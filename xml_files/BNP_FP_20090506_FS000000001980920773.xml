          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the presentation of BNP Paribas 2009 First Quarter Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded. Slides of the presentation are available on BNP Paribas Investor Relations website, www.invest.bnpparibas.com. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Philippe Bordenave, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kath . Good afternoon. Welcome to you all. I would like to start with a few introductory words before taking your questions. In the first quarter 2009, BNP Paribas posted 1.5 billion net income in a still very challenging environment. This good performance was achieved thanks to positive contribution from each of our three activities; Retail Banking, Corporate Investment Banking and Investment Solutions, which is the new name of the asset gathering division. And this good performance was achieved despite a rise in the cost of risk due to the further deterioration of the economic environment.</p>
          <p>The Group's revenues totaled &#x20AC;9.4 billion, up 28% compared to the first quarter of 2008. This performance is due to the business' good sales and marketing drive, as well as the Group's greater attractiveness and market share gains in the current banking landscape, as illustrated by several things.</p>
          <p>First, the very strong net asset inflow of &#x20AC;13.4 billion in asset gathering activities, Investment Solutions, which came on top of &#x20AC;10.4 billion last year. Second, the net increase in accounts in our domestic markets, both in France, plus 65,000, and in Italy, plus 17,000. And three, the number one position reached by fixed income in the all bonds in euros league table for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The Group's operating expenses were up 16% compared to first quarter of 2008, but at constant scope and exchange rates, and excluding variable compensation, they were down 2.4%, thanks to the cost cutting measures implemented across all the businesses in accordance with the target to stabilize cost in 2009. And the operating division's cost/income ratio improved a lot, by almost eight points at 66.1%. And the gross operating income, which was &#x20AC;4.1 billion, was up 1.3 billion, plus 48%, compared to the first quarter of 2008, reflecting the Group's good operating performance this quarter and allowing it to absorb the additional cost of risk and value.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk totaled &#x20AC;1.8 billion, or 128 basis points of the Basel I risk-weighted assets, compared to &#x20AC;500 million in the first quarter of 2008 and &#x20AC;2.5 billion in the linked quarter, the fourth quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>In the Group's two domestic markets, France and Italy, the cost of risk remained moderate at respectively 35 basis points and 74 basis points. However, the downturn in the economy affected the other loan portfolios, in particular at BancWest again, Personal Finance, in Ukraine again, and also &#x2013; and this is new &#x2013; in CIB's financing businesses.</p>
          <p>Beyond the cost discipline I have just mentioned, this quarter also demonstrated BNP Paribas' ability to adapt swiftly to the fast changing and challenging environment. In the first quarter alone, in fact, we met our full year stated objective to reduce market risk, as well as total risk-weighted assets. In an environment that has remained extremely volatile, the target to reduce market risk, in particular exposure to volatility, to dividends and to basis risk, were achieved, as evidenced by the decline in the value at risk by 46% compared to its level as at the 31st of December, 2008. This reduced exposures combined with the greater selectiveness of the financing businesses at origination led to a &#x20AC;20 billion drop in CIB's risk-weighted assets compared to the level at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>All in all, so while having continued to grow lending in our two domestic markets, the Group already achieved its target of an overall 20 billion reduction for 2009 at Group level. As at the end of March, so the Tier 1 ratio was 8.8%, up 100 basis points compared to its level as at year-end. This rise was due to the combination of several factors.</p>
          <p>First, the Group's very strong profit generating capacity in the first quarter, which is adding 20 basis points. Second, the drop in risk-weighted assets, which is adding also 20 basis points net of the latent losses in the equity available for sale portfolios. Three, the lowering of the flow on the risk-weighted assets under Basel I, which is bringing 10 basis points, as we had said already. And so all that is 50 basis points, I would say, coming from our side. And the fourth factor is the participation in the second stage of the French economic stimulus plan, which brought also 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>So now with this 8.8% Tier 1 solvency ratio provides BNP Paribas with a significant safety margin in relation to the Group's medium-term objective of maintaining the Tier 1 ratio always above 7.5%. These achievements were made possible, I think, thanks to the bank's diversified and integrated business model, well adapted to the current challenges. And BNP Paribas now has the opportunity to roll out this model to two new domestic markets, Belgium and Luxembourg, with the acquisition of Fortis that we hope to close shortly. This acquisition is well in line with the Group's acquisition discipline. It's a fantastic opportunity to build a Pan-European leader, rooted in four domestic markets in the Eurozone, geographically and culturally consistent with each other. We are eager to start moving soon.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. I will now be happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question today will come from Kian Abouhossein from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Kian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I have a question first of all on fixed income. Can you please tell me how fixed income developed, when I look at the slow revenues? And how much of fixed income has come back from hedging gains/potential prop gain from the fourth quarter, so I get a bit of a better understanding? Could you also talk a little bit how the trend has been on a month-by-month basis in the first quarter in fixed income? And the second question is on equity derivatives. You discussed some of the further cleanups that you have done a markdown. Can you discuss a little bit how the underlying revenues in equity derivatives have performed both in the slow revenue side and the structuring side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the fixed income size, I mean, there is no &#x2013; I would say, you've seen that the parameters which are key for fixed income, especially the basis, for example, has remained as bad as at the end of 2008. There hasn't been any significant improvements. And so there is no mark-to-market, I would say, recouping of former losses in these results. The only thing we can say is that all those parameters have not deteriorated further, with the exception of the monolines price, which have widened quite a lot and which have also added another burden as we have reported in the figures we have given. So those good results were obtained in spite of additional cost of the monoline spreads and without any help from &#x2013; any significant help from, I would say, improvements in the market parameters.</p>
          <p>Now the main one &#x2013; the main explanation of those very good results, which is the exceptional level of activity in the first quarter, especially on the primary market with issues from corporate, from banks and states, which were at record levels, I think on &#x2013; at the level of the whole market, I mean. It was driven &#x2013; I think it was driven by fears of renewed credit difficulties, which led many to anticipate their 2009 funding programs, probably. Also probably some lag effect of issues which couldn't take place in the fourth quarter of 2008. So we had an exceptional concentration of activity on primary market.</p>
          <p>Then there were also huge volumes transacted on all segments of fixed income activity partly linked to the primary market business, by the way. And marginally driven by very strong client demand for hedging products. So we &#x2013; well, in all kind of products, interest rate, ForEx, emerging currencies, very good activities in commodities as well, commodity derivative as well. So this is, I would say, the first thing which is the huge volumes in the market. The second thing was that we &#x2013; clearly we are gaining market share in that market, in that big market we are gaining market share. It's visible in the league tables, because the league tables are officially recorded. But we feel that in OTC markets, in derivatives OTC market, even if there is no official record, we feel that we are gaining market share, partly due to a kind of fly to quality and there is concern on the part of our client. So a certain number of institutional clients are moving to us, and it's very beneficial to our franchise in terms of market share.</p>
          <p>And on top of that I would say, for the few players remaining in that market and acting in that market, there is a widening of a bit of a spread, which is helped by the reduced number of market counterparties, also the reduced number of arbitrage hedge funds. So there is less competition from that side. And also bid/offer spreads are also widened by the capital constraints and probably &#x2013; and some volatility also as well. So all of that is creating a very favorable trading environment. Plus I would add that the three yield curve movements were relatively favorable to the trading and to the management of inventories in that quarter as the short-term yield curve went down, which is, of course, helping the &#x2013; reducing the financing costs of the inventories. So this is what happened, I think, in the fixed income.</p>
          <p>Now I am not going to give you a month-by-month figure. I mean, we are still waiting for the quarterly results of the U.K. bank, so I'm not going to move to monthly reporting. Now the only thing I can say because it's very well known, and I think it has been the case for all big players in fixed income, is that the January month has been extraordinarily high, so higher than it was. But overall it has been a good quarter throughout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But how should I look at it when I see that you are making in one quarter what you made in '06 in fixed income revenues? Do you think there is a structural change? Or do you think this is an extraordinary time, which you will adjust back to what we've seen in the past over the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're part of both. I mean I think that there are structural changes, as I am mentioning, the widening of the bid/offer spread, the reduced number of market counterparties, the reduced number of big players in that market, less arbitrage hedge fund. All I said, I mean, capital constraints and so on, all that is structural and will remain therefore for long probably. On the other hand, the volumes, the high volumes we've seen in the first quarter are probably not going to be repeated each quarter, and so you probably have a little bit of both, the combination of both.</p>
          <p>Now equity, in equity we are &#x2013; well, the markets remain very difficult. The volumes, the client demands are down. The &#x2013; more generally, I would say, the equity products are not in demand that much, especially in the first quarter, we are not in demand. I think that it is changing somewhat these days, but the first quarter was not very good. And well, especially the structured products are concerned, the clients demand was especially low. The other thing is that as we had said while reading our yearly results, we were in the process of de-risking further. We wanted to run the business with a lower level of risk and a set number of risk, which used to be quite manageable, where now &#x2013; and are now very difficult to manage. So we have reduced that level of risk and it's very visible in the value at risk. And, of course, on the fixed income side it's easier to do that in good volumes and in a market which is extremely lively. While on the equity side, it was more difficult and more costly to do that in a market which was sluggish and not very active. So this is why the equity derivatives results are not brilliant this first quarter. But still we are pleased to see that they have at least broken even in terms of revenues for the quarter, and I think we're progressively improving and we're going to keep improving in the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you done with the de-risking of the equity derivatives business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are done, yes. All the de-risking is done. As we have said, now that we have the -- the value at risk has been half at the moment where the parameters remain very bad. You can look at it on slide 60, where you see that the average value at risk in equities went down from 66 million in the fourth quarter on average to 34 on average, and even 31 at the end of the first quarter. And so at that level we are below the level which was the level of the first quarter of 2008, for example. So we are &#x2013; in spite of parameters which are much more &#x2013; much higher and weighing a lot on the calculations. So the de-risking is done, and now both on the fixed income side and equity side, we are ready, I would say, to work normally in the market according to their new pattern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you can't quantify the cost of the de-risking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult because it's done in &#x2013; it's completely interlinked with the normal business. So it's very complicated to do it. It cost something, but it's not &#x2013; you can't draw any conclusion from that anyway. So &#x2013; and it would be very difficult to try to track that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and congratulation for the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question today will come from Jon Peace at Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, you've been very helpful in the past in giving us some guidance and your expectations for the cost of risk. I just wonder if you could update us, have your views changed for the last quarter. And I guess specifically with regard to where you're seeing a little bit of upward pressure, for example, in financing.</p>
          <p>And the second question was just on the balance sheet. Obviously, well done for getting your risk-weighted asset target earlier. I just wonder if you look forward through the rest of the year, what further progress you think you can get in getting risk-weighted assets lower? And with your Tier 1 targets &#x2013; and I know this is looking forward a long way now &#x2013; but when you think about when you might retire the preference shares, is there a core Tier 1 target you are aiming for, as well as the kind of total Tier 1 target? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's difficult to answer &#x2013; to make any outlook on the cost of risk, especially these days, as we are in the midst of recession, economic crisis which <mark type="inaudible" />. And that we have tried to give some indications, to allow everybody at least to make is online on slide nine and 10 where we are giving the cost of risk as a percentage of Basel I risk-weighted assets, which is <mark type="inaudible" /> we are giving for loan now. And it's true that in each and every case it's not. So in domestic markets, I mean, it's slightly up or it's up in a proportion which is not really translating into big losses. But, yes, it keeps deteriorating in Personal Finance and we try to do our best. We are extremely proactive in managing the workout. We have &#x2013; in each country we are reducing the marketing expenses and the marketing staffs, and moving people into workout teams and trying to ready to improve the workout and recouping a maximum of our loss. We have some &#x2013; well, we &#x2013; the environment &#x2013; we have some results, but the environment is adverse, so it's difficult to say how far it's going to go. I mean, that clearly it may go further up somewhat.</p>
          <p>At BancWest, well, we're really &#x2013; we were not expecting such high levels and it's in spite of the fact that BancWest is overperforming its yields when you look at the other banks in the U.S., or the Western U.S., even the peers &#x2013; it works, it even works. So we &#x2013; BancWest is &#x2013; we are not happy with this evolution, but we have to admit that most of the, I would say, of the reason is coming from the environment. And also again, we are trying to improve as much as we can and we do everything we can. The evolution, we depend &#x2013; on those cases, I would say, it will depend on the &#x2013; I think on the evolution of the economic environment. I mean, if the recession is climbing down in the U.S., if we have only a recession which is short and &#x2013; relatively short and mild in Europe, it is going to be better BancWest and Personal Finance. If to contrary the recession is deepening further in the U.S. and in Europe, it may cost even more.</p>
          <p>So in the emerging markets we &#x2013; well, it's a very well known question of Ukraine. Well, again, we are really doing everything we can. We are, again, moving people from the commercial side to the workout side, the same thing. We are strengthening the &#x2013; well, we are not even lending anymore in Ukraine. I mean, it's the extreme case. But the depression is strong in Ukraine. And in the financing businesses, we have &#x2013; in the other cases, I would say, PF, BancWest and even in Ukraine, as it's about retail, there is a kind of statistical &#x2013; a formation movement, which can be somewhat &#x2013; there is a kind of trend and &#x2013; well, so you &#x2013; in CIB it's even more difficult to anticipate, because it's about the corporate and you can have a bad quarter, like the first quarter, with a lot of <mark type="inaudible" /> becoming doubtful and creating a significant cost of risk &#x2013; very significant cost of risk, all of a sudden I would say. Because while it started to deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2008, but it's much more there. But it may change the following quarter, because it's a &#x2013; there is no statistical pattern, if you want, in CIB due to the kind of business they are conducting.</p>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; I really can't give you any outlook, any precise outlook for cost of risk. I'm sorry for that. I would like to &#x2013; I would love to have a precise view. We just do our best to limit the cost of risk, but we are in the midst of a worldwide recession. So, I mean, we &#x2013; it's a difficult time for banks. So the only thing which is &#x2013; I would say, which is bringing the kind of support for us is that our &#x2013; both our domestic markets, France and Italy, are resisting well and probably are suffering less than other countries in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now the balance sheet, well, the risk-weighted assets, we are not &#x2013; our aim is not to go further, I would say. We wanted to go in the region of 500 billion and we had said that we wanted to reduce by 20 billion over the course of the year. So we are there already. So we are going to be very strict in lending and very &#x2013; I would say, very disciplined and very selective. But our aim is not to go below 500, not at all. So we think that we have also to work and to support some of our clients and to take advantage of the good margin level at the moment. So we have to be both very disciplined, but we want to remain active in the business.</p>
          <p>And in terms of Tier 1 target, I mean, we are &#x2013; our target is clearly expressed in Tier 1 &#x2013; not in Tier &#x2013; Tier 1 or core Tier 1 or whatever, due to the fact that it's the way our regulator is reasoning in Tier 1. We have &#x2013; the non-equity Tier 1 is also real buffer to &#x2013; as it's &#x2013; I mean, it's a perpetual reserve and loss absorbing reserves and all the characteristics of the hybrid Tier 1 we have issued are meeting the requirements of our regulators. So our &#x2013; and to target is given in &#x2013; is expressed &#x2013; is given in terms of Tier 1. So the target we have, as you know, is to remain above 7.5%. We have said that given the uncertainties of the time, we wanted to have a buffer, we wanted to be clearly above the target and we think that at the current level, 8.8%, well, <mark type="inaudible" /> is really very significant. So this is what we can say. Now in terms of &#x2013; I think what &#x2013; I'm answering your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. Yeah. Thank you very much, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll move now to Kinner Lakhani with RBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon. Three questions. Firstly, I wonder if you could revisit the yield curve argument on the fixed income strength. I know you talked about the reduced cost of inventory as short-term rates go down. But I wonder if you could address the issue more in terms of the steeping of the yield curve and to what extent and how it plays in your favor.</p>
          <p>Second point, the second question may be slightly more strategic on the structured equity derivatives model. Historically, you've explained to us that risk transfer was key part of this model, and clearly it became more difficult to transfer risk. How do you see that developing over the coming years, and therefore your ability to generate earnings on the structured equity derivatives business? And finally, as we go into completion of Fortis, what kind of earnings and profitability should we start to think about compared to the guidance you gave us last October actually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, on Fortis &#x2013; to start with Fortis, I don't want to elaborate because we have to put in place now the working groups, which are going to fine-tune the industrial plan. And so I think any kind of new figures or whatever we could give would probably be outdated relatively rapidly and wouldn't be based on the detailed industry plan. So I think we have to wait a little bit before coming back with a more precise figures and clear commitments on the Fortis integration.</p>
          <p>On your second question about the structured product in equity derivatives, we &#x2013; I mean, we &#x2013; yes, it's true that in the past we were driving probably a very significant part of our equity derivative revenues from selling these core products, structured products for clients, and hedging them and then trying to keep the margin which was embedded in them. And it's true that these source of revenues at the moment is very low on that due to two things. In fact, first, a lower client demand for such products, and due to reluctance on our side to &#x2013; this is a surprise &#x2013; because we realized &#x2013; during the fourth quarter, realized that risk we thought were hedged, in fact, in dislocated markets, were not hedged anymore all of a sudden and we were last with risks which were extremely difficult to manage. So we have decided to reduce that kind of difficult to manage risks and to stay away from that kind of activity.</p>
          <p>Now at the same time, what is true for fixed income is also true for equity derivatives. The margins are widening on simple vanilla products, flow product. The margins are widening and so &#x2013; I mean, you can make a living with flow product. So the need for such structured product is also lower than it used to be when the flow products were commoditized and it was extremely difficult to make significant amounts of money with only vanilla product. So I think that the market is difficult to compare where the market is going to be, with what it used to be, because really we are in the new market, in a new pattern. And so we had to adapt to that new pattern of the market and this is what we have done at the end of fourth quarter and in the first quarter of 2009. And we think that we are now ready to take the best of the new pattern of the market.</p>
          <p>Now the yield curve argument, I think it's about &#x2013; it was relatively easy in the first quarter of this year, the story on the short end of the curve was clear. I mean, the central banks their rates, their key rates and all the yield curve was moving down on the short end. And clearly when you have that kind of visibility and when the cost of carry &#x2013; the carrying cost of your inventories is lowering that way, it helps the business, the trading business.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I will find something that <mark type="inaudible" />. First, on the CIB side, we used to have in the past a breakdown of your revenue by client activity and trading and other activities. Could you perhaps update us on that? Another thing, which is, I think I looked at your retail activity, especially in France and in Italy. We can see that the outstanding loans you are managing are starting to go down? Could you perhaps explain us what's going on in this activity? Is this because of tightening of your lending conditions or decrease of the demand?</p>
          <p>And last question, just a few minutes ago actually the EU Parliament just voted a new rule on banks' capital, especially on the 5% that you have to keep on balance sheet on all LBU you issue, but just under the cap of inter-bank lending activity. Do you think it will have an impact on your activity on the sector overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try to take your questions one after the other, and maybe add some more details on what you asked me. On the CIB side, we &#x2013; yes, this &#x2013; I would say that in the first quarter we had both &#x2013; I would say, we had both record level of clients' contribution. We have not &#x2013; well, we have not &#x2013; yes, you're right. We have not provided this figure this time. But the clients' contribution was at record level, the highest ever. And at the same time, the addition to the clients' contribution, which is brought by the trading and the hedging of the positions which have taken due to the clients' business, was also very good. In order to get such a result, you can imagine that you have to be good on both sectors. Now your second question about Italy and France, could you repeat your question because I have not completely understood what you --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, the question is just that, having a look at the outstanding amount of loans, we can see that it's starting to go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is a crisis, there is a crisis. I mean, there is less demand for loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, my question was, is it demand driven or is it also tightening of your lending criteria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's mostly &#x2013; really, it's demand driven. In our domestic markets, we have not really tightened our criteria. We have always been very strict in terms of risk selection and we have not tightened further in the recent months. But the demand for loans is slowing down a lot due to the crisis clearly. So this is the explanation, there is no doubt. For example, in &#x2013; just to give an example, in the mortgages, for example, there is much less demand for buy to let investors. That kind of activity in the real estate market has dropped to very low level. And so now there are now new incentives in France, which have been put in place by the government, they are really to revitalize this buy to let market, and maybe we're going to see some improvement in the rest of the year. But that's clearly demand driven.</p>
          <p>And now about the banks capital, we have always &#x2013; we are not really suffering that much from that at the moment, because as far as we are concerned we have always &#x2013; we never practiced the originate and distribute model. We always &#x2013; for example, in syndications &#x2013; in syndicated loans when we were &#x2013; when we are and when we were leading a new facility, we always were keeping part of it, significant part of it, even more than 5%. I mean, very often 10, 15%, as a matter of the policy &#x2013; I mean, not our policy and a matter also of transparency and loyalty to the clients. And so it's something we have always done. So it is no change for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one relates to the disclosure you give every quarter on the, sort of, sensitive loan portfolios. On page 71 you gave the commercial real estate assets. And you said it didn't really changed at all during the quarter. I mean, you said that's worth 9.2 billion. It doesn't look like you've taken any provisions against this commercial real estate exposure. I was wondering if you could give us some additional data points to get us more comfortable, because certainly if you were to use market prices on that 9.2 billion of exposure, given it looks like it's mostly U.S., California, U.K. and Spain, I think you'd come to a much lower level. So can you give us any comfort there in terms of loan-to-value or covenants, or something to just feel better about that? And also, obviously, no provisions in the quarter, so no deterioration, no internal ratings, downgrades, that sort of stuff.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is much more big picture. It looks like you'll finally complete this Fortis acquisition this month, I guess. As you look around the sector, I mean, do you see this as the first of what could be a number of deals, not specifically for you, but just within the banking sector? Do you see people doing more cross-border deals? Or do you think this is a pretty specific one-off case where a bank had run into some problems and you were able to kind of come in and rescue it? That's my second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll start with this one. I think that in the current environment, the cross-border deals are going to be very difficult to implement now, because due to the rescue of most banks by &#x2013; most ailing banks has been rescued by the government. And so I think it's going to be difficult now to organize such kind of cross-border deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, I was thinking less of a rescue situation and more of a management team out there saying, you know what, the banking sector has been a long time traded that 1.1 times tangible book, and we used to do deals at two, three times tangible book, let's get on with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's difficult. I mean &#x2013; and if only the delay we have seen since October are showing that that kind of deal is difficult to implement. So I'm not expecting a flurry of such opportunities in the near future. Anyway, as far as we're concerned, we're not going to be involved in such deals for quite a long time, because we have to focus on the profit integration for the next two years. In terms of page 71, you said of the so-called financial stability foreign report of all sensitive information, I'm not finding the 9.2 -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>9.2 is just a sum of the 7.2 plus the 1.2 plus the 0.8.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes, I see. Yes, we have &#x2013; it is true that &#x2013; this are &#x2013; those are the sensitive exposures we have in commercial real estate. So we &#x2013; these are reported such, so I can't they are contrary, and you are right. We &#x2013; as far as the homebuilders are concerned, we have reduced progressively the commitments to the homebuilders in BancWest from $3 billion in the fourth quarter 2008 to 2.4 billion in first quarter of 2009. It's not &#x2013; I mean, when you say that there hasn't been any change, in fact there is a slight decline. If you compare with, I think if compare with the same &#x2013; we are realizing those figures every quarter, so you can compare with the same --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it was 9.3 billion last quarter, so I said 9.3, 9.2 is probably currency moves I guess. I mean, it's certainly nothing structural. I mean, you still had assets at 98 --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the other way around, because the currency is going against us --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's not &#x2013; what I'm talking is structural, not talking of structural change. I mean, it's</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's difficult to have any structural change, because when you lent money to &#x2013; in that sector at the moment, the only thing &#x2013; you can't do anything else than trying to progressively not renew or reduce your exposure by not &#x2013; by benefiting from the maturities, the redemptions and not extending new loans or less, because it's something you can't recoup immediately. I mean, it's banking. It's a long-term commitment. So you have lent money for the long run and you can't change that all of a sudden. The quality is not extremely bad so we are &#x2013; as we said, we have &#x2013; the most difficult task is on the homebuilders. We have at BancWest 1.7 billion, originally 1.4 is drawn and we try to reduce it gradually and we manage to reduce it gradually, but it's going to be gradual. In CIB it's smaller, it's 400 million.</p>
          <p>Now the other &#x2013; apart from the homebuilders, there is no significant exposure on the property companies. There is a bigger exposure on the, what is called the others. Others meaning it's 5.2 &#x2013; it's mostly at BancWest, as you can see, &#x20AC;5.2 billion, which is in fact $6.8 billion. And it's lent to &#x2013; it's relatively well diversified. The underlying goods are properties, are offices for almost 2 billion, retail for 1.7 billion, industrial offices and so different kind of properties and collaterals. We have performed stress test on those loans, the significant one &#x2013; all the loans, the significant loans, more than $2 million. And we have identified, I would say, the most sensible part of the exposure and we are closely monitoring them. So, yes, the purpose of these assets that we bought in is to provide you with information about the most &#x2013; but I am sure sensitive exposure. So you have here our exposure in commercial real estate in the countries where the commercial real estate is fragile. So were --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about, like, internal rating migration? Has the risk-weighted asset allocated to this portfolio gone up even as the assets were declining?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is not &#x2013; up to now there is &#x2013; I would say, there is some &#x2013; the migration is limited. We have some migration in the &#x2013; and because of that migration we have some provision on a portfolio basis on those exposures, which I'm not yet doubtful, but are close to watchful &#x2013; close to the watch list, I mean. So we have built some provision on portfolio basis on those and we are closely monitoring the different cases. And clearly it may &#x2013; yes, it may feed indeed some of cost of risk at BancWest in the quarters to come.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Two questions on CIB maybe. To start with, in CIB I was just looking at the revenues in the financing division, and they seem to have gone a little bit more lumpy than they used to being up like 30% in the fourth quarter and now down like 13% in the first quarter. I was just trying to understand what were the drivers behind that and whether there was also some yield curve effect on your net Interest income there or things like that, so sort of getting some impression for the underlying development there?</p>
          <p>Second question is, CIB cost/income ratio as a whole is now below 50% this quarter, and I was trying to understand whether there was a structural change in &#x2013; potentially in your comp structure or your operating, your general expenses or something that, which can justify that? Or whether you don't expect this cost/income to stay in this region? And finally, maybe there was a comment this morning in your CEO's interview that you pre-release about Fortis now being well provisioned after the purchase accounting. I understand that you don't want to give guidance going forward, but I just wanted to understand what was the basis for &#x2013; what were the numbers behind that assertion that the book was well provisioned, maybe in terms of reserve ratio or any type of element that you can give us that justifies the fact that the book is now well provisioned, the loan book? And whether you have time to <mark type="inaudible" />. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, on the Fortis, I'm not going to give you any answer, because again we want to keep the subject intact for the Investor Day, and maybe for the second quarter results when we are going to &#x2013; if everything goes well, we are going to close the deal next week and then we are going to have a kind of preliminary or first wave of purchase accounting, which we're going to communicate at the occasion of the second quarter's results. And I think it's premature to give any figure at the moment.</p>
          <p>On CIB, the cost/income ratio, I think it &#x2013; a very good commercial of the first quarter was the combination of two things in fact. One is the &#x2013; just the consequence of the very high level of revenues, because of course the more revenues you have the smaller proportion of fixed cost. And so this is clearly one factor. The second factor is more structurally is that, as we have said, CIB has started, I would say, adapting its different platforms to the new environment and which implies -we're reducing number of schemes in the areas, in the activities which are the most affected by the crisis and which are going to be very active in the years to come. And we have said that our goal was to and is to reduce the fixed cost base of CIB by 5% on a full year basis, which means in 2010, until we have the beginning of this effect. And we have given the figure of the underlying reduction in the fixed income cost &#x2013; in the CIB cost, which if you look beyond the foreign exchange effect and the viable competition effect, you'll have a reduction in fact in the CIB. I think it's looking like 3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>3.2, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 3.2%. So it's a combination of both. So the second factor should be the main and even further, I would say, increase the first factor will depend on the revenues in the quarters to come. Now your question about the financing businesses revenues. Well, we had again a very good &#x2013; if you look back at the different revenues level of different quarters, the first quarter of 2009 is a good one with a higher level of revenues, 176 million. But it's true that there is some slowing down of the activity, given the fact that we have started reducing the risk-weighted asset, I mean, in that business. So you can't keep improving the revenues very fast when at the same time you are cutting your risk-weighted assets by 10 billion. If necessarily, there is some impact and normally, I mean, those &#x2013; this reduction is also going to be somewhat translated in the rest of the year as well, because clearly the risk-weighted assets of one quarter has an influence on the revenues of the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was just trying to understand actually more &#x2013; I mean, the level is actually very good as you say. I was just trying to understand the evolution, the quarterly evolution. It seems to be a lot more volatile than used to and I was just wondering whether there was any net interest margin development because of funding or things, but that's fine otherwise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's &#x2013; yes, you have &#x2013; I mean, more volatile. I mean, yes, margins are wider. The loans tend to be shorter. So, yes, there may be more volatility than in the past.</p>

          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, everyone. I will have two questions. The first one on life insurance. We have seen a pickup in Q1 versus Q4. I just wanted to understand which part is driven by the Livret A effect that we have seen in March? The second question would be on the retail side is, you have been able to release a cost reduction by 0.5. Can you give us little bit more color of how you have been able to achieve it in terms of maybe stopping hiring, open new branches to have a better feeling of how is it &#x2013; it would be recurrent in the coming quarter? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the rising trends, yes, the Livret A, the fact that the Livret A interest rate is going down, it has been the new malaise for the insurance business. And to that extent, March occurred a little bit &#x2013; yes, we had a new reduction in May, in fact, if I'm right. One in February, one in May, and the next one is in August. And each time &#x2013; probably again August is going to be down due to the reduction in inflation and key rates. And so we &#x2013; yes, it's helping the Livret A collection.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the financial commission in the French Retail, when we look to the trends, clearly you have been able to stabilize the fall in Q4. Which part of the life insurance commissions are representing in the financial commission of the retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in there, but I don't know about the exact proportion. We &#x2013; I'm not sure we are disclosing that figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Now on the retail, yes, we &#x2013; it's a combination of several efforts, I will say. The first effort is that we slowed down hiring a lot and we have the normal turnover, which is &#x2013; so which is freeing, I would say, some full-time equivalents. And this is allowed by the fact that we have really improvement in the efficiency in our back offices. And as we have said, we are now rolling out these efficiency programs in what we call the middle offices, meaning all the non-commercial activities. And so it was possible because of the H Pyramid and number of people retiring at normal departure. And also possible in terms of efficiency and without compromising &#x2013; without hampering the quality of service.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that we are delaying some investments and/or also reducing the cost of some investments, especially in terms of branch refurbishments, where we have now the refurbishment of branches have been redesigned, I would say, under a new pattern. And for the same branch we are incurring smaller and less expensive investments, which is allowing us reducing the cost growth of the network. And the third factor, third element which is also to be taken into consideration is that part of the compensation of the retail networks, is based on the results, and when the results are not increasing anymore or even slightly decreasing as to the cost of risk. While it has some impact on that part of the compensation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us little bit more flavor of how much you have been able to raise the part of variable in the salary of the retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we &#x2013; it's such huge &#x2013; it's probably &#x2013; in the retail the valuable comp is probably in the range of 10 to 20%, probably no more than that, probably more than 10, probably more 10 than 20. And 10%. But it &#x2013; it plays a role marginally, it plays role nevertheless.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question is regarding Italy. We have seen Italy BNL having an outstanding performance versus its peer, when most of the other retail Italian banks are sticking by revenues down by zero to minus five, or some of them minus 10. We know that by 2009 that could be the full impact, positive impact of the synergies of P&amp;L. How do you expect to maintain such a kind outperformance in the coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that beyond the synergies 3% -- two in fact, the gains we can make at BNL or the improvements at BNL are long-term ones, if you want. When we establish an industrial plan, we are always giving only a three-year tranche, because beyond three years tranch, because beyond three years it seems to be too far away and it's not to be disregarded by the market. But, in fact, the changes we are implementing are far reach &#x2013; are long lasting changes, in fact. And we uphold &#x2013; there are a lot of &#x2013; beyond the synergies of a merger, you have all the cross-selling and the cross-catalyzation between the different retail networks, which are implemented year-after-year and which are kind of endless, rolling &#x2013; permanently rolling program and they are creating impetus for the long run. So we are really seeing that BNL should &#x2013; well, even beyond 2009 we expect BNL to have a good evolution over the next few years.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from Pascal Decque with Natixis. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I still have two or three questions. The first one regarding the repayment of the core &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" />, which criteria would you use? I know that Mr. Prot this morning mentioned, still a few quarters ahead of, let's say, a good performances for BNP. But are you returning in term &#x2013; thinking in terms of period some quarters in term of level of Tier 1 you could reach? And when you will do so, will do it thinking of precise branches already or you will say anything which is over 7.5% Tier 1 ratio, we will repay it immediately. First question.</p>
          <p>The second one is on the provision increase in the financing businesses, 420 million. Could you give us some more detail. I know you will never mention any specific name, but you could eventually mention some countries or region or sectors. And the last one is a follow-up on the variable remuneration in investment banking. Is there any possibility considering the mechanics you put in place last year for paying part of the bonuses of last year over two or three years considering certain targets that would be obtained? Clearly, we've kind of a deformation of the &#x2013; say, the variable part in this quarter or the coming quarter just because of the good performances that we are seeing now. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The &#x2013; about the &#x2013; non-voting shares buyback, potential buyback. I think you have to realize that we are talking about shares buyback. It's non-voting shares, I agree. But nevertheless it's shares buyback. I think that the current fashion is not about buying back shares, clearly. We have said that as long as &#x2013; I mean, the crisis will not be over or as long as we are not going to see the end of the tunnel, we think that we need those shares in order to have a buffer and not to be too close to the 7.5%, which is our threshold, minimum threshold of Tier 1. And so we have just taken those shares. We just issued those shares one month ago. It's far too early to think about buying them back.</p>
          <p>On the provision increase in CIB, well, it's a little bit across the board. I'm sorry, but we &#x2013; well, we tried &#x2013; when we were preparing the slides, we tried to see if we could give some indication about the sectors or geography or whatever. And in fact when you look in detail, it's little bit across the board. It's not one big file. It's a lot of small or medium-size size, and it's &#x2013; well, it's really scattered across a lot of geographies and sectors. So it's just the consequence of the overall deterioration of the global economy.</p>
          <p>As far as the variable &#x2013; you should not &#x2013; you mix &#x2013; it's not because part of them are going to be paid over two or three years, or rather three years. It's that we &#x2013; that we are going to spread their &#x2013; they are putting into the accounts. I mean, we have really booked in this quarter the provision which is consistent with performance of this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is no lagging effect on the &#x2013; in the variable composition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That means that eventually in the fourth quarter all the two, three coming out there could be a plus effect coming from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In case of bad performance, in case of negative performance, yes, as it happened last year, for example. Well, the bonuses are computed on a full-year basis. So it's true that if you have at the end of the year &#x2013; it's exactly what happened next year. At the end of the year, a negative performance of the market or some market activities, and then, yes, what has been reserved provisions over the first three quarters is taken back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is not what I was thinking about. I was thinking a good year there, you have reached the targets you mentioned at the end of last year for the payment spread over a few years of the bonuses of last year or part of the bonuses of last year, they would be then implemented at the end of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, I'm going to. If I'm not wrong, last year part of the bonuses in CIB were paid immediately and another part was supposed to be paid over two or three year if some targets were reached?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then my question was, if these targets are reached in 2009-2010, are you going to spend some more money on variable to pay this previous bonuses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's cleared out. The answer to that is that we are spreading the cost, the corresponding cost for 2009 over the four quarters, so there won't be any.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Three questions, if I may, and then one just &#x2013; I haven't heard the answer on one of the questions. So the first question is about Ukraine. You have mentioned that in emerging markets you have PDT of 14 million. But I assume that considering the provision charges in Ukraine, you must have had a loss in Ukraine. Can you just quantify that for us please? Shall I ask the other questions or shall I wait until you respond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We do have a loss in Ukraine. I don't have the precise figure in mind, sorry, and I don't think we're disclosing that, the country because of the wider &#x2013; it would become extremely &#x2013; the concerning party would become more &#x2013; but yes, we do have a loss in Ukraine, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do have a loss in Ukraine, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was astonished about your net inflows in asset management, especially considering what's going on in the markets. How do you explain such a strong performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net inflows in asset management, I think is coming from the fact that we are gaining market share. Our attractivity, our credibility has increased a lot. I think very certain number of &#x2013; number of big names in asset management, in wealth management have, I would say, <mark type="inaudible" /> established their reputation over the last few &#x2013; last two years. And if you see that number of competitors suffering from big close. And so as far as we are concerned, we are gaining, we are &#x2013; well, we are gaining, but also diluting.</p>
          <p>I think it's part of what others are losing. I think this is &#x2013; at the same time it is also the result of an expansion policy which has been conducted over the last three, four years progressively with very small acquisitions, if you remember. But in order to complement what we had already and to have a consistent setup. And while we are also reaping the fruits of those investments. Also plus if you remember, the cost growth in that business used to be something like $0.10 per year. So, of course, since mid year or last year, we have put our foot on the break a lot. But we &#x2013; there is always a time lag between the investments and the retail. And so we get also the good returns from that policy of progressive development results spending significant goodwill &#x2013; amount of goodwill, but progressively expending our teams throughout Europe and even beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to understand, you said you gained market share against some of your competitors. Are you talking about the Swiss banks, or primarily one Swiss bank, which is UBS? Or have you gained market share against your local peers, some of the French banks, in particular? Did you think you want anything when you said Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole and SocGen announced the joint venture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; yes, it was &#x2013; well, I think it's a little bit against everybody. I mean, we had given &#x2013; for example, you should take the 2008 net &#x2013; the figures, we have compared the figures in 2008. And for the &#x2013; well, it's not only asset management, it's the whole asset gathering including --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; private banking. And so in 2008, we had positive net asset inflows of 1.8% of our assets under management. While this figure was negative for not only UBS, you are mentioning, and SocGen and Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole you're mentioning, but also Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think it's a little bit across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My third question is linked to the AFS reserves. You had a write-down of about 1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Can you talk what those write-downs are linked to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, it's primarily linked to the reduction in &#x2013; sorry. Thank you. It's primarily linked to the drop in stock exchange prices. We into &#x2013; the equity part of it is 1.4 billion, so it's the most &#x2013; the biggest part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my final question is just &#x2013; you probably mentioned the answer already. In terms of de-risking the balance sheet, are you there yet? I mean, are you --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are there. I'd say that already, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But when I looked at &#x2013; I mean, when you were discussing your balance sheet de-risking, you said you had a huge repo position, which could be &#x2013; which was low margin, margins were improving. That you could do a lot of de-risking or deleveraging there considering the funds of your balance sheet. Your balance north of &#x20AC;2 trillion as a standalone, and then you have another six or $700 billion from Fortis. I mean, 2.7 trillion is enormous. Would you be considering reducing further your balance sheet once you take over or once you integrate Fortis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is, yes. I mean, in the context of the integration between Fortis and BNP Paribas there will be some reduction in the balance sheet. I don't expect the size of the balance sheet of the total group to be the addition of the current &#x2013; the plain addition of the current level of both on both balance sheet. That's for sure. But again it's too early to give figures because again it's going to be part of the industrial plan which we are going to design in the following months &#x2013; in the next month.</p>
          <p>But just let me add that you should not completely mix or &#x2013; make confusion between de-risking and deleveraging. In our eyes it's more important to de-risk the bank rather than deleveraging, and you have some deleveraging which are not associated with a significant de-risking. And typically as repos are concerned, the repo business is a business where the risk is extremely low. Most of the repo is collateralized with government bonds, so the risk is extremely low. And at the same time, you have real de-risking, which I'm not certain with any deleveraging at all. For example, what we have done in the equity derivatives, when you reduce the risk derivatives, you may reduce the exposure you have in derivatives without any impact on the balance sheet figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I may rephrase then. You're done with the derisking. But are you done with the deleveraging? I guess the answer is no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are done with the reduction of the risk-weighted assets, which ultimately is the best measurement of any risk. So we're there with the derisking, yes. Deleveraging, I mean, is something which we're going to revisit at the occasion of the Fortis integration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you very much for the answers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question today comes from Guillaume Tiberghien with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I've got three questions. The first one relates to the negative unrealized losses in the AFS portfolio of 3.4 billion. And given the market value in the quarter to date, is it correct to assume that some would have reversed? Or am I wrong? And in that case, can they &#x2013; sort of are they crystallized as a negative item, are they impaired in the balance sheet?</p>
          <p>The second one relates to the coverage of non-performing loan. And I think the coverage ratio of non-performing loan went up a lot in Q4 and then went down in Q1, I think, to 84%. Could you maybe just give us your target coverage ratio, if you have any? And the last one relates to the monoline risks. I noticed that the exposure to the CLOs and the CDOs, the risk has actually reduced during the quarter because the counterparty risk is lower than it used to be in Q4. And I'm a little bit surprised about this movement. I would have anticipated a little bit of deterioration. So can you maybe elaborate a little bit as to why the counterparty risk has reduced here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first question, you are right. As most of the deterioration in the value of the available for sale equities is due to the decline in the stock exchange prices during the first quarter, the improvements we have seen in those markets is being evaporated or I guess should translate into a reduction in the unrealized losses in the AFS. Well, if it continues until the end of June, which we would hope.</p>
          <p>Then on the NPLs, I would say we don't have any target in terms of NPLs. We &#x2013; of coverage ratio, I mean, certainly not in terms of NPL leader. We adjust each time we have a new files becoming doubtful, we provision it at the level which is adequate. And it just happens that in general when a file become &#x2013; when there is a new file becoming doubtful, the level of provisioning is not 90% at the beginning at least, because in general very often there is a recovery rate which allows us to have an initial provision level which is more in the region of &#x2013; depending on the size of course, but it maybe 40, 50 or 60%. And so the fact &#x2013; the mere fact that we had a lot of additional NPLs and doubtful files in the first quarter has weighed on the coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>Second, we had said &#x2013; yes, we had said while releasing our fourth quarter results in February, we had said that we had provisions, the exposures in Ukraine a little bit ahead of the files becoming effectively doubtful on a portfolio basis due to the deterioration of the country itself. And in the first quarter we had a series of files in Ukraine becoming effectively doubtful, and which were provisioned by cutting, if you want, the collective provision which we have built on the fourth quarter. And it may explain as well part of the reduction in the coverage ratio. Now when you look back in the past, so it has moved between 80 and 90%, so we are not out of the trend over the last few years, I would say. But, yes, it's at 84%. I think we're still relatively high compared with the competition, I would say. Monolines, yes, I checked. You are referring to the Financial Stability Forum reports on slide 74.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the total present value and the total notional were stable over the quarter. In fact, we had some initial changes just due to the increase in the dollars, and so we had no further commutation in the first quarter. Now in terms of CLOs and CDOs, the &#x2013; yes, we have a slight gross counterparty exposure due to the certain &#x2013; probably certain &#x2013; it's not a lot. And it's not &#x2013; yes, it's really 10% in each case and I think it may be explained just by the some tightening of certain spreads. There are &#x2013; more generally, the exposure &#x2013; what has characterized this quarter as far as monolines are concerned, is that the deterioration of the underlying assets according to their market price, I would say, has stopped. So the underlying spread is not significantly different and has even  -- as you said, even slightly improved in certain cases compared with the end of December. And the additional cost of the quarter is 100% coming from the deterioration of the monoline spread themselves due to their own evolution. But the underlying exposure, I mean, the market value of the assets which are protected by the monolines has not deteriorated in the quarter. The stress has more or less stabilized in fact from &#x2013; there have been some movements within the quarter, some deterioration at beginning and some improvement at the end in March. But, overall, we &#x2013; the spreads went back to the level at the end of December.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Anke from Execution. I just had three follow-up questions, please.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is on the cost/income ratio in CIB again, sorry about it. I was just wondering, if we look at more of a normalized level and standards as a function revenues. But I think in the past you mentioned 60% cost/income ratio or something, which you are aiming for. So is this something we should keep in mind maybe for 2009? And then the second question is on French Retail Banking and the net interest income, in particular margins. Do you see the net interest income in Q1 as sustainable for the rest of the year or are there any one-offs in there? And then lastly just on IRS 39 and reclassification of assets you did in 2008, maybe you have given somewhere the number, but I can't find it. I was just wondering what the avoided P&amp;L hit is as a result of the reclassifications you did in 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the reclassification &#x2013; to start with your last question &#x2013; there was no new reclassification in the first quarter. And the impact of the reclassification of last year, in the fourth quarter of last year was negligible in fact. I remember you that we've reclassified only 8 billions, which is a low, low amount compared with a lot of competitors. And as I said, as most of the spreads didn't change and even somewhat improved during the quarter, the impact of this reclassification on the first quarter P&amp;L was completely negligible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the French Retail, the net interest income is improving, yes. It's a combination of improved margin on lending. I would say that the market is somewhat improving, especially corporate short-term loans, repricing and also some mix effect, because consumer loan growth is relatively good and it's well margined, it's the best margin product we have. And also we had a positive shift in savings mix from term deposits, which were in fashion at the end of last year. We spent on term deposits, we have low margins, as you can imagine. To past book savings and more or less linked to the Livret A issue and all the big excitement around the Livret A and here we have a better margin. So this is what happened. It's going to continue. It depends a little bit on the behavior on the market and the clients, but we tend to be relatively optimistic about the trend. There is no reason why we should see a significant change in that trend in the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost/income ratio of CIB, yes, 60% is one of the bench &#x2013; you're right, to recall that benchmark we have in mind. Again, we'll have the structural support of the savings program which is underway at CIB, and is going to help. And we &#x2013; on the other side, of course, it will depend on the level of revenues. But &#x2013; again, the cost/income ratio in CIB, it's not like in the retail business. You don't manage CIB <mark type="inaudible" /> cost/income ratio, but it's more a kind of indicator which can be invalid if it goes too high and so we keep an eye on it. And, well, we are happy to have it below 60%, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a very quick question on advisory in the capital markets. On the capital allocated, I've seen it has increased on a quarterly basis from 3.8 to 5.2 billions. And that's despite a decrease of risk-weighted assets from 86 billion to 76 billions. I am just wondering where the increase is coming from, given the fact you have decreased the market risk in the division? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's because the capital allocation is based on the risk-weighted assets at the beginning of the quarter. Each beginning of the quarter we allocate capital for the quarter to come based on the capital consumption at the beginning of the quarter. So the increase you have between the fourth &#x2013; if you are on the &#x2013; 3.8 is the capital consumption at the beginning of the fourth quarter and the 5.2 is the capital consumption at the beginning of the first quarter, meaning at the end of the year 2008, so you will see that capital consumption &#x2013; the capital allocation going down next quarter. Is it clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just a convention, because in fact it's quite logical to &#x2013; it seems more logical to allocate capital on the basis of the risk-weighted assets at the beginning of the quarter rather than at the end of the quarter. Okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Three questions. First, regarding the retail operation in France and in the U.S. Could you give us some color about April. By the way, I am a bit curious how you feel about the government, the French government recommendation towards assets growth in France this year. Second point regarding some items in the P&amp;L, which are practically volatile this quarter. I mean, equity accounting, minorities and tax rate. Could you give us some guidance there And last point, there are discussion about creation of bad banks in several European countries. Would you favor such an initiative if your non-French competitors would benefit from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as bad banks are concerned, I think it's &#x2013; we are not very well placed to comment on projects, which are project in other country. As a matter of principle, we think that it's more like &#x2013; in general, it's more, I would say, practical &#x2013; it's also more practical and I would say &#x2013; and there is less <mark type="inaudible" /> if bank is taking care of its own loans and assets. But I don't want to comment further.</p>
          <p>As far as the tax rate is concerned, we keep saying that if you &#x2013; as a kind of average you should take something like 26, 27%. And that being said, it may change from one quarter to another depending on certain number of factors, including in which countries we are making money or not. For example, in the U.S., the tax rate is relatively high. And when you make money in the U.S., the tax is higher than when you make money in &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; in the Gulf, for example, or in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>So it depends a lot on which business is the most successful at the moment and it depends also on the amount of capital gains which are realized. And clearly if you &#x2013; well, if you compare, for example, with the first quarter of last year, in the first quarter of last year we had a significant amount of capital gains on different items. We have mentioned in the presentation. And those capital gains in general are not taxed or taxed at a lower rate, at a privileged rate in all the countries and it tends to reduce the average, while in this quarter we had a very low level of capital gains. So it's difficult to apply a tax rate quarter-per-quarter, if you want. I think on a yearly basis, it's a better basis to look at the tax rate.</p>
          <p>For the rest &#x2013; about the France, the French Retail, yes, we &#x2013; I'm not going to give you, I mean, monthly indications. But your questions about the 4%, we think that &#x2013; I mean, we are committed to deliver the 4%. We are in line at the moment and the only thing is that, as the economy is slowing down, the demand for loans is slowing down, as I said earlier. And it may be challenging to reach that level if the loan amount keeps going down. But at the moment, I mean, we &#x2013; to remain something we are committed to and we're going to do our best anyway to get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I also asked about the U.S. Do you see any things <mark type="inaudible" /> that Mr. Bernanke is right to see stabilization ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think he is better placed than we are to issue statements like that. I mean, if he said something it is probably true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one point and my question on P&amp;L items was also about associates and minorities. Anything special there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In associates, you know that one of our associates is <mark type="inaudible" />, which is the holding company and they are affected by the stock exchange somewhat, by the stock exchange evolution. So you have the translation of that in the Q1 figures, and it should be better in April. It's a little bit like the FX, no?. And the minorities, I think there is nothing specific to mention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question will come from Pierre Chedeville with CM-CIC Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Could you give us just the development regarding the cost of risk in BNL, which is decreasing significantly from the Q4? Could you also tell us a little bit more regarding the mortgage business in France? And at last, margin or comment from you regarding evolution, if you see some evolution in the current crisis on the accounting point of view or also a regulatory point of view? I mean, do you see, for instance, a likely coming back of a collective provision or SABG, for instance, like we used to have in the previous accounting system? And regarding differences between regulatory in Europe and U.S., what do you think are the most significant issues to solve in the coming months or years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On BNL, it's simple. I mean, there is a seasonality in the cost of risk, in fact, in the fourth quarter. And it's the same in France by the way in the retail. In the fourth quarter, there is a kind of complete review of the portfolio, which always in induces some higher cost of risk that quarter. I think if you look at the &#x2013; in the past you will see that there is a usual pattern. So the comparison of Q1 and Q4 is not relevant for the cost of risk in retail.</p>
          <p>The mortgage business in France, I mean, nothing specific to mention. I would say that the market , we're &#x2013; the market is growing by roughly 7%. We're growing our own outstanding amounts by 6% on lease or EBIT below the market evolution, because we tend to try to be careful of the long-term maturities especially and so we have a higher turnover, if you want, than the competitors due to the fact that our back book is of lower average maturity than the competitor's one, because we're always reluctant to lend money for 30 years. So beyond 20 years, we tend to be maybe less competitive than others and more reluctant, and the other around for lower maturities. But otherwise nothing to mention. The market is slowing down, but is not dead at all.</p>
          <p>And on the accounting, I think it's a little bit late to start discussing the accounting rules and use of the dynamic provisioning. So there will be a lot of discussions. Our hope is just that all lessons to be &#x2013; are going to be drawn from the current crisis in order to avoid the accounting rules to play a role of acceleration or amplification of the crisis, like we have seen this time, and we're going to take part to that discussion. We are already taking part to those discussions. And it's too early to see how they're going to help.</p>
          <p>Okay, any other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. We will take our next question from Kimon Kalamboussis with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. This is Kimon Kalamboussis from Citi. Conscious of time, two quick questions, if I may. First on NPLs, those are up 17% quarter-on-quarter. Is it the level &#x2013; is it some exceptional items or what's the level of exceptional items this quarter? Or should we assume a similar growth going forward please? And the second question is on dividend, some French corporate have moved to half-yearly dividends. Do you consider any such move, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't. On the second question, we don't. And on the first question, I mean, yes, they have increased a lot due to the current environment. And you know that, as I said, while beginning the cost of risk is going everywhere in the roof. So, yes, the total is plus 17% NPL. It's not quite &#x2013; it is difficult to &#x2013; it's lower than with competitors. The same figures, I think is more in the region of, what, 20 to 40% in certain banks of our size and our kind. So, yes, it's due to I think to the overall deterioration of the economy. And should you infer that is going to grow like that for the whole year, I'm not sure. I think it will &#x2013; again, it will depend on the evolution of the economy and depending on how dramatic and how deep is the recession, the NPL evolution will slow down or not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I have three questions. First is, the project of some French bank to create the off-balance sheet special purpose vehicle for the retail finance. And could you give us your view on this product? The second question is on Ukraine, because since the <mark type="inaudible" /> BNP has started to divestiture its credit portfolio in the retail network in Ukraine. Then could you give us &#x2013; could you tell us at which state you are at for this divestiture plan? And the last point on BancWest in the U.S., because you announced optimization plan for BancWest. And we're wishing that we will see some positive impact. But when we will see this positive impact on the account for BancWest? Thanks for your answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The project of off-balance sheet, I don't know what. As I said, we're not in favor of that at all. We really prefer to &#x2013; we think really that the &#x2013; every bank should take care of its own loans, and it goes more, I would say, moral. I not only say that to take care of its own loan, and it's also more practical in terms of rather than sharing, because otherwise if you start pulling certain number of loans, you necessarily end up with the disputes about how to share gains or losses. So we're not in favor of that. We're seeing that, especially in France, I mean, the level of the leverage finance loans is not such that we can't &#x2013; we couldn't take care of them each of us separately.</p>
          <p>In Ukraine, yes, in Ukraine our aim is really to &#x2013; when &#x2013; really to recoup the maximum of the loans we have extended and improve the workout. We have &#x2013; the outstanding &#x2013; on slide 47 you have the outstanding of the UkrSibbank, and you can see that we have reduced outstanding by a significant amount. Well, of course, it's a mix of foreign exchange effect result, but not that much, in fact, because the last part of the loan value dollar is one of the problem, and so the foreign exchange effect is not that huge. And it's mostly a workout and we are not extending new loans at the same time, or almost, and in order to focus on the reduction of the exposure. So this is one thing.</p>
          <p>Now at the same time we are also focusing on reducing the cost base, because the revenues are now going to go down, because as we are reducing the assets necessary, the revenues are going to go down. And so we have to adjust the cost base as well, and we have kept almost 500 full-time equivalents over the quarters. We have closed 80 branches over the quarter. So we are actively taking action in order to optimize. We are not going to close the bank at all, but we are optimizing the bank in order to reduce costs and to recoup the maximum possible. So this is what we are doing in Ukraine. Now it's &#x2013; again, you can't expect a significant improvement over one quarter. I mean, it's an action which will take some time and the results are going to be seen over time.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; and the same answer for BancWest. I mean, the results of the plan, when we say we're going to save $100 million on a full year basis, it means that you're going to see those $100 million reduction in cost in 2010. In between, you're going to see the beginning of it only. But the whole thing will be seen only next year, because as always when you start reducing cost, you have &#x2013; initially you have some restructuring costs. You incur some additional restructuring costs first, one-off costs, but those are necessary you have to incur them. And it's an impact of that. Once the measure is taken that the savings are coming. So it's &#x2013; we are in &#x2013; the year will be difficult both in Ukraine and in BancWest, don't expect the improvement in the months to come.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just one question on BancWest, please, if I may. There is a growth in the loan book. Could you tell us where it comes from? And also, what kind of rates you're currently making on this kind of business? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes.  Hello, Alain.  Yes, we have a growth in the loan book at BancWest. It comes from &#x2013; yes, you have it in detail on slide 49. If you want to compare with one year or for this quarter, we are reducing &#x2013; what is increasing is the first mortgages. This is the main driver, first mortgages, to our clients, because when we are for the best category of clients. And as a lot of competitors are not able to lend anything, we are gaining market share, and this is a good thing because it's good product, if you want, and we are going to &#x2013; we're increasing also the number of new clients. We are not giving the &#x2013; for BancWest, we have not given the net new accounts, but it's also very positive, like in France or Italy. So this is where it comes mostly, I would say. We have also a slightly positive evolution in corporate loans for the same kind of reason. In fact, we have some increased penetration and --</p>

          <p>And in terms of margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The margins are improving. The margins on the loan side, the margins are improving significantly. The margin, I would say, problem recently in U.S. is coming from the deposit side, because interest rates are so low that site deposits are not &#x2013; the margin on site deposits is now close to zero because the rates are at zero almost. But on the loan side, margins are widening and so we are booking those loans at good margins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm conscious of time, so just a very quick one from me. Can I just follow-up on Anke's earlier question. I think one of the positive surprises here was the French Retail net interest income. I was just wondering, as you say, it's going to be reasonably sustainable, if we carry that forward to see a flat level for this year and with investment fees also seeming to stabilize versus the second half, it looks like we could be looking at French Retail revenues up maybe four or 5% for this year. So just wondering, what happens on the cost base on that front? Because I know you are talking positive jaws of 1%. But would you actually look to invest in the business and would you look to try and keep costs flat even if revenues did pick up from current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our aim is to adjust &#x2013; what we always did is adjusting the cost growth to the top line growth. For this year, I mean, we are in the mood where our aim is really to keep the cost growth close to zero, in fact, due to lot of uncertainty on the cost of risk side. I mean, and on the &#x2013; depending on the evolution of the economy in France. So we &#x2013; in such uncertain times, it's better to be very cautious on the cost side.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Our final question today from Jean-Pierre Lambert, KBW. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, very good afternoon. Just two points. Could you make some comments or give some color as on the evolution of fixed income business revenues after the first quarter? And do you think that it's sustainable to have the operating profit before provision growing faster than the provisions? I mean, perhaps you could comment on your views in general for the sector or for your bank. And the last one, if I understand very well you totally exclude to issue new shares in order to reimburse the non-voting shares. It's a way you're not going to look into? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to the second question is easier, it's yes, you are right, we totally exclude that. And also to the first question is more complicated. Is it sustainable? As I said, there are &#x2013; in the very good level of result in the income in the first quarter, there are certain origins which are sustainable clearly. As we said, the improved margins, the less competition, the renewed &#x2013; the volumes, part of the volumes are going to remain there probably. Also part are probably not going to be repeated. The volumes of January were really exceptional and are probably not going to be repeated.</p>
          <p>And the yield curve movements are difficult to predict and they may change. So they are probably part of those. And the evolution of the cost of risk is also difficult, because if we can reasonably say that on the retail side that there won't be any improvement soon. I mean, the trend is up and going to remain relatively up probably for several quarters. And on the CIB side, the funds in businesses, it's more &#x2013; even the cost of risk is volatile. I mean, because, as I said, it's not statistical. It's a certain number of files and it may change from one quarter to another. So I'm sorry, but I can't really help you for the first question. And that's it.</p>
