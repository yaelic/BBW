          <p>Thank you very much, Pierre. Welcome to D&#xFC;sseldorf today where we are going to review our '08 numbers and also strategy, build upon our adhesives business and then have Lothar Steinebach talk us through the numbers in more detail.</p>
          <p>Last we met was back in November in London where we spoke about third quarter numbers and also our strategic outlook for the next four years. I am happy to be able to report that we made significant progress in the three strategic areas that we defined as our priorities for 2012, and I'll speak about some of the progress today. I will give you the highlights of the numbers also and, Lothar will, as I said before, will go to a greater level of detail.</p>
          <p>We have, of course, also subsequent to our meetings distributed and communicated our strategic priorities throughout the organization. So, today, it's well known and understood by every single employee within our organizational structure.</p>
          <p>Before I start, let me just give you a couple of words to how we see 2008 and also just underline the following, that it's important that when we look upon 2008 we look upon 2008 from a 12-month view, and not a two-month view. What I mean by that is that we tend to look upon the last two months of the year which were quite dire in a bigger context and forget the first 10 months of the year, and I think that in order to have a good view of 2008 it's important to have the long-term view of it. It was a market where the global economy grew by three points in the first six months and then went to zero in the last six months. We had enormous volatility in both feedstock, raw materials, and currencies. Just remembering back in July, the oil per barrel were 144 and now it's about a third of that.</p>
          <p>Of course, these changes, particularly as it relates to raw materials, have significant impact on our margins particularly in our adhesives but also in our detergents business. And we saw a strong financial slowdown in the second half that predominantly impacted our adhesive business.</p>
          <p>On the asset side, so to speak, we had a very, very good year in cosmetics. It was a continuation of what we have seen in the past 18 months. So, consistent, good year over four quarters, with strong market-share gains, a lot of new products in the marketplace, and a more solid final than we've seen for long.</p>
          <p>We continued our success in the emerging countries with a organic sales growth of 13% bringing the total share to 37%, up from 34% in '07, so gaining three full points of share in the emerging markets as the overall revenue. As you remember, back in November, we said that our goal was to have 45% of our business coming from the emerging markets in 2012.</p>
          <p>We had all-time high market shares in Eastern Europe for all businesses. Our top brands grew 1.8 times the overall growth of the company. We did go out and make a very early market response to the changes that we saw in the marketplace. We, actually, at this conference a year ago, we publicized our global restructuring program and initiated very quickly, and in the fourth quarter, within the first week of the fourth quarter, we also initiated a cost chase which had a significant impact also on our fourth quarter numbers.</p>
          <p>We are well ahead with the integration of the National Starch business. Both Lothar and Thomas will speak about that, and then, of course, the sale of Ecolab, one of the few large transactions in the U.S. last year, has improved our liquidity position. And as an overall &#x2013; overarching range, we also defined our strategic priorities impact 2012 in the year.</p>
          <p>So, it was a year with a lot of changes, not only for the business but also for the business environment but also to the direction of our company.</p>
          <p>Now, on the key financials. This was the guiding range that we have given out and we stayed pretty much within the guiding range. On organic sales growth, we guided at 3 to 5. We took it up from 3 to 4, to 3 to 5 following the first six months when everything looked normal in the global economy. We hit three. We said that we would have an adjusted EBIT growth of around 10%. We came in at 9.1. So, in the ballpark and we said our adjusted EPS growth would be low single digit. So, we came in at 3.2. So, achievements within the range of the window.</p>
          <p>Just to clarify and I am certain you have gone through all the numbers but this is a year or was year because this is '08 with the number of one-time effects in the P&amp;L, we have National Starch, we have Global Excellence, we have Ecolab to mention a few which does distort the window a bit, and just for comparable purposes is that if you go through the numbers, we are reporting 14.131. If you adjust our EBIT debt with 6.81 as one-time items, you get back to 14.60, and that is without PPA. PPA is 35 million for three quarters which gets you to 14.95 but the comparable number moving forward is 14.60 because the PPA will be in the P&amp;L moving forward.</p>
          <p>That brings, on adjusted EBIT, if you do comparable from 10.5 to 10.6 but with the PPA at 10.3 and an adjusted EPS flat from a comparable basis without PPA at 2.26.</p>
          <p>From an overall business standpoint, we grew the business 3% organically and eight points overall. The eight points overall was strongly driven by our acquisition of National Starch. We had a significant decline in our gross margin which Lothar will speak to later on but the majority of that was restructuring and Global Excellence and National Starch related.</p>
          <p>EBIT, as I said before, was heavily impacted by the one-time charges into our P&amp;L that brought it back to 14.60. And you can see our EPS at 2.83 was again very much impacted by our Ecolab divestment of 1 billion. So, overall, the picture is organic growth of three made progress on the margin line. Overall, operationally, if you clean it up, substantial changes to the P&amp;L due to the three transactions that I spoke about.</p>
          <p>When I then look upon and spend a couple of minutes on how do we actually evaluate and judge the performance of the company and in the business groups throughout the year. What I've done here is I've outlined the EBIT margin throughout 2008 by business group, and what you can see is it's very telling for how the year was.</p>
          <p>Our Cosmetics and Toiletries business continued to perform well consistently throughout the year with a very strong margin. We had in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business, you saw us being under pressure in the first half with first time for a long time having a single-digit margin in the second quarter of 9.8, particularly under pressure due to enormous price increases in raw materials.</p>
          <p>As we also communicated very early on last year was that we initiated price increases in almost all categories across the globe and you can see the impact of that with the strongest fourth quarter overall with 12.6% margin for our detergents business. So, having the worst second quarter and the best fourth quarter for a long time shows the volatility for our detergents business, but a very, very strong comeback from our detergents business.</p>
          <p>Our adhesive business had the seasonality of the global economy pretty much, a decent first half and, of course, strong under pressure in the second half with strong decline in a number of our focused industries like aerospace, electronics, and automotive. Thomas will take you through that more in detail.</p>
          <p>Overall, as you can see on the red line, we were capable of improving the margin from Henkel in the second part of the year compared to the first part of the year, particularly as the improvements not only from price increases, but also Global Excellence and National Starch integration started to pay off. So, in this context in a year that was highly volatile, we had three business groups that performed differently and in this context, the balance portfolio paid off.</p>
          <p>What I like to do now is give you a brief insight into the progress we are making on our strategic priorities and how that will, over time, impact our P&amp;L from a one-time standpoint and from a sustainable standpoint. I will start out by looking upon achieving our full business potential and speak you through three main elements that I also mentioned in London when we met. One is portfolio, second is brand, and third is operational excellence. Let me start out by portfolio.</p>
          <p>In Laundry &amp; Home Care, we regained our leadership position in dishwashing in Germany with a very, very strong performance this year. In our Cosmetics side, I will speak about that more in detail, but what we are seeing is, the results you are seeing in the P&amp;L is also being seen in the market share positions. And furthermore we gained the number one position in body soap in the U.S. with our brand Dial. And in Adhesives, we gained massive scale opportunities with the acquisition of National Starch, which is really a transformational deal that we've made.</p>
          <p>From a regional standpoint, we continue to see very strong performance in the emerging regions. We saw a 13% organic growth, which built a share as I said earlier on to 37% of total revenue, up from 34 to a three full points of growth in the emerging regions to continue to being the growth driver within the Henkel organization. We also saw further profitability increases and what I mean by that is that our profitability in the emerging regions have grown by 50% since 2004. So we are seeing it's not only being a strong revenue driver, it's also having a significant impact on the profitability of our company.</p>
          <p>We have gotten a much more significant position in Asia due to our National Starch acquisition, 40% growth in that set up and we have all time high-end market shares in all business units in Eastern Europe. So, both progress from a category standpoint and from a regional standpoint.</p>
          <p>From a regional standpoint, this chart is probably more telling, this is our detergents business development in the past three years in Eastern Europe growing from 21.9% to 25.8%, so four full points over three years and getting closer to the gap of our primary competitor, peer one as we say. As you can see that in Eastern Europe, in detergents, it is becoming a duopoly business or duopoly market position. We have three other competitors with marginal positions, but consistently good performance in a year also that was very challenging for our detergents business due to our raw material price increases.</p>
          <p>If I go on to brands, what we see is we continue to see our top brands drive our organic sales growth. The company, overall, grew three points and our top three brands -- Loctite, Schwarzkopf, and Persil -- grew 5.3 points. You can see by business group, in Laundry &amp; Home Care, two out of the three grew very strong, Persil being really the growth driver for our detergents business in 2008. But one of our brands needs fixing and our UW colleagues are working on that.</p>
          <p>In Cosmetics and Toiletries, very, very strong growth from both Schwarzkopf, Fa, and Dial. And in Adhesive Technologies as you can see, the top brands grew 7.5% being Loctite, Teroson and Ceresit, while the rest of the business grew 1.3. So you can see that the top brands are capturing a bigger and bigger part of the overall Henkel business. The top three brands now account for quarter of our total business equaling 3.5 billion and our top nine brands account for approximately 43 to 44%. So, strong growth drivers and strong profit drivers.</p>
          <p>We had, as I started out by saying, a particularly strong year again in our Cosmetics and Toiletries business and our Schwarzkopf brand continues to perform exceptionally well. It now represents as one brand, 1.7 billion of business, has grown 7.5% in 2007, and in the last three years we have gained more market share versus the competitors with 1.7 points of market share growth from 2005 to 2007. We have now market leading position on brand levels for tests in brand and styling, in styling and color and we've also had a very strong year in our professional business. So, what we are again seeing here is not only does the portfolio overall perform well, but the concept of having the Schwarzkopf umbrella brand driving the business is really paying off with a 7.5% points of growth in the overall business.</p>
          <p>Moving to operational excellence, what we have here is and I will give you two examples. On our manufacturing footprint and supply chain, we have initiated more than 60 projects last year. Initiated means announced and started in 2008, that all addresses our manufacturing footprint across the globe. For National Starch, we are starting to see they are paying off with 33 million of synergies achieved in 2008 versus a plan of 20 and we have globally closed 10 plants already.</p>
          <p>Our detergents business went out very early on last year and communicated what the strategy was as it relates to its manufacturing footprint in Europe, and we made great strides. We are planning to close our factories in Genthin, Malgrat, and sell the one in Sevilla. It is important also that we do that, what we call the Henkel way, with a high level of responsibility in closing these manufacturing plants and ensuring or doing our utmost to ensure that our employees that will lose their jobs will get jobs at other places. So, strong progress on our detergent side.</p>
          <p>Our Cosmetics production, we've taken and consolidated our Asian cosmetics production in Thailand now, closed two manufacturing plants in China, and we have sold our Aurora Plant to a contract manufacturer in the U.S. So, as you can see, more than 60 projects announced and initiated, and strong progress on all of the projects that we have announced.</p>
          <p>On our SG&amp;A, Purchasing, we have doubled the size of our Shared Services Centers in 2008 in Bratislava and Manila, and continue to move transactional work to these centers, and we initiated cost chase measures to ensure that we have sustainable cost savings throughout the year.</p>
          <p>On our Purchasing, we consolidated our spend with our suppliers by 7%, and we've also reduced the number of raw materials by 6%, in order to reduce the complexity in the prescriptions of our products, and by then also reducing the cost of manufacturing. Now, we have initiated various structure process of our suppliers, where we've evaluated more than 1,200 suppliers to ensure that the suppliers that we have, actually suppliers that are also will survive in the medium and the long-term. So, strong progress also in SG&amp;A and Purchasing.</p>
          <p>On the customer side, we have today eight out of our top 20 customers are growing twice as fast as the overall company. Our target was 1.5. You can then ask why not all 20. And part of it is, of course, that some of the industries that we sell into are either flat or declining. In that context, we can't double the sale, but we're, of course, trying to double market share. But, the target is to consolidate spend but also drive higher level of profitability around these. We have, as we communicated back in November, established contacts at the CEO level with all our top 20, top customers, and what we've also done is that we are using more and more our sustainability position as one of the value propositions to our customers, as one of them. And what we are seeing is for a number of customers, sustainability plays a bigger and bigger role.</p>
          <p>Today, we're also releasing our Sustainability Report for 2012, and you can, for 2008, with the plan of the targets set for 2012, you can see the targets we have set ourselves, and see a task base for the next four years. We have defined five focal areas. And, in that definition, we have also defined every new product we bring to market has to contribute to at least one of the five focal areas in our CSI area.</p>
          <p>And it is starting to pay off. Last year, we won the German, the prize for being German most sustainable brand, and very recently, we got the award from Walmart for being the supplier with the most significant contribution to sustainability. Two significant awards, that we have won, that we also believe help will drive our business.</p>
          <p>On progress on our global scene, our employees are the key to our success. And it's immensely important that we spend enough money, resource, and time, to ensure that we continue to develop our employee base, to ensure that we have the right competencies to drive Henkel forward, and reach our targets long term. That's why we made certain that this is one of the key strategic priorities, and we made substantial progress in this area.</p>
          <p>What we have is, today we have a management team, where more than 50% of the management team are non-Germans, i.e. international. Not saying that Germans are not international, but representing a different nationality. A quarter of our management team are today female. We have made progress on the overall diversity development within our company. We have 560 apprentices in Germany. We have hired 10% new hires this year, and we continue to push in that direction.</p>
          <p>We've also established, what we call, an executive resource pool with the goal of having 200 high, what we call high, potentials to replace people leaving the company for different reasons, and we are in the process of selecting these people. We don't believe we have all 200 today, but we will get there over time. And for that purpose, we've established also a Harvard Executive Training program, to ensure that we train our people on top talents appropriately.</p>
          <p>We've implemented strategic resource planning with a long-term view, not only looking upon demographics, but also much more looking upon, have we aligned our resource planning with our long-term strategy planning? Do we have the right people at the right place in the next two to five years?</p>
          <p>Pay per performance you'll see, and Lothar will speak about that, is being managed more strictly. You are seeing this year, lesser bonuses paid out because of lesser numbers, and that is according to the targets that we have set ourselves, that we are very committed to ensure that there is a very close link to performance of the company and the compensation of the people in our company.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, we set ourselves, as a strategy, that we wanted to promote our leaders from within, but at the same time, we stated very clearly that we didn't want to compromise on quality. So, it's great to see that we're able to promote three top performers within our company to the second highest level reporting straight into the Board by the end of the year, which shows that we are getting much more traction and succession planning and leadership development within our team.</p>
          <p>So, overall, we believe that we have made great progress on our three strategic priorities. The journey has just started. I want to be very clear on this. This is not the end of it, but we want to make sure that every time we speak to you, we go back and report on these areas because we believe these are the fundamental drivers to improving our business.</p>
          <p>How do we then look upon 2009? If we look upon the overall market, we are convinced that we are facing recession. There was a global GDP growth in 2008 of 1.9. The forecast in the month of October 2008, for GDP growth in '09 was 2.2, and the forecast in January '09 was minus 1.7. It shows the enormous amount of turbulence we currently have in the market. And what we are seeing is that we are seeing consumer habits are changing, as it relates to price points and size, and market habits in different regions. We are seeing industrial consumers reducing volumes and destocking. We've seen that already in the fourth quarter, and we are starting to see impact on payment behavior. It had very limited impact in our fourth quarter. We believe it will have also &#x2013; it will have an impact in the future.</p>
          <p>We have, early on in the fourth quarter, initiated alternative planning scenarios, and also defined additional counter measures. So, very early on, we initiated so to speak Plan B, "what happens if" and also initiated counter-measures to support that. I do want to say in that context, that our counter-measures didn't start in October. Our counter-measures started back in the first quarter last year, when we initiated Global Excellence, and you will see later on, the progress we've made on that. That was the first counter-measure to the market movements.</p>
          <p>We have defined counter-measures that relates to top line, bottom line, and cash, top line particularly focusing on quality and brands and relations, also looking upon appropriate spending in the promotional areas to ensure that we have the right products at the right channels at the right time, and supporting our products, and supporting our top line, but also emphasizing Henkel as a reliable supplier. We are convinced that some of our smaller competitors will have a very hard time, and might not even survive over the next couple of years. And Henkel as a reliable supplier, we see as being a strong and a very good position.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line, we have very early on the implemented very tight cost control. We temporarily closed a number of our manufacturing plants over Christmas, and we will do the same over Easter. And we are also looking upon reduced working time. We've been very restrictive on hiring for a long time. We are intensifying our collections on the overdose on the cash side. We have solid liquidity reserves past our <mark type="inaudible" /> and we reduced CapEx by 30% to 330 from 470, and we've put our mergers and acquisition budget at zero. So, we have waited for things to come in the first quarter. We have initiated all these countermeasures back in the fourth quarter earlier last year, which brings us to the target.</p>
          <p>We believe that under the current conditions where volatility is so high in the marketplace and big parts of industry are changing their forecast almost on a daily or a weekly basis, we cannot give a quantifiable outlook for the year with the current setup. Our target is to outperform, means grow stronger than our markets, and also initiate, which we've done measures that will support our EBIT and EPS. And when the markets will become more stable, we will go out and revert to normal guidance. But under the current circumstances, we don't believe it is prudent to go out and give guidance under these market conditions, quantifiable guidance. Meaning, as we end going into 2009, we believe that we are well prepared. We have set our strategic targets, which will be communicated and we are executing along those within our organizational structure.</p>
          <p>We have strong growth drivers in our brands and innovation where our strategy is that each new product that we bring to market has to be accretive to gross margin. We see the emerging markets as shown as continuing to be a revenue and profit driver. Our top customers will continue to drive our growth.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, we have been capable of reducing our overall costs in the &#x20AC;225 million in nine compared to eight, and we are also starting to see raw material costs playing into our favor.</p>
          <p>We have initiated additional countermeasures, and on the liquidity side we have a very strong position after the sale of Ecolab. We see nine as being the year that will help us move forward to 2012 and we'll take the appropriate steps in nine to respond to the short-term macro requirements, but we will not lose the focus on 2012.</p>
          <p>With this, we believe that we have done a lot of our housework &#x2013; our homework so to speak in eight. We believe there is a lot of homework to be done in nine and 10 also. We are not saying that we believe that nine will be a challenging year, which is also why we're giving the outlook that we are giving, but we believe that we are well positioned to perform in a market that will be a challenging market in nine.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Lothar, who can take us through the numbers in more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>2008 financials. Ladies and gentlemen, 2008 has been a challenge and I believe that getting transparency and detail on the figures will be an equal challenge, so we'll give it our best shot.</p>
          <p>Before I start with the numbers, let me quickly give you an update on how we've held through Q4 2008. Mature markets were continuing to decline. We've seen that starting in the middle of 2008, but it was continuing at an increased &#x2013; increasing pace in 2008 Q4. Slowdown in emerging markets, that was the big event eventually coming on us in 2008 at the end and the accelerated downturn particularly in the Adhesives markets, particularly with respect to industrial customers, but there were positives as well. We've kept our Home and Personal Care businesses on a growth path. We have established and initiated countermeasures in savings early on in the year and we have seen results from that. And we've been able to solidify our financial position by the divestment of our Ecolab participation.</p>
          <p>Let me start with sales growth by business sector. As you can see, for the full year, the difference between FX-adjusted and organic is pretty small in Laundry &amp; Home Care and Personal Care, so there were no divestment and acquisition activities worthy of note in the two divisions, while obviously there is a big impact in the Adhesive Technologies division from the National Starch. In the fourth quarter, the impact is particularly big as total organic growth for Adhesive Technologies was negative, while FX-adjusted, we still had almost 20% growth.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter was a strong performance in our Home and Personal Care divisions. 5.4% Laundry &amp; Home Care organic growth and 3.3 in Personal Care were outstanding results in difficult times. So, therefore, we have seen strong organic growth in both Home Care and in Personal Care. Both divisions, it was entirely driven by pricing activities, which we had initiated earlier in the year, particularly in Q3 and which have had impact now eventually in Q4. So good &#x2013; very good organic growth, very strong activities in pricing, which has helped us to achieve our targets in terms of organic growth for the total company.</p>
          <p>Adhesives has experienced in the fourth quarter a strong volume decline. As you can see, still the pricing, which was more than 5%, has not been sufficient to overcompensate the negative impact from the volume decline of minus 14%.</p>
          <p>Back to the total Home and Personal Care, strongest impact in growth in terms of organic growth for both divisions, particularly in terms of pricing. In other words, pricing was the strongest we have experienced in all of 2008 in Q4 for both divisions. Pricing activities, which had been established in the third quarter, have taken their effect in the fourth quarter, and therefore resulted in the strongest growth contribution from pricing in both Laundry, Home Care, and Personal Care.</p>
          <p>Laundry &amp; Home Care has had its strongest quarter in terms of growth of all the quarters in Q &#x2013; in 2008, and it was driven by basically strong performance in heavy-duty detergents, fabric finishers and dishwashing. So, all the important parts of our portfolio have strongly contributed to the growth of our Laundry &amp; Home Care division.</p>
          <p>Cosmetics was in line with Q3, so that was not a downturn, it was at about the same level. As in Q3, both divisions had a stable volume despite the strong pricing impact in Q4.</p>
          <p>Strong negative growth in our Adhesive division with important end-markets rapidly deteriorating. We have increased our prices by more than 5% as part of total growth, but it was not enough to compensate completely for the volume losses. We are seeing the strongest impact in Western Europe, North America, and as I mentioned that earlier, Asia which has had a strong downturn in terms of industrial output in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Quick look at the sales growth by region, obviously we've seen adjusted for foreign exchange effects good growth still in Europe and organic growth just slightly positive, entirely due to a strong organic growth in the emerging market's part of Europe, Eastern Europe. In other words, Western Europe has been negative in terms of organic growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>North America similarly has been negative in terms of organic growth. Strong impact from the National Starch acquisition resulting in 13.5% organic &#x2013; 13.5% adjusted for foreign exchange effects. Latin America has held up very nicely, 8% organic growth, 18.7% adjusted for foreign exchange effects, including the impact from the National Starch acquisition. So Latin America has pretty much held up through most of the year. Asia-Pacific, the negative minus 10.6% organic growth in the fourth quarter, but the strong impact almost 50% adjusted for foreign exchange from the National Starch acquisition.</p>
          <p>Separating out the emerging markets from the regions that I have reported earlier, resulted in 6.3% organic growth for our emerging market's portfolio which is lower than what we had before. So therefore, Q4 was already negatively impacted, particularly by a negative organic growth in Asia and particularly there for the Adhesive division.</p>
          <p>The decline in the Adhesive Technologies division which is obviously a part of the story for Q4 has been particularly pronounced in our North American business. We've seen a stable growth, organic growth in Laundry &amp; Home Care and Cosmetics and Toiletries North America. With respect to the emerging markets, Home and Personal Care have continued with double-digit growth rates, all emerging markets together and we've seen a decline in the Adhesive Technologies division with Asia, particularly negative.</p>
          <p>EBIT growth by business sector, Q4 we've &#x2013; obviously have a strong margin increase in the fourth quarter in our Laundry &amp; Home Care division. We have a negative minus 80% compared to prior year in the Personal Care and minus 160 in the Adhesive Technology division.</p>
          <p>Starting with Laundry &amp; Home Care, obviously we've seen price increases which have contributed strongly through organic growth, also taking impact in terms of our margin improvement in the fourth quarter. We've also had an impact from the savings from Global Excellence. And in addition, we've had 130 basis points improvement over Q3.</p>
          <p>Now, it's also important to note that on a like-for-like basis, improvement was even stronger because the reallocation of the central R&amp;D would have resulted in a margin on a comparable basis of 12.6%. With respect to Personal Care, margin minus 80 basis points compared to the prior-year period. We have increased our marketing spending in the fourth quarter significantly over the same period in 2007. And we've achieved a stable margin compared to the prior quarter in Q3, 2008 in order to sustain our strong organic sales growth. We have spent more and we have seen the results with a margin on a like-for-like basis obviously even less reduced compared to last year because of the reallocation impact from the central R&amp;D which is 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>Finally, negative impact on our Adhesive Technology division, we've seen a strong market downturn and volume losses, particularly in a number of important industries, most notably in the automotive industry, electronic industry, and durable goods. Obviously electronic industry is affected by the automotive industry as well because it's a strong outlet for electronic industry, but also consumer electronics have had a weak fourth quarter. So, all this together has resulted in a negative market development for the markets in which we are active, particularly those that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>We've also had a negative impact from the first time amortization of intangible assets resulting from purchase price allocation. We have attempted very hard and that's a strong part of our story for Q4, to mitigate the impact from the additional charge, the 35 million amortization charge that we have incurred first time in Q4, 2008 by additional cost chase measures with almost being able to compensate through extraordinary efforts in saving costs wherever possible. That is obviously something which has been an extra effort on behalf of that particular division, but also on behalf of the whole company.</p>
          <p>You may remember that there has been some negative publicity at the beginning of fourth quarter because of the savings programs that we have put in place in order to make our numbers for the year. We finally have seen positive results from that which in a way indicates what we have tried to achieve.</p>
          <p>National Starch derivation of goodwill, that's important in order to understand the impact from the additional depreciation charge that I referred to earlier. Total purchase price was around about &#x20AC;3.7 billion. Tangible assets that we have taken over book values were 0.6 billion. The intangible assets that have resulted from the purchase price allocation are in the range of 0.6 billion and that's then the amount that needs to be depreciated over the next year's duration of the life of these intangible assets resulting in a remaining residual goodwill of &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Amortization of the intangible assets, the 600 million, has resulted in a charge of 35 million in 2008, which is just three quarters. On a run rate, that's about 12 million per quarter resulting in a charge to be expected going forward of about 46 million.</p>
          <p>Q4 Income Statement. Some relevant information, obviously, we have a sales increase heavily driven by National Starch integration, even stronger increase of cost of sales, which is partially due to the National Starch business and partially due to the increase in the cost of raw materials. Resulting lowering of the gross margin is in addition impacted by allocating the expenses for Global Excellence and for National Starch integration into the lines of the P&amp;L, so the gross margin was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses that had to be booked in the cost of sales line.</p>
          <p>If we try to provide more transparency on the development of our gross margin, we have started Q4, '07 with 45.3%. We have increased our margin by price volume impacts, about half price, half volume of 1.9 percentage points, negative 2.5 from cost of sales, increase in raw materials, and other costs, 0.2, others which has resulted on a like-for-like basis in a 40 basis points reduction of our gross margin. Now the remaining impact is from the restructuring which I mentioned earlier 2.6 percentage points and National Starch which includes two components, a lower gross margin of National Starch to begin with and restructuring for integration expenses that have been allocated to the National Starch activity.</p>
          <p>Going from in Q4 reported to adjusted EBIT, we have EBIT as reported &#x20AC;155 million with &#x2013; we have an impact of one-time gains to be detected in order to arrive at adjusted EBIT of 19 million, one-time charges 23, normal restructuring is 1, and extraordinary restructuring charges relating to National Starch and to Global Excellence 219 resulting in adjusted EBIT of 379. The one-time gains refer to basically two one-off items, one is the sale of non-current assets, which we have undertaken in the Q4 and a gain from post retirement healthcare, which has resulted from a combination of National Starch integration measures, closing down plants, making people redundant which results in a lower total amount of liability from the post retirement healthcare and an immediate gain, which we have recognized as a one-off impact in the 19 and then corrected to arrive at adjusted EBIT.</p>
          <p>The one-time charges that we have incurred are basically two items, maybe three, purchase price true-ups and integration cost National Starch. Purchase price true-ups or purchase price post closing adjustments refer to two transactions which we have undertaken earlier in the year where we had to, as part of purchase price adjustments, recognize additional expenses of 12 million. These are one-time charges because they're related to the dispositions and not reoccurring. Integration cost, National Starch 11 million. That's obviously the part allocated or occurring in Q4 as a result of the efforts to integrate National Starch.</p>
          <p>Finally, the National Starch and Global Excellence restructuring charges which have been incurred in Q4, 109 for Global Excellence and 110 for National Starch. For Global Excellence, that's basically the end of it because we have taken the full charge for Global Excellence in 2008. With respect to National Starch, we're ramping up our efforts to do the integration, and therefore, this amount is kind of a pretty high amount and remains some more to be done.</p>
          <p>So that then results in extraordinary restructuring charges of 219 and explaining the evolution to adjusted EBIT. Now, again in order to get the transparency, we have provided income statement from sales to adjusted EBIT on the basis of adjusting for restructuring expenses which otherwise have been booked into the individual lines in our P&amp;L. Obviously, that reduces the impact on gross profit which you have seen earlier, the big impact from the increase in cost of sales. Now the increase in gross profit is still lower than the increase in sales; that again is due to the integration of National Starch which has lower gross margin to begin with; and therefore, integrating the sales of National Starch with lower gross margin results in overall lower improvement in our gross profit.</p>
          <p>Marketing and selling and distribution expenses have again increased on a lower scale than our sales volume, which is due again to the fact that we have integrated National Starch. Obviously, National Starch has very little in terms of marketing expenses, nowhere near to the average of our branded products businesses. So therefore, we're entering National Starch into the Henkel group with a lower level of marketing, selling, and distribution expenses as a percentage of sales.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses, again a smaller increase compared to the sales level. Administrative expense, we've seen an improvement in our situation and I will explain that in a moment; and net of other operating income and charges, I have explained earlier.</p>
          <p>Lowering our administrative expenses has been one of the big success stories for our Q4. We have driven lowering our administrative expenses by restructuring savings and additional cost chase measures. We have announced early on in the fourth quarter that we need to come up with extra efforts in order to make our numbers to get to the forecast that we have communicated after Q3 and we have taken what it takes in order to get to making our numbers.</p>
          <p>Look at the full year 2008 sales to gross profit. There again, there are some discrepancies in order for you to understand because of the integration of &#x2013; impact from National Starch. A stronger impact from cost of sales due to National Starch and restructuring gross margin, I'll explain again through the bridge that we have provided for Q4. There again, compared to 2007, 46.4% gross margin. We have a dilution of 30 basis points on a like-for-like basis. We have a price volume improvement in our gross margin. We have a negative still remaining from the price increases on the input side, although in the fourth quarter we've seen strong improvement already, but that has not been sufficient to completely compensate the negative impact on our gross margin but we're on a good way.</p>
          <p>In terms of restructuring in National Starch, the same story that I explained earlier. Restructuring has had a negative impact on the gross margin as reported in National Starch, both for the integration expenses and the lower level of gross margin.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBIT from the 779 as reported. We have one-time gains that we need to readjust in order to get to adjusted EBIT of 30 million, one-time charges of 48 million, normal restructuring that's inline with what we have communicated earlier, and the extraordinary restructuring charges from Global Excellence and National Starch resulting in adjusted EBIT that's according to the customary practice resulting in adjusted EBIT of 1,460 million or 1 billion 460 million.</p>
          <p>Now the one-time gains which we have adjusted in arriving at adjusted EBIT. Disposal of the water treatment has occurred earlier. Sale of non-current assets plus the six that we had in the fourth quarter resulting in nine and post-retirement healthcare, which has occurred in Q4, and which I have explained earlier.</p>
          <p>One-time charges 48 million. Integration cost National Starch, integration cost of National Starch, as reported here is a one-time charge; 36 million. That's not restructuring, does not qualify as restructuring because it's not closing down facilities, it is related to consulting costs that we have incurred entirely to go through the integration effort and as such, it's a one-time expense and therefore subject to adjustments.</p>
          <p>Purchase price true-ups, I've mentioned that earlier, the 12 million from Q4 resulting in 48 million. 646 for the full year extraordinary restructuring charges, 504 Global Excellence, that's almost exactly in line with what we have communicated for the full year. And National Starch the 142, 142 restructuring, 36 consulting cost. So the total effort for integration is composed of restructuring and consulting costs. This year is just restructuring.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBIT; 1.460 billion, adjusted financial result minus 194, I'll explain in a second resulting in adjusted earnings before tax 1.266 billion, adjusted taxes on income minus 309, adjusted tax rate 24.4 which is almost in line with the tax rate as reported. Adjusted earnings per share on prior year level.</p>
          <p>Explanation for adjustments in the financial results. Without Ecolab, the net interest would have been or has been 275 negative. We have had the investment results from Ecolab still in through mid of November when we made the divestment of 81 million and adjusted one-time gain from the Ecolab divestment of one billion forty two million, which we have adjusted here in the financial result in order to provide the transparency that is necessary.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this graph, the net interest that we have incurred last year; minus 275, pretty much will be the financial result going forward in as much as the investment result falls by the wayside. We have divested of our Ecolab participation, so there will be nothing coming in the future, and then the net interest will equal financial result in the future.</p>
          <p>We have an increase in our net interest as a result of the increase in financial debt in 2008. It's obvious that we have initially financed National Starch acquisition through additional debt. We've refinanced part of it through the disposition of our Ecolab participation, so there are some positive and negatives going forward.</p>
          <p>That is a very strong performance from our perspective despite the difficulties that we have experienced in the fourth quarter in terms of the volume decline in the Adhesives business. We've been able to manage our net working capital to sales ratio to the level that we had in 2007. Remind you, this is one of the targets that we have set out long-term for 2008, the 12%, we're well below 12% and we have stabilized our performance on the prior year level despite the difficulties.</p>
          <p>Net debt development, that's an important result from our Ecolab divestment. We started into the year or I should say into the second quarter of the year taking on additional debt. The gross debt was almost 6 billion. We've had liquid funds of 653, resulting in net debt of round about 5.4 billion. We have at the end of 2008 net debt of 3.8, 3.9 billion, obviously entirely due to the disposition of our Ecolab participation which has helped reduce our net debt by almost 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Cash flow statement, starting with EBIT as reported somewhat higher income taxes paid, higher depreciation of non-current assets 546 million, and change in other receivables, liabilities and provisions. A higher amount that we have paid in terms of income taxes relates to the cash-out from the settlement of tax audits in the U.S. and in Germany. The difference of about 100 million is &#x2013; about half of it is the cash-out for the tax settlements and the remainder is the capital gains tax payments and the National Starch tax payments. We have obviously had through the additional business that we have integrated, additional tax payments, and therefore there are some higher tax payments cash-out from the businesses that we have taken over.</p>
          <p>Depreciation of non-current assets, Global Excellence accounts for 144 million and the National Starch depreciation, the additional depreciation that we have taken in addition to the regular depreciation is the six million. So therefore, about 150 is in addition to the depreciation on a run rate basis.</p>
          <p>Global Excellence provisions, which have increased our change in other receivables, liabilities and provisions, we have had an increase from Global Excellence in &#x2013; of 290 million and from National Starch of 100 million. That's obviously the amount that has been reserved in order to provide for the cash-outs that will occur in the future. It all relates to projects that have been announced already that have been communicated, and therefore can be put into the provisions and the cash-out will occur in the next two years.</p>
          <p>Update on Global Excellence and National Starch. We have been able to accelerate the pace of generating savings from National Starch and from Global Excellence, we're ahead of schedule. We have confirmed total level of savings for 2011 of 400 million, and we will be realizing the savings in 2009 of 225, which will help us in getting through a difficult 2009.</p>
          <p>Timeline for Global Excellence, we have improved our pace. We had anticipated 30 million savings; we end up at 35 for the full year. We have booked the full charge, 504 million, so that's it for this program and we have realized savings of 35 million already. The other numbers have been, as reported earlier, the 100 million for 2009 and 125 and 150 in the years thereafter.</p>
          <p>Timeline for National Starch, we have accelerated. We have realized 33 million already in 2008, which is a very strong, very good achievement. And therefore, we increased our target for next year by 25 million. We expect to generate savings of 125 million in 2009 from the National Starch integration.</p>
          <p>And the rest of the charges, we've not been able to book in 2008, because projects could not be announced, we're not ready for an announcement, that amounts to about 70 million which will be booked in 2009. So the total amount that we expect for this program will remain at 250 as will be the savings that we expect in 2011.</p>
          <p>That's the key takeaways for the full year and for the position where we find ourselves in. We've been able to maintain our volumes in Home and Personal Care at a stable level. We have seen an accelerated downturn, particularly in Q4, for Adhesive Technologies division, and we've been able to accelerate the pace of our Global Excellence and National Starch integration in order to account for some of the contingencies that we may have to face going forward. That will be a great help in maintaining our strength. It also obviously is important from our perspective that we have been able to divest our Ecolab participation, which not only has resulted in reduction of our net debt, but also increasing our liquidity position.</p>
          <p>All in all, at the end of 2008, we are in good shape, but 2009 will be a challenge, will be a particular challenge for our Adhesives business and Thomas Geitner will lead you through the strategic background of our Adhesive division and opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lothar. Good afternoon. I am pleased to talk to you about Henkel Adhesives today and there are basically four points I will address. The number one is our progress with National, where we think the integration; we are ahead of what we had announced early on. The second thing, as you will see, we have reached a very strong and solid number one market position in all our markets. Thirdly, following the acquisition of National and some previous ones for the next two or three years, we think we should focus much more on strengthening organic growth in the Henkel Adhesives business. And last, but not least, 2009 will be a very difficult year in the market for Adhesives, but we feel very well equipped to face the challenge and to come out of this downturn as a strengthened company.</p>
          <p>Now, before I go into the presentation, we have a quick video prepared for you explaining what we are doing on the product side, so I am going to save a little bit of that. Hopefully it is going to start now.</p>
          <p>[Video Presentation] .</p>
          <p>Now, talking about the numbers that you have lastly seen already from Dr. Steinebach and Kasper Rorsted, our sales figures you have seen have grown by 17.3%, organically it's 1.3%. The 6.7 billion which we are showing here include three quarters of National because only in April we closed the transaction and there are few more components to say about the revenue number. First of all, I mean the full year figure on price increase year-over-year is 4.1%. So, that shows us that we have all through the year managed to get pricing through quite well compensating for the increase in raw material prices, firstly.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the year 2008, if you like, is basically two years. There is a year going from quarter one to quarter three where we have managed the organic sales growth of 4.7% and the fourth quarter which you already have seen the numbers going backwards by 9.2% which is the reflection of the fact that in Western Europe and in North America we have seen a massive slowdown in industrial production not just in automotive but also in other industries which sell more industrial products like steel or household products like kitchen furniture or washing machines or everything which is basically a long-lasting consumer good that people don't buy every month or every quarter. We have seen a massive slowdown in production which has come through to our number.</p>
          <p>So, a true decline in sales figures in Western Europe and North America. A first-time decline really in our business in Asia-Pacific year-over-year and a quite significant slowdown in the other emerging markets like Eastern Europe, Latin America and also in Middle East Africa.</p>
          <p>On EBIT margin, you have also seen Mr. Steinebach's comments. We have a quite strong dilution coming from the fact that we have taken on board National which has lower margins. The organic EBIT margin of Henkel Adhesives is actually slightly above the previous year's numbers, and the dilution coming from National, as explained, is one of the reasons why we are pushing so hard on the synergies because the synergies need to help us to bring us back on track to our target margin development by getting the synergies in as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about Adhesives in more general terms and why this is an attractive market and how does this fill us through to our strategy, we look at Adhesives as a market of 48 billion worldwide which is basically done in three big segments. The first is Consumer and Craftsmen, 10 billion euros; Industry, 23 billion euros, and Building Adhesives, which is 16 billion euros.</p>
          <p>The way we look at the market defines it in a way that we expect to have a long-term growth of 3 to 4% which we have basically seen also over the last few years. And despite the fact that we are going through a market downturn in 2009, we fundamentally believe there are a number of healthy drivers which runs via our hedge fund through the recession will be back in place and will help continue to grow our markets in our industry.</p>
          <p>Now, what are these drivers? There are basically three mega trends which we think will sustain this recession. The first one is the growth of emerging countries. All of these countries have started and built over the last 15 years a consumer goods industry to help to create wealth and feed the need of their population which is creating a significant need for Adhesives for industrial production and production of consumer goods. We think that trend will persist even through and after the crisis.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there is a lot of discussion in the world about reduction of carbon footprint, and that is really stipulating from our point of view innovation in crucial areas of product design in industrial production. It's not just motorcars and aeroplanes as you've seen in the film but it's also household devices, it's in mobile handsets where the need to be more energy efficient creates a lot of innovation through the use of more and different materials which can only be used in combination with Adhesives because classical joining technologies can only be applied to a limited degree.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we have seen a strong globalization of supply chains over the last 10 or 15 years, where companies have put factories into low label countries. All their companies have invested in growing emerging markets and basically their supply chains have moved eastward, and that has been a particular market opportunity for Henkel because we typically have manufacturing capabilities in these countries and has been able to grow market share as the manufacturing bases really moved into Eastern Europe and into Asia.</p>
          <p>Now, structural adhesives are the key element of what we are doing which is subject to innovation in the industry, in particular coming through new methods of design in motorcar and aeroplanes and trains and washing machines. But people need to be more efficient in terms of energy usage and this is why this is one of our focus points of product development and innovation going forward because we believe this market will grow as our customers look for new methods of joining other than the ones that they have used traditionally.</p>
          <p>So, all these elements will drive the market and will also drive our capability to introduce innovations to our customers in the way they design their products and they run their assembly lines.</p>
          <p>Now, Henkel Adhesives Technologies has a very unique position in that marketplace and there are basically four defining sectors for that unique position. The first is, obviously, our strength as a market leader. We are not just strong by the number of sales we are reporting to you year-over-year but also by our capability to earn these sales basically across the globe. So, I think this isn't something I need to talk to you about in great lengths but you have seen it and heard that before.</p>
          <p>Secondly, brands. I mean despite the fact that we are making two-thirds of our revenue in industrial, with industrial customers, branding is a very important issue. I mean you have seen Kasper Rorsted's example of the Loctite brand or of the other brands which are in these Adhesives division which are growing above average of what our overall divisions' growth is. So, brand is an important driver of trust where people need to apply a product, where they basically have no own competency to understand what this product really does.</p>
          <p>We are not in the business of supplying a part to our motorcar manufacturer. When a motorcar manufacturer calls us, he typically needs a solution that he can't find himself where he needs a specialist to find him the chemical solution. Now, this trust element of the way we introduce our products and we tailor them to our customers, processes, and products is a crucial element. So, having strong brands has been a strong asset in the past and we are sure we'll be one going forward.</p>
          <p>Our global presence is a true unique feature in terms of &#x2013; we have global technologies which we basically can sell to every customer worldwide. But the important thing is, we are capable of supplying in each region because we have typically or we have in all regions, manufacturing capabilities that don't just help us to supply the customer in a very immediate form, but also make us quite independent from currency fluctuation which we have seen so drastically over the last 12 months and for sure will be a factor of the future going forward.</p>
          <p>And last, but not least, in all the countries where we are present today, we have the capability to work on solutions which means we don't just sell a standard product across the board in many of our areas, and I will talk about in a moment, we are providing the customer a solution which is tailor fit to his product design or his manufacturing process. So, global presence has much of the capability to generate sales, it's a result of a very elaborate global footprint in supply chain and the capability to deliver solutions.</p>
          <p>And the last sector which I think is probably the most important one is our scope of technologies we have. I don't think any competitor of Henkel has a scope of technologies in the way we have is available and we have developed capabilities to deliver it globally to our customers in particular to our industrial customers who typically don't look for a product, they look for a solution so that they want to know what is the best technology to solve my problem, even if it's quite a standard application, we see this requirement very often. So, having a broad scope of technologies has proven to be a strong feature in competing, in particular in the industrial sector.</p>
          <p>Now, where do we stand with respect to National? We closed the <mark type="inaudible" /> in last year in April, which was a big day obviously for everybody. From Q3 onwards, we basically had the structures between the two companies combined, so since then we have for similar businesses, one management structure, one person available in each region to running the business and basically take the two organizations and put them into one, well, not just top down &#x2013; not at the very top, but really top down to the level of salesmen and the factory managers. So, basically from August, September last year onwards, we had fully integrated the organization in the Packaging area, but also in the Electronics area.</p>
          <p>In Q3 and four, in two steps we have announced the restructurings in particular on the factory side. Kasper also has already alluded to that. We announced the closer of 30 factories, 10 of them already closed. And the others, we are in the process to shutting down as we go through 2009. And we have delivered already by the end of the year, 33 million of synergies. And I can say, I am the new guy on the block here having run this division now for nine months, obviously had a very close look of what was the commitment of the 250 million and I am glad to say that, we have confirmed the 250 million and we even think we have slight upside on that if you look on the timeframe until 2011, then being concerned about do we achieve the 250 million. So, we are very confident we can do that.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, we increasingly see positive response from customers where we have now a much larger range of products which we can offer and actually it turned out that our product ranges were much more complementary than we had initially expected between Henkel and National. So, having the salesmen now going back to the customer and offering a much broader range of solutions and products is really appreciated. And we are not so sure in some customers, but I mean I can tell you after nine months operating in this mode now, we are very confident that it's really a strong selling feature, which will help us over time to expand our market share.</p>
          <p>Now, we look at National not just as an acquisition to make the business bigger. We look at National also at an acquisition which is really transformational in the way we run the business in particular in those two sectors of Electronics and Packaging. In those areas, we have significantly strengthened our market position. In Packaging, we are in all sectors in all regions, now the number one supplier. In Electronics, we are either number one or number two depending on the different product segments, which gives us a very strong position when it comes to scale in particular, but also we could organize our business in a different way. We use to be organized pretty much as a functional regional business. And we have started to run the business in a much more &#x2013; divisional area, because in each of the divisions we have passed a point of critical mass to run them in much more focused and customer integrated ways.</p>
          <p>We have doubled our business in Asia, which is an important point strategically for us, because it's one of the fast growing regions. And obviously through Asia in the Packaging business, which I will show you going forward, is much less vulnerable to industrial cyclicality. We have lowered our overall exposure as a Henkel division to cyclicality. Now, obviously we get a lot of scale effects in purchasing in the way we do innovation and we can afford doing innovation in manufacturing, but also in the sales organization. And, that's a point I also want to underline, getting the 250 million is not an easy thing in terms of achieving synergies and driving it through the organization, but we are pretty confident we have had a very good start.</p>
          <p>We are well underway to achieving the programs. But, we think today it's achievable. We are very confident it can be done. But, there is another element and that is getting the long-term benefits of scale. Being a business that can move much bigger development programs or get the benefit of much bigger factories, not just in lower initial costs as what we are doing now, but running them over time in a much more scale effect is a benefit which we haven't even thought of before we did the transaction which we are seeing coming through going forward.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Henkel Adhesives business we have basically five different areas or five different target markets and each of them follows a different logic and different business model and in terms of also markets, a different market dynamics and let me talk about that for a moment. So, that's how our 6.7 billion in the last year broke down.</p>
          <p>If you take the first sector which makes &#x2013; it's the biggest in terms of revenue, it's the Specialty Adhesives and Surface Treatment area for manufacturing industries. And you can see with the picture what the typical customers they are &#x2013; these are household appliances that are steel works, people who are producing steel belts and coils, motorcar manufacturers, aeroplane, and there is a big sector in that division which we call Loctite, which is basically the repair and overhaul business.</p>
          <p>So, that is a business where we make solutions for customer which are pretty much tailored under what the customer wants to design as a product. So, providing a solution for the customer-specific problem is the winning proposition there. And of course and that area is particularly important to have a very broad technology base and the capability on the sales side to deliver this technology solution capability to the customer.</p>
          <p>Now that sector obviously is the one that is most affected by the downturn that we see in particular in North America and in Europe, but also partly in Asia, because really that sector follows in the industry cycle of industrial goods. And this is where we really saw the biggest downturn in the fourth quarter last year coming through.</p>
          <p>The second area is Packaging, Consumer Goods and Construction Adhesives, that's if you like the area where we sell to companies we package their goods, like the consumer goods companies, like one of our big customers is our two consumer divisions here, who are packaging their goods or to customers who are producing hygiene wear, personal hygiene wear. So, these are products which are much closer to the daily, weekly, monthly needs of customers.</p>
          <p>We are actually, we are not so much a solution provider, but in this area we are selling standardized applications much more than solutions. And here the name of the game is really driving a volume business, getting volumes through a sales organization, getting volumes through factories, getting volumes through purchasing is the winning game and is really the formula for success and that's the area where we've made the biggest difference through the acquisition of National Starch where we have picked up the biggest strengths. And obviously, the industry cycle there is a different one to the manufacturing industry. It is pretty much the consumer product cycle that we are living with here.</p>
          <p>Electronics, here again, one area where we have picked up significant strengths and scale, so the National acquisition, albeit it accounts only for 6% of our revenue, this is pretty much innovation driven and scale in R&amp;D. So the capability to be early on with new products as the next cycle of innovation happens is really crucial to winning in that field. So, having now doubled the business there is really helping us to justify R&amp;D investments. Industry cycle here is not just one, it's a few; it's semiconductor, which is very cyclical of course, then we have consumer electronics and we have durable goods, like all the household devices that would use electronic materials.</p>
          <p>Building Adhesives, you all know is basically the business where we selling material for interior completion of buildings or for waterproofing. There we selling branded products through structured channels like wholesale or retailers. And obviously, the cycle there is pretty much the construction industry.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, if you like the display window of Henkel Adhesives, it's a consumer adhesives division, because that's the one where our brands are most visible to the consumer, it makes up 21% of our revenue. There we sell branded products, through wholesalers and retail distributors. This is a business where we are particularly successful here in Western Europe, in North America and in Latin America. And that business obviously is yet following another industrial cycle, which is basically slow moving consumer goods that people do overhaul or repair in their homes or buy adhesives for their offices.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at another way of cutting our business which is regional, 40% or close to 40% last year came in terms of revenue from the emerging markets, one-third came from Western Europe, and 23% from North America, the 4% at the bottom right is basically Japan and Australia. Now, if you take those two ways of looking through the business, we think we have a pretty well-balanced portfolio, which is helping us to mitigate sector cyclicalities, because in a normal economic cycle these sectors, in some way, don't follow the same cycle, in the way we see it right now, in this global downturn. So, we think our portfolio, in terms of geographies and markets we are serving, is really helping us to manage cyclicality.</p>
          <p>However, we need to acknowledge that if we have &#x2013; we are not immune against the global downturn and the meltdown that we see in some of the sectors that we are serving here. So, if we like it or not, we will be affected as we were in the last quarter, last year. And definitely we will be affected by what's happening to the, in particular, manufacturing sector in that year.</p>
          <p>Now looking through the sales history of Henkel Adhesives, we have a pretty impressive growth track record of 11% CAGR, which is the result of strong organic growth, but also of a number of acquisitions. So National is a big acquisition last year, as you all know, but there are number of preceding ones, in the years before. And frankly, being the new guy here and having had various discussions with my colleagues in the board meetings, our strategy for the next two or three years should really be focused on getting the organic growth factors in the business right, and really getting the potential, in terms of organic growth, going.</p>
          <p>National is not just a big acquisition for us, or a transformational decision for us. It has also been a decision that has been quite disruptive to our organization, and we are still working to get everything back and settled, and make sure that the scale benefits that we are talking about are really filtering through the business and are visible to the customers. So, we believe, in the next few years, the business should really be focused on getting the organic growth capabilities to life, and really get the full strength of the acquisitions that we have done recently out into the market.</p>
          <p>So, there are four areas of particular focus to that, number one, customer focus, strengthen our customer relationship, I will talk to that about in more detail in a moment. Innovation is a key feature of our future growth. Industrial excellence and scale is very important, we have worked on that as part of the integration of National, but it will continue to be a core area of focus. And the fourth area, where we think we will get a lot of benefit and value for, is ongoing investment in emerging countries, where we believe the growth opportunities will prevail even if we're seeing some slowdown at the moment.</p>
          <p>Now, if you talk about customers, I think one of our biggest asset today, looking through our portfolio, is really our customer relationship. Not the one customer relationship, but the numerous customer relationships we have, and our capability to strengthen it, I think can be improved in terms of how do we really drive our innovation roadmap, how well do we understand what in particular big customers need in the next two or three years, as they go through this phase where they have to change their product programs as a result of a number of challenges they face. So, customers, as a source of ideas and the source of growth and the capability where we can leverage our size, in particular helping our big customers, will be a key focus area for us going forward. And it will also drive the way how our organization will evolve, because we think there is potential where our size and the different sectors we are in, can be turned into more focus in the way we run the organization.</p>
          <p>Second, innovation, I think &#x2013; we think there is a lot of potential in driving innovation, in particular if we manage to focus our resources more on key projects. Having a few big projects is something that only a big supplier can do, and giving our relative size, I think that's a feature that we should build more on. And, this is why we believe that improving the output and the efficiency of our 1,600 developers is one of the key things that we expect, as we consolidate the organization after the integration of National.</p>
          <p>Industrial excellence and scale; we have talked about it, you have heard Kasper also talk about it, that overall for Henkel it's an important element of strength and value creation going forward. I think it's even more so one for the Henkel Adhesives division, where beyond the programs that we have already announced for the National integration, we will continue to strengthen our supply chain, our sourcing capabilities, and our capabilities to drive R&amp;D programs.</p>
          <p>We will, definitely now in the downturn, have a much stronger focus on costs, create more transparency on costs, and use the opportunity of the changes we are doing at the moment to get to a better cost position. We will have fewer and bigger factories going forward. And we have started the reduction of complexity in both products, but even more so in processes. And we think, doing that, in terms of not just a tactical thing to do, to achieve synergies for National, but also as a key strategic building block to get the benefits of scale onto the market, and onto the bottom line, will not just help us on the bottom line and on growth, but it will also help us to make the business less exposed to industrial cyclicality.</p>
          <p>So, I mean, you've heard us say that 2009 will be a difficult year, we have looked at the major industries that we are saving, and I want to give you at least some outlook of where we think they are going. We consider automotive and metal to be under challenge most of the year 2009, so we expect some decrease of market there, in those two sectors for 2009. Also, we see construction will go slower, will work slower this year, so we will see some decrease there. And also, we will see some strong decrease in market on the electronics.</p>
          <p>For our consumer customers and customers who are serving consumer businesses like packaging, which make up altogether about 50% of our revenue, we expect that the markets will be more or less flat. What does it mean for us? Well, we will need to tackle negative market growth in 2009 with all the elements that's behind that. We expect that the strongest impact of this market decline will hit our businesses in automotive, metal, construction, electronics. And obviously, we expect less impact of the downturn on those areas where we are closer to consumer businesses, as are in our consumer business for adhesives or where we are supplying directly into consumer companies.</p>
          <p>What are the top line priorities? We think we have done big changes to our organization last year, as we did integrate National. So, we have gone through the phase of the big disruption. Our sales guys are back on the market for the last four months, five months. And I think there are plenty of opportunities out in the marketplace, where customers are concerned about who &#x2013; which supplier is stable enough to help us, who will make it through the downturn, and has a supply base which is reliable, all of that. I mean, that's creating opportunities.</p>
          <p>Also, that is the time that customers have time for innovation. They are looking for opportunities to lower their cost. They are much more receptive to ideas, where we can tell them, 'look if you do it this other way and use that &#x2013; this other product of this other process in your manufacturing, you will be capable of lowering your cost.' So, value selling for us, is a better opportunity in a time where the customers are not so terribly busy, because their market is more difficult.</p>
          <p>And clearly, we will intensify our innovation efforts. We are very much focused on the cost this year. But clearly, we want to maintain our innovation programs, in particular those where we expect a long-term value and a long-term strengthening of our competitive position.</p>
          <p>So overall, we think for the top line, there is room for us, despite all the difficulties in the market, to position Henkel as a reliable partner for innovation and as a reliable supplier in a time of big uncertainty for many industrial customers.</p>
          <p>What are the bottom-line priorities? We will accelerate the National savings. We have done a lot of announcements in September and in November, with respect to restructuring factory closures. We have given dates at the time, at the moment, we are reviewing dates and bringing forward some of them where we can. But there is some potential where we think bringing a few things forward will help us, not just on the long-term, but also for the bottom line this year. We obviously will run the business to a lean cost structure, you have heard Mr. Rorsted talk about the things that we have done; hiring freeze and being very prudent on costs, we will do that in particular in the Adhesives business.</p>
          <p>We have us already started back in October, the adjustment of our capacities by factory closures &#x2013; by temporary factory closures and beginning in North America, but also now in Western Europe. And we have announced further steps to close down factories for days or weeks where necessary to make sure we are not producing inventory at a time where lower raw material prices make having big inventories an even bigger risk. So, we will assist on our feet, to make sure we adjusting our capacities to what's going on in the marketplace. And obviously, net working capital management is a key priority always but it is even more one for a time of lot of uncertainty in the marketplace. So keeping receivables and inventories under control is a key management focus area.</p>
          <p>Now, I think the name of the game really is this year to make sure we are adjusting capacities, cost and working capital to what the market is, to where the market is going.</p>
          <p>In summary, we think we are pretty, we can be pretty confident as we go through the downturn, nobody wants to go through a downturn but, out of the choices we have, we have chosen the one to be confident about it, because the one &#x2013; the other ones where we are not confident is &#x2013; is not really a choice that you want to be in if you want to be active in the market. We think we have a strong and unique position in this marketplace. We've started early on with our cost reduction as part of global excellence and through the opportunities we have been offered through the National integration.</p>
          <p>We know where we want to go with our strategy, you have seen our mid-term targets for the strategy, we don't want to correct them at all. We think we should keep our eyes really focused on them to make sure we are keeping them in eye and use 2009 as an opportunity to bring a few things forward. And clearly, this year will be the year of focus on innovation, cost and working capital.</p>
          <p>Now, despite all the things that are going on in the market, we think looking at 2009 as an opportunity to strengthen our position and to take the next step to achieving our strategic opportunities is the right way of looking at the business and that's what we are going to do.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>We are opening the Q&amp;A now. May I ask you to mention name and company and second, to be very disciplined and to limit your questions at two at a time. So, who pushes the button first? I look around. Martin R&#xF6;diger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two questions. First, on goodwill, for National Starch it's now 2.5 billion. We've seen yesterday Akzo Nobel has done a huge write off on goodwill, how do you see the risk for a substantial write off on goodwill as an impairment for National Starch? Second question is on the target for 2012 of 14% EBIT margin and, just for clarification, the amortization charges of 12.25 or 46 million a year. Do we have to deduct that from the EBIT margin or is that a clean figure, the 14% EBIT margin target for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the special depreciation that Akzo has taken. It is not entirely clear as to what exactly that refers to and what the basis for it is. What we have seen in the communication is that they have taken the charge on the business that they have acquired and on the business which they wanted to divest but couldn't. So, from our perspective, before I get into our own situation, I think there may be some likelihood that does refer to, at least in significant parts, to the business, which they wanted to divest but could not for market reasons and that maybe good reason for writing off some of the goodwill.</p>
          <p>With respect to our situation, we have very carefully reviewed the cash generating units to which the National Starch business pertains. And the way it works is that we have integrated the National Starch businesses into the cash generating units at the Henkel legacy business to which that particular business pertains, where we had very little goodwill. So, therefore, through the amalgamation of the businesses that we have acquired, and those that we had before, we have, the result was that we have a pretty significant buffer against goodwill impairment.</p>
          <p>So, from the perspective of the analysis that we have undertaken, towards the end of last year, there was not only no reason but certainly it was impossible for us to do any special depreciation. And that's the situation, as far as we are concerned, for the time being. You also know that this is a long-term view; it's not just one quarter that may go down, resulting in the necessity for a write off. It's the long-term growth rates that are being applied for calculating the residual values. And therefore, for the time being, we remain at the level that we have communicated with respect to no, not only no need but no reason for the special write-off.</p>
          <p>Relating to the second question, I should start out by saying National Starch is not an excuse for not making the number, but the opportunity to make the number. If you take the PPA, the PPA is an annualized basis 48 million. You then go back and do a ballpark. That means it's between two and 3% of the EBIT that should be generated in 2012. So, we see it as being part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next, Harold Thompson and then I will come to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Harold Thompson, Deutsche Bank, just two questions. First of all on Thomas's presentation, which I thought was excellent and very realistic. You refer that you got all the tools to outperform the market growth rates, in a way, in terms of growth and profits. What did the market growth rate in your industry, do you believe, did in Q4 and how do you think that will pan out across 2009? And the reason I ask that is because the inventory de-loading, restocking and so on will have material impacts on the market growth rates and that's why I'd like to know your insight there.</p>
          <p>And the second question is one on costs. Clearly a lot of belt-tightening on the admin cost line in Q4. How much of it is sustainable? Because it meaningfully helped your short-term profitability. And how much of it is, we can assume will go on at that rate through 2009, you can only cancel your Christmas party once?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with respect to the market, I mean, we think that what we have seen in terms of our declines in Q4, this is pretty much what the market has done. I don't think we have lost or gained market share in Q4 in any considerable way. So, I think everybody in the industry will have seen a quite similar pattern of customers who were actually quite short-term beginning to shutdown factories or to begin to lower their inventories.</p>
          <p>Now, with respect to 2009, I mean, we have given you the view that it's very difficult to make a forecast on that. And I don't think I want to change that at that stage because the difficulty is every time you speak to a customer this week what his forecast will be for the next month, you can be sure next week he revises it, right, and at the moment most of them to the wrong side. And unless that has come to more stability, it is very, very difficult to give a serious forecast of where the market is going. And I just can't see us at a point in time at the moment for the big regions like Western Europe or North America to have reached some degree of stability as of yet.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, definitely inventories in the industry are beginning to go down. We have not so much visibility on inventories, we have spotty visibility in some customers and on some segments more than in others. But really this is what customers have told us before Christmas as they are managing their inventories because everybody is, like us, concerned at what cost do you have inventory and what do you explain to your bank. I mean that's maybe not like us but many of our customers have to do that and that was one of the reasons why we have seen the downturn to happen so quickly in the fourth quarter, that people were very concerned about not just the volumes of their business but also on their balance sheet. And we've seen that come through. And I just can't see at the moment a fundamental change to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the cost topic, first of all we had, when going into Q4, targeted an additional 25 million of savings that we wanted to realize. We ended up with a much higher amount, actually more than, more closer to 50 million, which we have been able to realize, some of which is clearly not reoccurring. I'll give you one example, that's the curtailment gains that we've realized and that's about 13 million, so that's one item which is not a reoccurring item.</p>
          <p>Now, others which we would, under normal circumstances, not continue because, referring to the multimillion dollar Christmas events that we usually take, that's far further out but there are other elements such as training, some of the travel that you have to do in a global company, you cannot just use the telephone and the video, although it can go a long way, but it's not entirely possible. So there are a number of things which, under normal circumstances, we would want to go back to because of the special efforts that we have undertaken in the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our best estimate of what is reoccurring is that we think that maybe 25, 30 million is none, is one or the other could be continued without having too much of a negative impact on the business, but that's kind of a guesstimate and it also depends to some extent on how our markets evolve. In other words, if we see continued weakness in Asia we obviously do need less of an effort and can reduce our cost base there as well.</p>
          <p>So, it's a moving target to some extent. We've been very proud that we've been able to realize that amount of savings, which we've never done before in the history of this company so that's been a huge effort and part of it certainly is nonrecurring. But we also watch all markets evolving and we will respond to market downturns, some of which you have heard already in the adhesives sector where we need to respond again through more aggressive cost-cutting measures, which also eventually may take the form of more structural measures, rather than just short-term cost cutting.  That's further out, that needs more preparation but that's certainly an area where we will need to look into.</p>

          <p>We go now to Carmel <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carmel <mark type="inaudible" /> Unicredit. My first question is concerning the liquidity situation and the debt situation. At the end of 2008, there was still a short-term debt portion of 1.9, 1.8, 1.9 billion so obviously refinancing has to be negotiated this year. Maybe you could give us some details referring to how you intend to do this, and about the credit lines which you have? The second question is referring to the rating commitment, debt was reduced a lot in the fourth quarter, but the question is whether this was enough to maintain the ratings at A3 and A minus and, as far as I remember, you have a rating commitment for the A rating range, is this still valid? Yeah, that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the short-term debt, that's composed of a number of different items, which is, among others, so called bank loans that we have. We have a pretty large portfolio of bank loans in many countries, which result from some specific situations in that particular country. In some situations, it's cheaper to get the bank loan there rather than doing the usual financing through the parent company. In other situations it is, by local law, just not permissible to do this, so there are many reasons why we have the short-term bank loans, that's about 700 million.</p>
          <p>We have also a remaining level of commercial paper which is pretty low, actually is only 200 million. We have also bank loans, we have related proxy loans, that's about 600 million and I think the major part that's amounts to the 1.8 billion that you were referring to, commercial paper. The bridge loan also qualifies as short-term borrowing by the way and that's a big part of the 1.6 billion. Simply because the initial expiration is in end of March, but we have an option to extend by another year, so that's not something which needs to be refinanced in 2009.</p>
          <p>Some of the short-term loans currently do not pose any problems, particularly the commercial paper market is very liquid. It seems to me that liquidity in the market is abundant, that's not a problem. The real question is what is the price of it and therefore for the time being, with the rating that we have, and that answers question number two, we're committed to the rating. We've always been committed to the rating and that continues, so that's one of our important parts, one of the important parts of our finance strategy.</p>
          <p>We are committed to the rating, to the category, as you know, but that remains our strong conviction that this is providing us the flexibility and access to financing that we need in order to survive even a short-term credit crunch or whatever might occur later this year. So, from that perspective, we have still large room in terms of liquidity because we have behind the commercial paper, which we have utilized only 200 million, we have 2.1 billion backup lines, so there is 1.9 billion technically available, which we have not utilized and we still have some cash in the balance sheet, as you have seen.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we are in a very comfortable situation in terms of liquidity, in terms of the expiration of the loans or the bonds that we have. We don't expect anything that needs to be refinanced in a major aspect until 2010 or even much later, so from that perspective 2009 in terms of finance, liquidity, that looks very good to us.</p>

So two questions, firstly to start, when do you expect to see this year the first benefits from the raw material price declines? That's my first question, and the second question, are you planning or have you already experienced some price declines or price cuts asked by your clients, most of all in the industrial adhesives business?

          <p>First question, first impact from the raw materials, we should see that immediately, as you've obviously observed, Henkel, in detail, over a longer period of time, you know that we have seen the big increase in the oil price towards the middle of last year which then just fell over the cliff. Ever since we have been pounding on our suppliers to reduce purchase prices, so, therefore, we do expect that we get significant reductions in the average in this year and certainly beginning as early as the first quarter. With respect to the price cuts, I may hand over to, I guess, Thomas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, yes we see, first, reduction in material prices come in, but they do not go across the board of our raw materials. In some categories, they are more visible than in others. Of course, we see customers coming back to us and ask for lower prices because that's what everybody does at the moment, it's a difficult time, so that's what you do with your suppliers.</p>
          <p>I don't think we have, to date, given in too much on that, but as we do not expect to keep the full benefit of the price, raw material price declines on all P&amp;L as we couldn't get &#x2013; we didn't get the full burden, because we basically passed on the price increase last year and we have shown you that we have increased the prices by 4.1% throughout the last year, the price level we had in December was actually 5% above the price level of December 2007.</p>
          <p>So, we were pretty successful in getting pricing from our customers and we would expect that at least some of that we will need to concede as we see a more stabilized decline in raw material prices going forward, but we are very prudent on that. And much of that depends on what competition does also, I mean, I have to say.</p>

          <p>Yes, can I ask two questions please? In the annual report on the adhesives line, you are breaking down the margin between the consumer and the industrial business for the full year. So I was wondering if you can maybe do the same thing for the fourth quarter? And maybe comment a little bit on how the two sides have developed in terms of growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And the other question I had was on Eastern Europe, whether all three of you can maybe tell us a little bit what you are seeing in terms of trend levels on the consumer level and with the retailer?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, break down consumer and industrial, that was a requirement or is a requirement from our auditors. It's not our favorite pet child, so we will not provide more information than absolutely necessary and that's all we needed to provide. This is not the way we run our business, so that's been mandated, we don't want to even get into the detail of it because for us that's an artificial distinction which doesn't make any sense, but we are required to do it, so we do it. We will not provide any more detail because that's not the way we run our business, we run our business, Thomas Geitner is running this as an integrated consumer and industrial business and therefore that's the way we look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the brief comment, per business group, how you see the situation in Eastern Europe?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shorter comment on this, concerning cosmetics, different issues, I think what you also saw in Q4 is still some good growth, but issues are, as you can imagine, doing business, in some countries, with distributors, where we have to be very careful concerning money collection and this has a priority on sales. And the topic which I think also for you is not new is that the whole transaction cost at the moment with all currencies in this region of course is also something which is a challenge to us.</p>
          <p>Quite similar picture when it comes to detergent. Eastern Europe will not be a gross issue, there will be still gross, but currency will be the topic transaction losses and how to deal with our customers and distributors. So I fully share hands combined points on this.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, in adhesives we have basically three sectors that we are serving in Eastern Europe, the one is consumer which has grown pretty well over the last two years which we think is trading quite well. Then we have building, which has been the growth engine for adhesives over the last two or three years, we expect a significant slowdown actually potentially some decline there, because in some countries the construction industry in Eastern Europe is beginning to suffer for financing. We haven't seen much of that come through to us, but there are first signs that it might go slower. And, in the industrial sector we don't see much change of dynamic there. It was gradually building up and it's at the moment there are no big change in terms of our outlook in Eastern Europe on the industrial side, I mean, I think the biggest exposure to the exchanges in Eastern Europe we have on building.</p>

          <p>Okay, who takes the last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Philipp Frey of Sal. Oppenheim. A bit on, well you had excellent Home Care business in the fourth quarter, your expectations on promotional activity and pricing pressure going into the first quarter. And well, as a second question to Mr. Geitner, well, if I am getting your comments right you are certainly hinting that there is a substantial further deterioration of adhesive growth rates in the first quarter ahead with customers reducing weekly their expectations. Could you a bit comment on that as well, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me start with Home Care. It was pretty tough to increase our prices in the fourth quarter and a bit also be pretty tough to keep the price level in the first quarter. This will very much depend on the future development of the markets. Pressure from freight side is already a reality, but we proved and demonstrated to have strong brands and a strong pricing power, this will be the name of the game.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the risk of sounding rude, but with the intent not to be and I mean that very politely, we've given the guidance that we would like to give for 2009 at this stage.</p>
          <p>In closing, let me just add a couple of comments to the year gone by, and I think it's important and I have said this on a number of occasions, that you look upon 2008, as a 12 month year, not a two month year, and I mean that very deliberately because it was a year with three points of growth in the first half from a global GDP standpoint and zero in the second half. And I think if you only evaluate the progress in 2008 based on the last two months, you get a distorted picture, because the year also, compared with other years also had 12 months.</p>
          <p>So let me just go back and reflect on a couple of the items that had an impact and has made changes to Henkel in the past year. We had on the management level, the retirement of Ulrich Lehner and Alois Linder and we had Thomas Geitner joining our Board. We had the acquisition of National Starch in April. We announced our Global Excellence program as one of the first companies in our industry and definitely within the decks in the first quarter last year we announced as one of the very first companies, our cost chase program in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We executed the Ecolab transaction as one of the few transactions on the U.S. last year. We defined and communicated our business strategy and targets for next year, and as a sideline, we also ran our business in 2008. What we did do also is and that is what we ask you to put into consideration, we did execute what we said we would do. We've been very prudent in managing our business in 2008. We have taken appropriate measures in 2008, at various stages in 2008, and we've taken decisions that have been harsher than we've been willing to take in the past. You have the commitment from our management team sitting here that we will continue that management style and act prudently and accordingly in 2009.</p>
          <p>We believe having long-term targets is very important in a market that is short-term volatile. That doesn't mean that we are not short-term accountable, we are accountable short-term and long-term, and we will take appropriate actions in the short-term, but it is also very important for us that we keep the long-term view. And with this, we believe, we've done the initial homework. I'm not saying the homework, the initial homework. We'll continue to do our homework as articulated on previous meetings to get us to where we need to get in 2009 we are committed to do so.</p>
          <p>We see '09 as being a difficult year, difficult due to lack of transparency, also difficult due to a high level of uncertainty. And, you can argue, what is the biggest problem is it uncertainty or is it the real thing, but the combination of both is making the overall climate in 2009 challenging. We will operate within that climate and with a level of prudency that we need to operate within. And, as Thomas rightly said, we see 2009 being a step in the right direction that will give us a number of opportunities and longer term put the company at a better position.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Lothar.</p>

          <p>As usual, we try to keep you a little bit longer here, and invite you to join us for a drink at the other end of the overhead bridge. It's an unusual year ahead of us and it's unusual occasion for you to say goodbye to Pierre Brusselmans, who is due to retire at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Pierre Brusselmans is retiring from finance, which I believe is something which he never thought he would end up in. He joined Henkel, only 37 years ago and Henkel Belgium in the Cosmetics Department. And he has gone through all the Henkel businesses on his way finally to culminate in the Finance Department.</p>
          <p>He has been in the Detergent Division at Henkel Belgium. He has been running Henkel Belgium as General Manager. He has been General Manager of Henkel Benelux, which is Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, and eventually took over a role as Head of Consumer Adhesives coming then to D&#xFC;sseldorf. From that, he was well trained and well equipped to move into finance in 2002 and ever since he has been perhaps a bit of a colorful bird in finance, but certainly a very valuable addition for us.</p>
          <p>I am sure, he have enjoyed his presentations, his information and the way he has been approaching communication through the capital markets. He's always had a much more marketing-oriented approach than all of us at finance, and we've learned a great deal of him. So, therefore, we are very grateful for the contributions that he has made. It's not the farewell speech because there is going to be another one, a longer one, but just for you to give you the opportunity to say hello, farewell to Pierre when we rejoin on the other side of the bridge for today, ahead of another challenge this year.</p>
          <p>Thank you and good-bye.</p>
