          <p>Thank you, Christie and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Occidental Petroleum's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call from Los Angeles this morning are Dr. Ray Irani, Oxy's Chairman and CEO; Steve Chazen, our President and CFO. Also joining us are Bill Albrecht, President of Oxy's U.S. Oil and Gas operations; and Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas Business.</p>
          <p>In just a moment, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Irani to discuss some the high points regarding the third quarter as well as developing opportunities which we expect to add to our growth over time. Steve Chazen will then review our third quarter and nine months 2009 financial results also talk about some of our recent acquisition activity as well as provide an update on Oxy's Kern County California discovery and our California exploration activity.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter earnings press release, investor relations supplemental schedules and conference call presentation slides which refer to Steve's remarks can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Irani. Dr. Irani, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. This morning, I will give you brief highlights of a few of the positive developments at Oxy during the last quarter. Steve Chazen will provide financial highlights and details shortly.</p>
          <p>Our worldwide oil and gas production for the 2009 third quarter was nearly 7% higher than the third quarter last year. A significant portion of the domestic increase is from our new discovery in Kern County, California, which we announced last quarter.</p>
          <p>In the new discovery area, we currently have gross production of approximately 26,000 BOE per day, which is 8,700 BOE per day more than we reported to you last quarter. We continue to be excited about Oxy's growth potential in California.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we also achieved production growth in the Middle East region, mainly from our operations in Oman and the Dolphin project. We continue to see opportunity in the Middle East and it's a region in which we expect further growth.</p>
          <p>In the next few weeks, we will launch a joint operating company to manage the development and production of the Bahrain Field. As you know, with Bahrain's national oil company, and Mubadala of Abu Dhabi who are teaming to dramatically increase the field's oil production from 30,000 barrels a day to 100,000 barrels a day. In addition, gas production is also expected to increase 50% to 2.5 Bcf during the term of the contract. Oxy's net proved reserve additions over the life of the project are estimated to be 450 million BOE.</p>
          <p>And as announced last week, Oxy is part of an Eni-led consortium that has been awarded the license for development of the giant Zubair oil field in Iraq. Iraq holds the world's second largest reserves of oil, with about 115 billion barrels, second only to Saudi Arabia. Iraq officials have said that they plan to increase the country's oil production from the current level of about 2.2 million barrels a day to over 10 million barrels of oil. We are now one of the few companies on the ground floor of this world-class opportunity.</p>
          <p>The Zubair field has significant proven reserves, estimated at more than 4.2 billion barrels, and current production of 195,000 barrels of oil a day. Development of Zubair will be a multi-year, multi-phased project with production expected to reach a plateau of more than 1 million barrels a day during the next six years. We expect Oxy's net share of peak production from the field to be about 90,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>The Zubair project will give us the opportunity to learn, evaluating each phase of the project and give us the insight to effectively evaluate future developments in Iraq. We hope to expand our position over time and continue our involvement in Iraq, while meeting our standards for security and rate of return.</p>
          <p>I now would like to turn the meeting over to Steve Chazen to give you our third quarter and year-to-date financial results in greater detail.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ray. Net income was $927 million in the third quarter, compared with 2.3 billion in last year's third quarter. Here is the segment breakdown for the third quarter. Oil and gas third quarter 2009 segment earnings were $1.5 billion, compared to 3.6 billion for the third quarter of 2008. The $2.1 billion decrease in the third quarter was due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Occidental's average realized crude price in 2009 third quarter was $62.79 per barrel, a decrease of 40% from the $104.15 per barrel in the comparable period last year. Oxy's domestic average realized gas price for the quarter was $3.04 per MCF, compared with $9.35 per MCF last year.</p>
          <p>Worldwide oil and gas sales volume for the third quarter of 2009 were 628,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, an increase of nearly 7% compared with 588,000 BOE a day in the third quarter of last year. Increase includes 22,000 BOE per day from domestic operations, 16,000 BOE per day from Oman, 10,000 BOE a day from Dolphin, partially offset by 8,000 BOE a day in lower volumes from Argentina.</p>
          <p>The domestic volume increases occurred in California and the Permian. The California production increase was largely a result of new wells in the Kern County discovery we announced last quarter.</p>
          <p>Middle East included higher production in Oman and higher production sharing volumes compared to last year's third quarter. The Argentine decrease includes 9,000 BOE a day loss from the strike in Santa Cruz in the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Third quarter of 2009 worldwide oil and gas sales volumes decreased 3% or 21,000 BOE a day from the second quarter of 2009 of 649,000 BOE a day. Dolphin volumes were lower by 10,000 BOE a day, resulting mainly from higher catch-up cost recovery volumes in the second quarter. Argentina volumes decreased by 7,000 BOE a day due in large part to the Santa Cruz strike. Qatar and Libya volumes declined by 8,000 BOE a day due to the timing of liftings.</p>
          <p>Midcontinent and Rockies volumes were lower by 4,000 BOE a day, which reflects the natural decline in gas production. California volumes increased 8,000 BOE a day largely the result of new wells in the Kern County discovery.</p>
          <p>Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter in line with our guidance of 50 million. Oil and gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.27 a barrel for the first nine months of this year, a 15% decline from last year's 12 month costs of $12.13 a barrel. In the third quarter of 2009, oil and gas cash production costs were $10.15 per barrel, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2009's run rate.</p>
          <p>Taxes, other than on income, were $1.75 a barrel for the first nine months of 2009, compared with $2.62 a barrel for all of 2008. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect lower crude oil and gas prices in the first nine months of this year. In the third quarter of 2009, these taxes decreased to $1.73 a barrel compared to the second quarter of 2009 rate of a $1.82, due to reductions in the 2009 to 2010 property taxes.</p>
          <p>Chemicals segment earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $72 million, compared to 219 million in last year's third quarter. The third quarter 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in the US housing, automotive and durable goods sectors, resulting in lower margins for caustic soda, polyvinyl chloride and lower volumes for chorine, caustic soda, potassium hydroxide and polyvinyl chloride.</p>
          <p>Midstream segment earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $77 million compared to 66 million in the third quarter of 2008. The increase in earnings was due to higher margins in the marketing business, partially offset by lower NGL realized prices in the gas processing business.</p>
          <p>The worldwide effective tax rate was $37 million &#x2013; 37% in the third quarter of 2009, compared with our guidance of 40 to 42. The decrease in rate reflects tax benefits resulting from our relinquishment of international exploration contracts and a higher proportion of expected total year domestic source free tax income. Occidental generally records no tax benefits on foreign expense exploration until the lease is relinquished.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to Oxy's performance during the first nine months. Net income was $2 billion the first nine months of this year compared to 6.4 billion last year. Capital spending for the third quarter of 2009 was 746 million and 2.6 billion for the first nine months. We currently anticipate total year 2009 capital spending to be 3.7 billion. The $100 million increase from our last estimate is allocated to domestic Oil and Gas operations. Portions of the increase will be used to complete 130 previously drilled wells in the Piceance basin. This work will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010 and is expected to add about 40 million a day to our production.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations for the nine months of 2009 was $3.8 billion. We used 2.6 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures and 600 million on acquisitions and foreign bonuses. These items amounted to 3.2 billion of cash use. We also used 794 million to pay dividends and in the third quarter we used 691 million to retire senior debt maturities which was funded from the second quarter issuance of $750 million of senior notes due in 2016.</p>
          <p>These and other net cash outflows decreased our $1.8 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $200 million, to 1.6 billion at the end of this past quarter. Third quarter free cash flows after capital spending, dividends and taxes, but before financing and acquisition activities was about $700 million.</p>
          <p>As a result of the reduction in debt in the third quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio came down to 9% which is the same level reported last year. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the nine months was 811.1 million and weighted average diluted shares were 813.9 million.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect oil and gas sales volumes to increase to about 650,000, 660,000 BOE a day, at around current prices. The fourth quarter production is expected to reflect increases from California, Argentina and the Middle East / North Africa.</p>
          <p>With regard to prices, at current prices, a $1 a barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $39 million. The average third quarter WTI oil price was $68.30, and NYMEX gas price was 3.60 per MCF, a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas price has a $23 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $5 per MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $100 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.</p>
          <p>For the Chemical segment, we expect continued weakness in the U.S. housing, automotive, durable goods sectors in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is traditionally the weakest quarter for this business.</p>
          <p>Chemical earnings for the fourth quarter expect to be between 20 and $40 million as opposed to breakeven level we had estimated last quarter. We expect increases in chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride prices. These increases are not expected to fully offset the higher feedstock and energy costs.</p>
          <p>We expect our combined worldwide tax rate for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 40 to 42%, depending on our split between domestic and foreign sourced income. Our third quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplement.</p>
          <p>Turning now to acquisitions, last month we announced the acquisition of Phibro from Citigroup for a price that approximates the liquidation value of Phibro's assets. As of the most recent information, the vast majority of Phibro's assets consist of cash and marketable securities. The exact amount of the purchase price will be determined at closing which is expected this quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect that our investment in Phibro will average about $250 million depending upon their cash needs from time-to-time. They will operate as a stand-alone entity while our current trading operations will continue selling our physical production. Our policies on hedging and risk management of our physical production remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Phibro has an extensive system of risk controls which will be overseen by Occidental employees. The quality of Phibro's risk controls and management can be seen by the lack of any losing years since 1997 when they were bought by Citi. With time we expect to use Phibro's excellent reputation in the Middle East and elsewhere to enhance our position in the region.</p>
          <p>Property acquisition activity has picked up recently. We expect to close several hundred million dollars of property acquisitions in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to California exploration. Excluding the Kern County discovery discussed in last quarter's conference call, over the course of little over a year we have drilled 36 exploration wells seeking non-traditional hydrocarbon zones in California. Of these wells, 11 are commercial and 10 are currently being evaluated. We expect to drill an additional 7 exploration wells this year. Oxy holds 1.1 million acres of net of fee minerals and leasehold in California which have been acquired in the last few years to exploit these opportunities. Discoveries similar to the Kern County discovery are possible in this net acreage position. Additionally, we'll continue to pursue shale production which is expected to produce oil on this acreage.</p>
          <p>The Kern County discovery which is near Elk Hills is not below any producing zones. In this area, we are currently producing from 10 wells approximately 105 million cubic feet of gas a day and 8,500 barrels of liquids a day which is 8,700 BOE a day higher production than we disclosed last quarter.</p>
          <p>Cumulative gross production since the start of production to the end of September has been 8.5 Bcf of gas, and 765,000 barrels of liquids. All of this production comes from conventional zones. While there is oil production from shale zones in this area, the bulk of the future production will come from conventional wells.</p>
          <p>During 2009 we expect to drill an additional 11 wells. In the next two quarters, the focus of our drilling will be on oil wells as we seek to further define the oil zone. Copies of this press release and our quarterly earnings are available on our website or through the SEC's EDGAR system.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to see if you could elaborate on a few things with respect to your Kern County activity. One being on Elk Hills, you've disclosed previously that you're going to bump up against some processing capacity limits there. Can you update us with respect to the timing of expansion and the likely cost, and at what point might we start to flatten out in terms of the California production growth as that becomes a bottleneck? Or can you keep growing for the next few quarters without that being a limiting factor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still have some more room in our facilities in gas handling. At the current rate of growth obviously we're probably going to run out some time. But we have plans to bring skid mounted facilities in to handle the gas. We're also slowing down some of the less economic activities in the Elk Hills area, to create more room for this. We don't have any idea -- we can't tell you how big the facility is at this point, since we still have a fair number of unknowns about how much gas we're going to need to process. So that's part of -- one of the delays is we just don't know how big a plant to build.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The numbers we told you last week maybe a little low. So I think where we are as far as the growth that we would expect, continued growth for a few more quarters. We just don't know at this point where it's going to wind up. It continues to do extremely well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And then as you shift your focus more towards the oily of the wells, you've been of course around two-thirds gas so far, any expectation for average well productivity? It's been quite strong with the gas-weighted wells. Do you expect a similar rate of production on say, a barrel of oil equivalent basis, even with the oil wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The oil zone is fundamentally less -- has less permeability than the gas zone. Gas zone is a very permeable zone. The oil zone is a little less. But again, of course you're getting a little more money for the oil on a BOE basis than you get for gas so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It probably will turn out to be more economic to drill the oil wells right now than the gas wells. But the gas wells are very prolific as you can see. We could probably boost the production in the gas wells even further from existing wells, if we open it up further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Can I pin you down on a number in terms of barrels per day from an oil well in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It varies considerably. We have some wells that are making several thousand a day of oil, and some wells that are less productive, so a few hundred barrels a day. So there's a fair amount of variation between the wells. And that's why we're focusing on it over the next couple quarters so that we can figure out where the better parts are. It's a little more complicated than the gas zone, which is fairly easy to engineer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to follow-up on the last line of questions on Kern County. Last quarter you disclosed the resource estimate of 150 to 250 million barrels from six wells. And as you've delineated the field with four additional wells, how big do you think the resource could be today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't really want to go into reengineering every quarter. You've got the wrong conference call I think for that. So I think we'll hold with this range for now and we'll update you as the rest of the year progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as you continue to step out, are you seeing pretty consistent well productivity or are results tapering off a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The gas wells continue to perform, gas condensate wells continue to perform extremely well. And so we don't see any tapering there. Oil, a little more variable but that was built into our models. So I don't see any reason to monkey with the estimates at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just moving to the Permian, over the last couple of quarters you've spent less and less capital but this quarter you saw a sequential uptick in production. Are you doing anything differently in the Permian or have you been able to selectively add producing properties over the last six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've added some properties. Capital's being deployed a little more efficiently. So I think we're getting clearly more bang for our buck. And I think some of this you're seeing as a result of last year's program that's sort of flowing through. So I think you've got a little more selective investment this year, a little bit of acquisitions, and something from last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. One other thing I would like to add to that is that we've increased our CO2 purchases by about 100 million a day or so, and we're starting to see some additional response from our increased CO2 injections.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's good color. Thank you. Just one last follow-up. When you talked earlier, Steve, about making further acquisitions with, is that also in the Permian or can you give us a little bit of context where?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>There's some deals that we have agreed to and some that are still in the advanced tire kicking phase, so there's no real color at this point. We just want to alert you to the fact that the activity had picked up in our traditional areas, so it's basically going to be California and the Permian.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got a few things here that increase your volumes outlook, I guess. Could I ask you a couple specifics about the Middle East and then a more general one? The specifics you said I think 30,000 a day in Bahrain to 100 but didn't give a timeframe and then you also mentioned Iraq to 1 million growth over the next six years.  I wondered when you expected the first oil there. And the wider more general question is will you be upgrading your volume forecast? I think you're up 5 to 8% guidance, I wondered if there was upward pressure on those numbers based on what you're saying today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start one by one. With regards to Bahrain, you will see production next year starting in January, actually. So there will be production showing up from Bahrain in 2010 and increasing over time as we develop the field. So that's one.</p>
          <p>With regards to the Iraq development, it's going to be in test track. Now, we haven't yet signed the agreement totally, so we have to get the agreement buttoned down. The agreement has to be approved by the Council of Administers and then by Parliament where we don't expect in any of those a problem, but you know, when you're dealing with any kind of government, particularly a place like Iraq, you can't predict when exactly it's going to happen.</p>
          <p>They're anxious to move ahead. They need the money over-simplified, because the U.S. cannot just keep banking the Iraqi Government even their social programs or in their defense and security agencies. So we talked about over the next six years, because we didn't want to get into yet predicting quarter-by-quarter what's going to happen. So I doubt that you're going to see any meaningful production out of Iraq showing up on Oxy next year, but I think 2011 you will start seeing and it'll build up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then the overall volume target I believe is 5 to 8% growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll stay with the 5 to 8% overall target for now. As we develop our plans for the next couple years, we'll update you probably next quarter as to where we think we're going the next couple years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then my second, if I could. Just wondering about Phibro, how's that going to appear in the earnings? Is it going to be better realizations, is it going to be a certain line, it is going to be corporate and other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's going to go in Midstream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it will be hidden within the Midstream results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think hidden is probably not the right word, placed in there. It's the same &#x2013; there's a fair amount of volatility in Midstream already but it's clearly not a corporate and other item.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I were &#x2013; without being &#x2013; I really don't know. But I would put in sort of 100 million after tax per year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess the guidance or least the fact of what they've earned over the past five years was more like 300, and I think it was $375 million per year?</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just to follow up on Iraq. I believe you said 4.2 billion barrels opportunity. Do you have an estimated CapEx either gross or net to get to those reserves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, this is a production sharing agreement, Arjun, and if you look over the life of the contract you get large numbers. The way the contract is, which I don't want to go into great detail, has a good feature on cost recovery in the beginning of the contract. So actually the exposure in terms of risk capital is fairly limited. And as we said, it's a multi-phase project so we'd be learning as we go on. But it does have a good cost recovery in it and most important, I can tell you that the project we believe will meet our hurdle rate in terms of rate of returns, any way you want to look at it, IRR, return on capital employed.</p>
          <p>So Iraq as we have said before is a huge basin. We got one of the most productive fields. Few companies, mostly larger than us, are in there. BP as you know got in. There are others vying for West Qurna and we feel that our participation in Iraq will be useful and profitable for the company and its shareholders long-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dr. Irani, thank you for that color. It is an existing producing field as you mentioned. And the cost recovery and the production sharing contract, that's very interesting that this has that. I assume because it's producing, you will get to &#x2013; initially get some production and cash flow, unlike many fields where you have to wait four or five years for the CapEx to be spent and the production to come on, and I assume it's the increment over what it's producing now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You get your cost recovery from production above the current production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can't take something they're producing already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the fact is, I mean, when we say over 4.2 billion barrels in total, we believe there's more. And there's a lot of opportunities. I mean, this is the heart of the oilfields in Iraq, close to export ports. It's right next to the Southern Oil Company, which is currently doing most of the production and operated by the Iraqis. It would be cooperating with that. And the cost recovery feature and the tax rate, which has been improved, makes this project attractive. I mean, just the reserves and the opportunities long-term are overwhelming and we feel that we will participate without undue risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's really helpful. If I could try a final one, you've already been very helpful and I appreciate it. The press will widely report that companies will get paid two or somewhere around $2 a barrel. Should we think of that as more the profit oil type per barrel metric and as a cost recovery measure or is that just mixing up a whole bunch of terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really don't want to get into the details of all of that. I mean, clearly we know what we are negotiating from. What I want to share with you, the project will meet our hurdle rates for projects overseas.</p>

          <p>Couple of questions, Steve. I'm going to kick-off with Iraq, just to follow-on from Arjun if I may. The CapEx budget that's been talked about, $10 billion in the first six years is what Eni is talking about. You haven't said what your share of that's likely to be, can you give us an idea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the shares are still being negotiated among the different folks and we're going to share part of our share probably with Abu Dhabi and there may be others coming along, so we don't know what Eni is going to share numbers with who. I think you're looking at Oxy's in the 25 to 30% range.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Got it. If I could jump over to California, in the last conference call you suggested, Steve, that you hadn't yet seen any decline rate on the wells. Is that still the case?</p>

          <p>Great stuff. And the final one from me, just then jumping again around the world back to Bahrain. First, though, I guess when you sign the agreement when things are in place, is there a fixed margin on the base production and then a PSE on the increment?

But the returns in Bahrain are attractive. Again, as you recall, the partners, Oxy 48%; Mubadala of Abu Dhabi 32%, Government of Bahrain is 20%, the production sharing agreement, there are fees for current production, the PSA for production above the current production. I'm telling you that the returns will be a factor.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you, Steve. At the moment, we're still in the process of having our development plans negotiated and approved. So we expect to have that in the middle of next year. As Steve points out, most of the activity at the moment is getting ready for new exploration.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then just you also talked about ramping up I guess in the Piceance basin next year. Can you talk about the economics you're seeing there and are you looking at the forward curve or are you looking at kind of lower cost structures in that basin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're going to complete these wells that we already drilled and they'll be on early next year. Based on the current, call it the forward curve, if you will, we would probably start ramping one rig up early next year and begin actually drilling wells early next year. If the curve holds, we'll put a second well, second rig to work in the middle of next year.</p>
          <p>So we think that the -- while we're not as buoyant as some about gas, gas prices, the gas market, the current curve would allow us to drill profitably in the Piceance. We reduced costs considerably in the last few months as we've been down, so we worked on that to see if we can get our operating costs down. I think we've been successful with that. And drilling costs have come down with more efficient rigs that we have there. I think we're in pretty good shape, but obviously $4 gas is not a &#x2013; it doesn't work at $4 gas but as we pass $5 and get to 6, I think we're excited about the opportunities there. Should be a fair amount of production next year from it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My questions on Iraq have been pretty much answered. But maybe you can tell us what you think were the advantages you brought to the party that got you a position in Iraq relative to the other competition?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our very strong position in the Middle East, if you fly to Baghdad, which I did recently, you can see it doesn't take long to fly from Baghdad to Oman or Abu Dhabi or any of those other places. We have a strong position. We've performed in every country we have taken and so very strong operational record that we have. Sandy, who is on the phone with me, has done a fantastic job. The Iraqis are very interested in having the production increase fast, of course that depends on the security situation and many other things. So, frankly, it's just our record in the region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in the enhanced oil recovery business. That's sort of what we do. As far as the project itself is concerned, putting aside anything else, I mean, this is sort of what we do. We say we're in the Middle East. We say we don't take exploration risk, exploration risk. We do say we take engineering risk which is to say we think it's going to cost $100 or cost 200 but we think this is manageable there. So it is sort of what we do. And it's a big opportunity over time and I think the exposure here is modest for the Company and if it craters the exposure's pretty low. So I think if you just viewed it as exploration it would be an attractive risk return ratio.</p>

          <p>You can view the production there as in three pieces at this point. An oil zone, a gas condensate zone and then the shales. We're not talking about the shales because compared to the rest, it's &#x2013; while it's real nice, compared to the rest it doesn't have the kind of impact. So a classic oil zone, a gas &#x2013; classic &#x2013; actually gas condensate zone and the shales.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in focusing on the oil zone, you've had pretty robust production from the gas zones and you mentioned economics on those last quarter. Is there any reason why you wouldn't dedicate one of those rigs or add another rig to continue to drill on the gas zones, given the strong economics there?</p>

          <p>We're drilling another gas well as we look to extend the size of the field, the aerial extent that we believe is there. The oil is really &#x2013; we know the gas is there, so the oil is really more profitable right now.</p>

          <p>It's been there for millennia, so I expect that it will last for another six months. The wells are draining &#x2013; are pulling a sizable area without any decline, so we're really not in any real hurry on the gas, but we are continuing to build out that &#x2013; the gas zone to see how big it is because we need to figure out how big a plant to build.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to follow up on the California. I recognize that the conventional discoveries are the priority near-term, but I wanted to get a little bit more color on the shale zones. Have you, over the past three quarters drilling, become more positive regarding the prospectivity of that play? It sounds like you may, given some of the comments on the slide and &#x2013; what economics or what oil price is required to make the shale play out there viable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's really changed. We've always been pretty positive. The drilling results sit well with our models. So I don't think &#x2013; we've always been fairly bullish about it, so I don't &#x2013; that's why we- initially, that's why we went into the big acreage position was really for the shales. What oil price, I don't really know, $25.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly current price is very profitable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't cost that much to drill and they're reasonably productive. So I &#x2013; it's hard to say what the exact oil price is. Remember, most of this, there's no royalty either.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you wind up with pretty good economics. So I wouldn't worry about us losing some for price, but I think that it's just a matter of how fast you want to develop it and also looking out for our acreage position to make sure we have acquired everything that we need to acquire as we go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the conventional play, you mentioned that some of the additional discoveries have been smaller. Are there -- I guess it's hard to identify prospects on seismic floor, but do you anticipate drilling any larger prospects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It just takes a while to clear, to get your permits and that sort of thing because we didn't really start the permitting process until recently. It just takes longer to get ready. So, there really isn't any real order to it. We're looking for more of this and we'll continue to do that. And we'll drill them when we get the permits and we're ready to go.</p>

          <p>If you even thought about it, remember, they went through this thing with the Canadian Company. So it's not like buying stuff in West Texas, by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then if I could just quickly, as a point of clarification, the increase to your CapEx budget and then the several hundred millions of acquisitions expected in the fourth quarter, the acquisitions are incremental to the increasing CapEx, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The CapEx is drilling and that sort of activity. Acquisitions are acquisitions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize if you've already addressed this because I got on the call a little bit late and I haven't seen the slides. But could you --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Hope you don't mind the cold.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk a little bit about the strategy behind acquiring Phibro? Are you going to utilize them to get more aggressive in hedging your own production or I know you bought it on the cheap but what really do you hope it to do for your company going forward? What's the main attraction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are two attractions. One it's obviously a very profitable business, so we like profits. The second point is that no, we're not going to hedge. Our current production is essentially unhedged and will stay that way. They're not really hedgers, actually. He never goes short, so I don't know how you'd be a hedger without ever going short. So I think what he does is he looks for opportunities to trade, to gain advantages. He's a fundamentalist. He looks for opportunities to make small gains or even large gains. It's going to be a stand-alone operation for quite a while until we figure out, to see how it goes. They do have a superb reputation, especially in the Middle East. And so we see opportunities there to make -- to use their name and their skills to help us get more business there and that's really the -- if you want to think of the strategic part of it, that's it. But that's going to take a while. We've got a lot of calls from people in the Middle East that are interested in meeting with them and talking about trading. Remember this is sort of an independent trader unlike a BP or something which uses the oil. So I think it will put some advantages, but it's basically for the money.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick clarification. Did you quantify the actual dollar amount for the property acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we said several hundred million dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second is another large company in this space has talked about having some packages available, some stuff is in your backyard and there's also some other projects in the Middle East. And I just didn't know if that was something that would interest you or you guys are going to stick with sort of the core area as you sort of look around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at lots of things, practically everything. And so you should expect that we'll stay with our core areas and not do something out of the core areas. But we look at lots of things and whether they have packages in the Permian, certainly looking at any Permian or Californian packages, if there was a package that worked for us in Iraq we might look at that. We look at lots of stuff to get some idea of the markets. I don't think I would read much into all that.</p>
