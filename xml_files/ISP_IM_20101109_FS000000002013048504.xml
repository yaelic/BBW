          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Conference Call of Intesa Sanpaolo for the Presentation of 2010 Third Quarter Results hosted today by Mr. Corrado Passera, Chief Executive Officer. My name is Isabel, and I will be your coordinator for today's conference.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand the call over to Mr. Corrado Passera. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning or good afternoon to everybody. Thank you for being with us this afternoon. We will present our nine-month results. Only a few remarks before we go together through the presentation. Three main issues I would like to address. Results, we are happy about the sound set of results we have achieved in the third quarter. We are in line with our expectations. Q3 has been a bit higher than Q2 on a recurring basis. And the &#x2013; our basic approach that as you know we call sustainable profitability is gaining momentum.</p>
          <p>This momentum is built on a number of things that quarter after quarter are always the same but we strongly believe in this balance of profitability, operating profitability. So revenues on the one side and cost on the other side, but at the same time strong liquidity, strong solidity, strong risk profile and very low leverage. Some of these components as a cost that we believe that a bank like ours should behave in this way in a period of time like the one we are living through.</p>
          <p>Second point, capital position. We have tried, also in this case, to give the maximum possible transparency to the market. And as we will sit together we feel comfortable with our capital position also after the details about Basel III. We think that &#x2013; we believe that complying with the requirements of Basel III will be very manageable for us. Thanks to what I said before in terms of results, but thanks to the combination of liquidity and leverage on the one side, capital &#x2013; internal organic capital generation and the capital management actions we have on reserve. But we'll elaborate more on it. So we're confident that we will be able to meet the new capital requirements without any recourse to other capital measures, besides what we have already planned for.</p>
          <p>Third point, growth. Growth is the challenge for a number of banks like ours. We are happy to see some of the recovery signs being consolidated and by recovery signs I mean the improvement in interest income, the increase in credit demand and the decrease in loan adjustments. As you might remember, on the June results, we had identified both credit demand and loan adjustments as to early signs of recovery and luckily enough, both these trends have been confirmed after the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Also in terms of growth, we strongly believe that our bank is very well positioned to take advantage of the new face of growth that will inevitably take &#x2013; will happen in the next month. But one point that is particularly important because sometimes we are sort of considered a proxy of our country in terms of economic growth and that is certainly partially true but what I would like to stress with you is the fact that the very large majority of our revenues are in countries outside of Italy, but especially in regions within Italy that are already enjoying a good level of growth. And that will be &#x2013; will enjoy growth levels in the next certainly months and years in the higher bracket of the European Union. What I'm saying is that as we all know Italy is not a homogeneous market. We have a number of regions that are behaving very properly in terms of administrations and are behaving very actively in terms of growth, others that perform in a different way. Luckily enough, we are concentrated in the regions that are amongst the most active and the most efficient in Europe.</p>
          <p>So let me now take you through the presentation. I will go very rapidly through the document in order to leave as much room as possible to your questions.</p>
          <p>Page number 3, the summary of the summary. First point, nine months net income is in line with our expectations. 2.2 billion is what we expected for the nine months and we're happy that despite all the events that have occurred in these nine months, we confirm what we had in mind.</p>
          <p>Third quarter, both in terms of operating margin and in terms of pre-tax income, we see a strong increase of the third quarter vis-&#xE0;-vis the second quarter. That's very important. Further signs of cycle recovery, it's what I mentioned before, we see customer loans at the end of the quarter moving up the same way they had done at the end &#x2013; the very end of June. And in terms of asset quality, things have gone even a little bit better than what we expected.</p>
          <p>Cost reduction is a boring usual piece of news but the structure of cost reduction continues. Liquidity and leverage will remain competitive advantages. We mentioned a possibility to release some of these brakes as soon as the economic situation allows for this reduction of the brakes. It's not yet the case but both these elements make our overall results quite sound. Same thing for capital strength, we had a Core Tier 1 at the end of the third quarter close to 8% and in our opinion, more than adequate.</p>
          <p>Page 4, some figures about what I summarized in the first page. Page four is the performance in terms of operating margin Q3 on Q2. The growth is evident and income before tax from continuing operation is moving very steadily and strongly in the right direction. If we take the net income and we adjust it for the main non-recurring items, we have more than 630 million at the end of Q3, that is almost is more than 26% increase vis-&#xE0;-vis the second quarter. So, third quarter clearly better than second quarter.</p>
          <p>Customer loans, one of the two signs of maybe change in the cycle, three quarters in a row with a plus sign. We're back at the level of one year ago, that's a nice feeling. This trend is happening throughout the portfolio but especially in the two segments that represent more clearly the performance of the overall economy, SMEs plus 2% third on second quarter and mid corporate plus 3% Q3 on Q2.</p>
          <p>Page 6. The slowdown in the stock of net doubtful loans is the other evidence of the recovery of the cycle. You have two set of figures on the left hand side, the trend in the net doubtful loans quarterly change moving slightly down. And what is even more important, the total net inflow of new non-performing loans quarter-after-quarter in the next &#x2013; in the last six quarters, the trend has been very consistent. The &#x2013; a combination of these two trends make the overall stock of net non-performing loans stable Q3 on Q2. We will give you more details in the following pages but let's now focus on the main points.</p>
          <p>Page 7. Growth in customer financial assets. It is very important to keep and to develop the loyalty of our customer base quarter-after-quarter, both the total customer financial assets and what is even more important, the total assets under management move slightly in the right direction. This is an evidence of the strength of the client relationship even during very difficult times. And if we look at customer financial assets, in the last quarter those assets have improved by more than 4 billion, 21 billion more if we compare the end of September with the end of December last year. Asset under managements are up 3.2 billion versus the end of June and more than 8 billion versus the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Page 8. Structural cost reduction. This is an effort that will never end. We are in an industry where costs have to be managed this way. Obviously the big part of the effort has been done in the first years after the merger, but the effort remains very high. And also in the first nine months of the year, we have a clear minus sign, minus 1.7 vis-&#xE0;-vis the same period of last year. The amount of synergies we have accumulated since the merger took place at the end of 2006 is quite significant.</p>
          <p>Page 9. Liquidity. Liquidity is an area where maybe we're overdoing, but that's the right way to stay in the market in our opinion for a bank like ours in a period like this one. Left hand side, very strong balance between direct customer deposits and the loan to customers. On the right hand side, you see the amount of placement, long-term funding facilities we have placed during the last three years. If we put together 2009 and the first 10 months of 2010, we're talking about 70 billion euros. Even in the last part, the 8 billion, part of them, half of them actually, have been already realized on &#x2013; during the month of November.</p>
          <p>In addition to these very strong figures, we confirm a very well balanced net interbank position. The interbank position is another area where we could in the future release a little bit of brakes, but for the time being we decided to stay at this level. Same thing for eligible assets with Central Banks, almost 60 billion available, net of haircut, at the end of September.</p>
          <p>Page 10. Leverage; the real indebtedness of banks. The ranking is more &#x2013; is the same. We added in the last few quarters &#x2013; we're at the very top of such ranking.</p>
          <p>Page 11. The capital ratios. Third column is the situation at the end of September, almost 8% Core Tier 1, more than 9% Tier 1, almost 13% total capital. The stability of the Core Tier 1 is remarkable because during the third quarter we had the purchase of the 50% of Intesa Vita and the remaining 49% of Centrovita, so 10% have been absorbed and we have already accrued also the third quarter portion of the dividend we expect for the 2010 distribution.</p>
          <p>So embedded in these figures we already have almost 800 million euros worth of dividends to be distributed. As far of the last three columns of the picture, you know we have two sets of reserves; management actions that can create further increase in our capital ratios. We have here on the table, 150 basis points, 1.5 percentage point. As we have already mentioned on other occasions, actually we have even more than that but &#x2013; and we hope we'll not &#x2013; we will not use the last column. But in case we need, we have at least 1% probably more than that.</p>
          <p>Page 12 is a complicated page but it is in line with the kind of transparency we want to provide on all occasions to the market. It is our best estimate of what would happen in the worst case if the 2019 parameters provided for by Basel III are applied to our September financial statement. So the important figure is the one at the very bottom on the last column. So if we apply all the worst parameters to our today balance sheet we get to a total effect of less than 70 basis points. Actually within those 70 basis points there are areas of potential improvement because some of the elements have not been definitely defined let's say by Central Banks and the Basel III committees. But if worst comes to worst, the impact on our accounts, on our capital ratios by Basel III will be in this around. Obviously, between now and 2011, we will have a massive in creation of operating margins, we will have growth, but this is an exercise to apply immediately on our accounts what it &#x2013; what Basel III provides for the next 10 years. Page 13, we confirmed that we expect the 2010 results to be slightly higher of the 2009 ones.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at each line of the consolidated accounts. Page 15 is the summary. Revenue is up 0.7% Q3 on Q2, and that's good if we remember that Q3 is the quarter with August included. Operating cost down both Q3 on Q2 and both nine months-on-nine months last year. Operating margin up 3.9%. Net adjustment to loans down 10.9% Q-on-Q, 14.2% nine months-on-nine months. We are now at 80 basis points annualized, 75 actually in the third quarter. We are now pretty sure that our 2010 figure will be certainly well below the 2009 figure. Pre-tax income, up 32.7% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 16. Some more detail on the third quarter P&amp;L. The arrows show the figures that we consider particularly interesting. The operating income up, thanks to a good performance in terms of net interest income. We will elaborate more both on interest and commission on the following pages. Costs down 1.7%, et cetera, et cetera. If we compare the net income bottom line from an accounting point of view is minus 49%, actually excluding the non-recurring items is up 26% and the details are described on page 17. If we exclude from accounts &#x2013; from the P&amp;L and net income whatever is not recurring, you see that we had a two &#x2013; second quarter net income of 500 million, while the third Q net adjusted &#x2013; adjusted net income is 633.</p>
          <p>Page 18, nine months-on-nine months. Very good performance in terms of commission, very good performance by the insurance people, good cost control, net adjustment to loans a little bit lower than we expected and overall more or less the same result despite the effect of &#x2013; all the effects we all know.</p>
          <p>Page 19. The summary of our balance sheet. Loan to customer, zero, is a good piece of news. Actually if we compare the June results with the September results loan to customers are up by 4 billion. Customer financial assets, we've already made some comments before, plus 2%, that means 4 billion vis-&#xE0;-vis the end of June and especially asset under management up 3.2 billion versus the same date.</p>
          <p>Page 20. Net interest income. We have benefited from a slight increase in market yield. October has been another good month in that respect. We'll see what happens in November and December, but we hope we will be able to confirm the trend that we have on the left hand side of the page. If we look at volumes on the bottom right hand side, we see that the only big reduction is with large corporate, but large corporate is a segment that has been able, luckily so, to take advantage of a market where bonds have been reasonably easy to place and we have assisted a number of them in the issue of significant amounts of bonds.</p>
          <p>Page 21 is the analysis of the change in the net interest income. On the left-hand side we have the Q-on-Q analysis. Obviously the two important figures are the spread effect and the hedging effect. As planned and as expected, we have &#x2013; as long as market yields move up a little bit, we have an immediate reduction in hedging but we have a larger effect on spreads that partially is a &#x2013; is not completed in the same quarter but has effect only in the following quarters. Volumes have not given a positive &#x2013; particularly positive effect during the quarter but it's more or less zero. The nine months is something you know very well and we hope to be able to balance part of these effects in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>Page 22. The net fee and commission. We had third quarter lower than, not we expected because we decided not to place any drawbacks with upfront fees, but we decided to concentrate our resources in the fourth quarter on bank products, certainly the August effect and this decision not to place third-party products during this summer is the reason why we have the trend that we are having. The yearly analysis is the comparison between the nine months 2010 and the nine months 2009 is actually very positive. Also thanks to what we see on page 23. The net flows of asset under management is very clear, left hand side at the top of the page, not yet what we would like and what we will have soon but certainly moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>The net fee and commission income coming from both asset under management and insurance products is giving quite a contribution to the growth of our revenues. Thanks both to volumes and to the mix of our mutual funds that we manage. If we look at the bottom of the page, we see that in &#x2013; if we compare the nine months this year and the nine months last year the percentage, the share of mutual funds that we can consider high quality or high value added kind of funds is increasing steadily. We are certainly not happy until we are not above &#x2013; very well above 30%, but we have already moved 4% in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Page 24. As you might remember, we had a very low second Q, because of mark-to-market in unrealized losses on financial assets caused by the Greek crisis, those 100 million we lost in second quarter will come back soon because you know that the duration of our portfolio is very short, so by mid next year we will get back the 100 million we added to mark-to-market on our portfolio. Third quarter results are in line with what we expected, not yet the running rate we expect for the bank, but yet a positive figure.</p>
          <p>The analysis of the trading profit is on page 25. You see that the very large majority of our trading profit are profit made directly or indirectly with customers, that's the first and second line. While prop trading and structure credit product that is each part of the prop trading activity is positive but certainly a minor percentage of the total amount.</p>
          <p>Page 26, insurance business and insurance contribution to our revenue is very stable, very satisfactory. This is an area that will grow significantly and when we talk about insurance products, we talk about products that will to a certain extent a part of our saving related products that the insurance products complete our product range in the saving world, while we expect also the damage and liabilities lines to contribute more in the future. We are working on consolidation of our insurance companies. It's a project that unfortunately has been slowed down by the authorization processes at the anti-trust level but it is a process that is underway will create one of the leading and hopefully the leading company in the area of bank insurance and not only maybe bank insurance.</p>
          <p>Page 27, cost figures. Structural cost reduction is confirmed quarter-after-quarter and our commitment in this area will certainly not be reduced in the future. Page 28, cost of credit, cost of bad credit. We are very satisfied with the third quarter results, 711 is a good figure given the situation. The fact that we have a more than 10% decrease Q-on-Q is a bit more than what we expected, I said it before. And it is the evidence of the very strong prudence and a very strong attention we've always given to the quality of our loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Page 29, some further figures on the quality of the portfolio. If we take all the non-performing loans &#x2013; on loans left hand side at the top of the page, we have a decreasing percentage. Keep always in mind that according to Italian regulations restructured positions that are in any respect performing positions are included in non-performing loans, if we exclude the net restructured loans we get &#x2013; we go down to 4.6%. If you look at the net past dues, the trend is very clear and is what we expected. The net past dues are the first step in the pipeline of the non-performing loans and the fewer position enter into the pipeline, the better it is for the whole process as you can imagine. If you look on the right hand side bottom of the page, you see that the total net non-performing loan portfolio is stabilizing about &#x2013; at about 20.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Page 30, two important pieces of information. Doubtful loan coverage remains very high and that is the main reason why we keep being repaid more than the net book value of the doubtful loan positions. On the right hand side, you see that we're amongst those banks that keep accumulating performing loan reserves. We never used this reserve not even during the worst part of the crisis and the coverage of the performing loan portfolio is increasing quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>31, I will leave these details. Page 32, just to give you the trends. If we look on the right hand side, we have the new doubtful loan gross flow and quarter-after-quarter you see the trend 1.8, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3. If we look at the left hand side and we analyze the new substandard loan in the gross flow, the trend is very similar 3.5, 2.6, 2.6, 2.4. Obviously, we are not talking about an easy situation but this is the situation today but certainly the trends are in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Page 33, the usual breakdowns of our portfolio both in terms of the business areas on the left hand side and with the details of their residential mortgages, both for the mix and their ratios are &#x2013; and remain very strong. On the right hand side, you have the breakdown by industry.</p>
          <p>Page 34. The breakdown by products and by countries of all our portfolio. We confirm that our overall exposure to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain is in the round of 2%.</p>
          <p>From page 35 on, we have the divisional figures &#x2013; the divisional results. I will leave them for a while and I will use them, if some of you are interested, but I would prefer to leave now as much as room as possible to your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will now take our first question from Marcello Zanardo from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Passera and colleagues. This is Marcello Zanardo from Sanford Bernstein. You mentioned growth at the beginning of the presentation and if I look at the P&amp;L and the results growth is very dependent on Euribors going up on the loan growth coming up and on cost-cutting and clearly provisions getting better. So you have some control on these measures such as cost control and loan growth if the macro allows and much less than others. So my question is that going back to growth more of a strategic one, you have a neighbor of yours called UniCredit, which is very likely to go in through significant rethinking &#x2013; early thinking at least in my opinion of their franchise. So I'm asking your opinion. Is there a possibility of you and the new top management team sitting down together on the credit and helping each other out by swapping assets in Central Eastern Europe because 10% of your franchise is in CE, you mentioned it's good and I think it is except Hungary, which is obviously going through a tax issue, but is still too low. And UniCredit, in my opinion is present in too many CE countries. So what is preventing from you and the new CEO to sit together and swap a few countries with each other so that the funding, the market share, the pricing and the CE impact and the complexity as well will improve on both sides, especially on your side on the growth? So that's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two, I do understand that you have some leverage on the capital base and some of these deals have been implemented. But other banks such as BBVA, for instance, used a strategic deal staking guarantee towards the raise a bit more of capital, not a lot more, but a bit more to reinforce the capital position that funds the deal. Now is that something that you would do in the future provided that the deal is EPS announcing, gives a good ROE, a return on investment and makes sense, so that you could tackle two issues? And if not, do you think that perhaps, you could, for instance, maybe sell the insurance operations, I know that there are a lot of assets on sales at the moment. But once you have implemented synergies there, you have taken the value up not to be penalized as much as you would expect? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are quite right in terms of growth. Our growth will be partially dependent on the trend in market yields. But for sure, both loan volumes and commission, especially coming from asset management products will be a function of our capability, of our efficiency, of our determination to push those two components of our revenues. And we're optimistic on both doors assize. As far as your encouragement to sit down as you're saying with another Italian bank to swap assets, I think that in the real life that's not the way things happen. We are very much competitors of each other and we can &#x2013; we certainly and we can and we always tried to make these kind of discussions also with other banks in similar position. So no, I do not expect anything like a sort of common table with a specific bank to rationalize both the networks in CE. Actually we are very happy about our network, the contribution and we can look at the figures if you want, the contribution that the international bank division is providing to the group is very interesting. We have the 11 positions, 5 of them of some size, all of them managed in a very coordinated and effective way. As you know we have announced we will be interested in adding another country in &#x2013; to this network. And we are hopeful we will do it without asking for any support by shareholders but by using the money and the reserves we already have at home.</p>
          <p>And now I come to the second question that is very much connected with the first. Other banks have decided to make some big acquisition. As you know we have looked at some of those acquisitions and at the end we decided that price was not what we consider the right price for making a deal profitable for the shareholders &#x2013; for our shareholders in the medium-term. As I said before, the kind &#x2013; we are not in an acquisition mode. The small things we have done and that we might do, will be financed with money we already own, with margins we will make in the next month or years. And as you were saying we have the possibility to divest from some of our less strategic assets and we have at least 200 &#x2013; 150, 200 basis points of reserves under these kind of assets. So no, there is nothing like what others have recently announced in our plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Now, just to clarify and maybe I was misunderstood. I'm not implying that you need to rationalize your CE franchise; I'm actually implying the opposite. And despite my reference to your neighbor, my question is so enlarging the table, yeah, not just in Milan, if you find a counterpart, which would benefit like you by swapping country, so you reinforced your position for instance in Hungary and the other banks somewhere else where you have a minimal presence. What is that in your opinion stopping this process to happen or do you think that this is possible again to a much larger table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This might happen. It's not a formal table but we will move in the direction of making our portfolio stronger and one way to might be to use complementary situations in &#x2013; no, not complementary, complement situations in other banking groups.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. The first one is on asset quality. I thought it was a very visible improvement in terms of the flows of non-performing loans and Intesa having been one of the very few banks in Europe, which has maintained their covenants stable and actually increased generic values, in my view, no legacy to deal with. So I guess if you could give some guidance on next year cost of credit it would be useful.</p>
          <p>And secondly on the impact from Basel III, I found a couple of the impacts suggested on page 12 are probably almost theoretical, in particular the one on the saving shares given the peculiarities of the Italian saving shares and also the impact from deducting Bank of Italy, even that your book value for that is well below the stated shareholders' funds of Bank of Italy. So I was wondering if you could give a comment on that. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I tend to agree with all the points you made. So in terms of our asset quality, we are very happy about the improvement we are delivering. The strong prudence and the high coverage we kept also in the past is now paying off &#x2013; are now paying off, and we expect that next year the downward trend in the &#x2013; say in the ratio between loan loss provision and loans should gain momentum.</p>
          <p>Basel III, we have tried to be as negative as possible. The saving shares in our opinion are loss absorbing stocks the same way ordinary shares are. So we hope they will be considered of the same quality of ordinary shares but still is not yet been defined so we applied the worst-case scenario. Same thing for Bank of Italy, Bank of Italy is a source in the medium term for sure of improvement in our capital ratios because the value that is embedded in our 42% share is certainly significant. Also in this case, in the lack of definite determinations, we have preferred to consider it sort of normal asset to pay for in terms of equity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon Mr. Passera. I also have a couple of questions. I thought you made a very interesting comment on your very liquid balance sheet, your very high liquidity parameters. You probably have gone ahead to what even regulators are asking. And you're probably finding yourself in a situation where you're very safe, but this is costing you money. I think you probably are suffering from a negative carry trade, but other banks are actually enjoying a positive carry trade. I certainly don't want to start assuming here that you should be taking more risk or leveraging more. But surely there is potentially the room for changing that parameter a little bit and perhaps giving a little bit of relief to profitability to that interest income at a time when interest rates are not really moving. And as a house, we have a very conservative view on interest rates moving here. So what are you thinking there? Are you prefer to stay extremely conservative? Is there a little bit of room for a Minerva that could actually help your net interest income into next year?</p>
          <p>And I would also love your comment a bit more on asset quality. There are some signs of improvement, but it strikes me that in Italy situation is still very tough. And you're probably one of the better positioned banks, in any case. But what do you see around? How long will it take for the bad loans to start turning around; do they normally come up more at the end of the cycle? What actually do you see on the ground also given macroeconomic data that is coming through?</p>
          <p>And also, the stock of NPLs is still quite large. Is it something that you would consider again reducing? I don't know even whether sales transactions that have been done in the past can even be proposed today. But is it something that you think over time you may be looking at?</p>
          <p>And also, on a more general theme, what do you see now, besides low profitability, is the bigger challenge from a business point of view in terms of your retail branches, in terms of your presence with clients on the network? I'll be interested in your view here. Thank you.</p>

          <p>As far as liquidity is concerned, yes, we kept the bank at the level we expected the liquidity regulations to happen. So yes, we wanted to be compliant with the worst case also in terms of liquidity ratios but these rules have been postponed to a further future. We are carrying a cost because of that and from next year these costs will be progressively reduced and possibly eliminated. And if things move the way they are moving that will happen in already during 2011. Asset quality -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If the third world war does not happen and things keep resisting the way they are today, we will certainly reduce and eliminate the extra cost coming from over-funding next year. Asset quality; asset quality are moving the way we expected. The first segments to have troubles are always the larger companies and SMEs come at the end, and SMEs are coming now &#x2013; have come now during 2010. And the Banca dei Territori will have its worst probably year during 2010 and so &#x2013; or at the end of this year, also the last and this lowest, let's say, segment in terms of the substandard and doubtful loans generation would be completed and from next year all the divisions will move &#x2013; we expect them to move downward in terms of provision. NPLs &#x2013; stock of NPLs, you certainly remember a similar deal we have done few years ago, the time will come for a divestment from part of that stock, probably today is too early but given the quality of this portfolio an opportunity will certainly arise in the next month.</p>
          <p>If I understood correctly your last question is about the main challenges that we &#x2013; that I see in front of us in terms of growth and in terms of performance of our bank also in a low yield environment, the way we expect the world to be in the next one or two years. The business plan is focused on that. The business plan is taking advantage, certainly considering all the main trends in certain terms of the margins with the different segments of customers and we are, for example redesigning the network in such a way that our &#x2013; one of our main competitive advantages, that is the branch network can remain a competitive strength and not a cost liability. So certainly redesigning and using the network in a way that is more consistent with the new level of margins is number one.</p>
          <p>IT and technology in general is the other answer to a world where a good part of the operations of the transactions are not any more part of the branch world. And simplification that the simple bank project I mentioned also on our last presentation will be the third way to improve, increase productivity. Productivity is a word that you will hear very often from now on. It's a concept that will be the basis and it will be one of the platforms on which the new business plan will be designed.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have few questions. One regards the fiscal stuff, not really fun, after credit quality we moved on that. Actually we see more and more banks having more taxes to pay, not just in Italy but also in Italy and in some of the Central European countries and actually also in Germany and the UK, are working on that. We see that you are running more like at 39% tax rate. Is that something that you consider sustainable going forward or you see any sign of improvement in that context?</p>
          <p>And second question is again on insurance. Other colleagues perhaps touched that a little bit, you've recently received the longer way to go ahead from the anti-trust on some of the most important asset there, actually what do you believe is going to be the impact, now that your numbers &#x2013; now that you can fully consolidate first these assets? And then how much improvement you see because you own all of that that you can now merge and consolidate these assets? And after that because it is now absorbing something like 4.3 billion investments on your balance sheet, so &#x2013; also in your simulation for Basel III, it is clear that it's an area that is going to weight more and more on your capital ratio. Do you believe that your strategy in that concept will be towards partnership? So you &#x2013; are you prepared to reduce your ownership there?</p>
          <p>And then finally, again on revenues, you were mentioning &#x2013; in fact you are working on the business plan, we all wait for in the springtime. Actually revenues also in this quarter and over the year-to-date numbers revenues had been actually weaker point and actually to have in mind that trade and income can help can help a little as it did last year is not easy to say. So on the net interest income the ongoing improvement of the interest rate is certainly going to help already in Q4, but what is your view on the commission side that's &#x2013; is that still remaining very much under pressure. Do you believe we can see some sign of improvement already in the first half of 2011? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tax rate: we certainly suffered from an unfair decision in Hungary and for 2 or 3 years I believe, we will have this 38 million worth of unfair taxes in that country. As far as Italy is concerned, we believe that 37% is a reasonable figure for the short &#x2013; in the short time, for the next time, for the next period. Obviously, when the results get to the level they are today, the very strong fiscal pressure that we suffer from because of the fact that we cannot exclude from cost that the provisions on loans has an effect. So since you mention 39, I can give you the guidance something in and around of 37.</p>
          <p>Insurance, we had to go ahead I agree. We want and we are creating a hell of the company, a company that will have a very important role on the market both in life and in the merchant liabilities lines and also in pension related kind of products. It will be one of the main &#x2013; one of the important projects of the business plan. In the next 3 years, we will create a significant value for the shareholders through the development of our insurance presence. We are not &#x2013; we do not feel we are obliged to divest or even to partially divest from our activity in the insurance business. We believe there is room for optimizing the cost of equity or the equity that has been invested to be allocated on this activity and I hope that the absorption of capital at the end will be much lower than the figure you mentioned that we also mentioned in our worst-case scenario. So insurance is an area of growth &#x2013; value growth, and sustainability from a capital point of view is something on which I will concentrate my efforts.</p>
          <p>Revenues, I don't agree, let me use this word, that revenues are a weak point in our third quarter results. The positive sign on net interest income given the situation is a very positive sign. Never forget and let's never forget the kind of business that we are involved and the kind of business we are not involved. Commissions are the results of a decision that will pay, because what we have not used in terms of customer assets to sell third-party products in the third quarter will come back with even better results on in the next quarters with products &#x2013; with our internal products.</p>
          <p>And commissions will be, especially asset management related commission, will be one of the two main projects of the business plan. In any case we refer we are really ready to accept this level of growth in this period of time in order not to jeopardize on the one side the quality of our loan portfolio and on the other side not to disperse resources that can be better used internally.</p>

          <p>Do you believe that already in the Q4 that the usual annual accrual of performance fees and some more upfront fees together were obviously a much easier seasonality compared to the summer period can already overcome the situation and turn around the situation on the commission side? Or you expect more towards the first half of 2011?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. This is Giovanni Carriere from Autonomous. Very quickly, I have a detailed question on slide 20 where you basically mention, on the left, one of the bullet points, that the average loans to customers were lower in Q3 versus Q2. I just wanted you to clarify because obviously I'm calculating the loans at the beginning an average of the quarter and for me, the average was actually higher.</p>
          <p>And on a related point, more generally, the Euribor has gone up, the average one, I think by 20 basis points. On your loan base, there would have been 180 million. Obviously you just get to capture a part of the increase in Euribor. But what I've seen, given also that the loan book has expanded, it's a little bit less than what I was expecting. Could you elaborate, please?</p>
          <p>And the last question would be also if you could give us a little bit of a general sense on the spreads that you're seeing on new lending. So for example, on new mortgage and new business loan, how you feel about those. Obviously the decision ones are public from the Bank of Italy. And how do they compare, on average, with the average spreads that you have on your bank book? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I understood your second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean, the first one was the average loans. Maybe if we get the answer to that one, then we will get the answer to the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The average loans, you're right from a mathematical point of view. But since the changes have happened at the very end of quarter. You cannot use the effect in terms of interest income. So both &#x2013; what happened on the Euribor side on the one side, on the other side on our internal figures, make your point a bit difficult because what happens at the end of the quarter cannot be compared with the average volumes, but you're right in what you said. The second question was about what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the second question, I got my answer as well, that basically I see that Euribor has gone up 20 basis points. But if I calculate the margin on average loans the way I was calculating it &#x2013; that's gone down. But then I think I got my answer. If the average loans have actually gone down in the quarter, then probably yes, the margin went up. So I did get my answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other effect you must take into account that the change in the pricing sometimes have a certain time lag. So, you immediately have the write-down effect. But the write-up effect is only in the following month. So on average, on the whole year, you don't see &#x2013; you don't suffer from the same effect. But on a single quarter you cannot make the same calculation on the deposit side and on the loan side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. And the last question was on the overall spreads on new lending versus your back book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The new lending is not quite a clear question because it's very different and the kind of mark-ups we will make on the different lines and on the different segments is very difficult. For sure, today, we are still suffering from very low level of mortgage margins, while the medium/large corporate margins are being managed rather well, while SMEs still embed at least a 30% of our customers with negative EVA.</p>
          <p>So to make the story short, there is room for better pricing for at least 30% of SMEs and between 10% and 15% of mid-corporate, while we expect interest rates to move to improve the margins of mortgages that today are very low.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Hi. A couple of questions if I can. One on funding and the margins and the other one on asset quality. On the first point, on funding, looking at your most recent issuance in terms of institutional bond benchmark, it seems to me that the average spread is 50 basis points, 70 basis point above what we saw in 2008 and 2009. I know that these issuances are not straight comparable, but it seems the trend is quite clear. And naturally, it seems a trend that involves also other European banks.</p>
          <p>My point would be, do you see a similar trend also on your retail funding side. Some of the domestic peers suggest that retail bonds used to be placed at Euribor minus 50 basis points to 100 basis points now are placed at Euribor plus.</p>
          <p>If that is the case, what are you planning to do to mitigate the pressure you see from the funding side given, as you are suggesting, some limited room for repricing on the corporate side?</p>
          <p>And on asset quality, I get all your points in terms of the improvement and the number are very clear. I wonder if the strengthening of the euro that we saw in recent months with the euro back at the same level of 2009 against the dollar is something that you think can put some risk to the corporate sector. Or in other words, why are you not concerned with weakening of the export trend next year that has been the major driver for the recovery this year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you made the point that sounds a little bit strange to me. Bonds for the retail customers should always be above Euribor and we always had rates above Euribor. They will remain above between 25 basis points and 50 basis points because at least &#x2013; it's a rule we have given the Bank since a long time. So we are not suffering from that effect. Other banks that maybe, as you were saying have been offering bonds to their retail customers with rates below Euribor will suffer from that. But that's not our case.</p>
          <p>As far as assets quality and the risk coming from a stronger and stronger euro, you're right. I believe, I share with you some concern, if the euro remains or goes even higher in terms of value. Actually, I do not expect it or at least we cannot say for the time being. But the currency fight that is underway, for the time being, as a victim that is the euro and for an export focused economy like ours, that's a problem. If it remains in the area where it is today, it's not such a disaster, but certainly it's one of the variables we have to monitor more closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I go quickly just back to the first point? Very clear the point on the retail bonds. In general, do you believe that this &#x2013; there is a trend for a significantly higher cost of funding for Intesa for, or basically all the European banks and there is a risk that these can be only moderately passed to the clients, so it will be a hit on the margin? So it will limit the recovery in NI going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I got the figures you were probably mentioning. So, I confirm that our bonds for the retail market have always paid rates higher than Euribor. Obviously the retail bonds have to have rates very much connected also with the institutional market.</p>
          <p>And since we have seen our cost of the bonds for the retail market going up in the round of 25 basis points in the last year, while the average cost on the institutional market has gone up 50 basis points, if that was your question?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, not that &#x2013; that was clear. I was trying to understand how you are planning to basically mitigate this asset bill. This is going to be a negative impact on your margin. So I was wondering are you planning to do something to mitigate this effect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions from me. The first one is on the capital position under Basel III. I understand you've done your calculation with no phasing. And on the basis of the figure you provided, the 68 basis points of negative impact, I'm actually looking at a pro-forma common equity Tier 1 at the end of 2012 of 7.9%, which is close to 8%. And the 8% is a figure that many banks are now targeting.</p>
          <p>I'm just wondering whether you can confirm that's the figure, which &#x2013; with which you are comfortable, whether you are planning to return capital also in light of the capital management needs measures which are in the region of 150 basis points? And more broadly speaking, what level of common equity Tier 1 are you targeting for 2012?</p>
          <p>And the second question is actually on the contribution to net interest income from hedging, which has slightly decreased to 400 million from 430 million. I'm just wondering whether you can tell us how sustainable and how stable this contribution is going to be in the next quarters. You already said it's quite stable. I'm just wondering if you can give us some more detailed figures. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The final target, in terms of capital ratios will have to be agreed upon with our Central Banks. For sure, as far as we know, as of today, we will have to remain above 7%. And a 7% like ours would be a very strong one, because it will be coupled with a level of liquidity and the level of leverage that will make the overall picture of the bank very strong. What that &#x2013; this is a very important point because my strong suggestion is that we should not look simply at the magic figure of the core Tier 1 because core Tier 1 is an important leg of the table, but the other three legs are risk profile, leverage and liquidity.</p>
          <p>And if you optimize all of them, even at the over amount of Core Tier 1, that can be limited. In any case, we want to remain above the 7% provided by the Basel III requirements.</p>
          <p>In terms of trading profit, you know better than me that you cannot take commitments in terms of revenues and income coming from this area. But what we have in our mind is the average figure of last year as a sort of running rate that is slightly above the third quarter results. We have to have, on a running rate, something that has a two as a first figure of the three.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The hedging will remain with the same contribution with the present level of market yields. The more we lose, the more Euribor rates move up, the more we get in terms of mark-downs and the more we lose in terms of hedging. The combination of what we get on &#x2013; in terms of markdowns and what we lose in terms of hedging in markups is something between 340 and &#x20AC;400 million net for every 100 basis points of movement of the Euribor rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have another question on macro hedging. My question is, if you have considered the possibility to reduce the notion of the macro hedging in order to looking past all the profits that you made with these deals, so maybe not closing all of the hedges, but reducing them. And if not, why? Because of &#x2013; from my point of view, it could be wise to reduce the hedging given that I believe the downward risk on rate at this point is limited. Is there some downside risk? But my opinion is limited. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have clearly considered this possibility, that in the end the net value for the bank was negative; because the same way you make this calculation also the market makes the same kind of calculation. So strategically speaking, we work for making our revenue stream as stable as possible. But in terms of financial deals, the reduction of the optional would have had &#x2013; or would have at least for the time being, a negative impact on our overall value for the bank.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Mr. Passera. My first set of questions is actually on Slide 12, just a clarification. In the DTAs calculation that you're suggesting, I was just double checking if you've also taken into account the new DTAs that you're going to generate going forward, so between now and 2019, assuming that you will keep providing above 30 basis points, so you should keep generating deferred tax assets in the future. And secondly, on this slide, although you mentioned up to 150 bips of core capital release from JV listings, I guess Fideuram and so on. Just to check, if you have included &#x2013; I guess, no, but I just want to double check the impact of such intervention on the minorities that you propose on page 12.</p>
          <p>Second set of questions is on CIB. Overall good set of results in asset quality, but provisioning are going up in CIB. On Slide 52 you mentioned a single loan driving to such increase. I was wondering if I could get more color. And secondly, on this topic Banca IMI reported 420 million net profit in the nine months. That's almost 50% of your CIB earnings and 20% of your group earnings. I was wondering if we could get a bit more clarity on these parts of your business, some sort of breakdown between 16 common equity between customer business versus profit business. And most importantly within the financial business &#x2013; the financing business, if we could get a split between the high margin operations, the structural and then acquisition finance and the low margin <mark type="inaudible" /> business.</p>
          <p>Finally on strategy, you mentioned Banca Monte Parma, I see the rationale, market share in the region, but I cannot avoid asking you how much of this is some sort of intervention required by the Bank of Italy rather than a genuine interest in a bank which might not be the most profitable in Italy. I think there is interest on your side. And in general, my question here is, there is a long list of assets you have disposed over the last couple of years, some good assets, I would say.</p>
          <p>My question is, what kind of trade-offs do you have in mind between the core capital you would wanted to achieve and the kind of earning dilution you're willing to bring on board by disposing the assets? Would you may be consider other options to free up capital or generate capital, such as split dividend or dividend capital? Thank you.</p>
          <p>Sorry for the long list, but I hope my questions are clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as the new details, obviously they are not included. The same way we do not include all the positive components of the capital ratios in the future, that's the situation as of to-date. Second, if we take &#x2013; if we consider the minority effects on the effect of the 150 basis points of non-core disposable asset, the answer is yes. Your corporate and investment banking, if color of the single position means the name, the answer is that we cannot give names for company that &#x2013; even if they are substandard but are still in the performing situation or non-doubtful yet. And in many cases, they're not public figures, public names.</p>
          <p>Monte Parma &#x2013; and then we talk about the acquisition strategy. What leads our actions in terms of investment &#x2013; divestment &#x2013; is a strategy with a limit, with a constraint that is EPS effect. But what leads the whole exercise is strategy. If we have a business where we cannot be the best owner, or we do not want to invest to make that business successful &#x2013; and that is the case of security services.</p>
          <p>Security service was a good asset, but it's a business that has become global, where the capital requirement to become a global company would have been enormous. So I think it was quite in the interest of our shareholders to dispose and get the maximum value we could have achieved, and we have achieved quite an interesting value.</p>
          <p>In other cases, we simply sold, because there is no meaning in having, for example a 50/50 joint-venture with a competitor; or in the case of Fideuram we believe that a company that is in clear competition with the rest of the group can be supported and can be helped in its development if it is a listed bank, if it is a listed company.</p>
          <p>In terms of the various small acquisition we had done with Monte Parma. We believe that one of the strongest competitive advantage of our bank is the territorial coverage. And we have identified a number of provinces, a number of regions where there is a strong value in reaching a market share that we have not reached yet.</p>
          <p>The two provinces where Banca Monte operate are provinces that we know very well, that are very rich and interesting provinces that we have to leave, because of anti-trust regions, when we separated our destiny from the alliance with Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole. And I think it was in the interest of the group to take advantage of that opportunity and by those branches through the acquisition of the control of that bank.</p>
          <p>The same kind of reasoning holds true for what we're doing in Central Eastern Europe whenever a good opportunity arises. We have identified some countries where we want to strengthen our position or enter directly. Poland has always been one of these countries. We have looked at several other opportunities, but then the constraint I was mentioning before became the rules because it's not &#x2013; strategic importance is not enough to make an acquisition possible. You have to pay a price that is consistent with our EPS targets and the prices that were &#x2013; that has been spent by other banks for other acquisitions in that country were well beyond what we had in mind. Polbank might be a way to enter and to get to know the country. Again, it's a matter of price. It's a matter of the kind of contract we can agree with the selling party. So we will see in the very next days if it is worth to continue the discussion or not.</p>
          <p>Core and non-core, partially, I have already given the answer. We consider core the activities where we have a competitive advantage, where we can defend the competitive advantage, where we can develop a contribution to the overall results that is consistent with our overall target. Actually, what we wanted to sell has been sold. Now what we have on reserve if we need higher capital ratios actually are in most cases businesses that can be developed, can be kept into the group or divested if necessary. But tell me if that was your question and if I answered to your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely yes. There are two pending things if I may. The one was if script dividend could be actually an option that you would consider. And then there was a bit of color on Banca IMI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Split dividend is nothing on the table. It's something that we never took into consideration. And there is nothing I can comment on as of today. In any case it's something that belongs to the Board and to the Shareholders Meeting at the end. So there is nothing I can comment on.</p>
          <p>Banca IMI is becoming a hell of a company. And the fact that they have been able to be on practically all the deals in the country, the strength of the team they have created in all the lines, equity capital market, debt capital market, advisory, the capability they are proving in terms of collaboration with the rest of the division and with the rest of the group because Banca IMI is now becoming a &#x2013; let's call it a brother company also for the Banca dei Territori is quite a result.</p>
          <p>Probably, it is worth a separate presentation with all the details of Banca IMI and their corporate investment banking division. And so we are more than available but for sure, Banca IMI is taking benefit from the very strong and consistent investment that we have done in the last three years and one of the main projects of the merger was to join efforts in the investment banking area and to re-launch a very strong and famous brand like IMI and it seems that our people are succeeding in doing it.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. It was just to bring your attention back on to slide 11 where you have the estimated capital benefit at 0.5 and the 100 basis points that you were talking for the future. So the questions are two. First of all, under which assumption of core Tier 1 ratio you will be working under Basel III. In other words, what would you think that would make you comfortable in terms of the new framework as far as Intesa is concerned? And the second question is under which condition you would eventually trigger the estimated further benefit on capital management actions if is needed? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I did not understand your question or maybe it's a question we have already discussed before. We believe that 7% core Tier 1 according to Basel III is what a bank like ours need. But since we do not make the rules, we have the reserves to bring this level to more than 8 through operating results and through divestment if necessary. But the target can be only decided with our authorities. What we want to make very clear to the market is that we are already at the level that we consider adequate, but the kind of results we expect and the kind of divestments we can trigger if necessary, make our the bank compliant with more or less whatever requirements will come.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, it's Anke from Execution. I just had very &#x2013; three short questions. The first one is on the spread data you gave on the third quarter. You said it's a 42 million benefit quarter-on-quarter. And I just wondered is this the corporate center where we effectively see this? And how does it basically square with your comment about the contraction in the mark-up in Banca dei Territori? Is this because there is a timing difference in terms of mark-up and mark-down with respect to the interest rate moves?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just to confirm on the relatively sharp drop in loan loss charges in Banca dei Territori, is this sort of like sustainable for the fourth quarter? And then lastly, you seem to be very excited about the demand for loans, and I just wonder how quickly are we going to see this in the numbers or will we only really find out with your business plan next year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understood correctly your question, as far as the combination of the different effects on the 42 million improvement, for sure, the mark-up have a timing problem. But it is also true as I said before that there is a lot of pressure on certain products and certain segments. So we expect the full effect of the Euribor increase to happen during the next month. But we will have to wait and see. The decrease in the provision by the Banca dei Territori cannot be considered yet a trend. We will have to see.</p>
          <p>For sure we consider the 2010 the worst year and the highest year for the Banca dei Territori in terms of provision. And it's too early to say whether the next and the last quarter will be higher or lower than the third one. The growth rate we expect for our loan portfolio in the business plan, we will have to say, but as a general rule of thumb, at least in our country, the loans &#x2013; good loans can grow 4, 5 percentage points higher than the average growth rate in GDP.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. From me just a couple of questions. The first one is if you confirm the guidance for the end of the year, i.e. to have the same report &#x2013; higher reported earnings than in 2009? And the second question you answered already before, but I would like to get a bit more color on the trend in commissions. This for me was a bit of the weak point in the quarter. I think this was a good quarter in terms of asset quality, capital, very good guidelines, but commissions were quite weak. And my understanding is because you also had to place your own bond. Now you're left for &#x2013; in Q4 with additional placings of about 8 billion which is not a small number. But at the same time I saw also that you've been involved in some large capital transactions in Italy, so this should sustain your fee levels. So I know that maybe it's difficult to answer, but if we want to look at Q4 this year, our reference point for the commission line should be Q3 or it should be the first half of the year, the average of the first two quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guidance on net income, we confirm we have written also on the presentation that we confirm that we are confident our bottom line results in 2010 will be slightly higher than &#x2013; a bit higher than 2009. The commissions are not only weak because we decided to place our own bonds, but also because we decided to not to devote part of those resources to third-party products in order to have higher products that have been made available only in the last quarter of the year. So as a guidance in terms of running rate of this line is certainly the average of the first half of the year and not Q3.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I have a question on net interest income again. Now obviously the increase in net interest income was not that substantial this quarter due to the lagged effect of asset re-pricing. But my question really is that one month Euribor is at 0.85% now. What would be the normalized net interest income on that basis on a quarterly basis? And then how long would it take to reach that level taking into account the lagged effect of asset re-pricing?</p>
          <p>My second question concerns Basel III. I know you've answered this in a number of ways, but could you give some insight as to whether you expect the Italian regulator to implement a too big to fail regulatory minimum in addition to the 7% that we have as a normal minimum? And thirdly could you disclose what your group intangible assets are so that we can calculate your tangible NAV? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Net interest income, there is no such thing as a normalized figure. And we expect this figure to grow very significantly for the combination of volume growth, market yields increase. So it would be misleading to give any guidance on this line. Certainly...</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Can I &#x2013; sorry, can I ask a different question then? If volumes stay the same, everything else being equal, but one month Euribor is 0.85, what would be your quarterly net interest income, can you answer that question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The sensitivity without taking into account the volumes is the one I mentioned before. We expect between 300 million and 400 million worth of increase for every 100 basis points increase in Euribor rates. I didn't say &#x2013; I didn't repeat that because I thought you have already got this answer before, but maybe that was not your question?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as Basel III/IV, the too big to fail regulations, we are all waiting for it. And it's very difficult to make any forecast. For sure despite our size that is certainly meaningful, we are a bank that has in the round of &#x20AC;600 billion worth of assets mostly and almost completely concentrated in real economy kind of activity. So I certainly do not expect treatments of the kind that other kind of banks will have in that respect. But really I cannot answer this question. The intangible components in our balance sheet are 24.7 billion and the goodwill accounts for about &#x20AC;19.2 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try to cut it short because I see that it's really late. Three questions. The first one is a follow up on trading income. Probably I missed your answer before. My question is will you stick to your original target or statement of a run rate for the trading income in the region of 200 million, 250 million per quarter looking forward?</p>
          <p>Second question is a more, let's say, an indication that you could provide if you want to share with us. I know there is not a straight answer, but will &#x2013; how will you quantify, say, the cost for over-funding that could be recovered in 2011 through a different approach?</p>
          <p>Third question on, again on macro hedging. Two things. The first one if you can confirm that what we learn on the price that the bulk of your hedging facility has an average duration left, let's say, between 3.5 and 4 years. Second, it's not exactly clear to me why you should record a loss should you decide to, let's say, to close the facility. Probably you might enjoy a lower benefit in 2011 and 2012. But the real question that I will ask you is this one, would you have an active approach in deciding what to do with the hedging facility? Meaning, should you have any evidence that interest rate will increase much more than what the market is currently expecting, would you decide to actually take benefit of this embedded earnings within your hedging facility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I confirm the guidance in terms of trading income between 200 and 250. The theoretical total cost of over-funding might reach &#x20AC;200 million but that does not mean that we will eliminate it completely during next year. In terms of macro hedging, you are right in terms of duration, while I probably answered not clearly on the last part of your question. I did not say or I did not mean to say that we would make a loss if we sell the macro hedging. We would make a lot of money, but the money we will make in keeping the macro hedging is higher. So what I try to say is that today, if we compare the net present value of keeping the facilities and selling the facilities, that keeping the facility is still higher than the selling of it. Should it be a different situation obviously we would consider the possibility to sell this embedded value.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon to everybody. I just have a couple of questions. The first on emerging markets and the second one, again, on capital. You mentioned during the presentation the will to expand the portfolio of markets of the group without asking shareholders for extraction. How much does this constrain the possibility to take available assets, i.e. how far are you willing to stretch Core Tier 1 in case of a good opportunity? And how were you planning to fund the Zachodni acquisition in Poland in this situation? And I wondered if you are still interested in entering the Turkish market, we've just seen a Spanish bank doing so in the last couple of weeks.</p>
          <p>Finally on capital, without getting into the technicalities of the countercyclical capital buffer, I wanted to ask you a bit of clarification regarding your 7% Core Tier 1 target under Basel III. I wonder if in your view this is under the current low growth environment, or if you're assuming the bank to revert to a high-single digit, low-double digit balance sheet growth, i.e. is there a link in your view between the capital target you want to set the bank on and the outside environment, which allows the bank to grow? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>I will try to answer and if it's not the right answer, you correct me. In terms of emerging markets, we said and we confirm that if we find the way to add one market to our portfolio, we will consider it. We considered the Turkish market, but we have not found any deal, any opportunity that was compatible with both the quality and the price we had in mind. In terms of Poland, we are considering an acquisition that should become the &#x2013; feasible, would be quite consistent in terms of capital ratios, because the cost in terms of equity that this acquisition would bring is totally consistent with the 7% constraint we have in terms of Core Tier 1 according to Basel III.</p>
          <p>And then I come to the second part of the question. The 7% is the constraint we want to respect and to maintain on any occasion. And the kind of final ratios we &#x2013; what we will keep in the next years will be one of the main component, one of the main element of the business plan. So tell me if I missed a part of your questions.</p>

          <p>Yeah. No, on the first one on the emerging markets, let me just clarify. Basically, I was wondering if the constraint of not wanting to ask shareholders for capital may potentially imply that the bank may have to miss some options of bigger size that would require capital increase. I was thinking perhaps of the deal that was just happened a few months ago in Poland of Zachodni, the press was reporting that into some partners or amongst the potential leaders for the bank and this was implying a total evaluation of almost &#x20AC;4 billion for bank we are hearing evaluations of magnitudes that are way smaller than that. That's all. Thank you.</p>

          <p>No, we will not miss any opportunity because of that, because the reason to say that in case we can get gold at the price of copper, we do not offer our shareholders the possibility to put money into bite. But what I was saying is that there is nothing on the table of the size. What we have under table is something totally compatible with the 7% constraint we have in terms of core capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. And thanks to all of you for staying with us so long. We considered the Q3 results quite encouraging in a number of ways. We believe that our customer base is a very strong asset of ours. So we believe that the business model we have built and we are further strengthening is something that has brought us through the crisis and will bring us very strongly through the next phase of growth. We are working very hard with the whole team of the top management group on the new business plan. The business plan we will present next spring will cover much better than I did today, all the issues you have rightly raised during these discussions and for the time being thank you to everybody.</p>
