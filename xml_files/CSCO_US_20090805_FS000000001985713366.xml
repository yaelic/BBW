        <plist>
          <p>Blair, thank you very much. During the opening comments of the conference call I will focus on what I view to be the key takeaways for Q4 fiscal year 2009: first, a very candid discussion about what we are seeing in the market on a global basis relative to Q4, and its effect on our Q1 fiscal 2010 expectations; second, an update given the current economic challenges and how we're reducing expenses, prioritizing our many opportunities for future growth, as well as our progress in realigning resources, all of this with a focus on investing in new market adjacencies, emerging technologies and emerging markets; third, on a very positive note, a detailed discussion on sequential order trends in Q4 and progress on several of our 30 plus market adjacencies that we're focused on; and finally, our revenue guidance for Q1 fiscal year 2010 with the appropriate caveats.</p>
          <p>Frank will follow these opening comments with additional details on Q4 and the majority of the fiscal year 2009 discussion. The third section of the call will focus on business momentum from a strategy, customer segment, geographic and product basis. Frank will then follow with additional financial parameters around our guidance. I will then wrap it up with some comments in terms of Cisco's momentum going in to Q1 fiscal year '10 and finally, our Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>From a summary point of view I think there were a number of key takeaways from the results in Q4 FY '09 and I will attempt to summarize these at this time. First, on the areas we control or influence, such as our key financials, we are doing very well, whether it's in the area of expense reduction, resource realignment, margins, cash generation or acquisitions.</p>
          <p>If you look at my key takeaways first Q4 was a very solid quarter from a financial perspective. The following there are some high level financial takeaways for the quarter. Revenue was 8.5 billion. Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.31. GAAP earnings per share were $0.19. Expense reductions, we exceeded the 1.5 billion expense reduction goals Frank and I outlined in prior calls. Non-GAAP gross margins were above 65% and service revenues grew at 5% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We generated 2 billion in cash in Q4 resulting in total cash and investments of approximately 35 billion and we repurchased 800 million of stock during the quarter. DSOs were 34 days and non-GAAP inventory turns were 11.3. Book-to-bill was comfortably above 1, non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately 3.3 billion in Q4 FY '09, down 8.5% year-over-year in Q4 and as a percentage of revenue was 39.2%, which was in line with our guidance that Frank and I provided of 39 to 40%. But perhaps the financial measurement that we are most pleased with overall is our ability to focus on preparing Cisco for the future and still maintaining very strong profits as a percentage of revenue during what is clearly the toughest economic challenge of our lifetime.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income was $8 billion for fiscal year '09 and was 22% of revenue for the year and for Q4 FY '09 it was 1.8 billion which translates into 21.5% of revenue. To have gone through the toughest economic time period we've seen in our lifetime and maintained comfortably over 20% non-GAAP net income as a percentage of revenue is a pretty good achievement. Frank will cover both additional details on Q4 numbers and a summary of the fiscal year 2009 financials and give discussion.</p>
          <p>My second key takeaway even more positive than the financial discipline and results in the quarter, Q4 had both, the first positive sequential product order growth and was also the first quarter in the entire fiscal year that was anywhere close to having normal sequential order seasonality. For me personally this was the most important takeaway in the quarter. In other words, while it is too early to say that this is a definite trend and therefore, the much anticipated recovery, the sequential order numbers were very solid and more along the line of our normal seasonal quarterly results for the first time in the last four quarters.</p>
          <p>Let me explain in a little more detail why this is important during periods of economic transition and during these periods of economic transition even more important to me than year-over-year numbers. During normal economic times year-over-year numbers are very indicative of the health of business. However, during economic transitions, upturns and downturns, sequential order comparisons to the same quarters are very useful in determining the health of the business and possible directional changes. We know that our sequential order growth rates follow similar patterns during normal times. This clearly has not been the case for the first three quarters of fiscal year '09 where we saw very large swings averaging 10 to 15% below our normal sequential order patterns.</p>
          <p>However, we saw a dramatic difference trend in Q4, the order rate on a sequential basis in Q4 was in line with our normal patterns of up approximately 10% Q3 to Q4. Additionally, we believe that sequential order rates in Q1 could follow a normal order pattern as well, which is historically down in the mid-single-digits from an order perspective. I'll explain how this translates into Q1 revenue guidance in a moment.</p>
          <p>While it is too soon to call a recovery, this return to normal pattern is the first major positive order trend we've seen in over the last several quarters. Trends also occurred across most of our theaters on a global basis.</p>
          <p>One final thought, while this is a very important trend, I would want to see the sequential trends continue for several more quarters before we'd be comfortable with saying that we are returning to normal business momentum. And as we return to normal business momentum I will then go back to focusing on year-over-year numbers as the primarily measurement of business momentum and the health of our business.</p>
          <p>The third key takeaway for the quarter, our new innovative organization structure built around councils, boards and working groups is operating extremely effectively. Almost all of our 30 plus market adjacencies, which include products, geographies, solutions, et cetera, are progressing well. We will discuss progress in a couple of these market adjacencies in future quarterly conference calls.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we are very pleased with our progress in aggressively managing our expenses and exceeding our stretch goal of reducing our annualized expense run rate by 1.5 billion that we committed in the Q1 conference call. We have also realigned approximately $1 billion of resource to new market adjacencies and opportunities. During Q4, we also aligned our engineering and our sales organizations around an expanding focus on customer segments, and solutions. Rob, just a real nice job on the sales side and here and Padma and Ned, the entire engineering team did amazing job there and I am very comfortable we are structured the way we want to be for the future.</p>
          <p>Fifth, assuming there are no major surprises to our expectations on economic trends, we have completed our major expense reductions and limited restructuring and we are now moving the entire focus of the company to growth, starting first with improvements in sequential order growth, followed by year-over-year growth. When we saw the market change early in fiscal year '09, we made a decision to accelerate our normal process to realign and restructure resources rather than go through a broad-based lay off.</p>
          <p>Two quarters ago, we announced our plan to have limited restructuring as part of our portfolio realignment and that would result in reductions of 1500 to 2000 jobs during the second half of fiscal '09. We shared with you that limited restructuring was an ongoing part of our business process, and something we have done for many years although this recent action was unusual as the number of job reductions were higher than normal. We have completed the recent limited restructurings and expect the total number of jobs reduced will be slightly over the high end of the range provided. I want to thank our employees and our leadership team for their very effective execution of these changes which were very challenging and at times painful for us all.</p>
          <p>In terms of those areas that we can control or influence, we continue to feel very comfortable with our long-term vision and differentiated strategy as we move into new market adjacencies and prioritize our existing opportunities.</p>
          <p>Our new organization structure of councils, boards, working groups as discussed in the last few calls, is operating very effectively. These structures most important, allow speed, scale, flexibility and rapid replication. We will continue to move into additional market adjacencies and are currently at 30. And perhaps equally important, many of our leading customers understand how this highly innovative management structure and new business models can launch this many new major products and market adjacencies with both quality and volume.</p>
          <p>We exit Q4 with a compelling financial position and an innovation engine both from product and a business model perspective that should allow us to expand our leadership in the marketplace. Our internal startups as well our acquisition of small companies continue to fill out our architectural strategies. For example, our video strategy from the home to the service provider to the enterprise is being described by many of our customers I talked with, as world-class innovation and of equal importance, world-class execution.</p>
          <p>The Pure Digital acquisition with the Flip Video formally becomes a part of Cisco family during Q4 truly brought home to many of our customers, how our architecture will play out across all customer segments. Our consumer Flip momentum continues to be extremely positive. Ned, nice job and Jonathan, nice job and Chris and the entire team and we even have found it expanding into the enterprise marketplace where we got our first million dollar commitment for Flips from a single enterprise customer.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that video architecture is the most important Web 2.0 next generation play, and is one of the key competitive advantages versus our peers. For those areas that we can control and influence, we feel we are doing reasonably well. The key market transitions relative to collaboration, virtualization, and video networking which will drive productivity and growth in network loads for the next decade, are evolving even faster than we thought one to two quarters ago.</p>
          <p>While we attempt to be very transparent with what we are seeing in the market, and have established a good track record in terms of seeing trends early, our views do not tend to change every month or quarter. And even when they do evolve, to change dramatically is really the exception. It is with this consistency of staying focused on the long term while not getting distracted by short-term market activities that we believe and will be one of the keys to our future success.</p>
          <p>No one knows for sure when the upturn will occur but as we said, in prior quarters, we are going to continue to be very aggressive to position ourselves for the inevitable upturn, while continuing to maintain tight financial management and aligning resources to new opportunities.</p>
          <p>Also, as we said, in prior conference calls over many years; Cisco will always be affected by major economic challenges, capital spending patterns, new and existing competitors, and our ability to execute or not on our strategy and other factors as discussed in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>For purpose of our long range goals, as well as our quarterly guidance, we are also assuming that our vision of how the industry and the market will evolve will be accurate, and that we will execute effectively on that vision.</p>
          <p>With all of this in mind, we continue to provide our guidance, with all the appropriate caveats, one quarter at a time and encourage each of our shareholders to not get too far ahead of themselves in building on the positives of this quarter.</p>
          <p>With this discussion in mind, our revenue guidance for Q1 FY 2010, including our usual caveats, as discussed earlier, and in our financial reports, is for revenue to decrease in the 15 to 17% range year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In summary, we believe that we are very well-positioned in the industry from the vision, differentiated strategy and execution perspective. We believe we are entering the next phase of the internet as growth in productivity will center on collaboration enabled by networked Web 2.0 technologies. We will do best to provide the product architectures and the experience to help our customers in the implementation of these collaborative capabilities from both a technology and a business perspective. We will also share with our customers how we've done this internally.</p>
          <p>In short, we are going to attempt to execute a strategy over the next decade that is very similar to what we did in the early 90s and as we said, before it powered our growth for a decade.</p>
          <p>Now Frank, let me turn it over to you for more additional details.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. I'm pleased with how well we managed the business this quarter in what continues to be a difficult economic environment. During this quarter, we maintained our focus on reducing our annual expense run rate, while continuing to invest in our strategic growth areas. Our solid results in Q4 FY '09 once again showcased our ability to manage profitably across varying economic cycles while delivering innovative products and services that provide real value to our customers.</p>
          <p>For today's call, I will comment on our fourth quarter financial results, and then on our full year 2009 results. Starting with Q4 results, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $8.5 billion, a decrease of approximately 18% year-over-year, within the range given last quarter of minus 17 to 20%, a tough comparison given Q4 '08 was the highest revenue generating quarter in Cisco's history. Total service revenue was $1.8 billion, up approximately 5% year-over-year. Total product revenue was $6.7 billion, down approximately 22% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Switching revenue was $2.8 billion, a decrease of 20% year-over-year. Modular switching revenue was down 22% year-over-year while fixed switching revenue declined 17% year-over-year. Routing revenue was $1.5 billion, down 27% year-over-year, representing a decrease of 27%, 29%, and 24% year-over-year in high-end, mid-range, and low-end, respectively.</p>
          <p>Advanced Technologies revenue totaled $2 billion, representing a decrease of 19% year-over-year. This was primarily due to declines in video systems of approximately 30%, Unified Communications of approximately 5%, and security of approximately 19%. Other product revenue totaled $387 million, a decrease of 32% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We experienced a decline in total revenue across all geographies on a year-over-year basis. Quarterly revenue declined ranging from 5% in Japan to 38% for our emerging markets theater, with quarterly revenue in the U.S. and Canada theater down 13%, down 20% in Asia-Pacific, and down 19% in our European markets.</p>
          <p>Despite the challenging revenue environment, the strength of our business model enabled us to effectively manage our gross margin. Q4 FY '09 total non-GAAP gross margin was 65.3%, up two-tenths of a point quarter-over-quarter and up 0.4% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>For product only, non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.7%, up one-tenth of a percentage point quarter-over-quarter. For the quarter-over-quarter comparison, favorable product mix and cost savings offset by increased discounts and lower pricing.</p>
          <p>Our non GAAP service margin for the fourth quarter was 67.5%, that was up from 67% last quarter, and 63.1% in Q4 fiscal year '08. Service margin performance quarter-over-quarter was due to strong margins as a result of higher revenues in technical support services. Service margin performance year-over-year was better than expected due to strong margins in both technical support services, and advanced services from cost improvements, combined with higher than expected mix of our technical support versus our advanced services.</p>
          <p>Total gross margin by theater ranged from approximately 58.6% for emerging markets to approximately 72.9% in Japan. Gross margins improved on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the U.S. and Canada and Japan however, Asia-Pacific, emerging markets and European markets saw declines in gross margins on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to increased discounts. In emerging markets, we saw some additional decline in margins as a result of an increase in deferred revenue as it related to our financing programs.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $3.3 billion in Q4 that was up $200 million quarter-over-quarter as expected due to project related spending, seasonality of our variable compensation and certain real estate charges partially offset by benefits from our lower head count. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 39.2% in Q4 '09 versus 35.3% in Q4 '08 within the range that we provided last quarter.</p>
          <p>In the current environment, we have focused on operational efficiency and expense management as mentioned in our prior call. To that end Cisco employees have clearly responded by exceeding our stretch goal to remove $1.5 billion from our annual run rate of operating expenses. I would like to take a moment to really thank and congratulate our employees for their exceptional efforts achieving this goal.</p>
          <p>Interest and other income was $73 million for Q4, which was higher than expected reflecting one-time realized gains of $41 million from some of our investment sales. Our Q4 FY '09 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 20%, lower than last quarter, due largely to favorable tax benefit rising from our state audit settlements. As we communicated earlier in Q4, we did take a one-time GAAP tax charge related to a change in the tax treatment of share-based compensation as a result of a court case between Xilinx and the Internal Revenue Service. The impact to Q4 was $174 million to the GAAP income statement and $550 million to our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion representing a decline of 23% year-over-year. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 21.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter was $0.31, versus $0.40 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, a 23% decline year-over-year.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, as compared to $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter were $0.19 versus $0.33 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2008. For Q4 '09 there was a $0.12 difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share. Approximately $0.07 is related to our expected GAAP to non-GAAP differences, such as stock compensation, amortization of purchased intangible, IP R&amp;D and an intangible asset impairment, $0.03 related to the tax matter discussed previously and $0.02 related to a voluntary early retirement program we extended to eligible U.S. and Canada employees this quarter. The additional items this quarter were unusual occurrences outside the ordinary costs of business therefore, they were excluded from our non-GAAP earning.</p>
          <p>Now switching to our full year performance. Total revenue for fiscal year 2009 was $36.1 billion, a decrease of approximately 9% over fiscal year '08 revenue of $39.5 billion. Routing revenue ended the year at 6.3 billion, down 21% year-over-year, switching revenue was 12 billion, a decrease of 11% from last year and advanced technologies revenue was down 4% year-over-year to $9.2 billion. Total service revenue was approximately $7 billion growth of 8% in fiscal year 2009. Total non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal year 2009 was 65%, down one tenth of a point year-over-year. For product only non-GAAP gross margin was down seven-tenths of a point year-over-year due to the discount, pricing, lower volume and mix partially offset by cost savings.</p>
          <p>The total service growth margins were up 3.4% points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 13.7 billion in FY '09 that was down from 14.1 billion in FY '08. The year-over-year decline was due primarily to savings from discretionary savings, favorable foreign exchange, as well as lower head count.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2009 was $8 billion down approximately 17% from fiscal year 2008 non-GAAP net income of $9.6 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for fiscal year 2009 were $1.35, that was down from $1.56 in fiscal year 2008 representing a 13% decrease year-over-year.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income for fiscal year 2009 was $6.1 billion or $1.05 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to 8.1 billion or $1.31 per share on a fully diluted basis in fiscal 2008, representing 24% and 20% decreases year-over-year, respectively.</p>
          <p>Product backlog at the end of fiscal year 2009 was $3.9 billion, as compared to 4.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2008. Our backlog as a percentage of our Q4 product revenue was approximately 59% and up 3 percentage points from Q4 '08. This level of backlog combined with our product and service deferral revenue position, really positions us well as we enter fiscal year 2010.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the balance-sheet. Our balance-sheet continues to be strong providing us with significant financial flexibility <mark type="audio gap" /> by continued economic pressures we have continued to strengthen key financial metrics. Total of cash, cash equivalents, and investments for the quarter were $35 billion. I t was up 1.4 billion from last quarter. Of this total balance 5.9 billion was held within the United States at the end of Q4. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was approximately $2 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance was $3.2 billion at the end of Q4. At the end of Q4 our days sales outstanding or DSO was 34 days driven by the timing of service billing to the latter part of the quarter offset by very strong collections. This compares to 27 days in Q3 '09 and 34 days in Q4 '08.</p>
          <p>Total inventory at the end of Q4 was $1.1 billion; that was up slightly quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP inventory turns were 11.3 this quarter, up six-tenths of a point, compared to last quarter and down three-tenths of a point, compared to Q4 of last year. Our inventory management as measured by turns remains world-class. Inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q4 were $2.2 billion, a 2% reduction from the end of Q3.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, we repurchased 800 million of common stock or 42 million shares at an average price of $19.02 per share. And we ended the quarter with approximately 4.8 billion remaining in the current stock repurchase authorization.</p>
          <p>Deferred revenue was $9.4 billion at the end of Q4 '09, an increase of approximately 6% year-over-year. Deferred product revenue of $2.9 billion and deferred service revenue of $6.5 billion, both increases of approximately 6% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>At the end of Q4, our head count totaled 65,545, a net decrease of 1013 from last quarter. The reduction in head count was a result of our continued pause in external hiring and our limited restructuring. As we communicated in our Q3 '09 earnings call, we do expect &#x2013; we did expect to reduce approximately 1500 to 2000 jobs during Q3 and Q4 timeframe as part of our portfolio realignment. Having completed these higher than normal limited restructuring, we expect the number of jobs reduced to be slightly above high-end of the range.</p>
          <p>In summary, from a financial perspective, we're very pleased with our Q4 and fiscal 2009 results, which illustrate the resiliency of our business model, as well as the strength of our business. While we remain focused in FY '10 on operational excellence and efficiency, we'll continue to make investments in key growth areas across our market adjacencies that we believe will position us and the company overall for long-term success.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back over to John.</p>

          <p>Frank, thank you very much. Well done.</p>
          <p>Now, moving onto a strategy review, discussion of customer segments, geographic and product review. Q4 continued to see the balance between innovation and operational effectiveness in almost every aspect of our business. The innovation and execution has never been broader and more successful: ranging from product announcements, technology architectures, acquisitions, and a rapidly evolving business architecture leadership in our customers' minds.</p>
          <p>Cisco has had a continued explosion of collaboration enabled by networked Web 2.0 technologies in everything we do. Always listen carefully to our customers and in many ways, feedback from our leading edge customers about this activity in Q4 was pivotal. Truly a tipping point in terms of both their understanding and in many cases their commitment to next generation intelligent networks becoming their platform for productivity, standard of living and global competitiveness. The 30-plus new market adjacencies all tie to the common theme of the network becoming the platform for transformation in business models, government services and the connected consumer.</p>
          <p>I would like to articulate and provide additional clarification to our approach to what some of the financial community calls a portfolio growth opportunity in market adjacencies. I would also like to cover several of these market adjacencies with additional color in terms of our progress, goals and objectives. We will continue to do this in most of our conference calls moving forward and highlight in each of them several market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>Our goal is for you to view this as not just a portfolio play of growth opportunities, but also pieces of both a technology and business architecture play that has the potential to power a substantial part of our growth, as well as our traditional core markets. We had a similar approach years ago on a smaller scale where we identified market transitions that extended the role of the network. In other words, they were extensions of our core products. These have been known today as advanced and emerging technologies.</p>
          <p>Today Cisco is focused on how we can use our technology, and solutions to solve the challenges of business, society, government and our communities. As we do this, we are becoming closer to our customers, helping them solve their top issues and increasing our position as a strategic business partner in addition to creating new opportunities where we can extend the role of the network. We call these opportunities market adjacencies and while today many of them may be considered small and fast moving, tomorrow many of them could be billion dollar businesses for Cisco. This is not just a portfolio play, but rather tightly related parts of the portfolio that architecturally come together to increase the potential success of many of our new adjacencies, as well as our traditional markets.</p>
          <p>In some cases, these market adjacencies allow Cisco to lead in key market transitions like video and virtualization or in other cases to open up new markets for us like smart grid and smart connected communities. While others represent new global business models and go-to-market plans like emerging markets in China, India and Mexico and still others refer to how we are transforming Cisco and our own business processes. We see inter-dependencies across these market adjacencies and although each are in different phases of execution, they all build on the increased role of the network. The common thread is the network. It is the platform for growth and innovation.</p>
          <p>In summary today, we are investing in 30-plus new marketing opportunities that are adjacent to our core business and in each of these cases the technology architectures drive innovation in our core products which we believe translates into growth. Assuming we are successful in many of these opportunities, you will see us expand well beyond the 30 that we have today. Our innovative organization structure of councils and boards brings together leaders from across the functions, all of our corporate functions to define, plan, execute and monitor our progress in these market adjacencies. This disciplined approach allows our team to scale and work across the opportunities with both speed, flexibility and then be able to replicate these models quickly.</p>
          <p>You can expect these market adjacencies to become a growing part of our business over time just as the advanced technologies did looking back several years ago. While some of these may be able to be discussed in ways similar to our early advanced technologies, others may not easily be discussed as standalone segments. We will consistently share our position in these markets so you can monitor our progress. These business processes are evolving rapidly in each of the market adjacencies supported by the new organization structure and as such should be considered work in process. We will do our best to give you periodic updates on each of these areas so that you can monitor our progress by both categories and potentially our progress on architectural plays.</p>
          <p>Today, I'd like to cover quickly three market adjacencies examples. Those three are: first, smart connected communities; second, small business; third, smart grids. As a reminder if we hit or exceed 50% of the focus market adjacencies, we will declare success and that if we execute expectations on too many of these market adjacencies, it means we probably did not take enough risk.</p>
          <p>Smart connected communities, we continue to make progress with our initiative to help cities use the network to deliver better city management, enhanced quality of life for citizens, drive economic development and cultivate environmental sustainability. Last quarter we mentioned we had reached an agreement with Incheon, Korea, Mayor Ahn and Gale International a major global city developer. We're proud to announce, we will join them this week in opening the city of Songdo in Incheon where we're Gale's technology partner across the board.</p>
          <p>We expect our partnership with Gale to lead us into several other opportunities around the world as we expand this partnership to go after new projects in China like Meixi Lake project in Changsha, the capital Hunan province.</p>
          <p>Additionally, this quarter we announced the launch of several smart connected community products, such as the Mediator. This product converges 60 plus building systems in onto the IP network ranging from air conditioning, to lighting, security and access control. Similar to how voice services transformed as they came onto the IP network, we're now transforming real estate by bringing building systems onto the network, driving down operational costs, generating additional revenue and decreasing that building's carbon footprint. based on these developments with the appropriate caveats, we're seeing an even larger opportunity for Cisco with Smart Connected Communities from several hundred million dollars, as I mentioned last quarter, to multi-billion dollar opportunities in the next five to ten years.</p>
          <p>Second, small business, we continue to make strong progress in our adjacent small business market, potentially one of the fastest growing growth opportunities for Cisco. Our current market share in most industry analysts' opinion is in the low double-digits and therefore, provides Cisco with an opportunity for growth even if IT spending remains constrained. While small businesses are quick to pull back at the start of a downturn, they traditionally start buying sooner and more broadly as the general economy recovers. We're beginning to see signs of recovery and small businesses are projected to spend over $7 billion on networking technology in 2010.</p>
          <p>Over the past year we've created dedicated teams across all functions to meet the needs of small business customers and the channel partners to serve them. We now offer purpose built, small &#x2013; Cisco Small Business products for customers who want simple but reliable network solutions. As an example in Q4, we introduced the new Cisco ESW 500 switches that are highly competitive based on price, features and support. As a snapshot of what is possible in the future, we could combine our small business products with our investment in cloud services to provide as a service offering to Cisco partners.</p>
          <p>Third: smart grid, in the areas of smart grid, we have well defined vision and strategy, and we're now focused on execution. To the extent our thought leadership developed an ecosystem of partners to drive open standards and deliver an end-to-end solution for our customers. Cisco will lead in defining the end-to-end architecture that will enable our vision of securely managing energy on electrical grids all the way from the generation to the consumption in homes and buildings. These efforts are highlighted by our collaboration with partners Landis+Gyr, IBM and GE, utility partners, such as Florida Power and Light and Duke Energy and standard bodies, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Federal Regulation and Oversight of Energy and the North American Electrical Reliability Corporation. This here smart grid approach is complemented by our recent announcement of smart connected communities and smart connected buildings.</p>
          <p>Our vision and differentiated strategy for each of these market adjacencies is only about a year old. Our ability to move resources quickly to capture market transition is a direct result of the collaborative processes embedded in our councils, boards and working groups and enabled by the way we use network enabled Web 2.0 technologies. As a result, we're making decisions faster and moving with speed, scale, flexibility, and replication, common focus points that you'll hear from us again and again.</p>
          <p>At this time, we will cover our customer segments, geographies, products for Q4 in more detail. The customer segments and geographies will be discussed in terms of orders unless indicated otherwise. The product review will be primarily in revenue growth. First, on customer segments, where the discussion will be measured by both orders year-over-year and sequentially on a global basis. As a general statement, our position in terms of both technology partner and a business partner to our customers and service provider, enterprise and government is continuing to expand in a very positive way.</p>
          <p>Also we have &#x2013; as we have already discussed the numbers in terms of year-over-year growth in these markets are challenging. However, from a sequential order point of view, that is Q3, compared to Q4, we saw double-digit growth in terms of orders in enterprise, commercial and government. Service provider growth continues to be challenging on a global basis with sequential order growth in the low single-digits.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to cover year-over-year growth rates in our customer segments as we have done in prior quarters. Starting with a positive, the public sector was the least impacted by the global economic challenges, all of our customers segments &#x2013; of all of our customer segment markets, but was still down globally 3%. The U.S. public sector which includes both federal and state and local was up 4%. The U.S. federal business was very strong with growth in the mid-teens, Japan was up 28%, Asia-Pacific was down 23% in public sector and Europe was down by 7%. Emerging market public sector was down approximately 19% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In other global customer segments, our enterprise business continued to be tough and was down approximately 30% on a global basis, when, compared to a very strong ending to last year's Q4 FY '08. Service provider spending continued to be tight and down in the upper 20s year-over-year, commercial market was also down in the mid-20s while the consumer was up in the low single-digits.</p>
          <p>Geographies, as a reminder this is how I primarily manage our business-based upon five geographic theaters. This quarter we will give both sequential and year-over-year quarter growth. On a global basis, most of our markets began to stabilize and show sequential Q3 to Q4 improvement. The U.S., Asia-Pacific, Japan and emerging market theaters all grew orders sequentially from Q3 to Q4 in double-digits. The one exception, Europe, continued to be challenged growing sequentially in mid-single-digits.</p>
          <p>As you would expect from a year-over-year perspective, the geographic quarter rate numbers were challenging. The U.S. was down approximately 20%, emerging markets down approximately 30%, Asia-Pacific down in the low 20s, European market was down in the high 20s and Japan was down in the low single-digits.</p>
          <p>The following is a quick summary of year-over-year numbers and as you would expect the geographic order rates by customer segments were, as I said, earlier, challenging. First for the U.S., within the U.S., U.S. enterprise was down mid-20s year-over-year, service provider down mid-30, commercial was down in the mid-20s.</p>
          <p>In Asia-Pacific, enterprise was down year-over-year 30% approximately, service provider was down in the mid-teens, commercial was down in the teens. In emerging markets, enterprise was down approximately 40%, service provider was down in the mid-20s and commercial was down in the mid-30s. In European markets, enterprise was down in the mid-30s, service provider was down approximately 30 and commercial was down approximately 30.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to products, product numbers for Q4 will be in terms of revenue year-over-year, but will be similar to what we saw in customer segments and geographies. Routing was down 27% year-over-year, switching was down approximately 20 and total advanced technologies were down approximately 19% in terms of revenue year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In terms of advanced technologies, video was down 30% year-over-year, Unified Communication was down 5%, wireless was down 19%, security down 19%, and networked home was down 26%, application networking systems was down 27, and storage was down 8%.</p>
          <p>Other products, including WebEx were up 14%. TelePresence revenues were up 97%. In terms of total revenue mix for Q4, routing was approximately 17%, switching was 33, ATs were 24, services 21, and others about 5%.</p>
          <p>In terms of Q3 to Q4 sequential order growth rates, we saw similar balance as we did in our overall business and geographies from an orders perspective with 7 of our top 10 largest products growing sequentially in double-digits. Another point of possible interest is the very positive start we're seeing to our new products in the routing and switching areas, such as the Nexus 5000 and the Nexus 7000, both growing in terms of sequential order rates Q3 to Q4 approximately 100%.</p>
          <p>ASR 1000 is off to a great start with over 1,000 customers of which approximately 220 are service providers. It is growing year-over-year in terms of orders at above 80%. And finally, the ASR 9000, while it's too early to say for sure, it's off to a very solid start both in terms of opportunities and customer acceptance.</p>
          <p>The customer acceptance of these new products combined with the continued success of our high-end routers and switches, such as CRS-1 in terms of orders, the CRS-1 grew in excess of 25% in the quarter year-over-year, including more multi chassis sales this year than in all prior years combined. I believe these trends signal a good chance of future market share gains both in routing and switching categories.</p>
          <p>Now, on to vision strategy and execution. In summary, although we would all like to avoid the downturn, our vision of how the industry is going to evolve appears to be playing out very much as we expected. We believe our differentiated strategy is also achieving the benefits to both Cisco and our customers that we thought was possible.</p>
          <p>And finally, our execution is on target in terms of results as measured by customer partnerships perspective, market share and share of our customers' total communications and IT expenditures, as the network becomes the platform for delivering these capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll it over to Frank for some additional details on both financial guidance and other financial highlights. Frank, to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. It continues to be difficult to provide a forecast given the variability and the uncertainties going on in the market. These events increase the potential that our actual results could vary materially from our expectations. Therefore, we anticipate total revenue for the first quarter to be down approximately 15 to 17% year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, we expect to see approximately 1 to 3% growth.</p>
          <p>At this point, let me remind you that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you some additional details on our Q1 financial guidance. As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margins has always been challenging due to various factors, such as volume, product mix, variable comp costs, customer and channel mix, as well as competitive pricing pressure. That being said, we believe that total gross margin in Q1 will be approximately 64% reflecting the revenue guidance I just shared with you.</p>
          <p>With recent acquisitions, our entry into some lower margin markets, gross margin could be negatively impacted by our product mix. We believe Q1 operating expenses will be approximately 38 to 39% of revenue. This Q1 guidance reflects the saving from lower head count and discretionary spending reductions, reflective of the expense management initiatives that we complete in fiscal year '09, partially offset by some seasonality of our Q1 expenses.</p>
          <p>We expect interest and other income to be approximately 25 million in the first quarter. Our tax provision rate for Q1 is expected to be approximately 22%.</p>
          <p>While, we expect to continue our share repurchase program, it is difficult to predict the exact weighted average shares outstanding. We are modeling share count to be up approximately 50 million shares quarter-over-quarter in weighted average shares outstanding for EPS purposes. In this estimate of share count, we are not taking into consideration any further change in stock price that could occur in the first quarter of FY '10.</p>
          <p>As a point of reference, a $1 movement in our average stock price would change the calculated shares outstanding for purposes of determining earnings per share by approximately 14 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash flow from operations, we would expect to generate 1.2 billion to 1.5 billion during the first quarter. For our Q1 F '10 GAAP earnings we anticipate that GAAP EPS will be $0.05 to $0.07 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS, primarily due to acquisition related charges, stock compensation expenses. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.</p>
          <p>Other than those items noted above, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring, and tax or other events which may or may not be significant.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back to John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, thank you very much. The following is a summary of my view of Cisco's momentum and opportunities entering Q1 of fiscal year 2010. In areas that Cisco can control or influence, our leadership from a product perspective, innovation, architecture and operational execution, not only continues to be solid, as we said, before, but also our customers are beginning to grasp the productivity implications and the importance of both the technology and architectural play.</p>
          <p>As we said, before, even if the market slowdown continues, we don't see this changing our long-term growth opportunities. If we execute the way that we have in prior slowdowns and assuming the global economy recovers to GDP growth rates similar to those in the middle of the decade, as we continue into Q1 FY '10, we plan to aggressively invest in new and adjacent markets for the longer run.</p>
          <p>On a global and U.S. basis, we continue to see the same challenges and uncertainties from an economic, political and capital spending perspective that many of you continue to witness. However, on a global basis, we are starting to see potential positive trends in Asia-Pacific, U.S., emerging markets and Japan. We continue to see Europe, especially the U.K. to still be in a very challenging business environment.</p>
          <p>Again, we want to thank the Cisco family for working together as a team to ensure that our company is in solid position to not only weather the challenging economic environment but even more importantly to be ready to accelerate as the market turns. I know it has not been easy and we are working hard to maintain our culture of innovation plus a stretch goal mentality in giving back, all during tough periods or times for ourselves, our families and our friends.</p>
          <p>As we continue to aggressively invest, we will also continue to maintain our focus on our financial models. Once again, with our usual caveats as discussed earlier and in our financial reports, our Q1 fiscal year 2010 guidance is for year-over-year revenue to decrease in the 15 to 17% range. We believe our long-term growth opportunities remain in the 12 to 17% range, again assuming our usual caveats and normal global GDP growth.</p>
          <p>We will focus on what we can control and influence and attempt to position Cisco to gain momentum in market transitions, whether they are industry consolidation, product transitions, market adjacency opportunities or economic. In summary, for those areas that we can control and influence, we believe our vision, strategy and execution are in great shape and producing results.</p>
          <p>We were very pleased with our results and saw a number of positive signs in this quarter in the economy and in our business, especially comparing the sequential order results from Q3 to Q4. If we continue to see these positive trends for the next one to two quarters, we believe there is a good chance we will look back and see that the tipping point occurred in Q4.</p>
          <p>As we look back on fiscal year '09, we are pleased to have successfully demonstrated our ability to make difficult decisions and to tightly manage our business during one of the most economically challenging periods in our history. We enthusiastically kick off fiscal year 2010, a year that promises new market transitions and milestones, including the celebration of Cisco's 25th anniversary as a business.</p>
          <p>This year we intend to celebrate a quarter century of being a company that stands for innovation, operational excellence and integrity. Cisco continues to be nimble, flexible and customer driven, which has always been core to our culture.</p>
          <p>I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions to our success as we celebrate the past and build towards our 25th anniversary together. As always, I want to also thank our shareholders, customers, Cisco family and partners for their support and continued confidence in our ability to execute during rapid industry consolidation, market transitions and challenging economic times.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I was wondering if you could give some comments on both the underlying business trends, your guidance for sequential growth and the margin you guided to? Just in a very quick calculation, even if I assume all your new revenue comes from the acquisitions and from the new areas you're entering and if those products have 20% gross margins, pretty hard to get down to 64% given what you just put up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, a bunch of questions, I'll combine them into one answer. First, if you look at what Frank and I outlined, we patterned revenue for Q1 very similar to what we've seen during normal time periods, which is flat to up perhaps $100 million. That's a pretty aggressive and bold statement within it.</p>
          <p>In terms of our margins, we think overall as you get a mix of consumer products, and software products coming together, as we said, in last quarter conference call 63 to 64% is what we would normally model. We're saying we're at the high end of that for this quarter in terms of the balance.</p>
          <p>In terms of mix, Jeff, I wish I could tell you we're accurate in the pick. We'll tell you now that we'll get the total numbers right the majority of the time. Our mixes are all over the place in terms of balance. So, maybe in a callback or a one-on-one session Frank could go into more details on it, but I think the combination does round up, and we've been through the numbers pretty carefully together to what we outlined.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Paul Silverstein, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. You may ask your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, two related questions: one, can you give you little more color on the order trends inter-quarter, what you saw from the beginning of the quarter to the end both on a global and a regional basis? And related to that, you talked about a normal period but we're in &#x2013; what everybody knows has been an extraordinarily non-normal period, and if in fact, we're coming out &#x2013; and I recognize it's still early days &#x2013; but I'm not sure I understand the normal seasonal commentary in that context.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know Paul its new data points and Blair warned me ahead of time I've got to be careful in how I walk through it. But our quarters are remarkably predictable in each of the quarters during normal times in terms of what occurs in Q4 and Q1 and Q2 and Q3. This year very candidly, Q1, Q2 and Q3 were below those normal sequential growths by 10 to 15%, Q4 was the exact opposite. It was right on par, approximately 10% growth Q3 to Q4 when I take everything into consideration that I measure.</p>
          <p>In terms of the balance and the linearity, it was very solid and much in line of what we expected and we ran &#x2013; if I remember Frank and Rob, we ran above forecast almost for every week of every quarter, which is usually what happens when a sales force is on a trend. Though within that, Paul, last quarter I was the kind of worried that we signaled a potential leveling off, although no one knows for sure.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we're clearly signaling a potential tipping point headed to the upside, although we'd want to see it for couple of more quarters that we see in front of us. The balance was good on a geographic basis in terms of the sequential trends and the one exception is Europe which I think we've got a great team in, but Europe seems to be running a couple of quarters behind the rest of world; they were a couple of quarters late in seeing the economic slowdown, and they'll probably be a couple of quarters late in coming out of it.</p>
          <p>So, Paul I hope that helps clarify it a little bit more, and I thank you for the question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I also wanted to dig into the gross margin trends. First on the quarter where there was some pricing pressure but it seemed that, that was more than offset by the mix, can you just comment if that pricing pressure was downturn driven, in other words, customer driven versus competitive, from some of the new more aggressive competitors you have in all the various markets?</p>
          <p>And related to that, if you can just give us your best estimate of your long-term gross margin trajectory taking into account some of the new businesses you're getting into?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Simona, when you look at our pricing pressures they were very much normal for us given tough economic times. Cisco sells on architecture, solutions, value-added capability, integration, investment protection, and most of our competitors come at us with very aggressive pricing. That's especially true in emerging markets and in Asia.</p>
          <p>In terms of the trends, we didn't see anything abnormal. We actually, as we said, saw gross margins stay very, very solid. Probably the area that's under the most pressure is service providers. That tends to be a more price sensitive market, especially in Asia, and I think you saw that in terms of our gross margins in Asia, but overall, this is business as normal. Again Rob's team is very good about selling architectures and value-added plays.</p>
          <p>To your indirect part of your question Simona, price is more of an advantage in terms of our competitors coming at us during the very tough economic times than it is normal times. So I'm very pleased with what we did on both market share, our win rates, our positioning overall, and we'll continue to come down Moore's law in terms of price performance but our ability to maintain our margins I think is world-class and very comfortable overall. So as you begin to expand it overall, it's more a mix issue. I don't see abnormal pressure. You do see the pressure in different areas as we move forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I had a question on the quality of orders or maybe the profile of orders for next quarter. First, can you speak about orders obtained from end customers versus orders that came from channel? Have you seen any change in the channel inventory level? And second, related to this is, when you look at this quarter orders, sorry, revenues, Advanced Technologies went down sequentially while the legacy parts went up sequentially, do you see it reversing the next quarter based on the orders you're seeing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tal, a number of questions. In terms of the key trends, we take channel inventory into consideration as we give our guidance, and as we talk about sequentially the numbers. You did see orders start to replenish in the channel. We reflect that out in terms of our guidance and direction, but it does indicate increased channel confidence, and we saw that consistently throughout the quarter to answer your question very directly.</p>
          <p>The other parts, Frank, any comments?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing, John, I would add as far as the channel inventory I mean, the channel inventory remained about consistent where they are taking control of the inventory and managing that well and we had some good sell-through... <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Rob wouldn't say this directly, but I will. I think the channel programs have been world class. We've been making it pretty tough on our peers in terms of competing very aggressively on the channels. We have great channel loyalty and our programs have been very effective. We've seen some of our peers have to adjust their strategies based upon that, Tal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John. Are we starting to see the very early signs of an acceleration in month-to-month orders replacing their return to normal order seasonality. Can you extrapolate this trajectory in orders, which means it's a very near term quarter, where revenues will no longer be down year-over-year? And recognizing the improved magnitude of visibility, perhaps you can comment on the length of your visibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the trends are absolutely in a positive scenario. If you play out the numbers as we've outlined and if the market &#x2013; if you look back two quarters from now and the next few quarters go as we all hope that they will, we'll view this as a tipping point and more a return to normal growth. Time will tell what that growth range is during normal times. I personally believe it will be in the 12 to 17% as we look out one to two to three years into normal economic type of activity.</p>
          <p>Now remember, it does vary based on seasonality. So we're forecasting a very solid Q1-based upon normal growth time periods, when we forecast revenue flat, or up 1 or 2 percentage points, Frank and I are forecasting it up one to three in terms of the direction. So it goes back to one of your colleagues, I think it was Mark's comments about our seasonality was very much in line during the quarter, and we would hope that that continues through Q1. But Q1 is traditionally our weakest quarter as you come off a very, very strong Q4 into getting the machines started, getting the cycles going again, et cetera.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. You mentioned earlier, John, that pricing pressure was pretty much business as usual, perhaps outside of Asia-Pac, service provider. Can you talk specifically about the layer 2, layer 3 switching business, and what you're seeing from HP ProCurve in terms of price competition on product sales, service, and warranties, and what you're doing to combat that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, I'm going to expand your question, Rich, I'll do the reverse, I'll answer two questions at once and Blaire will probably shoot me afterwards. If you look at where we are versus our competition on both switching and routing, I'm very comfortable with where we are. First, you start from a structural point of view, we've reorganized engineering and evolved it, I think pretty smoothly, into one group owning the service provider and the routing products, and other group owning the vast majority of our switching products within the area, Ned owning the consumer, as well as the Chief Strategy Officer role. Kathy, the central organization, Marthin the new emerging technology and candidly, that's playing out very well.</p>
          <p>As we did that first in the service provider routing segment, you began to see our positions in the industry and our product architectures tie very tightly together. And as I alluded to earlier, with the key products, with both the CRS success, but also how our ASR 1000 products and the 9000 are playing out, it's always possible I get surprised, but I think we're going to get an increasing share of our wallet spend of our customers in the routing area over &#x2013; as you look into Q1, Q2 and Q3.</p>
          <p>In switching, I think we're doing well, especially in the data center, and Rob I'm going to ask you to comment maybe about data center overall a little bit here in a second. But if you watch it where we are in terms of the Nexus 7000, tying very tightly to the Nexus 5000, tying very tightly to the Nexus 2000 tying that to our strategy in terms of the server integrated communication solutions, et cetera. We saw both very good business results, and candidly, I feel very, very good about where we are on these individual products.</p>
          <p>In terms of specific comments about key competitors, I think we're doing extremely well in our channel programs, and candidly, it's something that we enjoy a good competitor in but if you watch what we're doing on the channels, we're not only holding our own, I think in most of the surveys that have come out when they talk about where we are in terms of gaining share in the data center, and in the architectural play and server technologies, et cetera, they're saying the odds of us being successful are very high, and they've pretty candid. They think that's much higher than our peers' ability to come into our traditional market. We have a lot of respect for large peers, they're very, very good in the marketplace, but we're more than holding our own, both on the competitive landscape, as well as the channels.</p>
          <p>Rob, expanding that into the data center a little bit, your thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John, in addition to our traditional very strong market position with the Catalyst products, 6K and 4K, our security and applications, our new portfolio is doing very well. We had a record quarter with the Nexus 7000, which is our core data center switch and interestingly enough, market acceptance is high in all market segments: commercial, enterprise and service provider.</p>
          <p>You already mentioned the 5K and 2K combination of Unified Fabric and Fabric Extension, approaching a thousand customers with that technology. The 1K received its first orders this quarter, which is our virtualized &#x2013; our virtual machine soft switch, and that's off to a good start and then we're beginning to see obviously in the latter half of this quarter, our first orders for unified computing.</p>
          <p>Over the next several quarters, we'll be increasing the availability of that technology across more markets. We'll be introducing, in addition to our current blade model, a series of new rack models and I think our real opportunity there is the architecture is resonating with customers with our partners, the system integrators and with service providers and I think the next couple of quarters is all about execution. So time will tell but we're seeing very good market acceptance on our data center portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Rich if we don't have good big competitors in each of the market we're moving into from the home, to the switching to the data centers, to the smart grid, we're probably in the wrong market. So the good news is we don't lack for competition.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Could I ask about the cash, just if you could repeat the U.S. portion, and what level of your U.S. cash you feel comfortable?</p>
          <p>And John, I thought I heard you say at a recent conference, maybe I heard it wrong that, at that time you had 33 billion in cash and that Cisco would be aggressive, and don't expect us to end the year with 33 billion in cash. I took that to mean that the cash balance would come down either due to acquisitions or buybacks, and the cash balance continues to grow. So, can you revisit what you said, and what you meant there or maybe I just heard it wrong? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nikos, you heard the concept right and remember the year is the calendar year in terms of the direction, and it wasn't so much the year as we'd be disappointed if we came out of this second economic downturn, and as you look back a couple of years from now, I'd be surprised to see our cash at that level.</p>
          <p>In terms of the utilization of the cash, 6 billion, if I remember right, is in the U.S., Frank? And about 29 outside the U.S. Ned, maybe some comments a little bit as your role of Chief Strategy Officer and my key investment officer, your thoughts a little bit about where you see us going with some of the cash from an investments or acquisition or a partnering type role?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John. So first thing I would say is clearly, we continued to be aggressive throughout the downturn in expanding ourselves into the markets and then you did good job of highlighting three of the market adjacencies we're pushing into today. We've been able to use our cash, both to create partnerships and do emerging technology investments, as well as acquisitions like Tidal Software which <mark type="inaudible" /> that you talked about. So, we're not going to spend cash just to spend cash and across the whole scale of investment, we have a big set of opportunities. I mean, across the priorities that we've outlined. We focus on virtualization and data center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just, Nikos, being very candid, because we've known each other for a long time, we needed to get our organization structures right both in engineering and the field. We needed to get a structure that can support the 30-plus market adjacencies, and began to outline a vision of where we wanted to go and a differentiated strategy in each one of those. And then you begin to add your investment into that play. To do it in reverse order would get you into a lot of trouble. So, it's a nice way of saying I would look at it as having our deck's pretty cleared. The aircraft carrier pointing in the right direction, into the wind, and over the next period of 6, 12, 18 months I think you will see us be aggressive. I would say we've been very aggressive in how fast we moved on our priorities and architectural plays. And, Ned, any last thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the other thing I would just say, John, is the valuation is very, very important as the market has moved up ahead of some of the performance of companies. We expect to be able to do deals at the right price and we're going to continue to be disciplined in that regard as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I was hoping we could drill down on the data center opportunities that we've talked about in the past and revisit that, particularly in light of some of the more recent data on the &#x2013; maybe the biggest spenders like Google and Microsoft that basically sound like they're going to spend less money on their data center initiatives over the next year, or even Microsoft talking about fiscal 2011 being flat. Can you help me step back and look at maybe a bigger picture? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. You know if you look at the overall play in the data center, I think the play is an absolute number play, but it's also what does the next generation data center look like? In our opinion, it's clearly going to be rapid blurring of the network, the processor capability, the storage capability, the software that goes with it and that virtualization, as we like to call it, will extend all the way into the home. That is right in our sweet spot in terms of what we do as a company.</p>
          <p>In terms of our market share, outside of the network and the data center, it is really small and we're clearly taking on some very big traditional players there. But if you begin to think about our ability to grow the UCS system or the ability to grow an architectural play in the data center, suddenly we're playing for 100 million, 200 million, 300 million type of opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now, without mentioning companies by specific names, but at least in one of the scenarios that you talked about, I'd be surprised if we don't expand our market share outside of our traditional areas dramatically as we move forward. So all of a sudden, we're a player in the data center in terms of permission to participate. The customers have been remarkably receptive to us playing here. We're in very good shape in term of our initial pilots and programs.</p>
          <p>Now we've got to deliver on those, and if we do, you've seen the surveys, as well as I have, most of the enterprise customers are giving us an opening that if we make our initial project successful and both the Nexus plays and the UCS plays, we're going to get a chance to play much more aggressively, even if the market were to stay at a given static level. 85 billion is a lot of money of which we're getting very small slice of the pie today.</p>
          <p>Nice way of saying, Simon, if we execute, the growth areas for us are really, really exciting and repeating the common themes, you're seeing, in our products in this area, growth rates of 100% quarter-over-quarter, granted off of a small base.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, you mentioned earlier, you'd seen your first orders for unified computing. We've been hearing that you're starting to see some traction in the Fortune 50 with perhaps trials moving into orders. Can you talk a little bit about that, and when do you expect this to be significant to Cisco as a business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I want to be careful. I obviously know exactly what our forecast is by quarter. But when you're starting off of a base of, like just for mathematical purposes, say 10 million trying to predict when it hits $100 million curve by quarter and beyond. I think it will be significant absolutely this year, probably the second half of the year is when you'll begin to see the volumes really come into play on it, if we are successful on our initial implementation. I think it's very fair, Brian, for us in each of the quarters to take it beyond the concept type of approach to a little bit more meat.</p>
          <p>I can tell you that the initial systems that have gone into production are going very well. And again, repeating the common theme, the customers have given us absolute permission to come in here. It is a cool architecture and with a lot of investment protection on it.</p>
          <p>Rob, anything you'd want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, actually to our pleasure, some of our initial orders are coming from medium-sized enterprise accounts, and I think the question was: will we see the breakthroughs in some of the Fortune 50? Obviously, they're going to take a little bit longer to evaluate an architecture, and we do expect we're going to see some really interesting wins, especially when the use case is virtualization, and especially when we're looking at enterprise applications that will be delivered inside the construct of a private cloud. That seems to be where we're finding the sweet spot. We're also finding tremendous traction with our service providers that are looking at delivering, hosting, and enterprise cloud-based services. So I think we're going to see some good progress, and the initial acceptance is happening very much with our channel partners, and in some of our medium sized enterprise accounts.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi. Thanks very much, John. I am wondering if you could go into your deferred revenue performance a little bit more. What are some of the things that are driving the sequential increase, and how we should think about that in terms of your own visibility? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, very much. Thank you, John. So Jeff, as I mentioned in the script that we went through, if you look at our deferred revenue on a year-on-year basis, it was up 6% on the product side and 6% on the services side. As you know, what really contributes to the deferred revenue is when we have more complex transactions that have to be deferred from a revenue standpoint. We tend to see this a lot from a service perspective, as far as anything that we look at solution transactions and then we also look at on the product side as far as any complex deal that has some revenue recognition items.</p>
          <p>I think it also shows that as you look through the quarter, we've continued to see some good opportunities that we expect to see over a longer period of time, which I think is where the deferred revenue comes in and as I also mentioned if you look at our backlog that we ended the year at, plus if you take on the growth in our deferred revenue for the quarter, which again, is little bit of an improvement in the trend that we saw versus Q3, I think that really bodes well as far as what we have in the backlog moving into the new fiscal year.</p>

That really hasn't occurred over the last few quarters and I am curious with your move into sort of these 30 new adjacencies, if your thinking has shifted to more gaining overall wallet share as opposed to maybe making sure you remain number one and two in every single one of these markets?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>John, very fair question. First, I intend to be number one r number two in the vast majority of markets we go into. Our vision, differentiated strategy and execution in each of these areas requires that. If we are not able to do that we will, as we did with optical, out of the six advanced technologies that's still important to us, but we'll pull it off the mainstream group and focus on the other five.</p>
          <p>Two, our position on share; I feel very comfortable with where we are in terms of our product, plans and strategy in routing and as I mentioned earlier as we did the organizational evolution several years ago with Penkaj and Tony heading up the group, we are now seeing the products roll out which give us architectural play as opposed to being developed in multiple organizations within our team. And with all the appropriate caveats, we're not only gaining wallet share within the customers, I feel good about where we are in the value-added strategy overall.</p>
          <p>Switching, we're doing well in a couple of the categories; a couple of areas I want to see us do better in, but you now look and you look within Tony Bates heading up all of our enterprise strategy, vast majority of our switching products which used to be across four or five groups largely underneath, Tony and John McCool, the exception being obviously what Mario is doing in terms of the data center. I think you will us execute equally as effectively there, but I think in switching you'll see market share by product categories first before you'll see it in terms of a total type of approach to the market.</p>
          <p>In terms of new market adjacencies, when we enter them I want to be one or two. They've got to play together. Everything we do in these market adjacencies, if they're done right, will build a technology architecture where the interdependencies between them become pretty exciting. Now, I realize no one else in the industry believes that or is building their strategy that way. I think that's a mistake, personally and I'm very comfortable with where we are, John. But stay tuned, continue to push me each quarter, see if we get the results or not and hopefully when we talk about Q1, we'll have some numbers that point towards your fair challenge.</p>

          <p>Great. I think we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, last one second time in a row.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. Wanted to focus a little bit more on your gross margin guidance for the next quarter, get a little bit more color product versus service where you expect the big movement downward?</p>
          <p>And also, you mentioned, if I'm not mistaken, that emerging markets are part &#x2013; a significant contributor to that decline. But it seems like the order patterns are very bad in that region and have been so for some time; doesn't seem like there's a bottom to the year-over-year decline in order pattern. So, is there some sort of a strong bounce back you expect in the emerging markets next quarter that the order patterns are just not telling us? If you can reconcile the gross margin with that, that will be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I am going to talk a little bit in general terms and then, Blair, I get to ask a question at the end. So, if you look at where we're going in emerging markets I am actually comfortable that if you see the trends continue, just like they did this last quarter, you saw Q3 being the area where it leveled off and Q4 sequentially being the first time it turned up. The emerging markets did the same thing that the U.S. did, as did Asia-Pacific, et cetera in terms of sequential order growth in the double-digits. So, it actually saw the same trends.</p>
          <p>Now, to the second part of the question you are seeing in emerging markets unless they are a oil producing type of environment, et cetera, their budgets both of government and their core businesses got squeezed much tougher than many of the developed countries world's did, and so their ability to respond back becomes more a challenging on it, but I am pretty comfortable with where we are in emerging.</p>
          <p>The markets that I'm actually concerned about that are going to probably lag by a couple of quarters the rest of the world are in Europe. and again, that's not an execution on our team's part, I've got a great team over there and Rob has a great team. I just think they were couple of quarters later going into this and you are seeing some pretty severe challenges in the U.K, Spain, and Italy. You have countries like Germany, that I think are managing through and are doing pretty well, but in total Western Europe and Eastern Europe I think are our challenge.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margin analysis, it's a mix issue as much as anything, and to me trending down or not. I would think 63, 64, and we clearly gave a margin indication for this next quarter, at the higher end of that. Now, we will have different mix issues which contribute to that, but I think these are pretty solid margins given the new markets we're moving into, the volume we're into et cetera.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, let me just add two things, one on the product side on the gross margin, as I mentioned we now have some recent organizations &#x2013; acquisitions that we brought into the business, which will have a negative impact on the mix, as well as some of the new products especially in some of the adjacent markets that we talked about, as they are early in their lifecycle, as well as the margin structure on those are lower. That plays into the mix on the product side.</p>
          <p>And then the other thing quickly I wanted to say on the service side is that as we have been mentioning now for a couple of quarters, we're investing heavily in Advanced Services primarily in support of data centers. We started bringing on additional head count in the Q3-Q4 timeframe that are going to be impacting the costs in Q1 that will bring the margins down on service side primarily because of the additional costs but it's also going to change the mix between our technical services and our Advanced services which do tend to have lower margins. So those are the dynamics that we're taking into consideration in the guidance that we provided for Q1.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and the one question I didn't get, Blair &#x2013; and Ittai, thank you very much &#x2013; is where we're going with cloud, some of these new architectures and how our strategy in cloud really pulls in many of the other strategies in many areas. Padma, maybe if you could give us a snapshot on that since you're leading the strategy for me on cloud and the implementation and a little bit how it might tie to some of the other things we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you, John. Cloud is &#x2013; we believe is perhaps one of the most network-centric architectural shifts that we're going see in the IT industry in a long time. And the reason we believe that to be the case is virtualization is going to be the foundation to drive that, and so UCS becomes a core element from an architecture perspective in how we can enable large enterprises to build their own private clouds, as well as service providers to provide the capability of virtual private clouds to enterprises and small businesses.</p>
          <p>Our cloud strategy is to link from an infrastructure perspective what we're doing in the data center all the way to the application delivery through SaaS, with the SaaS offerings that we currently have with WebEx conferencing, security as a service with IronPort, and some of the other capabilities. The key differentiation that we are focused on with respect to the network enablement is in providing security, which is a key concern of most enterprises in today architecture with Cloud, as well as enabling higher levels of service agreements and providing the interoperability between different Cloud architectures.</p>

          <p>So, an area to kind of stay tuned on and Blair let me give it back to you. You ran this exactly on time and you didn't have to nudge me except once or twice, so let's keep the pace going.</p>
