        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure for us to see you with G&#xE9;rard Lamarche and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli to run through our 2009 results and talk to you about the outlook for GDF SUEZ. This is the first full year after creation of the group in July of 2008. This has also, of course, been a year of very large scale crisis everywhere including in energy.</p>
          <p>This is a time we were able to really test the GDF SUEZ business model. And I do think we can say, if you look at today's results, we see very well that the model had held up well. It's the right relevant model we have at GDF SUEZ. Our strategy we have implemented is the right one, which is based on some principles of balance being ambitious and dynamic.</p>
          <p>So we're talking about a balance in our industrial activities, which cover the entire energy value chain in all geographic locations, there is a balance between capital intensive activities and services activities and a further balance in terms of our financial management which makes certain that our balance sheet is sound on firm ground with significant cash flow.</p>
          <p>This is another balance in terms of our labor model without which you can't really have a corporate project. Our intention, our ambition is -what we set our sights on. These are industrial projects. These are also questions of security of service and quality of service for our customers and thanks to our momentum, our dynamic approach we can say as of now that some of the upheaval we've just gone through, we've been able to turn around into opportunities that we've been able to position ourselves in new markets where growth has already resumed or maybe it continue apace all the while.</p>
          <p>So we're complying with these true principles, which means we are a very maneuverable group, fleet footed. I'd like to focus on three main points today through messages. Firstly, our development model has made it possible for us at GDF SUEZ to continue growth in 2009. If you look at our results, growth compared to 2008. And I would repeat it was a record year, it was really a historic year. At that time the commodities prices where unusually high. In 2009 our performance &#x2013; I really have to underscore this, is really organic performance.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we continued our ambitious industrial development, which will be the foundation for our future growth. Furthermore in 2009, we made some progress in our relations with the regulatory authorities and the domestic market authorities in France and Belgium and elsewhere in Europe. We made things clear, in terms of our group's prospects in that respect.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we maintain very dynamic growth objectives for 2010, 2011 and further years. These objectives now include what we're observing i.e. factor in a longer lasting deterioration than expected and various exogenous factors pertaining to gas for instance. You saw the effect of this and these factors in the past year.</p>
          <p>Now let's just quickly run through some of the key figures or highlights. EBITDA &#x20AC;14 billion which is slightly up compared to the record year of 2008. That's what we had committed to and we made good on that commitment in spite of a difficult macro economic context and this was all done organically.</p>
          <p>The recurring net income group share is also slightly up, &#x20AC;4.2 billion. Free cash flow has gone up very strongly of about &#x20AC;10 billion, well above expectations. Now, our net capital expenditure, approximately &#x20AC;9 billion, so as you can see, we're rolling out our CapEx program. Covering a two year period, 2008, 2009, we now stand at 20 billion out of the two &#x2013; from the two year period which makes perfect sense. The overall program is 30 billion over three years of 2008, 2009, 2010.</p>
          <p>Our gearing ratio is down slightly, 45.7% under half of our shareholder's equity &#x2013; 45.7%, sorry. Our debts remained almost stable, we basically self financed our industrial development and payout to shareholders. We've got the best financial structure today in the entire industry.</p>
          <p>We are proposing a dividend, the Board of Directors made this decision yesterday. We are proposing a dividend per share of &#x20AC;1.47. The dividend is up once again, growing by 5%. This is very much our commitment to annual growth of 10% during the period 2008, 2010 in spite of the period of severe crisis. The benchmark was the dividend paid by Gaz de France in 2007 which is &#x20AC;1.1 per share. So we met that commitment of an annual average growth of 10%.</p>
          <p>These results are thanks to our integrated business model which entails a great deal of synergy, complementary business activities both regulated and non-regulated. This is also helped by our footprint which is really quite diversified.</p>
          <p>What I'm really trying to drive home here is that our results are sustainable, particularly EBITDA in spite of a particularly difficult environment, very strong results. This year we've met our commitments again. We've seen our margins grow in spite of a strong drop in contribution from global gas...</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> (6:46-7:05)</p>
          <p>...the contribution goes down to 800 million so this reduction is more than offset by growth in other business lines.</p>
          <p>Excluding Global Gas and LNG, EBITDA for all of our business lines is up by 7%, organic growth. Both &#x2013; well, these two aspects are really good results. We can say that the environment is particularly tough and the Global Gas has resisted. They've gone down, but less than expected and we've seen growth in all other business lines at a pace of 7% in 2009.</p>
          <p>We are very familiar with the environment we're talking about. We could sum it up as follows. Firstly, we've seen a historic reduction in demand. Consumption has contracted, particularly by industrial clients on the order of minus 4% in terms of demand for electricity and minus 6% demand for gas in Europe. So the very first consequence of this is reduction in sales by volume in the entire industry.</p>
          <p>Now a second factor which of course is to some extent related to the first, a drop in commodities prices, a drop in average commodity prices by around one-third for Brent, down by about half for NBP spot gas and then down by about half in terms of electricity megawatt hours in Belgium. These price reductions all in all have made for strong pressure on margins.</p>
          <p>Lastly and this last factor was the least foreseeable, there has been a de-linking of spot gas prices from oil prices. We saw this again yesterday. We see the combination of this crisis on the one hand, and entry &#x2013; coming online of new production units, such as Qatar liquefaction facilities and non-conventional fields in the United States as they are called, all of these things have led to de-linking &#x2013; really quite abrupt de-correlation, which continues today, between <mark type="audio gap" /> gas prices.</p>
          <p>There are various repercussions. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois and G&#xE9;rard will talk about the consequence of this. Nevertheless today we feel the situation has stabilized, a recovery should take place. It's true, it's still difficult to know exactly what the timeframe is going to be, exactly when but, possibly the recovery will take place earlier and be stronger than people think.</p>
          <p>As I said in my introduction, in spite of this time of crisis the Group has continued implementing its industrial strategy in the various areas that you're very familiar with. I wanted to give you few examples.</p>
          <p>To talk about gas first of all, the extension, supply contract in the Netherlands with Gas Terra, development of new gas fields, recorded new reserves in Algeria that will be developing to us. We took a stake in an Australian liquefaction exploration project, Bonaparte, the inauguration of our new regasification terminal, Mejillones in Chile.</p>
          <p>Our facilities in Chile did not feel impact of the earthquake, neither our energy nor water facilities. Our teams, however, are very much working to rescue victims there.</p>
          <p>We'd also mention, we finalized our facilities in Gjoa, Norway production &#x2013; an offshore production unit for natural gas. It will be coming on line in the fall. It's a major facility.</p>
          <p>Now another area, electricity generation, conventional generation today, we've got 19,000 megawatts currently being built world-wide in power generation. This is about half of the generation capacity of a country such as Spain, or the equivalent of about 10 EPRs world-wide.</p>
          <p>Now to talk about nuclear, we've made progress in France, Penly, Belgium of course as well, also in United Kingdom and Romania, and Brazil.</p>
          <p>We continue developing our gas infrastructures as well. This is a business that sees regular recurring growth which provides us with stability and this is a very important thing when in the throes of crisis. I've mentioned two projects. There are stakes in Nord Stream. Nord Stream signed three days ago, President Sarkozy made with us a for a presence there. There were also &#x2013; this also involves contracts that in 2015 will increase resources by 1.5 billion cubic meters in a year; also signed the coming on line for the Fos Cavaou terminal which will be on line this year and then the Neptune floating terminal which will also begin production this year.</p>
          <p>And of course there have been many successes in services and environment. Let's mention the network contract for the London Olympics neighborhood, 40-year concession for heat and cold; and then the largest desalination plant in Melbourne, SUEZ environment; and then of course taking control of Agbar in Barcelona. So as you can see we've &#x2013; in 2009 we've made substantial progress in terms of industry, but also in terms of regulation.</p>
          <p>In our business sector, services to governments and private individuals, we've got a regulatory context, and the regulation certificate clearly is going to be a good balance here. We have made some progress in Belgium, I'd mentioned first of all. We entered into an overall agreement with the government which extends the lifespan of three of our tranches of nuclear power plants that should be reaching 40 years in 2015. So there is no further uncertainty there. We entered &#x2013; have a well-balanced agreement that we entered into with the Belgian authorities.</p>
          <p>In France a new public service contract has been signed, it covers a four-year period. It also includes a new rate mechanism. So the Group can very clearly transparently pass on changes in cost of supply under the control of the regulatory authorities. So here as well, things have been made very clear for the Group.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on the European front, intentionally we contributed to increasing the competitive market such as our exchange of assets with E.ON between Belgium and Germany. And also thanks to proposals we made regarding access to the gas transport network, proposals which were accepted by the European Commission. There are various subjects under discussion with the European &#x2013; I'm sorry; the various subjects with the EU have been settled; there are no further disputes.</p>
          <p>So those are three areas: Belgium, France and Europe, in these areas you can see we have been very proactive in terms of regulations. And we managed to get clarifications that are very important and beneficial.</p>
          <p>Now, we have to think about financial objectives when we talk about the future as well. Our financial objectives in spite of the economic situation that is still very uncertain. Nevertheless we set our sights on an objective of growth for EBITDA of at least 15% between 2009 and 2011 which means around 7% EBITDA growth per annum on average which is the growth we saw in 2009 for our business lines excluding Global Gas and LNG.</p>
          <p>This growth includes various elements that we know are going to weigh on our performance which is to say, firstly, the recovery for our industrial clients seems to be slower and not as strong as expected. We'd expected in two years we'd make up for the negative impact of the crisis in terms of sales by volume, but the volume which today are around 700 million of 2009's EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Well for the time being, if we look at our industrial clients, we don't see the strong rebound and the recovery we'd expected at least not at the beginning of this year. We think we really couldn't go so far as to expecting a recovery to take place in the next few months, we've factored that in.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have to look at the effect of commodities prices, particularly this de-linking of spot gas prices and oil prices. Now we can see in our gas balance sheet, we've got some exposure to the spot gas prices. We couldn't foresee that. The spot gas prices went down very strongly. Today the maximum we see them &#x2013; we are evaluating the maximum impact of that phenomenon, to take into account changes in the commodities prices. The maximum impact here should be &#x20AC;800 million of our EBITDA by 2011.</p>
          <p>Now of course we are making every effort to reduce that impact through the work our teams do and through various measures that Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois and G&#xE9;rard will be talking to us about. These are the negatives, but they are very much offset by the positives. And we have good clarity, we know exactly where these positives come from, which is why in spite of the negatives we've mentioned, we expect growth of 15% between 2009 and 2011.</p>
          <p>The positives, let's talk about the positives. First of all, coming on line, gradual coming on line of 20 billion worth of capital expenditure we made over the past two years. This contribution should on the order of &#x2013; in 2011, &#x20AC;1.8 billion including the scope effect.</p>
          <p>Next, we've got our Efficio operational performance plan which should help contribute to this increase by around 800 million. We've decided to ratchet up our target by 150 million, up 150 million more by 2011. So this contribution should be greater in 2011 than in 2010.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our business of gas selling in France should come back to a more usual situation compared to 2009, where we were &#x2013; we saw that our rates were lagging by around &#x20AC;200 million. Those are the various points, the positive and the negatives which lead us to an objective for EBITDA growth of at least 15% between 2009 and 2011, reflecting the strong potential for Group growth in the next few years.</p>
          <p>Now briefly, let's come back to the main growth driver, which is our industrial development. Our group looks at all the business areas, all the locations and considers industrial projects, studies them which could be used to contend with the energy and environmental challenges we're facing today and we will continue to be facing in the future.</p>
          <p>Now, I would say that all-in-all worldwide the number of these projects hasn't really gone down a lot with the advent of the crisis because these are long-term projects, clearly identified projects which have to do with long-term trends in our markets and which meet essential needs for humankind. Let me mention, you have here on the slide some projects coming online in 2011 and 2010. The flow of projects which is quite substantial.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, we announced that we were accepted as the preferred bidder in Saudi Arabia to build a thermal power plant, combined cycle gas plant: 177 megawatts, just a little bigger than an EPR in terms of power, $2 billion. We'll have minority equity stake but will be responsible as a Saudi partner. There were five candidate groupings. This just goes to show how successful we've been and the momentum there.</p>
          <p>Now, the basis for our group's growth is organic growth, we add to that organic growth through some highly targeted external growth operations, average size deals and exchanges of assets. We are always working very hard to provide a dynamic authorization of our asset base. In 2009 we sold 2.5 billion in assets and we did some acquisitions, average size acquisitions, as I mentioned, acquisitions on the order of &#x20AC;1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>I would just like to mention, this growth is &#x2013; and the prospects we are outlining for you, such as the 15% growth in EBITDA between 2009 and 2011, all of this growth is based on our industrial organic development plan. GDF SUEZ does not need significant acquisitions to grow or reach the objectives we've been outlining.</p>
          <p>So that's the backdrop and I'd like to recall for you that these projects are very carefully studied. Once we've decided to validate the risk profile and strategic interests, they have to meet a threefold financial criterion. First of all, they have to create value measured by ROCE and the IRR and secondly they are gauged in terms of their contribution to results and cash flow. Thirdly, they are evaluated by doing what we call a financial sanity check, i.e., the projects have to be bankable, i.e. financeable by a third party, such as a banking institution based on their own merits.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side of the table here you see an estimate of the contribution of new projects that I alluded to earlier. This should be on the order of 1.8 billion over a two year period. Now these are projects that have already been scheduled, the significant investments have already been made.</p>
          <p>In our balance sheet as of the end of 2009, we've got &#x20AC;11 billion in fixed assets currently that didn't contribute to EBITDA in 2009 which will contribute in 2010 and even more, make an even greater contribution in 2011, the contribution will be stronger in 2011 than in 2010 and this will be speeding up &#x2013; the contribution will speed up in subsequent years after 2011.</p>
          <p>There are various major projects, some of the biggest ones I'd like to mention: Gjoa, 2011; Jirau, after 2010 &#x2013; Gjoa is E&amp;P in Norway and this is a project that should contribute on the order of around &#x20AC;300 million EBITDA. It will come online in the fall.</p>
          <p>Then there's the Jirau dam in Brazil. It should &#x2013; alone, it should be yielding half a billion, $500,000 EBITDA at 100% once it comes online in a full year starting in 2013 and we hold 50%.</p>
          <p>So, Group growth will be sustained, regular, lasting, thanks to coming online of our major main &#x2013; of our very numerous projects worldwide.</p>
          <p>Lastly in terms of outlook and before I am going to give the floor to G&#xE9;rard, let me just do a summary run through of some of the figures that will be very important during our development over the next few years.</p>
          <p>As you can see in 2010, EBITDA should grow compared to 2009 and during the two years, 2010-2011, growth should be above 15% in EBITDA. The two main growth drivers here: industrial development and Efficio will &#x2013; contributions increase substantially in 2011. 2011 should be starting to rebound than in 2010.</p>
          <p>Efficio: we've got a new objective here. 1,950 million with a retention rate of about 70%, compared to the benchmark financial year which is 2008. We continue our pace of capital expenditure, 10 billion per annum on average in the next two years. This pace is consistent, in step with our plan of 30 billion over the 2008-2010 period. So we will continue 2010-11 at this pace of around 10 billion of CapEx per annum.</p>
          <p>We continue our objective of financial structure and a strong A credit rating. Lastly we maintain our policy of a dynamic and competitive dividend payout, paying out a dividend of at least the same amount as last year.</p>
          <p>Those are the main lines of our development that I wanted to talk to you about before then giving the floor to G&#xE9;rard and then Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to you all. I am pleased to present to you today the financial performance of GDF SUEZ in 2009. I'd like to, however, underscore three strong messages mentioned by G&#xE9;rard following the analysis of the accounts, in spite, of a very degraded market environment.</p>
          <p>We have achieved all our objectives in 2009. The 2009 results are slightly upward, 2008 was a record year for the Group and the free cash flow generation was particularly strong in 2009 because it more than doubled thereby strengthening our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Let's just focus for few moments on the deterioration of the environment that we faced in 2009. In 2009, we experienced a sharp drop in commodity prices. You can see on the screen the first part with respectively drops off 37, 51, 44 on Brent, gas and electricity respectively but a contraction of demand both in gas and electricity in all our major markets with sometimes double-digit drops such as the U.K. The volume drop was quantified for us and the impact amounts to approximately 675 million of EBITDA in 2009.</p>
          <p>The milder weather conditions in France in 2009 impacted our results and we sold 5.7 terawatt-hours (sic) [4.7 terawatt-hours] less than the seasonal average. In spite of that trading environment the Group demonstrates its remarkable resilience in achieving all its targets.</p>
          <p>Here I've shown you the Group's scorecard with the targets set for 2009 and the achievements. So you can see that EBITDA is slightly up 1%. We've strengthened our industrial capability. We're still on the 30 billion over three years program. The Efficio targets are exceeded with 750 million in savings achieved. The retention rate is 70% over last year. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will tell you more about that.</p>
          <p>We continue our attractive return to shareholders with an average increase over three years of 10% 2007 &#x2013; 2010 the Group still has a very strong financial structure reflected in the rating.</p>
          <p>The results G&#xE9;rard just presented, the Group's key figures. I'll explain in the first section how we have been able to maintain our results, whereas the crisis made us lose 4% in revenue. So then we'll look at the initiatives that allowed us to double the free cash flow without changing our industrial development plan and then we'll focus on the financial strategy, which gives us a balance sheet that's one of the most robust in this industry whilst reducing the financing costs.</p>
          <p>Let's now review the results. This chart clearly illustrates the balanced business model. You see that the tangible decrease as a result of Global Gas and LNG, B3G in our jargon; it's the small column in grey on the chart, minus 851 million, this drop in income is more than offset by the increase of the other business lines results totaling 7% together, let's review the results of each of the business lines.</p>
          <p>B3G; Global Gas and LNG, 20% of the group's EBITDA and its results are by definition more volatile both upwardly and downwardly than the other divisions. We unfortunately in 2009 experienced a downward volatility. B3G results were particularly impacted by the crisis, as I said the drop in the price of oil and gas that you can read on the small section in the middle that Brent went from 97 to $62 per barrel on average and that the price of gas was halved, from 26 per megawatt-hour to 13, the lower uptakes of industrial minus 20 versus the contracts. The lower LNG sales 22 terawatt-hours as against 46 in 2007, CapEx 1.1 billion, essentially the expansion of the Gjoa field in Norway 376 million, and that will be coming on stream in 2010. You see that EBITDA 2.9 billion down 850 million, as I mentioned, and down 1 billion excluding currency and scope effects that I will now detail.</p>
          <p>So this chart explains how we went from 2 to &#x2013; rather 3.7 billion in 2008 to close to 2.9 billion and on the left you have the results 2.345. First factor, the scope effects that are positive to the tune of 254 million and which at half is the entry into service of new exploration and production assets in the Netherlands and half to the global integration of Gaselys, our trading subsidiary in gas. And then you see the huge negative impact of the drop in prices of oil and gas, 1.3 billion, 900 million and 400.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the 900 million directly linked to the price drops on our exploration production activities and our supply activities that corresponds to our oil sensitivity &#x20AC;20 million per dollar barrel variation and gas sensitivity of &#x20AC;7 million per megawatt hour. And then 400 million in 2009, that's the stock inventory effects that remain positive, the change is 400 million over the previous year. This is the difference between the sale price and the average cost of stocks that were constituted in 2008 when the oil and gas prices peaked.</p>
          <p>And then on the right we have a positive effect of 362 million those are arbitrage gains and the beginning of negotiations with our suppliers and the impact of the volume drop linked to the under consumption of industrial clients minus 90 million. So EBITDA is down 850 million, instead of the 1.5 billion that some had in mind, and that's consistent with the guidance we gave over a year ago.</p>
          <p>The two factors to this, the average price of Brent is above our assumptions at the time. I indicated $62 as against $50 a barrel when we gave the last guidance. If you multiply the differential by the quantity you obtain 240 million. Second factor: the non-recurring items that I just explained amounting to 362 million.</p>
          <p>So how are 2010 and 2011 looking? We have both positive and negative factors that will impact our results. Let's start with the negatives, recently a considerable spread that varied between 6 and &#x20AC;10 per megawatt-hour appeared between the gas and the oil index gas price on our long-term contracts and the price of gas on spot markets. Some of our B2B clients might not renew their contracts that are indexed on the price and what we estimate is the B2B sales concern might be limited to between 50 to 80 terawatt hours.</p>
          <p>As long as this abnormal situation continues, the impact on our 2010 and 2011 EBITDA forecast will be respectively 300 and 500 million. That's a maximum of 800 million as compared to '09. Beyond the very unfavorable item there are of course positive aspects. The Group in 2011 and 2010 will benefit from the increase in the price of Brent and gas, the increase in the production of hydrocarbon thanks to the coming on the stream of the new fields bringing an EBITDA net of depreciation of 300 million in 2011, the impacts of the new renegotiations underway with our suppliers linked to the current poor sectoral conditions and our capacity to optimize our portfolio for the supply in LNG in 2010. The EBITDA of the division should return to a more normal level comparable to 2007 which was at 2.3 billion, and return to growth in 2011. Beyond of course we are very well-positioned to take advantage of the gas market rebound.</p>
          <p>In France, EBITDA of the Energy France business line sharply up. You can see, up 44.7 or 366 million because of a price lag that was less important in '09 than in '08. This positive effect is of the order of 500 million and it's not to be fully found in the EBITDA growth as you can see because the weather was milder, as I indicated, in France and the electricity margins dropped because of the prices and the lower hydraulic output.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the contribution of EBITDA to electric activities amounts to 663 in '09 as against 882 million in '08. Investments totaled 925 million, and reflect the growth of our electric capacity in traditional heat and wind. In wind we have 600 megawatt-hours in service.</p>
          <p>The growth in 2010, 2011 results will be sustained by the following items. The entry into service of three combined cycle plants: CyCoFos, Combigolfe and Montoir for a total of 300 megawatts which will contribute 100 million in 2011 and then the very positive effects of the entry into service of the new public service contract for over 300 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to international divisions: the Europe Energy and International division puts in a very &#x2013; an excellent performance in 2009 and EBITDA which is now in excess of 5 billion, up 15% over '08. All the divisions contributed to this performance, in particular the Benelux/Germany divisions.</p>
          <p>The business line, furthermore, benefited from a growth of its production capability of three watts (sic) [gigawatts] and in 2010, 2011, the results will be sustained by the entry into service of new production capacities, for the rest to drop of electricity prices in Benelux/Germany will be offset by the organic growth internationally.</p>
          <p>Let's go through this in greater detail if we're talking about profitability of investments. Now here we can see clearly how we've got geographical diversity or footprint. Let's run through a couple of these, one for division. In Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Luxemburg, we see price effects that were very strong. Thanks to our hedging &#x2013; electricity hedging policy, this has covered an 18 month period. On average we sold &#x20AC;58 per megawatt-hour. We also had greater availability of our nuclear power plants elsewhere in Europe.</p>
          <p>We mentioned some portfolio effects: in the United States successful integration of FirstLight; in South America merger of Edelnor and Electroandina, thanks to which we can fully consolidate Edelnor now because we hold 52% of their capital and they are listed, as you know.</p>
          <p>Now, elsewhere internationally our production capacity contracted around two-thirds today which gives us recurring cash flow and high visibility there. Let's talk now about profitability of investment. On the left hand side of the screen here you can see breakdown of the current projects. So now, this doesn't contribute to EBITDA right now, these are current projects and we're talking about 5.2 billion out of total of 11 billion indicated by G&#xE9;rard earlier.</p>
          <p>Now, as he said during the introduction, our industrial projects that are currently underway are quite significant in the energy businesses line, particularly in Europe and International and their contribution will be very strong in the near future. You can see this on the right hand side of the slide.</p>
          <p>Infrastructures business line, Infrastructures business line continued moving forward well, up 2% in revenues, up 5% EBITDA reaching 3 billion representing 21% of the Group's EBITDA. Now we can explain its performance firstly through rate increases we obtained, furthermore increase in capacity to sell storage capacity, also transport in Germany in spite of weather conditions which were not positive in France and they had also an impact on the Infrastructures' France result.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditure remains stable around 2 billion, a large portion of investment 57% are in maintenance such as to enhance security of our facilities. 2010, 2011 growth in this business line will mainly be through Fos Cavaou coming on stream. Full year impact should be &#x20AC;60 million EBITDA impact in 2011. Furthermore, growth in the regulated asset space, annual pace of growth 3 to 4% plus new storage capacities will be coming on stream such as in the U.K. and Germany.</p>
          <p>Services, now the services business line has held up well. I'd particularly like to emphasize the results of Cofely in France. Still though, you know the business line was affected by a dip in overall business activity and the reduction in the building and construction sector which meant a drop in revenues by 2.7%. We think continued operational improvement, implementation of the Efficio plan, thanks to which it's been possible for this business line to experience EBITDA growth of over 2% reaching &#x20AC;921 million.</p>
          <p>CapEx 622 million, this covers extension of the Paris urban heating network plus the Swift project, a drilling barge in the North Sea, as well as a project for installing the Olympic site in London. 2010, 2011 growth in EBITDA for this business line will very much hinge on economic recovery. The target for 2011 is to reach a margin rate of EBITDA &#x2013; or revenues of 5%.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Environment: right in line with its objectives. The results of SUEZ Environment were already given by Jean-Louis last week so I'm not going to comment on them further.</p>
          <p>Now after explaining operational performance, let's come back to the consolidated financial statements. The main point we'd like to underline in the income statement, increased depreciated amortization reaching 4.9 billion in 2009 compared to more than 6 billion in 2008, the increase in depreciation and amortization should continue in 2010 covering about to 900 million due to the coming on line &#x2013; the various coming into activity facilities and full consolidation of Agbar.</p>
          <p>You can see 323 million are charged for fair valuation of commodity financial instruments reflecting value fluctuations for underlying commodities throughout the year as well as unwinding positive positions toward the end of 2008 which you can see on this screen in the 2008 column.</p>
          <p>Then you have asset impairments reaching 472 million. This covers some small exploration licenses as well as discontinuation of a project for a coal-fired plant in Germany; the Brunsbuettel Stadt profitability wasn't what it needed to be there. Now asset divestments include various things such as substantial capital gains from the Y Line Intercommunal in Belgium, 6% of Fluxys, this is exchange of assets with E.ON and then a surplus provision of Megal.</p>
          <p>Next here we have financial results, stable 1.6 billion, net cost of debt remain stable 1.3 billion, tax expenses 1.7 billion, tax in 2008 this includes a tax that's been challenged in Belgium, 213 million, we paid the Belgian government this tax but we are contesting. Now the corrected effective tax rate corrected for divestments is 29.9% as opposed to 27.1% in 2008. This effective tax rate will go above 30% going towards our usual rate of 34% unless there is a non-occurring element. Now excluding remedies, the net result is 4.5 billion net income which is robust performance.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at cash flow in greater detail, cash flow generation. We can see a strong increase in cash flow generation. The reason for this is the gross margin 3 billion after paying the fine, Megal, 550 million. Tax paid out 1.4 billion, which is down compared to 2008 due to we received payment for provisional payments &#x2013; excess provisional payments that have been made and we also were able to use our tax deficit. Now there's been a reduction in working capital requirements because we've carefully been controlling counterparty risk. There has also been a reversal of margin calls due to drops in commodity prices so that our hedged positions were positive and then there's the impact of the drop in revenues. Lastly, I would like to underscore free cash flow is up by 53%, excluding some non-recurring elements, recurring free cash flow goes from 5.8 billion to 8.9 billion in 2009, that's beautiful performance.</p>
          <p>Now net CapEx reaches 8.8 billion end of 2009 which is in line with our investment plan of 30 billion as I said. We invested 3.2 billion in maintenance, 6.5 billion in development. We have continued our policy of asset rotation, asset turnover. The last two years we carried out 6 billion in divestments of assets. 2010, the group will continue with its policy of very selective opportunistic external growth. We have already &#x2013; G&#xE9;rard has talked about our policy here. We will continue with our strategy of asset turnover such as complete divestment of our regulated business in Belgium.</p>
          <p>Dividend, the recurring earnings per share excluding divestments and impairment mark-to-market is up 1% reaching &#x20AC;1.91 per share, we are proposing to the shareholder's meeting on May 3 a dividend of &#x20AC;1.47 per share, up 5% compared to last year. In all we can say that it's a competitive return, 5.4% based on the share price at the end of the trading day on March 1.</p>
          <p>So we have explained all the elements that have made a change &#x2013; I just talked about the cash flow, investments, dividend, debt reaching 30 billion, which is two years worth of EBITDA. Restated for 11 billion in assets under construction that are not contributing to EBITDA, the gearing ratio is 1.35 &#x2013; 1.35 of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about the financial structure now for a moment. As you can see here the gearing or the financial structure is very sound. Thanks to bond issues and the diversification of our financing sources, we have extended an average maturity of our debt reaching eight years on average at the same time we reduced the cost of financing, cost going from 4.9% to 4.6%.</p>
          <p>Another important fact in the current market situation is GDF SUEZ has received several awards for it's financing in all of its markets such as an award in France also in Belgium and the Middle East, Singapore, the United States, Brazil and elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to talk to you about the growth profile for the next two years. 2010 EBITDA will continue to grow. We will continue with our industrial development program and Efficio to more than offset for the crisis in the gas industry. 2011 will see the end of the crisis to some extent, also coming online of various industrial projects and Efficio, thanks to which we will see stronger growth representing all-on over a two year period at least 15% growth compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, three positive elements I would like to mention, highly positive points. In a very difficult environment this group was resisting very well. Resulting cash flow was up. We are confident in our outlook. We've got a strong financial structure, this Group continues to build its future, preparing the future with an ambitious selective investment policy and we have shown a profitability.</p>
          <p>We have a very attractive return for our shareholders: long, sustainable return. I think I'll give the floor now to next the speaker.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Before I hand back to G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet for the conclusions I' just like to briefly mention a few points with you to look at the impact of the crisis on our accounts and to see how it's limited the response of the company with Efficio, which is a program that were unfolding, with the support of management and to see where the company's positioned on its two prime markets, very briefly on gas and electricity.</p>
          <p>If I just revert for a moment to the impact of the crisis, well the figures that we're presenting to you today are very similar to those we gave you last year in September that is, that we're assessing at &#x20AC;700, the impact on EBITDA, the contraction of energy demand, gas and electricity on our major industrial clients for about 600 million.</p>
          <p>In fact what we're demonstrating is that the Group is extremely resilient on its volumes, less resilient on prices than on volumes, but on volumes holding up very well in terms of business activity. The excellent results that weren't expected to that extent of our service activities that they &#x2013; one might have thought that they would have been severely affected by scale of the crisis.</p>
          <p>So 600 million out of the 700 due to contracting demand, and about 100 million due to the difficulties that our clients experienced for an amount of over 18 billion of revenues bold rate of bad debt remains very low, as well, below 1% of revenues, so that's a very good result. So the response of the Company in terms of programs that we &#x2013; that's known as Efficio, we can say a number of things.</p>
          <p>Firstly the management team have are really mobilized around this program that we have increased on two occasions our estimates, our targets, because for this year, we already increased it to 650 million and we achieved 750 million, up 15%. So, we've increased the results for 2010 and 2011 in a similar manner.</p>
          <p>On these figures that are audited by our auditors, we consider that we can keep 65 to 70% in our EBITDA, and it impacts EBITDA to the tune of that amount, so the figures are revised upwards for 2009 but also for 2010 and 11, let me remind you that in Efficio, it's the merger synergies and performance.</p>
          <p>So what does Efficio contain when we look at it? Well, a large part is the operational performance of the business lines, you see here the impact of the synergies from the merger, the complementarities that were at the heart of the merger process. We're close on two-thirds of our results essentially, for example, the cost restructurings by pooling in our services of Cofathec leading to Cofely, a power plant maintenance program that has been revised and improved. All this traditional performance is found in Efficio. There is a cost cutting projects, the global purchasing plan that is beginning to deliver, it will deliver even more in 2010 and 2011, it's one of the key focus areas for this here.</p>
          <p>There's some work that was done notably on synergies in insurance. That was very profitable. And also major real estate streamlining projects, because we are restructuring our facilities in Paris and in Belgium and in other parts of France, which should bring in a number of mid-term efficiencies. We are working on support functions, the major services: HR, finance, IT and headquarters where we've reduced our head count in '09 and we're working continuously, that's where, for the future, there are additional capacities in 2010, 2011 and the out years to achieve further efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Let's return briefly to the gas and electricity markets for gas. Well, I told you in September that we saw something new that's de-linking, this disconnect between the long-term and market &#x2013; spot prices. Well, this delinking increased during &#x2013; from the period of September even if it was reduced slightly and went to &#x2013; what the consequence of that was a change in the behavior of our key industrial clients who found better elsewhere because the group lost some market share in this area, simply because the focus was on cash and profitability before volume.</p>
          <p>So this change in our client positioning is limited in its scope, you mustn't see that as the full client portfolio that is affected because we have both a regulated client base that is oil indexed and PPAs on our plants that are protected, so this change in customer behavior led us to changing our own behavior in our gas balance. Greater flexibility, greater flexibility in our gas balance, so in 2009 we were not out of synch and there is no reason for that to be the case in 2010.</p>
          <p>So we're better managing our balance and we've managed our relations with our clients on a long term basis. Forgive me for not saying any more, but there is a basic principle in relations between long term suppliers and the clients &#x2013; we are, we must ensure that the gas systems remains competitive. That's how the system was set up and that's how we apply it, so we are talking to our major suppliers.</p>
          <p>All this to say that in this gas market that is &#x2013; that was quite disrupted in 2009, B3G of our gas activities they were quite remarkable. 2008 was an exceptional year in every respect because of commodity prices. In 2009, we have the second best performance ever of gas activities, in spite of this extremely complicated market. So for the future, well first and foremost, the future lies with gas, we want to reduce the CO2 emissions, we have of course continued European production, but markets are certainly more liquid than previously, but nevertheless, pretty illiquid still on the earlier slide for note, you anticipated the cycles, what were seeing today is essentially the result &#x2013; the fruit of all these investments that were made during the years 2004, 2005 that are now coming on stream at a time when demand isn't very sustained, but in any event there is not much to come in the coming years in terms of new investments and to entry into service. So how long will this disconnect last? That's the major question mark. We don't believe that this year we will be seeing a re-coupling with the oil price.</p>
          <p>If we now move on to the next slide, well, we see that GDF SUEZ is number one gas provider. It's better to have a diversified portfolio because you interact with a larger part of the LNG in the portfolio because when opportunities pick up those who will benefit are those who have the flexibility and bring the gas to where it's needed, where the demand lies today we see the pick up.</p>
          <p>2009 was a very bad year for LNG, 2010 its come to Europe, but 2010 is changing and we're seeing new opportunities notably in Asia. Mention was made for example of discussions between our group and Pakistan, a country where in the past we in fact had no relation. So we see this flexibility for the upturn.</p>
          <p>It's not just based on long-term contracts. You see the significance of short-term supplies, the 1200 terawatt-hours of the group. The conclusion is that we've well positioned when it picks up, because we have LNG, because we have the balance and diversity. We continue to believe that Continental Europe based on long-term contracts there, things are looking good.</p>
          <p>So a group that is ready in gas to benefit from the upturn, for the recovery when we resume on our gas activities in the Global Gas and LNG business line, which is a pretty straightforward business line. But it's not always easy to predict the trends. That can be rather unsettling. When we look at the major boxes here for exploration and production, we had a 2009 year where revenues declined because of commodity and oil prices. For 2010 and 2011, we forecast a recovery.</p>
          <p>You see that for 2009 everything is either downwards or flat. In 2010/2011, we have production growth rate and an oil price more favorable that the 62 figure that we took for '09 even if we remain very cautious because for 2010, 2011 the price of a barrel of Brent is still below $80. Supplies: 2009, not a good year for supply. That is expected to continue through 2010 and part of 20 &#x2013; we don't see a long term and short term price reconnect. We can manage that but let's not expect miracles in 2010 or 2011.</p>
          <p>On LNG, on the contrary there, we hit bottom in 2009 for LNG activities, they can only pick up and that will depend on growth in developing areas such as Latin America or Asia, but we are ready to pick up with our capacity to reshift or re-direct our gas deliveries where that's needed. The key accounts we're not expecting any significant improvement in the coming period owing to the translation of this price de-linking.</p>
          <p>In terms of EBITDA and margin of course that's not where we generate the best margins in this area. However, on the trading front and the market activities there we forecast growth because of the pooling of both &#x2013; the previous trading activities that existed in the two companies and the synergies that can be generated and it's a period of price volatility and there our teams can expand their activities so we expect better results.</p>
          <p>So you can see that in a gas market that is far from being great in 2009 and plainly, we can expect that it will still remain in a dip in 2010. But the company can generate results during those times, as G&#xE9;rard said, after all, what we're referring &#x2013; coming back from the worst to results of 2007 of the order of 2.3, 2.4 billion. It's not the best market but these are very good results.</p>
          <p>On electricity briefly, well, 2009, the first time since 45 that the electricity consumption is down and we felt the effects of that. What do we see for the future and for GDF SUEZ positioning, what's under construction? On the left hand side of the slide, 19 gigawatts that will very, very soon come on stream. We had a target of 100 for 2013, we'll no doubt move faster so these 19 gigawatts will bring resources. G&#xE9;rard indicated the trends that we expect on the commissioning of these 19 gigawatts in 2010 and 2011. In terms of EBITDA that represents the confidence of the Group on the 15% EBITDA increase that we announced this year for the coming year. And what we do see? We see that the Group is very well supplied on its energy mix balance. That's the chart below.</p>
          <p>And we're extremely well-positioned in growth areas, because if electricity demand picks up, we'll pick up, we'll resume. It will fundamentally or in large party will be non-OECD and there we can expect capacity renewals in Europe and in the U.S. and accelerating demand. You see it's the red line on this chart how well positioned the Group is in countries, in geographic areas where expansion growth is at its highest level.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, before handing back to G&#xE9;rard, it was a severe crisis. We were able to limit it at least in terms of volume, which demonstrates the Group's great resilience. We are upgrading the performance plan targets, the key for us, a one way of managing the company. We have the flexibility, the strength as the leading gas supplier to benefit from the gas market rebound and our investments are made in developing areas where growth is picking up which is good news for the Group's future growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. Just very briefly, before fielding your questions, let me say something about our business model. Really, we are an electricity, gas and services supplier, energy services, environmental services. Worldwide demand for energy, demand for electricity, for gas in emerging countries is very strong. There is no global growth without energy, without growth in energy demand. That's where we are.</p>
          <p>We've opted to be present in emerging countries, Latin America, the Middle East, presently are we're leader &#x2013; in leading positions there. We are also highly present in Asia. So in those places where demand for electricity and gas is strong, we are very present.</p>
          <p>In Europe we see very well, economic growth is going to be lower though there is a recovery. Europe has opted probably for more energy efficient growth and growth that is kinder to environment. In Europe, we are selling gas and electricity and growth rates here are somewhat lower. But we are selling more services here.</p>
          <p>Energy services &#x2013; here we are really betting on energy efficiency, with the business line fully focusing on energy efficiency 77,000 people, we are selling more environmental services here as well through SUEZ Environment. So our strategic choice in this group has been clear. We are positioning on gas and electricity and services. And that turns out to be very much the right choice when we look at trends in terms of demand for energy in emerging countries and at the same time if we take a look at the situation in Europe where growth will probably be lower in terms of demand for energy, but higher growth, greater demand for energy services and environmental services.</p>
          <p>There you have it. Now I would like to field your questions. If you would like to ask a question, the person in the second row.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Philippe Garnier from Natixis Securities. I have three questions. Firstly, your working assumptions for gas, you told us about this morning the new business plan. Could you give us the previous assumption? EBITDA 17 and 18 billion, what were the basis there?</p>
          <p>Second question Efficio increasing by 150 million, the plan for internal efficiency. You talk about a retention rate of 70%. If memory serves, the gross amount of 1.8 billion ended up being 900 million. How do you go from &#x2013; go to that rate with a 70% retention rate out of 1.9 billion gross?</p>
          <p>Third question, lots of rumors we have heard about gas in France and gas rates. It's getting March now. We have an idea of oil prices in the first two months of the year. What are your expectations as of April 1st?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer that last question and then I'll let G&#xE9;rard possibly answer regarding the assumptions and then Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will talk to you about Efficio. Now regarding prices for gas, these rates are to change on April 1st. They're rules that were published in December by the government, decrees having to do with public service contracts that were signed last year and they're implementing decrees that have been published. So we have the system which is automatic it's in place. Let me remind you of the procedure.</p>
          <p>We have no leeway whatsoever and this actually is fairly satisfactory as far as we see it. There is a formulae published by the government, rates have to be calculated as per the formula, checked by the electricity regulation authority, they do the additions and the multiplications and check that the results are the same. The results of the calculation is then published on April 1st. So that's exactly that.</p>
          <p>The important thing that's in the procedure that the government has established, this procedure no longer requires a ministerial decree. Once a year, the government &#x2013; and this has been done &#x2013; once a year they set the parameters having to do with, well the cost components excluding commodities, so i.e. infrastructures used and so forth. That's been done for the year. Secondly, raw materials prices, the formula has indexation clauses, all this is contained in the formula and that's revised every quarter. The first stage of using this arrangement will be April 1st, but the government, the ministries will not be involved between now and April, we are just calmly waiting for the first of April to arrive now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Having to do with the underlying assumptions and previous market guidance, I have just gone through changes in gas prices, looked at them. You may remember at the investors day meeting November 2008 gas had reached, in Zeebrugge, its peak, I see it here, around &#x20AC;33 per megawatt hour. There is this de linking between gas price and oil prices but that hadn't happened yet at that time, we've talk about the de-linking since then. Now today I was looking at gas prices in Zeebrugge at &#x20AC;13 a megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>The difference is mainly due to the de-linking and not to the fact they're different working assumptions. Gas was always linked to oil at least for quite some time it was, so now that's a difference today but the reason for the difference in guidance is now the de-linking, we saw there in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now regarding Efficio, basically speaking, when we gave Efficio figures we still had some uncertainties as to the amount we could include in the EBITDA that we wouldn't have to either give back to the customers I mean, when you increase productivity you can't keep it all for yourself or we might have to give some back to regulatory authorities under our regulated business.</p>
          <p>Today what we have seen in the first year of this Efficio program is that the retention rate is in the neighborhood of 70%. That's not just our figure, it's been audited by the statutory auditors. This is important to us and we need to see what the impact is on the EBITDA, the actual amount of this that we retain from the Efficio program. It's true the figure might have been somewhat more cautious when we announced it last year when it sounded more cautious but the result is that today we do know and we think we will be able to keep this rate of 70% retention rate through the Efficio program.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from CIC. I wanted to go back to another point &#x2013; sorry to bring it up again but International Power. We all want to hear a little bit about this International Power.</p>
          <p>Second thing having to do with B3G results we understood this would go down going down to a normative level of maybe 5-7 billion. Is this just because their non-recurring effects of 360 million is that what you're excluding from future performance because I felt that that seemed a little bit shy so to speak, this expected dip for B3G?</p>
          <p>And another question could you tell us a little bit about on LNG deliveries that you made in the second part of the year or the last part of the year? Have things resumed? Can we hear the number of cargos?</p>
          <p>Another question, you told us you had improved your relations with suppliers. Did you use the take or pay clause? In these clauses you've got the make up clause has to do with the pick up amount. What's the situation in terms of the non-pick up uptick? According to some trade information it went as high as minus 20% compared to the contract with Gazprom and others?</p>
          <p>Last question, deficit rates, I got the impression minus 200 million, 200 million deficit tariffs in 2009, I thought I understood it was better. You talked about minus 100 toward the end of the year we'd all heard we're thinking about 100 million minus could we get more information as to the deficit tariff 2009? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Let me say something very briefly about International Power. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will answer your various questions regarding gas. Let me just remind us all of our development philosophy from our business plan and our development program for our industry. Everything focuses on organic developments. We're growing worldwide by building power plants, gas infrastructure, heating networks, cooling networks. That's our know-how and we do this at a sustained pace, thanks to which the group has grown. Sometime there's a little merger we're involved in, but in the meantime, we move forward organically. That's precisely what we're doing right now.</p>
          <p>As you saw 2009, M&amp;A activities &#x2013; sorry to the bankers who are here, small scale modest M&amp;A activity in '09. 2.5 billion in divestments and 1.9 billion small acquisitions. This is all about optimization. What we like are asset swap deals. We've done several of these, deals that entail very little cash. After all in one of this, the biggest one was that way. Also with Eni we did an asset swap. We did an asset swap of 2 billion -- two times 2 billion in assets with E.ON to optimize positions.</p>
          <p>To some extent the Agbar deal that Jean-Louis presented to the market is basically an asset swap. We like that approach, that technique. We optimize &#x2013; it's a way of growing, optimizing and maintaining the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, you realize that this is also our approach regarding International Power. There was a leak that made the British authorities ask for pens down, and that's where we are, pens down, no conversations underway and I can say nothing as to whether or not they may or may not resume.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Several questions on gas, GNL, second half 2009, no. didn't do much, very little, a lot less than in previous years. Number of cargos I do not know exactly for the second half. Maybe about 20ish -- 26, 26 for the full year, okay. So compared to about 40 in the previous year as you can see.</p>
          <p>It wasn't possible, we couldn't do anything. LNG comes to Europe; we had the European LNG, that was out. But we really reached the trough of that market end of last year. Today, this year we're already seeing resumptions. I said this earlier, particular in Asia, there is a turnaround. Now ability to manage the volume of the balance sheet and flexibility, the 20% figures too high in terms of what we can do, we didn't even need it on that scale. It's high though. Of course it depends on suppliers; depends on the relations we have, their abilities to manage business so forth.</p>
          <p>In terms of suppliers, what we can say is our major suppliers the traditional ones, the European long-term ones. Firstly, were surprised at this price disconnect, de-link. It took them some time to react, figuring out how far things were going to go.</p>
          <p>Three, we are now &#x2013; everybody is aware that something needs to be done, it's being done, but this is of course covered by commercial confidentiality. We don't go into all this.</p>
          <p>Now the figures for 2010 basically in the Global Gas and LNG business line, the B3G, we must not exclude the non-recurring business from 2009 to reach the 2010 figure. 2010, of course, there will be a downturn, but as I tried to show you in the graph there will be ups and down and we have to look at the overall amount, and we can certainly be fairly &#x2013; let's put it this way: in a gas market that's very depressed, we can be fairly &#x2013; feel fairly secure.</p>
          <p>I looked through this in my papers: number of ships, 26 cargos in 2009 as opposed to 56 in 2008, volume 24 terawatt hours less.</p>

          <p>Further questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Sod Jin. In addition to being an analyst, I'm also a heating customer. Your long-term contracts with Statoil and Gazprom, will these contracts have a spot indication? What about the CRE formula that doesn't take account of the spot?</p>
          <p>You mentioned Nord Stream. It's an MoU that seems to be non-binding for the time being. What will it take for it to become a contract? What does Gazprom need for you to integrate Nord Stream? And Gaz Naturale, how do you plan to acquire them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I didn't say that there was spot formula in the long-term contracts. I just said that we are discussing with our suppliers firstly and in the regulator formula, the formula that's always been applied by the French government as we must ensure the long-term supply of our customers. So the formula is based on long-term prices because when we supply gas for heating, generally you don't stop after one or two years, you're in it for about 10, 15 years or the whole of your life, which I hope is the case. So the price formula have always, they are always long-term formulas. And what we're seeing is that the short-term price formula are extremely volatile and it would be very difficult to go and explain to our customers that because the market lacks steps that the prices increase by 50, 60% and it won't last. So there is some understanding between all parties to base contracts to households on long-term contracts.</p>
          <p>On Nord Stream our timetable is that our entry into the capital base will happen between the financing, the closing, which is in the collect phase on the basis of the previous structure. We enter the capital structure. That's before the work planned in the spring. That's the timetable, the agreement. It requires the agreement of Gazprom as you saw. You saw the support of the Gazprom and political leadership and which is clear and of course the agreement of the other partners, essentially the two German groups, BASF Wintershall and E.ON as well as Gaz &#x2013; which is already present for governance. But all that's working well and it's in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>On Gaz Naturale, I don't believe the question of Gaz Naturale can be described as organic growth, rest assured.</p>
          <p>Question over there. Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris Rogers with ICAP, if I may ask in English. Firstly, could you go through the Efficio numbers by division, if that's possible, in terms of your target?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the chart on the direction of growth seems to show less than 7% in 2010 and more than 7% for 2011 for EBITDA development. So is that the correct interpretation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; it's correct. It is 7% in average. It's a little bit more in 2011 and actually less in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give the breakup of Efficio among divisions but you have the breakdown I've given to you among the main actions that have been followed by Efficio. So for the time being, I will just say again that what is very important is to reinforce and to strengthen the, what you call, action transverse and the support function where we have here a program of standardization first and then to reduce our cost in these sectors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Morgan Stanley. Three quick ones, if I may. A follow-up on Global Gas, you were offering some arithmetic on the figures. So the question will be, at the end of the day to better understand the outlook for the supply section, which is the less visible for the market, if we take 2009 for EBITDA 2.9, we remove the non-recurrings. We're down to 2.5. You announced it at least 2.3, 2.5, so we're going to lose approximately 200 million of worth on the recurring basis of 2009.</p>
          <p>E&amp;P has good prospects. You pointed the spot prices that are on the rise. On your sensitivity that should add 250 million on EBITDA. Could you give us your volume budgets in production for 2010? You must have good visibility and it's not easy for us to see, given the various assets that come into production. So the E&amp;P volumes in 2010, and overall an E&amp;P that will be up by 2 to 300 million, so there's a drop in the other businesses by about 500 million, you announced LNG would be up in 2010, that is that supplies are sharply down. So the question to have an idea in terms of the level and is it a lasting rebasing downwards of the profitability of supplies, or is it just a depressed level? What's your take for the future? Sorry, that's my first question, it's rather long.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on production for 2010, E&amp;P about 54 billion of oil equivalent barrels. It's rather limited production versus '09 because we're close on 53 million or 52.9 if I'm not mistaken, &#x2013; looking at Jean-Marie? 52.9, so it's not the volume, which is slightly up. E&amp;P in 2011, especially volume increased because we have more notably Gjoa that was cited by G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet, where there we have a prospect end of 2011 of 60 million which is kind of the target figure that we're aiming for &#x2013; on E&amp;P. So little volume increase in 2010 a bit more in 2011 and prices that we've taken that are below on the two years, below $80 a barrel for us.</p>
          <p>On the supply, well let's see upstream, the upstream margin as it's known that's perhaps a treasure of commercial, the best guarded commercial treasure of information in the company, the best kept secret for reasons that you'll appreciate, we suffered fully the problems in 2009 and we expect to continue to suffer from those in 2010, so we consider that the supply activity, the upstream margins on our gas contracts are today degraded, but it's not lasting.</p>
          <p>Now the question when will that durability or when that stop or at least that &#x2013; when will that deterioration &#x2013; I mean all of that is open to questions. It will essentially depend on the pickup in the gas market and coming tensions once again on prices or at least on the supply demand balance. Just to give you a figure and that's what makes us doubt what is the over supply of the global gas market for 2009 both because of the excess production and declining demand, globally we can say about 100 billion cubic meters. So out of the 100 billion cubic meters of a consumption of 3 trillion worldwide, so that over consumption in '09, is about 3% of the gas market.</p>
          <p>A very cold winter in France, I mean, it doesn't mean that it's necessarily the same thing globally, but a cold winter, you see far bigger variations than 3%, so clearly today the market is in oversupply G&#xE9;rard was saying earlier that perhaps that the rebound can come faster than today. I mean, today observers are extremely bearish on the gas market. I think they're over-egging the market pessimism here. 2010 will continue to be an average year &#x2013; more than average, but I mean, things can shift &#x2013; can change very quickly as we've seen in the past.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget that our market is a cyclical market with investments coming on stream and today we don't see a lot of new equipment for the future to drive future growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois was very specific on the volumes. On qualifying the EBITDA '09 figures for B3G G&#xE9;rard can perhaps enlighten you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah so let me just revert to the explanation that I gave earlier and you have figures for each of the factors that explain the change in the result. So we'll start from an EBITDA '09, of probably 2.864 billion. We remove the effect of the de-linking between price of oil and gas, which I indicated a maximum of 300 million.</p>
          <p>Next you have the oil sensitivity because oil prices are higher than the average last year with a positive effect of 240 million and as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois said, just repeat the figure, real production in '09, 53 million barrels; 2010, 54 and you can estimate that production for 2011 will be higher than 10%.</p>
          <p>And then you have the gas sensitivity, positive to the tune of 51 million and the contribution of CapEx that will progressively come into production 51 million. We remove the non-recurring items to order of 400 million and that gives you the 2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>So that was your first question, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And the second is very succinct, on electricity now. You indicated that our budget &#x2013; your budget is based on a mark-to-market, the prices that we're seeing on the screens for the non &#x2013; the un-hedged portion of your activity. Could you give us the average prices achieved in 2009 for Benelux, and could you give us what your average hedge rate? You mentioned volume, two-thirds, could you give us an indication of the levels for megawatt-hours &#x2013; euro per megawatt-hour?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So average prices, sales prices of electricity, I gave them to you earlier. &#x20AC;53 per megawatt, if I'm not mistaken and those &#x2013; the prices are flat, stable in 2010, given the hedging in excess of 90%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just to end more a open question on your dividend policy, you described it with an adjective. Could you perhaps specify, what you mean by this dividend policy that isn't quantified in spite of the fact that you have a good upward quantification of your future results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well the board will decide in due course. We have a very dynamic policy up till now. We wanted to increase the dividend this year. You know that in the utility sector it's rather an exception in order to, of course we can afford to do it in order to fully satisfy the commitment that we made as an average annual growth of the dividend of 10% per year over the period '8, to '9, '10 of the dividend paid out in those three years, so we fully delivered on our commitment that was made before the merger, before the crisis &#x2013; at a time when the individual outlook was very optimistic here, we say that the dividend will be equal every year to that of the previous year. We're not more specific at this stage, but it's a clear commitment. In terms of the dividend the group has always been rather generous, I believe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Deutsche Bank several questions. The first, I saw on slide 67, appendixes, on the cash flow chart we see there were significant changes in WCR and pure operating cash flow there is quite a sharp change in 2010 over 2009 and the WCR change is 2 billion this year, the positive what was the portion that was linked to commodities? We see there's less EBITDA on the Global Gas we recover on the working capital. Is there a smoothing effect there that could continue to operate over the coming years? I would like to have your take on that, especially after the E&amp;P and contract renegotiations on supply.</p>
          <p>Second question in terms of net debt, I know you have a good ratio, a lot of investments underway. What would your net debt target be for the end of 2010?</p>
          <p>Third point, the tax and costs to extend the life of power plants in Belgium is that included in your 2010, 2011 guidance and what will that impact on EBITDA be?</p>
          <p>And lastly, at your current share price with your cash could you envisage a buyback for a special dividend? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>G&#xE9;rard, on WCR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, WCR, page 41, down by 2 billion for WCR. I gave you the explanation. This is because of margin calls, that's half of it and also a real reduction in our Working Capital Requirements. Because the way we'd manage through receivables and payables. Half of this change you can consider recurring. The margin calls, of course, depend on price changes and we can't forecast those.</p>
          <p>Now on to debt, our target for net debt in 2010. We gave you a great deal of information to calculate this. We don't disclose in our guidance an actual target for net debt. Therefore &#x2013; but we did give information on our rating target but I can't give you the figure. So for 2010, you can calculate it.</p>
          <p>Regarding taxes in Belgium, they are not recognized, of course, under EBITDA, they do not affect forecast EBITDA, however these are included in our forecast for net income.</p>
          <p>Now share buybacks: for the time being we have no project for buying back shares, nor any exceptional dividend. We have done this in the past, both of those, and we won't hesitate to do this again in the future, but for the time being that's not on the agenda.</p>
          <p>Further questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Exane. First question gas and recovering cumulative shortfall, &#x20AC;30 million per year EBITDA margin for gas retail business in France is this contributing to make up for the shortfall or would this be above and beyond?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Answer is yes. Answer is yes, to the question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Second point, amortization is up 900 million euros for depreciation and amortization in 2010, in spite of the increase, operating income, should it go up in 2010 or not?</p>
          <p>Third question. Could you come back to explanation of deduction of provision between '08 and end of '09?</p>
          <p>Fourth point, more macro what is the outlook, what is your opinion in terms of non-conventional gas development in Europe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, depreciations and amortizations and a drop in provisions, G&#xE9;rard could you comment on that, look that up and in the meantime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I know the answer, I have the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. He can give you the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I told you that deprecations would be going up next year. We didn't set an objective for ROCE, so we're not going to give that.</p>
          <p>Non-conventional gas in Europe. Europe isn't mature, this isn't the United States, this isn't Australia, those are the two global regions where it's more mature, at least in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Secondly, what's being done today in Europe, the programs in Europe are surveying non-conventional gas. Now we do realize the limit, the border between conventional gas and non-conventional gas. It's fairly vague, the border is not clear, what we call today, non-conventional gas isn't as much Shale gas, but tight gas. Gas &#x2013; that's going to be changing of course in future years, but currently this is gas in highly compact reservoirs.</p>
          <p>Further point. We are involved both in programs to survey, take stock of non-conventional gas in Europe, these resources we're listing. We've got a very good know-how tied to gas. Our reserves in Germany and Algeria at Touat are reservoirs that may be re-categorized as non-conventional at some point, don't know. That's a question mark also. But we're not involved in oil shale and we don't intend to go there, at least not in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Lastly, there are two, three limiting factors probably on developing non-conventional gas in Europe to wit, firstly, you don't have the industry. In the U.S. you've got a lot of companies, a lot of small independent businesses that really built the industry. We don't have this in Europe today. So it could only be done by the majors, which would be a different business model.</p>
          <p>Second point, this has to do with at least in Western Europe, difficult to define where that is exactly but there are environmental aspects. Acceptance of non-conventional gas by populations. One visible elements here above and beyond, water that's required for this type of drilling but beyond the visible element is the number of wells, you have to install a large number of wells sometimes hundreds, hundreds of them so it's entirely true &#x2013; if you go to Dallas, you can see wells around the airport for non-conventional gas.</p>
          <p>The question for us would be, would it be possible to have these wells surrounding the Orly or Roissy airports in Paris? Which is to say we can expect non-conventional gas in Europe &#x2013; well, there is less of it, there will be less of it and it wouldn't come online in any near &#x2013; well, medium term future. We are talking about very, very long-term 5, 10 or more years for Europe.</p>
