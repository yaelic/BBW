          <p>Thank you, Rick, and good morning and thank you for joining us on our call. I'll give you an abbreviated review of our strong third quarter financial results, then Wade will take you through the details of our performance and finally, we'll spend more time on our announcement this morning regarding the PBM Express Scripts.</p>
          <p>Starting with our results today, we had a very solid quarter, which demonstrates that our strategies are generating strong financial results. We reported record third quarter sales of $18.4 billion, up 6.8% from $17.2 billion a year ago. Net earnings for the quarter were up 30.3% to a record $603 million compared to $463 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>Third quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.65, an increase of 38.3% versus last year's $0.47 per diluted share, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Strong cash flow trends continued in the quarter, with cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $1 billion. In the quarter, we grew our gross profit by 8.5% and our SG&amp;A by 7.2%. Our performance this quarter was a result of our ability to grow gross profit dollars faster than SG&amp;A dollars, allowing us to deliver on our goal of double-digit earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>This quarter, gross profit dollar growth was $122 million above SG&amp;A dollar growth, yielding an EBIT growth of 14.8%. By driving our gross profit dollar growth, we saw solid performance across a number of categories, including Retail Pharmacy, Over the Counter medications, Beauty and Personal Care. While we continue to grow our business and invest in the future, our strategies are implemented against a backdrop of economic and regulatory uncertainties. Persistent high unemployment, a weak housing market, high fuel prices and inflation all put pressure on consumers.</p>
          <p>In response, we believe our customers are managing their overall spending by buying more ad and private brand items. As well, we continue to see mix shift to consumables and non-discretionary items. Regarding inflation, we constantly monitor the competition and believe we are achieving the right balance between margin and traffic in our front end comp.</p>
          <p>In addition we continue to experience both commercial and governmental reimbursement pressure. On the government side of the issue, it's too early to speculate on the eventual timing and impact of AMP, of AMP. And on the regulatory front, we are pleased that the Senate took action on debit card reform. While the substance of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill is clear, both the timing and financial implications are still unknown and it's premature to speculate on any impact to our business.</p>
          <p>As we respond to a changing business climate, we also focus on solid execution to generate results. Throughout this quarter, we continued with our Customer-Centric Retailing conversions and in early June, reached a milestone of 4,000 CCR stores. We're on track to achieve our goal of 5,500 stores transitioned to CCR by the end of October this calendar year.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're very pleased with the pace and success of our CCR conversions. With Walgreen employees responsible for much of the work, we're completing stores 30% faster this year than last, with costs running at about $45,000 per store. Customer satisfaction is up in converted stores and we believe that the success of CCR is being reflected in our solid front end comp store sales numbers.</p>
          <p>In addition to our focus on our core business, we also recently made significant strategic advancements as we continue to align our assets with our strategies. In the quarter, we announced the sale of our PBM and the acquisition of drugstore.com. On June 3rd, we closed on our transaction with drugstore and we're pleased to welcome our new team members to the Walgreens family. With the acquisition, we strengthened our position as the most convenient multi-channel provider of health and daily living, giving our customers more ways to connect and buy our wide range of products and services.</p>
          <p>I also want to acknowledge and thank the employees of WHI. We closed that transaction with Catalyst Health systems on June 13th and I want to wish the team all the best in their new positions with Catalyst. The sale sharpened our focus on our strategy to leverage the best community store network in America. In addition, the strategic relationship gives us the opportunity to expand all pharmacy products and services, including Retail Pharmacy, both 30 and 90-day supplies, Mail Service and Specialty and Infusion Pharmacy, while Catalyst grows its PBM.</p>
          <p>Also during the quarter, we developed collaborations with a number of hospitals and health systems designed to improve patient care, provide greater access to important pharmacy and healthcare services and lower costs. These collaborative relationships demonstrate how Walgreen pharmacists, nurse practitioners and other professionals are integrating our services and solutions into the healthcare systems within our communities for our patients' and customers' benefit.</p>
          <p>In May, we announced a wide-ranging agreement with Johns Hopkins Medicine.  The agreement promotes collaboration on population-based research. We will also jointly review and develop protocols to improve outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. Continuing our focus on patient outcomes and chronic care, we launched a program with Northwestern Memorial Physicians Group of Chicago. Through the program, Walgreens and Northwestern Memorial employees will receive specialized care for chronic conditions. We will share important clinical information on the patients' care and progress with their primary care physicians to help enhance decision-making.</p>
          <p>And finally, Take Care Health Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens, has developed relationships with Ochsner Health Systems in New Orleans and Memorial Health in Jacksonville, Florida. With these agreements in place, physicians will share information with their patients on Take Care clinics and on other healthcare options when their practices are closed or they are unable to schedule an appointment within a patient's desired timeframe.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Wade for more detail on our results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin by saying we are pleased with our strong performance on our key financial metrics in what continues to be a challenging economic environment. As Greg mentioned, our net sales increased 6.8% to $18.4 billion. And our net earnings increased by 30.3% to $603 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.65, a 38.3% increase. Our comparable sales trends have improved from a year ago, with prescription sales up 4.1%, front end sales up 3.9%, total sales up 4.1%. And our prescriptions filled were up 4.6% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at our comp trends more closely, our quarterly script trends, shown in the green bars, increased by 4.6% in the quarter, up from last year's 2.5%, continuing to outpace the industry growth rate of 1.1%, excluding Walgreens. On a two-year stack basis, represented by the blue line, comparable prescriptions increases remain in the 6% to 8% range, with the spike in the first quarter of 2010 caused by the unusual timing and severity of the 2010 flu season.</p>
          <p>Retail prescription market share for the quarter was 20.1%, compared to a 19.7% a year ago. Our quarterly front end sales comps increased 3.9%, up from 0.1% a year ago. And we believe the CCR initiative, including expansion of and focus on core product categories and the rollout of beer and wine, continue to gain traction and drive our comps.</p>
          <p>The CCR initiative also helped drive the holiday sales comp this past Easter. And finally, the two-year stack, shown by the blue line, continued to trend up after bottoming out in the second quarter of fiscal quarter 2010. Compared to the industry, our sales continue to perform well. When viewing a true apples-to-apples time period that compares our front end comps to our top three competitors based on their most recent reporting, we outperformed all by a wide margin, as shown in this chart. We also continue to outperform on a two-year stack basis, as well.</p>
          <p>Turning to margin, our gross margin as a percent of sales was 28.1% in the quarter, compared to 27.6% last year. Overall margins in the quarter were positively impacted by higher Retail Pharmacy margins, as the effect of Generic drug sales more than offset market driven reimbursements. And front end margins were driven by OTC drugs, Beauty and Personal care and several private-label categories and that was partially offset by a higher provision for LIFO.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at our longer-term gross margin trends, our front end margins, while flat in the second quarter of 2010, increased in the other five quarters, as shown. And Pharmacy gross margins in the quarter improved with the impact of Generics. As we've discussed in recent quarters, additional progress obviously becomes increasingly difficult to achieve on these strong numbers. And please keep in mind that we will continue to believe the gross profit dollar growth and increases in traffic and basket are the most relevant measures of our progress.</p>
          <p>Two-year stacked SG&amp;A trends continue to improve with 15.8% growth in the third quarter of 2011, down from 17.1% last year and 18.7% in 2009. After adjusting for restructuring-related costs and costs associated with the Duane Reade acquisition, our two-year stacked SG&amp;A trends also showed steady improvement to 12.4%, down from 13.4% last year and 17.6% in 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally, walking through the progression of our reported SG&amp;A dollar growth rate of 7.2% to our adjusted core SG&amp;A rate of 6.4%, you can see the impact versus a year ago. Lower Duane Reade integration expenses offset SG&amp;A dollar growth by 60 basis points. Higher Duane Reade operating expenses added about 150 basis points. And lower net costs associated with our Rewire (sic) [Rewiring] (13:12) for Growth initiative offset our SG&amp;A growth by 10 basis points, all versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>Taking you through our income statement, this quarter included a LIFO provision of $50 million versus $18 million a year ago. Our estimated annual inflation rate for the current year remained at 2.25% versus 1.25% a year ago. Restructuring costs were $11 million, down from $17 million last year. Net interest expense was $18 million, down from $24 million a year ago, primarily as a result of reduced interest rates associated with our interest rate swaps.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate was 35.4% versus 42.5% last year. And recall that last year's effective tax rate included a $43 million charge to deferred charges related to the Medicare Part D subsidy for retiree medical benefits. This year's third quarter benefited from a favorable tax, state tax settlement. For the fourth quarter and the year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be about 37%.</p>
          <p>Average diluted shares outstanding were 922 million versus 982 million a year ago, due primarily to our share repurchase program. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.7 billion at May 31st, up 14.7%. Overall working capital decreased by 2.3% versus a year ago, while working capital as a percent of sales decreased by 8.5%.</p>
          <p>Total FIFO inventory increased by 7.7% in the quarter and by 5% on a per-store basis. For the nine months ended May 31, 2011, we generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations compared to $2.8 billion a year ago, primarily as a result of higher net earnings. Capital expenditures were $699 million, down from $786 million last year.</p>
          <p>As one of our core capital allocation priorities, we continue to return surplus cash to shareholders, and in the third quarter, we returned $535 million, including $160 million in dividends and $375 million through share repurchases. As of May 31, 2011, we repurchased $825 million against our $1 billion authorization. And as you can see, year to date, we have returned a total of nearly $1.7 billion to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now this slide shows our gross profit dollar growth trends for the past seven quarters, with the blue line representing 2010 and the green line representing the first three quarters of 2011. The red line above shows the two-year stack trend.</p>
          <p>Last year's fourth quarter benefited from the initial inclusion of Duane Reade, a higher level of organic store openings, and the rollout of beer and wine to about 3,500 stores, all of which will be cycling in the upcoming quarter. As you can see, the fourth quarter will have the most difficult gross profit dollar comparisons of the year. And we'll continue to see some volatility resulting from the timing of generic introductions. As an example, we received greater gross profit dollar help from new generics in the third quarter versus a year ago. In the fourth quarter we expect the help from generics to be significantly less than it was last year.</p>
          <p>We have a similar construct for SG&amp;A dollar growth for the last seven quarters, with the blue line representing 2010 and the green line representing the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, and the red line showing the two-year stack trend. As you can see, we're cycling a high rate of SG&amp;A dollar growth this year due to the Duane Reade acquisition, so the compare there will be easier than the prior quarters in the year.</p>
          <p>Now, as Greg said, we closed both the WHI and drugstore.com transactions in June. We expect the sale of WHI to be accretive to earnings by about $0.30 in fiscal 2011, largely due to the one-time gain on the sale, and neutral in fiscal 2012, not including the reinvestment of the proceeds. As we indicated at the announcement, we anticipate the drugstore.com transaction will be dilutive to earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 by about $0.03 due to transaction-related and one-time costs. Based on Walgreens intention to reinvest in the business, the company further anticipated the transaction to be dilutive to earnings per share by about $0.03 to $0.04 in fiscal 2012 and about $0.01 to $0.2 in 2013.</p>
          <p>Well, in closing, we are pleased with our quarterly results, which represented record third quarter sales, net income, earnings per diluted share and free cash flow, all notwithstanding an unforgiving economic environment. It is a validation that our strategies are translating into solid financial performance, and I want to acknowledge every one of our 244,000 employees, who work hard every single day to help drive these results.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll turn the call back to Greg for details regarding the developments with Express Scripts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Wade. First, let me start by saying, while not easy, this was a very clear decision for us and one that we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders, our patients, our customers and our company. Based on the terms and rates Express Scripts has insisted on and after months of unsuccessful negotiations, we have reluctantly concluded it does not make sense for our business and the strategic direction of our company to continue our relationship with them. As a result, we're planning not to be a part of Express Scripts Pharmacy Provider Network as of January 1, 2012.</p>
          <p>This means that in January, Express Scripts Provider Network will no longer include our 7,700 Walgreen stores and Duane Reade pharmacies. Despite today's announcement, we remain committed to serving all of our patients' pharmacy and healthcare needs in the Express Scripts plan through the end of this calendar year.</p>
          <p>To give you more context on our decision, as the largest provider in the Express Scripts Network, we no longer felt like a valued partner for several reasons. They were insistent on unacceptable reimbursement for the value we provide. In fact, their proposed reimbursement rates were below the published industry average cost to provide each prescription.</p>
          <p>Express Scripts attempted to define unilaterally what does and does not constitute a brand and generic drug, despite existing industry standards, which when combined with the unacceptable rates, further compounds the problem. And third, they wanted the ability to move Walgreens into lower reimbursement networks and benefit designs without our approval and without fair compensation, reducing the predictability we need to forecast our business adequately.</p>
          <p>As I said as I began my comments, I want to emphasize this was not a decision we made lightly. We considered all alternatives, but based on Express Scripts' position, it was very clear, principled decision for us. We believe the long-term ramifications of accepting Express Scripts' position with below-market rates and minimal predictability would have been much worse than any short-term impact to our earnings. Given that, accepting Express Scripts' position would not have been in the long-term interest of our company, our customers, our pharmacists and our shareholders. Furthermore, in a world where cost effectiveness and access to healthcare is so important, any time an intermediary continues to disproportionately grow its profit per prescription at the expense of the provider delivering the service, the relationship's out of balance.</p>
          <p>The fact is, we fill one out of five retail prescriptions in America. Patients and payers value the trusted relationship they have with their pharmacists. They value the high quality, cost effectiveness and convenience we provide, which is why we work with hundreds of PBM and health plan networks across the country.</p>
          <p>To give you some of the history, we've been in negotiations with Express Scripts for many months. Our team worked hard in a concerted effort to come to an agreement on a contract renewal that makes sense for both parties. We came into our discussions with Express Scripts with what we thought was a market-based reasonable approach to terms and rates.</p>
          <p>We proposed to lower rates on the behalf of the Department of Defense TRICARE program, the pharmacy benefit plan managed by Express Scripts that serves active and retired military personnel. We also offered to contract separately with Express Scripts for TRICARE beneficiaries, in order to continue providing services for all active and retired military personnel. Under our proposal, the reimbursement costs for the DoD would have been lower than under Walgreens new proposed commercial rates.</p>
          <p>For all other plans managed by Express Scripts, we offered to hold rates for a new contract at the level that will be in effect with Express Scripts at year-end, which will be lower than current rates. As for the impact on our business from this decision, we estimate that Express Scripts will reimburse Walgreens approximately $5.3 billion in fiscal 2011. This figure represents about 7% of our total company sales.</p>
          <p>Those sales divide into four distinct categories. Managed Care represents 45% of the business. 18% goes to the Department of Defense, 26% to employers, and 11% is Medicare Part D. Express Scripts' processes approximately 90 million prescriptions that are expected to be filled by Walgreens in fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>To mitigate that impact, we intend to work closely with our PBM and health plan partners. We've heard loud and clear over the past year from employers and payers that they value the choice, cost effectiveness, convenience and service of Walgreens. As a result over time, we are optimistic employees &#x2013; employers and others are going to want Walgreens in their network.</p>
          <p>Second, during the open enrollment period, we will reach out to the Medicare beneficiaries, to make sure they know how to have access to Walgreens' pharmacies they have known and trusted for years. We will assist them in finding Medicare Part D plans with access to Walgreens. And finally, we will work directly with employers and payers who have the ability to work directly with Walgreens.</p>
          <p>For all of these reasons, we are optimistic about our ability over time to regain these customers and grow our business. For now, however, we're not going to speculate publicly about the amount of business we can retain in fiscal year 2012 or the potential impact on our financial metrics and stated goals. In the long run, we believe employers will want plans with Walgreens in the network. With that said, Walgreens is moving forward with our strategies, and I'm confident in our future. Never in my years with this company have I seen so much interest from key stakeholders within the industry for the services Walgreens can deliver. We're prepared to live without Express Scripts in our world and work together with companies that understand the course we and the healthcare industry are taking.</p>
          <p>As we've demonstrated in this and recent quarters, we're focused on helping our patients live well, and on our strategy to transform community pharmacy to improve the overall cost and quality of care.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call back to Rick.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Greg. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Can you give us a little more detail on how you'll go about with the mitigating strategies and how fast you can act on those conversions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark. This is Greg. Yeah, as we said, I think first I'll start with Medicare Part D beneficiaries. The pharmacist has a very trusted relationship, close relationship with all seniors and all Medicare Part D beneficiaries. We intend, as I said, to work with them to make sure we help them find access to plans that have Walgreens in their network during the open enrollment.</p>
          <p>Two, we do believe that, in most cases, PBM contracts, health plan contracts typically are three-year contracts. And typically, most of those turn over about once a &#x2013; a third of them every year. So we intend to work with the hundreds of PBMs and health plans that we do business with that we think value Walgreens in their network. We heard that loud and clear over the past year that they want Walgreens in their network. And third, we think that there are a fair number of employers and health plans who have the ability to work directly with us and we intend to work with them, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can you contrast this with what happened with CVS last year? It seemed like the CVS dispute was more over <mark type="ph" /> macking (26:30). And maybe talk about this one versus that dispute?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark. I think certainly this is about Express Scripts and the proposed &#x2013; the proposal we received from them. Frankly, as we said in the call, I think first and foremost, we just &#x2013; we weighed this and obviously didn't make the decision lightly. We considered all the alternatives, as I said. But really what we can't agree with is someone having the ability to unilaterally decide what constitutes a generic drug or a brand drug. We can't agree to someone putting us into a lower cost network or a network with a different benefit design, as I said, without our approval or without us getting compensated for the volume shift that, that creates. And third, we just can't accept rates that are less than industry average and does not value what we bring to the marketplace, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I put it simply, I mean while there's &#x2013; while we're not here to talk about CVS Caremark, I guess what I would say is that we are taking a principled stand that we deserve to be treated and compensated fairly for what we do, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. It seems like a lot of the grievances you're citing here have existed for some time and so it could be viewed as, I guess, constant. What specifically here has changed? And then, I guess, what are the aspects of prior settlements that you want to see in parallel? I think predictability is one thing. But, I guess, why is this happening now and why not prior years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that, Mark, Greg, good question. First of all, the proposed rates are well below the market rates that we have and therefore &#x2013; and in fact, less than the industry average to fill and provide a script, as I said. Secondly, there are industry standards out there that define generic drugs today that the industry uses. And for someone to unilaterally decide to redefine a generic drug does not make sense to us and we can't accept.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I would say, Mark, I mean obviously, you know, negotiating with PBMs, managed care, whatever, is a way of life, right? That's just part of the game. Everybody wants to make sure that they do what's right for their company. So it happens all the time. It's just very seldom does it go public. And honestly, we are so far apart from what we believe is principled and fair, that it's not something that's going to be &#x2013; it's not going to be resolved honestly, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and, Mark, I will say, we were surprised by the proposal that we received from Express Scripts a couple of months ago. Surprised at the terms and conditions we received, the fact that they were looking for reimbursement rates far below the market rates that we have. And, as Wade said, we work successfully with hundreds of networks across the country all the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just explain this last sentence in the third bullet, for other plans managed by Express Scripts, Walgreens offered to hold rates at a new contract -- at the level that will be in effect at year-end, which will be lower than current rates. I don't understand what that means.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It means we basically, as of December 31, offered to evergreen that agreement basically, right? But &#x2013; which we already feel, quite frankly, is not an acceptable agreement, but that was &#x2013; and that's already below market, but that was what we felt was a very amicable proposal at the time.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a follow up on some of the mitigation strategies. Could you just talk on the cost structure side to what extent you could bring down pharmacy hours so that as we're trying to get to, you know, what would happen with contributions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Think about that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andy, great. Greg. Thanks, Andy. Certainly, we've thought this through clearly and we've got &#x2013; we're prepared and we have a plan. And certainly, we looked at the areas. We're ready to adjust SG&amp;A where we can, where we should. All of the above, as you just said, operating hours and others are in our plan. But we feel confident that we can adjust as needed and are prepared to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is a very important point. The -- even the worst-case scenario of us moving forward living in our world without Express Scripts in it is certainly better than what they were proposing. And we certainly have many things, levers we can pull, cost offsets, et cetera, but I guarantee you that our path forward for shareholders and for employees is better than the alternative, even in the worst-case scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I know you've -- someone asked about comparing this to CVS, but it seems so similar &#x2013; it's similar, but sounds like in a way this was a little more shocking and more of a discontinuous kind of, hey, here's our new offer and whereas with CVS, it seemed like, Caremark, it seemed like maybe the issues had been culminating, maybe came to a head. Is that &#x2013; am I reading that right? Is this like more of an out of the blue really discontinuous change in the business relationship and therefore the profitability to do business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark (sic) [Andrew] (31:55), Greg. Yes, as I said, we were surprised by the initial proposal we received. We'd been working for several months to try to come to a successful agreement with what we thought were fair and reasonable terms and conditions for the value we provide. We haven't been successful and therefore, we felt that it was necessary to inform our shareholders on this earnings call that &#x2013; where we are and that we're prepared to go on.</p>
          <p>As Wade said, and as I said earlier, that although we are in the business to fill prescriptions, we didn't take this lightly, as I'm sure you would expect. When we look at the long-term ramifications to our business, it's far worse than the short-term impact would have been having accepted below market rates.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clarify a few things, if I could. One, I think it was Wade before. Did you say that this is not going to be resolved? I just want to be clear. Are you guys still open to negotiations or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say this. I would say that we're not going to back off our principals and our stand that we deserve fair compensation, market-based compensation for what we do. If that day comes, so be it, but if not, we're prepared to move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in theory, there could be a deal. It's just a matter of it's got to be closer to your terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, Tom, this is Greg. Let me add to that. Certainly, as I said, we're in the business to fill prescriptions and certainly, if we can reach an agreement at some point in time where our issues that we laid out are accepted, certainly. But I also want to be clear that we are prepared, as I said, to continue to live in a world without Express Scripts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're prepared and we've got a plan in place to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then this generic versus brand definition, is there &#x2013; were they proposing a change versus what you've seen in the past or is there some new sensitivity on your part as to why this is an issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The proposal, as I said, is redefining what we understand the industry has used for years to define a generic drug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to be able to unilaterally define what constitutes a generic and a brand name drug is not acceptable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, honestly, any agreement where one party can define and change levers and things that they want anytime they want basically means that they can do anything they want, so there's no point --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That's different than the contract you've had in the past, that nuance. Is that nuance different than other contracts you've had?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And all right. And then the last thing, that $5.3 billion that you called out, to what extent would you estimate that there are front end sales related to that foot traffic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, front end sales aren't a big correlation to prescriptions, as we've said many times. We're not going to speculate on any of the numbers per se today.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from UBS, Steven Valiquette.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi. Thanks. You guys mentioned that you were surprised by the terms offered by Express. I'm just curious just from your end, I mean, what do you think is driving the more difficult terms that are being demanded by Express and maybe some of the other PBMs? And also, you went through with CVS last year, Express this year. Is there any color on when your Medco contract might be up for renewal or has it been renewed recently? Those are my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I &#x2013; I mean, we can't speculate on what's driving it. I would say obviously, if organic volume for them is roughly flat and their gross profit per dollars and EBITDA per script keeps going up, that probably suggests something. But with respect to Medco or others, we're not here to talk about any other party. We have good relationships with hundreds of other plans and we're going to continue on that. This is really about Express Scripts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I have just a related question. What do you think the chances that Express Scripts does what Caremark did in terms of saying, no, January 1, that you really &#x2013; we're going to kick you out in the next three weeks? Is that something they have the ability to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Meredith, I'm not going to speculate on what Express Scripts might do. As I said, we've made this decision and we've thought it through, considered all options and we are prepared to move forward in a world without Express Scripts. And so I can't speculate on what they may do. But we're prepared to move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our high road objective as of January 1st is just to make sure that there's time for payers and patients to transition, if necessary, so that we don't disrupt them because, at the end of the day, we should both take the high road around that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then another question about -- they've been public about their view on limited networks. Obviously, Walgreen not in a network is a big deal. That isn't a simple limited network to put together. But in your conversations with them, when they were talking was their posturing about, oh, limited network's the direction we think the industry should go in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Meredith, we've read that and we've heard comments in the industry about restricted networks. First of all, as I said, we've heard loud and clear in the past year that employers and health plans absolutely want Walgreens in their network. And frankly, the cost savings from restricting a pharmacy network is really just not substantial enough to reduce access for most is what we're hearing loud and clear.</p>
          <p>And finally, I want to &#x2013; health plans and health systems today are really looking beyond pharmacy. They're looking for community pharmacy to help them reduce their overall medical costs, while improving access and the quality of care. And I'll tell you frankly, I believe the days of isolating and focusing on drug spend separate from medical costs are coming to a close. So I think that folks today are looking for help from community pharmacy to attack their entire medical costs, improve access versus just focusing on their pharmacy spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I hope Express Scripts is listening to what you're saying. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>And we'll take our next question from Guggenheim Securities, John Heinkelbock (sic) [Heinbockel] (38:24).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Greg, from a long term perspective, one of the things that's concerned me is that when the generic wave kind of runs its course, that the level of confrontation between you guys and the PBMs would ratchet up. I mean, it looks like it's happening to some degree. How do you think about that long term if down the road there's less profit coming from generic? Will the level of confrontation increase? How do you guys deal with that longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John, first of all, as we've said before, I think anyone in healthcare, we're always going to be facing reimbursement pressure of some type. I will also go back to the answer in the comment just made to Meredith earlier. I think the value of community pharmacy going forward, working with forward-looking health plans and health systems that are looking to control the total medical costs, improve access, is where we're headed.</p>
          <p>One of our major initiatives and strategies, as you know, is to transform the role that community pharmacy plays in healthcare by expanding our scope of services via pharmacists, nurse practitioners and so forth. And that's when I say I've never had in my time with this company so much interest in what community pharmacy and what we can offer to health plans and health systems across the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I would say, and I've said many times publicly, and it's probably broader than this discussion, is we believe that in a world of all generics or beyond the wave that we have many, many, many ways that we can drive value for our company and value for the people and the patients and the payers that we serve. So I think that there will always be some tension but I think we're confident that there's enough things that we can do and over time that we have a very strong model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then second topic just on SG&amp;A dollars, maybe describe where you think we are with that. It looks like you're going to come in toward the high end of your range for the year. Do you think we're still on target for 3.5% to 4.5% growth next year? And what's the operating cost environment look like right now in terms of pressure on labor, utilities, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just a couple things, number one is we are on track for our target next year, 3.5% to 4.5% so very confident about that. Then the fourth quarter, as you know, last year was basically I'd say is an easy comp. So make sure that you on all the numbers you're running the two-year stacks to really get the truer trend. And I'd say with respect to costs, I mean, there's some inflationary pressure, but there's also I'd say in other areas deflationary pressure just because of the high unemployment and the economy. So we believe we can definitely manage to our targets.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As you look out to the generic payback in 2012 in Lipitor and what have you, can you give us any perspective of how you think the reimbursement rate environment is going to evolve in that regard, specifically to how reimbursement rates what they're going to allow you to earn on the incremental generics in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Greg here. I think that, as we -- as you said, as we see the generic wave coming, I think certainly generics are good for all. I think when &#x2013; I think certainly we're going to continue to see pressure, as I said, from being in the healthcare industry but at the same time, when you think about a world where virtually every therapeutic category of drug has a generic, payers are going to see a dramatic reduction in cost just from that same wave. So will they continue to be focused on cost? Yes. But are they going to see and experience big relief coming forward because every category will in essence have a generic? Yeah, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess within that, as we start to get closer and see the reimbursement rate picture become more clear for 2012 with all these generics, how much of that are the pent-up payers requiring goes into their pocket versus how much is able to be left to the benefit of the supply chain? I guess that's what I'm specifically trying to understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, fair question. I think, as I said, payers who are holistically and I believe trending to holistically looking at how to reduce their total costs are going to look at this in a more balanced and fair way. And frankly, that's what we're seeing. They're realizing that keeping folks adherent and compliant on drugs is much more beneficial than squeezing another few percents out of costs on the drug side itself.</p>

But I know at that point, you also had talked about going out directly to managed care companies, as well as employers. Can you maybe just talk about any success you had in the early stages of signing agreements directly with any of those employers, number one? And then number two, yesterday the State Senate here in New York passed an anti-mandatory mail potential law, which would now allow retailers that are willing to take mail order economics, they would be allowed to fill now mail-order prescriptions in their pharmacies. Can maybe just you give us your thoughts from a Walgreens perspective on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll take the first one. Yeah. On going to direct to employers, certainly we have had success there. And we lead with the employers. We lead with our Employer Solutions product. We also had direct relationships with health plans and employers across the country and we continue to see more of that. The State of New York, we applaud that. We absolutely think that payers and employers benefit from having a 90-day retail benefit added to an existing mail benefit. And I think that through proper benefit design and structures, that does make sense for retail to participate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can maybe Wade comment on the economics of that? So if you look today, the average mail-order contract is AWP minus 23% or 24%. If you have to take the exact same economics as just the way that the bill is written, is that a profitable script to you on a 90-day basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I would say there is no one contract. There is no one rate for mail. And when you factor it all together, it can be all over the map. But the truth is, is a lot of mail, most of it is kind of shadow priced off retail. Being able to do &#x2013; we can do a 90-day very cost effectively versus mail, providing a discount for the payer, but also providing good economics for us, given the benefit of being able to fill it once. So we'll have to look at that. I don't want to give an absolute but I think absolutely, we can be competitive and we'll have to see what the actual details are.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from <mark type="ph" /> Sean Buckman of Goldman Sachs (45:27).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. It's <mark type="ph" /> Sean Buckman (45:33) from Matt Fassler's team at Goldman. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you guys touched on this a little bit. But would you mind just kind of going through the drivers of the underlying or adjusted 6.4% expense growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can talk a little bit. One thing I do want to clarify, too, is I think in John's question earlier, the 3.5% to 4.5% target is kind of, I'd call it our cost base. Obviously, we said today with Express Scripts, we don't know exactly where this will end, what our sales will be, so we're not going to clarify goals but we're on track for that. I mean, the key drivers is obviously the same key drivers we had before. We have a little bit less to a degree because of partial quarter in there. We have our new store openings. We have some one-time costs associated with some of the deals that we've announced. But effectively, there's nothing out of the ordinary verse a normal trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then -- so there was no impact from the dot-com acquisition this quarter and I know there's a 3% -- $0.03 impact next quarter. Would you just remind us how the different line items flow through the P&amp;L on that impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The dot-com. The drugstore.com acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's going to come across a couple of different lines, both in terms of what their actual earnings accretion is, et cetera. Plus, we have some one-time and some expense costs that we're doing to beef up the proposition. Plus, we have some deal-related costs. So it cuts across all the various lines. It really just flows through it.  But you have closing costs, transaction fees and, like I said, you have the base P&amp;L of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the gross margin side, you talked about the big drivers there. Could you quantify maybe the impact of input costs this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've seen obviously some inflation coming through, not huge amounts but some inflation. We feel we've been very effective at pricing with it and in front of it. That's our plan to keep pricing. So, again, input costs are coming through a little bit. I think that while we do see higher fuel, et cetera, on our transportation, we also get some benefit offset because we're very convenient, and so we get it through the sales.</p>
          <p>I think you see that through our traffic, as well. But really, I think thus far, inflation is coming some but it's been manageable and for the most part, we plan on offsetting it through pricing. We'll stay competitive on the items we have to, but we'll also be smart about how we play our whole portfolio and drive things like private label even harder.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much and good morning. One topic we haven't really touched on is what you're seeing with regards to the clinics. Can you talk about what you're seeing with regards to profitability and also just traffic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Deborah. Thanks. You know, we're feeling good with the retail clinics, as you know, and I think I've talked the last couple calls, we've got over 300 out there. We've got scale. We now have really been able to look at the model and make some adjustments to the model, which are positive. So I think that -- such as expanding our scope of services beyond acute care into more screenings, chronic care management, and primary care like. We're seeing different approaches and we're planning different approaches to market and build customer awareness.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are hearing more and more, as I said, from health plans and hospital systems as we announced. Health systems are looking to leverage our retail clinics for access and affordable care. So we feel good there.</p>
          <p>Our employer business, our employer work site health has the same thing there. We're seeing increased awareness and demand. We just signed the relationship with Ochsner Health, as we talked about. So we're feeling pretty good there, as well as our pharmacy on campus, hospital system model. We're seeing a lot of interest from health systems that are looking for us to help them with their discharge process to prevent re-admission.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My thoughts had always been that as you continue to build out your relationships with the employers, that it might actually enable you to go directly to them and dis-intermediate, if you will, the PBMs. You're obviously in an interesting situation right now with Express Scripts. Can you -- and Walmart has been successful in going directly to employers. Can you maybe talk about how the relationships that you're building with the employers because the work site health care clinics might allow you to do this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And first and foremost, let me say that we work with all stakeholders in the industry. So we have valued relationships with PBMs that help take our products and services to the marketplace, health plans that take our products and services, health systems, et cetera. But at the same time, you're right. We do have what we believe is a unique and value-added solution for employers to be able to provide work site health on their campuses. With that, we are indeed able to build relationships because we create real value and we believe are influential in a positive way as to how they design their benefits for the best of their employees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Well, thanks so much, and best of luck.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Robert Willoughby of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Greg and Wade, I guess your principles in holding the hard line with Express Scripts would be much more comforting if some of the other major retailers also banded together to reject some of these new terms. I mean, I would assume Express is playing hardball with everybody, so how is this anything but Express leveraging what they perceive as overcapacity in the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bob, obviously I can't go there. But this is certainly about Walgreens and the proposal that we received, that we were surprised by from Express Scripts and the actions we're taking. We do believe that community pharmacy does provide value. We believe we certainly do. We think that payers are beginning to look for community pharmacy to provide services far beyond what others may be. So as I said, this is about us and Express Scripts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's also our principal standard is also being fair to the other payers that we work with and the other PBMs in managed care. It's not -- it wouldn't be right to give some super discount below market rate to only one at the expense of the others. We need to be fair to all of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Bob, this is Kermit. I'd just like to add that really no other PBM has taken this position to this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's interesting. I would view you guys as having a cost advantage in participating in this business. It seems to me other retailers must be agreeing to some similar hard line types of deals. It just strikes me unusual that they'd pick on one provider in their entire networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't speak to them. We believe we're very cost-effective and very reasonable and very market-based.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Bob, again, let me go back to, again, this is between us and them. But at the same time, I will say that we have decided to take a leadership position in this industry to transform the role of community pharmacy and to play a greater role in healthcare. And I think there is a tremendous opportunity for us to do that. We have tremendous interest from key stakeholders in the healthcare industry for us to play that role. And that's where we're headed. We're moving forward into that new world. And as I said, we're prepared and ready to live in a world without Express Scripts.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you and good morning. Two questions, one is, when you outlined the mix of the business that Express had earlier on the call, how would you characterize the profitability of that overall contract relative to other third-party contracts in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we said that we believe they're already unacceptable rates, and the proposal is even more unacceptable. So I'll just leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so below average right now. And then when you make your assumptions regarding the retention of business after this, are you basing that on hard evidence in the past where you've had contract withdrawals from smaller companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, Greg. As I said, in the last year, year and a half, we've heard loud and clear from employers and health plans that they want Walgreens in their network, for all the reasons that we stated: the convenience we bring, the 24-hour locations we bring, the services we're offering, the cost-effectiveness that we do bring. When you look at our generic utilization performance, the adherence and compliance, the rate terms and conditions we give, they're looking for us to be in their network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>And we'll take our final question from Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ed, morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions for you. On the gross margin, you had a nice bounce-back quarter in the gross margin after last quarter. You obviously said front end and pharmacy were both up. Can you talk about the sustainability of that over the next couple quarters? It looks like the comparisons are obviously pretty tough in both of those quarters. Generics, like you said, certainly are not going to help. Can you drive a positive gross margin over the next couple quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not really going to comment on the quarters. I would agree that there are tougher compares for various reasons that we outlined. I guess what I would say is we're really focused on not building a sandcastle but building a real castle. So over time, how do we keep strengthening the foundation in the financials, the gross margin, the SG&amp;A, making that model work, that 100 basis point model, and over time, over periods. So I won't speculate on the quarter, but I think that we feel that moving ahead, we have a very solid framework and of course, we're moving into a good generic period in 2013, et cetera. So I'll just leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wade, could you maybe talk about the drivers of the front end gross margin this quarter? I think last quarter you had mentioned that it was more flattish. Obviously, it's positive. And then, is there &#x2013; are there legs to that for those benefits, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, obviously right now, we're in the midst of finishing out CCR. So that brings &#x2013; that brings a fair amount of costs, et cetera, but then over time we believe, what we've seen, is we're going to have stronger margins and stronger lift resulting from it. We're also doing a better and better job of driving a very healthy mix for us, more beauty products, more OTC products, things like that, private label, which we've done a great job but we still have a lot of upside and we're putting a lot of effort in that. So there are definitely drivers over time that we can, I think, keep improving the margin. But again, I think it's -- you really have to look over the longer haul and keep focusing on two-year stacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just last question for you. I mean, there's been obviously a lot of questions today about Express Scripts and clearly, it's very, at least it seems very similar to what we saw last year with CVS. Can you just remind us of how that negotiation progressed last year? And then, last year, you started to see some real benefits in the gross margin when that resolution took place. So I know back then, you weren't really willing to talk about it, but is it something -- is this something that could provide similar benefits if it gets &#x2013; if it gets resolved in your favor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, Greg. Certainly, I'm not going to comment much on the CVS Caremark, other than to say, as we said in our release, we were very pleased with the outcome of that issue and we are working very closely with CVS Caremark today, as a result. Again, this is about our relationship with Express Scripts and our desire to reach agreement on terms and conditions that are acceptable for the value we provide.</p>
