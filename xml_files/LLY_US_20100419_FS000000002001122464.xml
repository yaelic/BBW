        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; our Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs, Bart Peterson; and Ronika Pletcher and Nick Lemen from Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest 10-K. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.</p>
          <p>You can access the earnings press release, supporting materials, a live webcast, an Internet-based replay, and a podcast of this conference call at Lilly.com. The supporting materials, the replay, and the podcast will be available on our website through May 21, 2010.</p>
          <p>Q1 was a strong quarter for Lilly on many fronts. In terms of financial performance, we posted robust results with volume driven revenue growth, substantial leverage on a performance basis between growth in revenue and growth in cost of sales as well as in operating expenses, and significant improvement in other income. As Derica will describe, excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform, this strong financial performance has positioned us to raise the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 and the bottom end by $0.10.</p>
          <p>On our last call, we discussed three business development deals that we had recently completed with Kowa, Incyte, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Since that time, we've continued to be active in business development, completing 3 more deals. We've entered into a global licensing agreement with Acrux for the commercialization of an experimental underarm testosterone solution; completed a deal with Boehringer Ingleheim in which we reacquired full rights to Cymbalta in OUS countries other than Japan. And we agreed to acquire European rights for several Animal Health products from Pfizer. Like the three deals we discussed in January, we think each of these deals helps to solidify our financial and commercial position in the short to medium term. Ronika and Nick will provide more details on these deals later in the call.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory front, in Europe we submitted exenatide once-weekly for regulatory review. Our regulatory team did a great job expediting this submission, allowing us to submit well in advance of the end of the first half. Here in the U.S., the FDA issued a complete response letter for exenatide once-weekly or Bydureon. We expect to submit our response this week.</p>
          <p>Finally, the PDUFA date for Cymbalta in chronic pain passed without FDA action. We expect that the FDA will schedule an Advisory Committee meeting in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>On the legal front, the judge in the Southern District of Indiana case with Teva upheld our Gemzar compound patent and ruled in our favor on nearly all of the grounds Teva had raised for invalidity of our method-of-use patent. You may recall that the judge in the Michigan case with Sun had already issued a partial summary judgment ruling invalidating our method-of-use patent on the grounds of obviousness-type double patenting. As a result, the judge in Indiana did not rule on this particular issue. In the Sun case, the Court of Appeals for the federal circuit will hear our appeal on May 7.</p>
          <p>The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the U.S. Patent Office's rejection of the patent claim Pfizer had asserted for Viagra. As a result, Pfizer's litigation alleging that Cialis infringed Pfizer's patent claim was dropped by agreement of both parties. Also in Cialis litigation, the Court of Appeals for the federal circuit affirmed a Delaware trial court's decision rendering its opinion that certain scientists at Vanderbilt University should not be included as joint inventors on patents relating to Cialis and its use in treating erectile dysfunction.</p>
          <p>Finally, we reached a proposed settlement of the outstanding shareholder derivative litigation.</p>
          <p>Now perhaps the biggest news for Lilly and for the healthcare industry was the passage of new legislation that brings significant changes to U.S. healthcare. These changes began to affect our financial results in Q1 and will have a greater impact on our results in the future. Before discussing our Q1 financial performance and our 2010 guidance, let's review some of the major provisions of the new legislation.</p>
          <p>As you're probably aware, many of the provisions that raise money to pay for healthcare reform take effect within the first 12 months. However, the provisions expanding insurance coverage are not slated to take effect until 2014. Let's start with those provisions that will affect our 2010 results. Changes to the Medicaid fee-for-service program and to the 340B program take effect retroactive to January 1 of this year. For the Medicaid fee-for-service program, these changes include an increase in the statutory minimum rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and a limitation on the maximum rebate to 100% of the product's price. Changes in the 340B program are focused on expansion of the program to include additional institutions such as children's hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, and rural referral centers and sole community hospitals meeting certain criteria for disproportionate share adjustment under the Social Security Act.</p>
          <p>Changes to managed Medicaid will take effect as of March 23, 2010, the date the healthcare legislation was signed. Specifically, the new legislation calls for an expansion of Medicaid fee-for-service rebates to managed Medicaid.</p>
          <p>In addition, our 2010 results will also be affected by channel accruals that we'll have to book to reflect greater discounts and rebates for the various elements of healthcare reform. Why is this? Well, government expenditures for purchases in any given period correspond to sales we made to wholesalers in prior periods. Therefore, in advance of a government expenditure occurring, we need to reflect our best estimate of the eventual discounts and rebates we'll have to pay. From a practical perspective, this means that we need to accrue for these future government discounts and rebates at the time we make our sale to wholesalers.</p>
          <p>In total, we expect that these various elements of U.S. healthcare reform will negatively affect our 2010 revenue by 350 to $400 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, our 2010 results will be affected by changes to the subsidy paid by the government to employers who provide their retirees with a drug benefit that's at least equivalent to the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beginning in 2013, the Federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers. While this tax will not take effect for three more years, accounting rules dictate that we recognize the present value of this future tax liability as a one-time charge upon passage of the tax law change. As this tax law was officially passed in March, our taxes for Q1 reflect a one-time charge of $85.1 million.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss those changes slated to take effect on January 1 of next year. On this date, two additional provisions of the healthcare reform legislation will kick in. First, branded pharmaceutical companies will provide a discount of 50% on drugs dispensed to certain Medicare Part D participants when they are in the donut hole. Second, branded pharmaceutical companies will collectively pay a multibillion dollar annual fee to the government.</p>
          <p>Implementation of these two provisions will undoubtedly be complex. Until specific regulations are written, it's not clear exactly how each of these provisions will be implemented. We've made initial estimates of the effect of these two provisions on our 2011 results, although these estimates could change substantially as the regulations are finalized.</p>
          <p>When these provisions are added to those taking effect in 2010, we anticipate that our 2011 U.S. revenue could be negatively affected by 600 to $700 million. Keep in mind that our exposure to various elements of healthcare reform is dependent upon product mix. For example, our exposure will decline significantly after the Zyprexa patent expiration.</p>
          <p>By January 2014, the U.S. healthcare legislation calls for a significant expansion of insurance coverage. This includes expansion of the population eligible for Medicaid as well as the establishment of state health insurance exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this will eventually extend coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who are currently uninsured.</p>
          <p>Finally, the healthcare reform legislation authorizes a regulatory pathway for follow-on biologics. The legislation includes important incentives for biotech research, including data package protection of 12 years.</p>
          <p>Now with this background, Derica will discuss our Q1 financial results and our 2010 guidance. Derica?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil. As I've done in the past, I will focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insight into the underlying trends in our business. Now this view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairment, and other special charges. Since the Imclone acquisition was completed in late 2008, pro forma comparisons are no longer necessary.</p>
          <p>Now let's start on slide eight with a quick look at our Q1 income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated strong revenue growth of 9% in the first quarter in spite of the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased from 83.8% to 79.5% due to the effect on the cost of sales of changes and the value of the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold in the period. Specifically, this effect significantly lowered cost of sales in Q1 of 2009 and modestly increased cost of sales in Q1 of 2010. Once again, in the supplemental section of our slide deck we have provided a slide showing the trend in our gross margin as a percent of revenue both with and without this particular foreign exchange effect.</p>
          <p>Now this quarter's operating expenses, defined as the sum of R&amp;D and SG&amp;A, grew by 7%, less than the 9% revenue growth. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew 6%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside of the U.S. and the impact of foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by lower legal expenses, while R&amp;D expense grew 10%, primarily due to increased late-stage clinical trial costs.</p>
          <p>Now despite generating leverage between revenue and operating expenses, operating income declined 3% due to the significant increase in cost of sales caused by foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Now moving down the income statement, you'll see an improvement in other income. And this improvement is primarily due to damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following our Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, a gain related to the disposition of investment securities acquired in the Imclone acquisition, and lower net interest expense.</p>
          <p>In addition, our tax rate increased by over five percentage points, driven primarily by the one-time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the retiree drug subsidy. Let me also remind you that the failure to pass an extension of the R&amp;D tax credit also served to increase our Q1 tax rates.</p>
          <p>Net income and earnings per share declined 1% and 2% respectively due to the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our cost of goods sold and the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform. Q1 earnings were reduced by $0.12 per share due to the impact of U.S. healthcare reform. It was comprised of two items: first, approximately $60 million or $0.04 per share in accruals for higher rebates; and secondly, a one-time tax charge of $85.1 million or $0.08 per share.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows our reported income statement while slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in our today's earnings press release.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at how foreign exchange affected our Q1 results, and let's start with revenue. As you can see on slide 11, total revenue growth of 9% includes a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. As to that impact of foreign exchange, total revenue grew 6%, driven by 4% volume growth. Japan's substantial volume growth continues, driven by Alimta's mid-2009 approval of both first-line and second-line non-small cell lung cancer as well as continued strong growth in Humalog and Zyprexa. Lilly remains among the fastest growing companies in this very important market.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on slide eight. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>First, you'll see the 6% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Now below that, you'll see that the cost of sales grew by only 1%, reflecting continued expansion of our gross margin percent on a performance basis. Operating expenses grew 5%, which was also less than our revenue growth. And as mentioned earlier, increased investment in late-stage clinical trials drove R&amp;D, which was up 9% on a performance basis. SG&amp;A on the other hand grew much less, which was only 3%.</p>
          <p>As a result of holding growth in both cost of sales and operating expenses below the revenue growth rate, our 6% performance growth in revenue translated into 9% performance growth in operating income as well as 10% growth in EPS, including the $0.12 per share negative impact of healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>Now for your information, on slide 13 we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. As you may recall, up until now our 2010 guidance has explicitly excluded the potential effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Now that specific legislation has been signed into law, we are incorporating the estimated impact of this new legislation into our guidance. We'll do so in two steps. First, we'll provide our 2010 guidance still excluding U.S. healthcare reform, so that you can have a clear idea of how our underlying financial expectations for the year have changed since our last earnings call. Then we'll layer in the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Moving forward, this will be the basis for future guidance updates. So excluding the estimated impact of U.S. healthcare reform, we are modifying our guidance to reflect our strong underlying business performance, including improvement in other income as well as for recent movements in foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>At the bottom line, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year from a range of $4.65 to $4.85 to a range now of $4.75 to $4.90, an increase of a nickel on the top end of the guidance and an increase of a dime on the bottom end of the guidance.</p>
          <p>In terms of line item guidance, we've slightly modified our revenue guidance to mid to high single digits to reflect the recent weakness in foreign currencies versus prior periods. Other income and deductions is now forecast to be a net deduction of 50 to $100 million. This represents an improvement of $100 million from our previous guidance of a net reduction of 150 to $200 million. This improvement is primarily driven by recovery of damages from companies that had launched generic olanzapine in Germany, and a gain of the sale on investment securities acquired in the Imclone acquisition. All other line item guidance remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, our earnings per share guidance excluding U.S. healthcare reform reflects the $0.03 charge for the Acrux deal and the $0.02 restructuring charge, resulting in an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share.</p>
          <p>Now let's discuss U.S. healthcare reform and how we expect it will affect our financial results. As mentioned earlier, we expect U.S. healthcare reform to negatively affect our 2010 revenue by 350 to $400 million. In addition, our 2010 results are also negatively affected by the one-time tax charge of $85 million related to the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy.</p>
          <p>Incorporating the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform yields the following EPS and line item guidance. On both a reported and a non-GAAP basis, our 2010 EPS will be approximately $0.35 lower, resulting in a range of $4.40 to $4.55 on a non-GAAP basis and a range of $4.35 to $4.50 on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>We now expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits, driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, Animal Health, Effient, and the exenatide franchise, partially offset by the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>We still anticipate gross margin as a percent of revenue to be flat to declining. However, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, we still expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to increase.</p>
          <p>Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low to mid-single digits. Research and development expenses are also still projected to grow in the low double digits. As mentioned earlier, other income for the year is now expected to be a net deduction of between 50 and $100 million.</p>
          <p>And as a result of the $85 million charge in Q1 related to future taxation on the retiree drug subsidy, the effective tax rate for the full year is now anticipated to be approximately 23%. Note that our full-year tax rate guidance assumes eventual extension of the R&amp;D tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally, we still expect cash flows to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion and anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2010 guidance.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to Ronika for an update on the Effient launch. Ronika?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Derica. For Effient, Q1 sales of $9 million showed modest growth over Q4 2009. However, this included continued inventory reductions from the original stocking. We estimate inventory was reduced by $7 million in the first quarter. Sequential quarter total prescription growth was 124%.</p>
          <p>While uptake has been slower than planned, we are encouraged by the recent demand trend. Currently, new-to-brand share for Effient exceeds 8% of the total oral antiplatelet market and has continued to show strong growth. New-to-brand trends reflect placement of approximately 1,800 patients on Effient therapy per week. Current estimates are that approximately 16,000 PCIs [Percutaneous Coronary Interventions] are conducted in the U.S. per week.</p>
          <p>Access continues to expand. Of targeted hospitals, Effient is now on formulary and stocked in the cath lab in 75% of all accounts, up from 60% earlier this year, meeting our expectations. In addition, payor formulary access continues to progress well. As of April 1, examples of payors making positive decisions include Express Scripts, Medco, WellPoint Anthem, Health Net, United Part D Prescription Solutions, and Prime Therapeutics, as well as many other PBMs and health plans.</p>
          <p>Finally in the U.S., we believe our focus on the high risk ACS-PCI [Acute Coronary Syndrome- Percutaneous Coronary Intervention] patients such as those with diabetes has gained traction in the market as market research suggests that this patient type is often cited as a group in which physicians feel Effient is an appropriate choice. Our sales force is well prepared to communicate these messages using promotional materials that incorporate feedback from DDMAC [Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and Communications].</p>
          <p>In Europe, despite the widespread availability of generic clopidogrel, we continue to achieve strong reimbursement and favorable pricing. Reimbursement covers 100% of the label population in most countries. It is important to highlight that following hospital formulary approval, protocol inclusion is a critical step in the hospital access process across Europe.</p>
          <p>In Germany, Effient experienced a slower than expected start due to the complexity of the protocol inclusion and access process. However, a clearer account focus and intensified cath lab activities are accelerating access to formularies, protocol inclusion, and ultimately patient initiation. As a result, first quarter sales in Germany showed a 147% increase over Q4.</p>
          <p>Similarly in the UK, PCI centers and primary care trusts have made progress establishing formulary access and creating protocols. The 59 PCI centers with current formulary approval represent 75% of all PCIs performed in the UK. As a result, first quarter sales in the UK increased 190% over the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>In the near term, we expect OUS sales growth to be bolstered by uptake in recently launched markets. Lilly launched Effient in Australia in December of last year. Notably, Effient was approved on its first submission in Australia and was listed for the full label populations and length of therapy. We launched Effient in France in January, and we've integrated learnings from the UK and Germany to drive quicker formulary access and protocol inclusion. Most recently, we launched Effient in Spain in late March and Italy early April. Remaining plan launches in 2010 include Canada and over 30 additional countries.</p>
          <p>In March, Lilly entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for the commercialization of Acrux's experimental underarm testosterone solution, Axiron. The product is currently under regulatory review by the FDA for the treatment of testosterone deficiency in men.</p>
          <p>In exchange for these rights, Acrux will receive an upfront payment of $50 million plus $3 million upon transfer of manufacturing assets. Acrux may also receive a milestone payment upon issuance of marketing authorization in the U.S. and commercial milestones and royalties based upon global sales of Axiron.</p>
          <p>We believe that Axiron will be a strong strategic fit for Lilly, leveraging our experience in men's health with Cialis to advance both the science and clinical outcomes for men with low testosterone. Axiron has the potential to be the first testosterone solution to be applied via an underarm application for patients who have testosterone deficiency. We look forward to working with Acrux and the FDA during the regulatory review process.</p>
          <p>Nick?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Also in the first quarter, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim terminated our agreement to jointly develop and commercialize duloxetine, with Lilly purchasing BI's interest in the compound. This termination means that excluding Japan, all rights to duloxetine for all indications will revert back to Lilly. Lilly paid $400 million upfront to BI. In addition, BI will receive a royalty on sales through the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>Over the past few years, we've been steadily building our Animal Health business both through organic growth, particularly in the large and growing companion animal segment, and through acquisitions. In 2007, we acquired Ivy Animal Health. In 2008, we acquired worldwide rights to Monsanto's dairy cow supplement, Posilac. And in March of this year, we agreed to acquire European rights to certain of Pfizer's Animal Health products. These products are used in both production and companion animals.</p>
          <p>These products also include vaccines, a new area for us and one we are poised to expand in the coming years with our own pipeline. To support our entry and future growth in vaccines, the transaction also included the acquisition of a vaccine manufacturing plant in Ireland. Detailed financial terms of this deal are not being disclosed. This deal is expected to close in Q2 pending regulatory approvals.</p>
          <p>Now I'll provide an update on our pipeline. Our pipeline slide demonstrates changes since our January 21 earnings call as of April 12. The recent additions and progress of our compounds further underline our robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 68 distinct NMEs [New Molecular Entities], including 30 compounds in Phase 2 and Phase 3.</p>
          <p>We've continued to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent half of our late-stage Phase 2 and Phase 3 assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio.</p>
          <p>As we have said before, advancing our pipeline is our number one priority. As reflected by the arrows on slide 20, since our last formal portfolio update we have advanced four assets into Phase 1: one for anemia, two for cancer, and one for pain; promoted one asset to Phase 2, our basal insulin for diabetes; added Axiron for testosterone deficiency; and finally one Phase 1 schizophrenia asset was terminated.</p>
          <p>So while the patent expirations of the coming years will hit us hard, we have eight molecules in Phase 3 today, and we anticipate at least 10 molecules in Phase 3 by 2011 if not sooner, with more coming behind. We expect that this will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013, providing a foundation for future growth.</p>
          <p>We've seen encouraging progress in our late-stage pipeline. Our Alzheimer's program continues to enroll ahead of schedule. We completed enrollment in our first Phase 3 trial for semagacestat, our gamma-secretase inhibitor last year, and we'll complete enrollment on the second Phase 3 study this month. We've also exceeded 50% enrollments on one of the Phase 3 studies for solanezumab, our A-beta [Amyloid Beta] antibody, and are closing in on 50% enrollment for the second Phase 3 study.</p>
          <p>We completed enrollment on the Phase 3 PRELUDE trial evaluating Enzastaurin for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We also initiated our Phase 3 AWARD program for our GLP-1 Fc assets in the first quarter. And we have Phase 2 data on NERI for depression both as a monotherapy and for augmentation, and are moving forward with our plans to initiate Phase 3 in the first half of 2011. We plan to present this data at a scientific conference in the future.</p>
          <p>This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will open the call for the Q&amp;A session. Operator, first caller, please.</p>

          <p>Thank you; a couple of questions. On the reform figure, can you parse out the 2011 revenue figure into what will come from the Medicaid rebates versus the other components like the donut hole filling and the excise tax and the 340B? And I guess same for 2010, if you could split it between rebates for Medicaid and 340B?</p>
          <p>Second question on emerging markets; it's something that most drug companies are talking about a lot. I don't really hear Lilly talking about it as much. And in fact unless I'm missing it, it doesn't seem like you guys even disclose your sales in these regions. And I'm wondering when we can expect Lilly to give more transparency on your sales levels and strategy in these regions.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, thanks for the question. We'll have Derica answer those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Tim, let me try to address both. In regards to the healthcare reform impact, the aggregate numbers that we provided of 350 to 400 million impact in '10 and the 6 to 700 million in '11, that's the level that we're comfortable disclosing at this time. We do not have plans to disclose the pieces of that in terms of breaking it down into the elements of the excise tax versus the Medicaid rebates. Now my rationale behind that is that there are still for some of those elements of the healthcare legislation still being discussed and still to be further defined, especially around the excise tax as it relates to the composition of sales and will it be branded sales, so forth. So it would be premature to try to get to that level of detail at this stage. But we did try to provide to you all at an aggregate level what we think in totality the impact &#x2013; the range of the impact could be.</p>
          <p>In regards to our emerging market strategy, in fact we are quite active in that space in terms of trying to take advantage of the opportunities in those geographies: clearly in China, markets like China, Brazil, and Turkey, where we have a great presence. But we are not just looking at exercising those opportunities on a commercial basis; we're also taking advantage on R&amp;D. So for example, we are increasing both our R&amp;D and manufacturing presence in China. We've actually doubled the size of our sales organization in China over the last 12 months to take advantage of our diabetes and CNS and oncology portfolio there.</p>
          <p>So while it may not be, I guess, as transparent to the marketplace, we are employing a lot of different efforts and strategies there to take advantage of that marketplace. However, and if you look at our price/rate/volume slide, that gives you some idea if you're looking at the rest of world of what we were able to achieve in those markets to date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, this is Phil. Just qualitatively on healthcare reform, the larger elements would likely be, given what we know today, the fee that will be assessed on the industry and our portion of that, the impact in Medicaid of the higher minimum rebate from 15.1 to 23.1, and the extension of that Medicaid fee-for-service pricing into the managed Medicaid book of business. Still a negative impact but less would be things like the 340B expansion. So that gives a little bit of color, while we're not in a position, however, to give specific numbers for each one of those line items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I can maybe add to update, Tim, as well, is there is also, as you look at Lilly relative to some of our pharmaceutical peers, there's also a product mix aspect in there as well. So products like Zyprexa that's heavily Medicaid weighted obviously has a disproportionate impact on Lilly maybe versus some of our peers. And so you can see that over time how as our portfolio mix changes, then the impact of healthcare reform on Lilly will also change.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Just wanted to follow up on the healthcare reform impact in 2011. The excise tax: is that recorded also in sales and as part of your 600 to $700 million impact that you guys are guiding us to?</p>
          <p>And a question on Effient; I was wondering if you guys have changed your detailing effort behind Effient over the last couple months.</p>
          <p>And third question on Byetta. With Victoza appearing to have gained about 20% of new prescription share based on the latest IMS data, has your marketing message for Byetta changed then? What's your overall expectations for the franchise, and are there any plans to increase the sales and marketing dedicated to the franchise? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, in regards to the healthcare reform in 2011 and the excise tax, the impact of that would be shown as a reduction to net sales, is what we are anticipating at this time. Once again, that's another item that's still to be resolved, but at this stage, that's the assumption that we're making.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Eric, in terms of the Effient messaging, as we've discussed some in the past, we've continued to be very focused on the patient populations that seem to have the best risk benefit from the drug. In particular, for example, diabetics is one area where we're clearly focusing on to ensure that the initial physician experience is positive. We do detail to the full label that we have that would highlight some of those areas where we have the strongest risk benefit. Ronika?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to Byetta, what we've seen most recently is we have seen some share of market softening, but it has largely stayed flat; that's key. We have seen some very slight softening in our new-to-brand, and it's specifically within the endos group and they're trying to get clinical experience with the new drug. But in the long run, we feel as though the growth of the GLP market in general will actually drive more patient utilization of our Byetta BID. And unfortunately when it comes time for our launch of our exenatide once-weekly or Bydureon, we feel as though the market will be educated more broadly with regards to the GLP-1 class itself.</p>

          <p>And then secondly on Alimta, can you give us a flavor for &#x2013; just help quantify what's going on in Japan and how much bigger that is really driving versus your expectations? I mean, is it 300 million international in the quarter? So how much of that was Japan? What kind of growth are we seeing there?</p>

          <p>With regards to Alimta sales in Japan, we are really pleased with the uptake there. Keep in mind that we received both the first-line and the second-line indication approval at the same time. Unfortunately, we don't give specific sales estimates by product or by country. But Alimta sales have been strong, but we've also seen other products have fairly strong sales growth as well as mentioned in the call, including Zyprexa, Humalog, Cialis, and Gemzar, so we're very pleased with the Alimta progress in Japan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There certainly would be. We had very strong volume growth in the U.S., in Japan, and in the aggregate of the other markets worldwide. All three of those broad geographies had very solid growth, and frankly in terms of dollars probably a similar kind of magnitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean if you think about the geographical mix, for us to achieve 57% overall growth for Alimta globally says that it has to be driven by more than just the Japanese marketplace.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you remember from the last couple of annual investment community update meetings, we've been talking about Japan. While it is a mature market, being one and given the timing of the launch of various products and line extensions should provide some countercyclical growth for us relative to what we would see in the coming years in the U.S. and Europe, and I think you're seeing essentially the beginning part of that trend that we had been talking about for the last couple years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, very much. I had a couple questions on reform and then one on Alzheimer's. So with respect to reform, could you just provide a little bit more detailed explanation on the impact of rebates going up and the implications for 2010? Specifically if you could please explain the extension of Medicaid pricing, that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And then second for 2011, I'm assuming that your 6 to $700 million revenue impact does not reflect some marginal benefit from additional revenue from seniors being pushed through the donut hole, if you could confirm that and also maybe talk about whether you are expecting a revenue benefit in 2011 from the seniors being pushed through the donut hole.</p>
          <p>And then finally, if you could just walk us through the timing on the Phase 3 readouts from your Alzheimer's program; I'm assuming that those will be in 2012, but if you could walk us through the timing, that would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. We're going to have Bart start off with your healthcare reform questions and Jan will handle the Alzheimer's questions. Bart?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, with respect to the impact of Medicaid rebates increasing, the expansion of not only Medicaid fee-for-service from minimum rebates of 15.1% to 23.1%, we also have the shifting &#x2013; the expansion of the rebates into Medicaid managed care. Now Medicaid fee-for-service is a larger portion of the overall Medicaid sales than Medicaid managed care, but nonetheless that is another meaningful increase. And also the increase in the rebates has an impact on the 340B discount as it currently exists and as 340B will be expanded as well.</p>
          <p>Secondly, your second question with regard to revenue benefits from the donut hole, partial filling of the donut hole, that's something that we're still looking at. And the behavioral aspects of seniors as they in 2011 begin to receive a 50% discount is something where we're not certain of what those impacts are going to be at this time, and as a result we're still analyzing that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, being a newcomer to Lilly, I'm very pleased that Lilly has these two Phase 3 trials in a very high medical need area. The first component, the gamma-secretase inhibitor semagacestat, the two trials, identity one and two, are planned to be completed in June 2012. In reality, it is 21 months after the last patient enrollment. The second one, solanezumab, a beta antibody, the EXPEDITION 1 and 2 trials are also coming in the same timeframe. The date currently is July 2012, 18 months after the last patient is enrolled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess a couple of other things just to provide some additional color; in terms of the benefit, potential benefit coming from additional patient utilization as pharma companies help fill the donut hole, there are two components that we've looked at. There's one that we have quantified and put in some potential upside for, and that is a few more individuals actually getting through the donut hole as opposed to stopping treatment under the current reimbursement scheme. Frankly, there's not a huge percentage currently. If you take Forteo as an example and probably the one where we have the biggest issue in our portfolio, we estimate that about 15 to 30% at most of patients stop treatment as they hit the donut hole. Some of that you just might just expect from normal compliance. Some of it could be financially related, so there could be a slight benefit there but it's not a large impact.</p>
          <p>The other one that I've heard a number of people on the street discuss is our doctors currently not putting patients on medications because they're quite sure they won't be able to afford them, and they don't want to start them to have them have partial treatment. Early market research would indicate that you need to have a more substantial closing of the donut hole to make a significant impact in that particular area.</p>
          <p>The other thing for the 21 months, just to &#x2013; you can do the math as well but to make it easy on you, September we completed enrollment in the first trial. Twenty-one months from that date would be approximately June of '11, if we completed enrollment, as Nick said, which we plan to here in April in the second trial, that takes you up to January of '12. As we've discussed in the past, it's very likely that we will hold off on announcing results from the first trial until we have both trials actually closed so we can preserve the data integrity of all the data from the second trial as well. I hope that helps.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just to follow up more, I'm trying to understand the 6 to 700 million, so assume that 300 million is the excise tax plus the donut hole. Is the donut hole offset by any patient assistance programs? I think that on the Roche conference call &#x2013; their portfolio is a lot &#x2013; their mix is different from yours, but they expected the donut hole to be offset by patient assistance programs. Are you seeing the same thing?</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you remind us what your exposure is to Medicaid? And thirdly, the 6 to 700 million for 2011, are there any bottom line offsets to that, or should we just assume that all just drops right to the bottom line? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>In regards to the bottom line offsets, while we've been obviously all anticipating that there could be some form of healthcare reform in the U.S., we had already begun our activities in terms of having to restructure our business and make sure that we're accounting for the expected declining margins.</p>
          <p>So if you go back to September of last year, Jami, when we announced that we were looking to reduce our head count by another 5,500 as well as also save an additional $1 billion by the end of '11, we are probably on the road in achieving some of those outcomes. To date, we've taken out about 1,500 of the 5,500. And we've made considerable progress in terms of our $1 billion savings goal, so we feel very good there. The impact that you're seeing us talk about here on the call primarily only relates to the top line impact both in '10 and '11.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on a gross basis both Medicaid fee-for-service and managed Medicaid combined account for just over 10% of our total U.S. business and on a net basis is slightly under 10%, so roughly 10% of our U.S. business is exposed to Medicaid.</p>

          <p>With regards to the other portion of your question, specifically with regards to the patient assistance programs, we have said in the past that we did see an uptick in the patient assistance programs in 2009. We saw an uptick continue into the first quarter of 2001 (sic) [2010] . How it will transition as these pieces of the legislation are ruled or enactivated is yet to be seen. And we can't say at this point will there be a direct offset with regards to the expense in the patient assistance program versus the expense incurred with regards to healthcare reform. That's yet to be seen.</p>

          <p>Second question just on the reform issue again, within the 350 to $400 million 2010 impact, I know you're not going to give specific breakdowns of the Medicare pieces, et cetera. But can you just quantify how much of this year's impact is from that channel accrual piece in anticipation of future discounts as compared to items that are being actually implemented in 2010?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse, your line is open.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and I appreciate your taking the question. I just have a couple. On healthcare reform, do you guys have an estimate in terms of what you think the baseline was for seniors hitting the donut hole in regards to the compliance rate? Do 50% of them continue to take drug or some kind of proxy you can give us to think about that?</p>
          <p>And then I just want to follow up on the basal insulin question. I wonder if you could talk about your interest being driven by a combination with the GLP-1. I think that's what you're seeing Novo and Sanofi do, and I wondered if you had the same intention as far as your GLP-1 plus basal insulin. And if so, is it yours or is it your partner's that might be the combination of choice?</p>
          <p>And then last question is related to Alzheimer's program. At the AAN [American Academy of Neurology], there was some progress of diagnostics in regards to detecting disease earlier. If the confirmation of these final results comes later this year, would you guys think about moving ahead in an earlier disease setting? And if so, would you do that for both the A-beta and the gamma-secretase programs?</p>

          <p>Great, Catherine, I'll take your first two and then Jan will take your last question. We'll need to follow up on your first question. We don't have the data that you were asking about.</p>
          <p>For the basal insulin GLP combo, clearly we've seen a number of companies talking about moving forward with some of these kinds of programs. There's currently nothing that we've discussed publicly, and we'll continue to monitor this space and see what the best way is for the GLPs to become a very significant portion of the treatment for Type 2 diabetics.</p>
          <p>If you've heard from our past comments, we continue to feel that the GLPs will be over time a very significant player in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The profile, for example, that we've shown with exenatide once-weekly compared to essentially almost all of the major current therapies is extremely promising, very strong Hb A1C control, very good weight profile, initial things that we've seen in terms of CV risk and definitely compared to some of the other drugs like insulin's low risk of hypoglycemia make it something we think would be a very significant drug in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes going forward.</p>
          <p>Jan, for Alzheimer's disease and diagnostics?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Alzheimer area, there is a key need to identify the right patients which have then the type of amyloid disease that we believe the majority of Alzheimer's patients will have, but certainly some dementias are likely to be caused by other factors such as more vascular problems in the brain. So from the standpoint of the current therapies, I think we need the amyloid diagnostics to be combined with Alzheimer's treatments and preferably to do that as early as possible in the lifespan of the Alzheimer's disease. So I assume the results for these first two programs will guide us actually how early do we need to treat an Alzheimer's patient and also for how long.</p>
          <p>I also see a great interest in the evolution of diagnostics for the Alzheimer area, specifically then to have some additional markers than just cognition to in time realize when there is a need then to treat further amyloid accumulation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have three brief questions. Will the healthcare reform hit to earnings in 2011 be roughly $0.50 a share, and will that be evenly spread throughout the year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, excluding healthcare reform, Lilly is cutting our revenue growth guidance due to the recent exchange trend. Why isn't this same exchange trend benefiting R&amp;D and SG&amp;A guidance? It appears that the higher guidance is &#x2013; higher earnings guidance is solely due to the higher other income.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, Cymbalta chronic pain claim. Lilly notes in the release that it expects an FDA Advisory meeting in the second half. But when the meeting was cancelled the first time, I thought the company was saying that no meeting would be required. So what has changed, please? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Steve, what we said is that we did a broad range for 2011 because there's still some quite dynamic pieces in there, especially around the excise tax as well as the donut hole that we were articulating earlier, so that's why we focused primarily on the range of the 6 to 700 million in terms of the sales impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of foreign exchange and the foreign exchange changing the guidance for some elements and not others, Steve, we talked in the past about the foreign exchange having a larger effect on revenue, a similar effect probably on SG&amp;A but not quite as large. I think you can take by the fact that we're moving the revenue guidance and not the SG&amp;A guidance that probably it was close enough to begin to tip it, so we had some possibilities of being in that lower range on the revenue side and we're still within the range on SG&amp;A side.</p>
          <p>And then for R&amp;D, R&amp;D has a much lower exposure given where we actually have the spend to changes in foreign exchange rates.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But recall, in our SG&amp;A in Q1 we did see about a three percentage point impact in our SG&amp;A growth in Q1 due to the movement in foreign exchange and that was 3 percentage point increase.</p>

          <p>With regards to the Cymbalta chronic pain sNDA, we currently have always said and we've been consistent with saying with prasugrel as well that the FDA can schedule a review at any time. We have had discussions with the FDA, and in those discussions our expectation is that a panel will be held in the second half of the year. We stand behind our data that we submitted. We feel that it's promising data. We've had other pain indications prior with regards to fibromyalgia and DPNP, so we stand behind that data, and we're prepared to address any of the FDA's questions at the panel if it occurs in the second half, and we're ready to do so.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks, Phil. Let me try to close today's session with some overarching remarks. First of all, we've had a very good start to 2010, and it was highlighted by volume driven revenue growth. We've had substantial leverage on a performance basis which drove operating income to grow faster than our revenue. And we've also seen significant improvement in other income as we highlighted.</p>
          <p>Excluding the effect of the U.S. healthcare reform, this strong financial performance has positioned us to raise the top end of our 2010 EPS guidance by $0.05 and the bottom end by $0.10. The strong financial performance also provides the resources we need to strengthen and progress our pipeline and engage in business development and pay our dividends. In fact, in the past three months we've completed three more business development deals. We've made significant progress on products such as Bydureon and our Alzheimer's drugs, enzastaurin, NERI IV, GLP-1 Fc, and our basal insulin. And all the while we've initiated Phase 1 trials for four new molecules.</p>
          <p>While the U.S. healthcare reform clearly provides a near-term challenge, we are confident our innovation based strategy will create value for patients, payors, and shareholders. We're focused on advancing our pipeline to deliver on our strategy, and we believe that our pipeline will enable us to launch two new novel molecules per year begin in 2013 and return us to growth after the year's YZ.</p>
          <p>I want to thank you for taking your time this morning to allowing us to update you on Eli Lilly and Company, and we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. And as always, we'll keep you informed on our progress, and have a great day.</p>
