          <p>Welcome everybody. Thank you for joining us again today. We will follow the usual running order with Laurie covering the financial results followed by Terry, who will update on strategy. And we'll then be pleased to take all your questions.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that despite the challenging economic environment, the Tesco team has once again delivered a good set of results guided by experienced management, who have steered the business through recessions before. As markets around the world start to recover, each part of our business is well positioned to pursue our strategy for growth.</p>
          <p>We continue to make good progress growing sales, profits and market share over the year. Our acquisition in Korea is performing well and delivering excellent results.</p>
          <p>We've opened our first three Tesco Lifespace shopping malls in China and we're continuing to build the infrastructure and develop new products for Tesco Bank.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased to announce that we again increased our dividend for the 26th consecutive year. This consistent track record of delivering dividend growth for shareholders is unrivaled in the FTSE.</p>
          <p>Strong Group results over the last year have been achieved through a constant focus on what matters most to customers in challenging times. A good example of this has been our renewed emphasis on rewarding loyalty at home and abroad. And this has been a great success with customers.</p>
          <p>In the UK, we increased our Clubcard investment with Double Points, giving customers even greater reward for their loyalty. And internationally, we also launched Clubcard in three more countries during the year, in Poland, Slovakia and Thailand. And for the first time, we now have more Clubcard holders internationally than in the UK. It's been another significant year for our work on the environment and within local communities. As we grow, our customers increasingly look to Tesco to take the lead in these areas and we are.</p>
          <p>In January, we opened the world's first zero-carbon store at Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, the latest step in our journey to reduce the carbon footprint of our business. And over the past year, we have made significant progress towards our long-term goals by reducing emissions from our baseline 2007 portfolio of stores and also the distribution centres by 7.8%.</p>
          <p>On the charitable front, this year we donated over &#xA3;60 million to charities and good causes, once again exceeding our target to give the equivalent of 1% of our profits to good causes. We've also continued to roll out Community Champions. These are members of staff dedicated to working with local schools, charities and services to support the causes that matter most to our local customers.</p>
          <p>Our Champions help us play a positive and active role within local neighborhoods and we now have Champions in some seven countries.</p>
          <p>Today's good results are testament to the hard work of our people. We remain united by our goal to improve the shopping trip for customers. Our latest employee Viewpoint survey shows that the record levels of employees feel proud to work for Tesco, which I think says a lot about what we've been able to &#x2013; how we've been able to cope with the recession. And this is very well exemplified by the way our staff went the extra mile to help customers during the snow and floods this winter.</p>
          <p>So I'd like to thank you -- all of our people for their hard work, which I know will continue in the year ahead. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. So we've delivered a strong performance in a recession with broadly based double-digit growth. We've increased our investment, improving the shopping trip for customers focusing on initiatives that build customer loyalty. And this has come and been funded by our productivity programme, we call Step Change.</p>
          <p>We've delivered on our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet, reducing debt by much more than the &#xA3;1 billion target. In line with our five-year programme, we've sold 1.8 billion of freehold property at very attractive yields. And the prospects for improving returns have never been better, supported by maturing businesses, recovering economies and increasing capital efficiency.</p>
          <p>I will take you through a summary of the Group performance. The Group sales for the year were 62.5 billion, up 7% and the Group trading profit rose by 12% up to 3.4 billion. This is a very strong result in a challenging economic environment across all of our markets. Both Group pre-tax and underlying profit before tax grew by 10%.</p>
          <p>The Bank and the Korean acquisitions have supported our trading profit growth well. From this year, Group pre-tax profit growth will get an extra boost as the Bank amortization charges reduces by approximately &#xA3;100 million.</p>
          <p>Underlying diluted earnings per share were up 9% to 31.7 pence. As you know, our policy is to grow dividends broadly in line with underlying diluted EPS, so our full-year dividend will also be up 9% with a final dividend of 9.16 pence.</p>
          <p>Before turning to the performance of the main business, I wanted to briefly talk about returns because it's a theme I intend to come back to on a regular basis. Return on capital, our key measure, has held up well. 12.1% return on capital employed, which is the right hand bar on this chart is a very respectable number, particularly in a capital-intensive industry like ours.</p>
          <p>Last year's ROCE number was 12.7%, so it's taken a small knock in the year. I'll go through the main drivers of this change. First, the underlying growth in returns was good contributing a 0.4% improvement driven by the UK and Asia. The impact of the downturn on Group returns was actually quite small and was isolated to Central Europe and I'll come back to international returns in a minute. The biggest dilutive influence on group returns were in fact the Japan impairment and the acquisitions both of which were temporary effects. With the Bank and Korea coming through very well in terms of performance, they'll start to continue to return from here.</p>
          <p>Looking at the main business now, I'll start with the UK, which has delivered another strong profitable year. Sales in the UK, ex-petrol, VAT-adjusted, were up 6.1% including 3.2% for like-for-like. Trading profits grew by 7% or 9% before the extra costs arising from the sale and leaseback transactions. The results are good but more importantly, we are winning in the market after adapting the business to a new environment.</p>
          <p>You can see from the chart the combined benefit of Double Clubcard Points and the annualization of the discount range coming through in the second half. Since then, we've been growing nicely ahead of the industry.</p>
          <p>There are two key elements to maintaining the success. First, continuing to improve the shopping trip for customers and how we fund the investment. Second, sustaining the optimum level of new space to grow the business profitably into the long-term.</p>
          <p>I am going to talk about funding the customer investment in a bit more detail. As you know in 2009, we decided to launch Double Clubcard Points. We did this with the confidence that our Step Change programme could rise to the challenge. The programme is in its 13th year and continues to go from strength to strength delivering 550 million of incremental savings this year. And Step Change is not just about generating savings, each project must be better for customers, simpler for staff and cheaper for Tesco.</p>
          <p>Our stock reduction program's a great example. It's better for customers because it's driven a big improvement in availability for both food and non-food. It's simpler for staff because it's easier to locate stock to fill the shelves, and stock errors can be identified more easily.</p>
          <p>It's cheaper for Tesco because, for example, a typical extra now holds 8% less stock, and fewer hours are needed to replenish the shelves. We're now looking at releasing backroom space to redeploy for retail services and expanding our non-food space.</p>
          <p>Step Change is constantly identifying more projects like this, and in some cases, projects are known as far ahead as five years. This year we aim to complete a global program that will deliver savings of &#xA3;800 million, and we'll invest most of those savings back into the offer for customers.</p>
          <p>The UK is well placed to continue to be an engine of growth for the Group. By making improvements, the shopping trip and through maturing space, we expect to see three to 4% growth over the long term for like-for-like.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline of new space will deliver a further three to 4% of new sales each year, and this year will deliver 2.4 million net square feet as we release some of the work in progress we've built up over 2006 to 2008.</p>
          <p>With our UK returns on capital already strong and rising, this will deliver further improvements. A third of this space will be for non-food where our market share is low and therefore provides excellent potential for growth.</p>
          <p>So moving on to international. Generally, we've seen bigger economic contractions in our international markets than in the UK, particularly in the early part of last year, and this resulted in falls in like-for-like and puts some strain on profit performance.</p>
          <p>However, having been hit hard on the way down, and having adjusted our businesses well to the challenges, we are now well placed to benefit as the economies recover. And this chart shows clearly how international sales performance is already beginning to reflect this.</p>
          <p>In Asia, the downturn was sharp but relatively short, and the trends are improving. Sales were up 20% in the year and profits up 24%. Of course, this includes the effect of turning around the acquired Korean stores that had been loss-making on acquisition.</p>
          <p>There is a lot of interest in our progress in China. So I wanted to update you on how we're developing the business. We've set up an operating company and a property company separating the investment in the developments of the Lifespace malls from our retail operations.</p>
          <p>The PropCo will manage up to 80 mall developments over the next five years, in addition to managing the third-party element of project funding. The mall program will deliver around half of our new retail space in China and will involve net capital investment from Tesco of around &#xA3;2 billion over the next five years. The balance of funding will come from external equity and debt investors into joint-venture companies that will own the completed projects.</p>
          <p>We're building out what we see as our model for long-term profitable retailing in China, particularly in the second and third tier cities that we are targeting. By joint venturing with our investors, we're carefully managing the sharing of investment, value and risk.</p>
          <p>From a retail perspective, we're aiming to grow our space in China by around 30% per annum over the next five years. And in terms of profit performance, we expect China to be broadly break-even next year. Thereafter, we expect to build profits rapidly as we leverage the large upfront infrastructure and capability investment.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Japan. In today's release, you'll have seen a further impairment we've made. This is a reflection of the still difficult retail trading conditions and it means we've now written down some 70% of the goodwill.</p>
          <p>In Europe, where customers were most affected by the downturn, overall sales was stable and trading profit performance was resilient, despite the obvious challenges of a second year of recession in some markets.</p>
          <p>The key has been facing into these challenges and what we've done in Ireland is a good example. In Ireland, we've transformed the business for customers by restructuring our operations, and in particular the way that we source our products. As a result, we've achieved strong volume growth in the second half and held profits flat, pre-exceptional charges.</p>
          <p>We've been looking at our experience in Ireland to help us find more synergies and savings across our other international businesses, and I'll update you further on that later in the year.</p>
          <p>The Western United States has been one of the hardest hit economies globally. Due to these economic headwinds and a more modest store opening program, Fresh &amp; Easy sustained a similar dollar loss to 2008-'09. Although we don't expect losses to be much lower in 2010-'011, they have now peaked and the U.S. will cease to be a drag on our Group growth.</p>
          <p>The recession predictably has not been helpful for international returns. Like-for-like CROI came off by 0.5% in the year, mainly as I said earlier as a result of the recession in Europe. It's also partly because we felt it was right to keep investing through the downturn, particularly in organic growth.</p>
          <p>We're starting to see the benefits of that judgment already in Asia, and I'm confident it will come through in Europe as the economies recover. Importantly, there's good underlying trajectory to our international returns, driving the improvements before the recession with scale, asset maturity and market position. And I'm confident that these factors will reassert themselves as background improves and will resume a faster rate of growth.</p>
          <p>These are powerful drivers that aren't always obvious when looking at the overall numbers, particularly when we're building networks and entering new markets. Let's look at each of these drivers in turn, and I'll start with scale.</p>
          <p>We've learned from experience that getting to those scale and leadership in any market is a powerful driver of returns. On this chart, you can see that if you take our eight markets where we hold the number one or number two position in, the returns are 30% better than the average. Then when we go on to look at the mature assets in those markets, such stores that we've held for more than four years, they are generating returns 70% higher than the average.</p>
          <p>The clear message is that as markets mature, the drag of new assets diminish, returns will rise. For these reasons, plus all the other opportunities we have to drive returns from global buying to lower capital intensity formats to own brand developments, I believe returns will grow strongly from here.</p>
          <p>Turning now to retail services. Profits were 540 million, up 18%. And this year these businesses contributed almost a quarter of our Group growth. As I said at the seminar in November, I believe there's significant potential for future growth here. In Tesco Bank, we're continuing to focus on setting up the systems and infrastructure, and the migration is progressing well. And the retail banking sector has remained tough, profits rose by 13% to &#xA3;150 million. And profit growths this year will be held back by the double running costs as we transition out of the RBS systems and we will have also a challenging background for investment income.</p>
          <p>Thereafter, we expect growth to accelerate as these effects reduce and we benefit from the strong underlying business growth our new products. Bad debts are improving and our performances remain significantly better than the industry average. We've maintained the Tesco Bank balance sheet in net surplus with a strong Tier 1 capital ratio of over 12%.</p>
          <p>Turning to our group balance sheet, I'm pleased to say we're making significant progress. I set the target last April to reduce net debt by &#xA3;1 billion in the year. Despite ForEx impacts, I'm pleased to confirm we've exceeded that target delivering net debt reduction of 1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>We've achieved this through managing capital back to a normal level having spent a couple of year's building a space pipeline, which means that the core U.K business is generating much more cash and this chart shows the EBITDA exceeding CapEx by &#xA3;1.9 billion last year.</p>
          <p>You can see that the work in progress capital bulge, we've talked about in the last couple of years has now gone through. International also generated cash in the year. As you can see from the chart, six of our countries were cash positive on this basis, which I think is very impressive.</p>
          <p>The second elements of debt reduction is 0.6 billion improvement in working capital and that has been done through projects, livestock reduction program I discussed earlier, and there are still more to come here.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, we continue to manage the release of value from our uniquely strong property asset base at very attractive yields. We worked hard to improve our key credit metrics in the year, which is good for our rating. And of course, this has also been very difficult in a recessionary environment.</p>
          <p>Our financing and liquidity positions remained very strong. This chart shows how well balanced that debt maturity profile is. Our early two years where we need to refinance more than &#xA3;1 billion and that's in 2013 and 2017.</p>
          <p>We've already paid down 70% of the debt fall in due in this financial year. And we will not need to renew any debt fall in due in the following two years.</p>
          <p>We also have 2.6 billion credit facilities that are undrawn and remain undrawn throughout the year. This year group CapEx will be about &#xA3;3.5 billion. And the relationship between cash flow and capital will continue to be strong.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to our target to reduce debt to 7.5 billion by the year-end 2011.</p>
          <p>In the year, we released property proceeds of 1.8 billion, selling some of our property and several merits. It demonstrates a significant premium of a book value created through a combination of development risk, high-quality site selection and the Tesco covenant.</p>
          <p>Here's Earlham which is a great example. We bought the land in 1977 for &#xA3;300,000. We then built a 50,000 square foot store and last year we sold it for &#xA3;50 million. That 50 million we've recycled into 500,000 square foot shopping mall in Fushun, China.</p>
          <p>Selling property introduces more operational attention into the business through rents. The fact that we have made solid progress as we absorb these costs confirms the strength in the U.K business. That yields a substantial and sustainable profit stream, which ranks the dividends without fundamentally altering the freehold mix in the business, which remains at 70%. And of course, it's the usual source of funds for financing that growth for the future.</p>
          <p>Our latest full property evaluation reflects affirming yields across the market and confirms that our properties were significantly more than their book value.</p>
          <p>As of February, the estimated value of properties was &#xA3;34.6 billion. So in conclusion, the business is delivering for shareholders through solid growth in sales, profits and dividends. We are strengthening the balance sheet by reducing debt, while maintaining a strong freehold asset base. At the same time we continue to invest in our strategy, building the platforms for our future growth. And with an improving economic environment the acquisition, strong market position, the outlook for returns has never been better.</p>
          <p>Thank you, I'll now hand over to Terry.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David and Laurie and good morning everyone. This year's results show another solid performance from across the group, our flexible business model has enabled us to weather the economic storm and emerge stronger with good building blocks in place for future growth.</p>
          <p>Our positions in high-growth international economies and non-food, we were always likely to face strong headwinds during the downturn in the recession, with these parts of the business, which will grow fastest in the recovery and beyond. Each part of our business, U.K, international, non-food, services is stronger now than this time last year. With leaner operations, growing market share, acquisitions performing well, and the strong opening program were starting the year in good shape.</p>
          <p>We are positioning the business for an improving economic environments around the world, perhaps slow and steady in the U.K, but that's okay for us, and a faster recovery in Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>Through the recession, we've stayed on strategy and continued to invest. This has positioned us well for improved returns going forward. There is a capital employed in the downturn starts to come through.</p>
          <p>I'll begin my usual update with international. It's been a very tough year as Laurie said, but we performed well with sales up 9%, the Korean acquisition, and the good contribution from new space in both Asia and Europe gave us momentum in the face of challenging like-for-like growth, particularly in the first half.</p>
          <p>Profits also grew, which shows the resilience of our international business. Severity of the downturn has meant &#x2013; but it hasn't been possible to grow profits everywhere, but we know from our market share gains, which have taken place everywhere that we've continued to trade the business well locally. This gives us confidence that we're competitive that we're doing the right things to customers and the encouragement that we're emerging from recession in a stronger position.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased with our performance in Central Europe, despite obvious challenges. We've made good progress in each country, as you can see from these market share numbers. Poland continues to do well with sales and profits up again, with strong growth, particularly in our smaller store formats, the launch of Clubcard in August, went well it's an important development. So, far we have signed up 1.8 million customers.</p>
          <p>The Czech Republic and Slovakia have been very tough markets this year. We've taken bold action to lower costs and prices to help customers who are feeling the strain, and in the case of Slovakia, actually to regain customers who went shopping across the border, because of when they entered the euro they had unfavorable exchange rates.</p>
          <p>We're starting to look at how we can take our European hypermarkets to a new level, as the economic background improves. In Slovakia, we've just introduced the Extra format by remodeling one of our Bratislava stores, that's the one in Petrzalka, adding new departments such as pharmacy, photo processing, opticians, phone shop and new department layout, it's actually launched extremely well.</p>
          <p>Our business in Hungary continues to demonstrate resilience, despite the economic recovery lagging the rest of the region. Our store opening program has helped us maintain sales growth and we've extended our position as market leader. So, we'll be well-placed when the recovery comes and actually, finally, consumer confidence is picking up in Hungary.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, despite our planned slowdown in store opening, we continue to grow sales well by 8%. The long-term potential of this large and underdeveloped market remains very attractive. And with the economy now turning the corner, we're setting up the pace of opening again and we'll grow space, in fact, by around 30% this next year alone.</p>
          <p>In Ireland, where we've now completed the operational changes outlined at the half year, the results have been remarkable, customers have benefited from unprecedented price reductions with over 12,000 products, it's the majority of the range, reduced by an average of around 20%. And we've turned around like-for-like sales performance from the minus 18% that we recorded in the first half to being very strongly positive now.</p>
          <p>By lowering our operating and buying costs, we've reduced prices for customers, we've maintained steady profit performance and we've grown market share, strongly grown market share actually.</p>
          <p>Our businesses in Asia made good progress with strong growth in sales and profits. We're now started to benefit from an improving economic background. In our largest business, Homeplus in Korea, the acquisition continues to deliver very good results, showing double-digit like-for-like in its second year, building on the significant uplifts we achieved at the acquisition.</p>
          <p>Homeplus is now a sophisticated business of real scale; sales of &#xA3;4.5 billion, profits of almost 300 million, it's rapidly becoming a major engine of growth for the Group. And there is still plenty of growth left to go for in grocery, in non-food, in convenience, in services. If we had the same share as we do in the UK, our Korean business would be four times larger than it is now. Is that realistic? Well actually, our current market share in Korea is similar to our UK share in the early 90s. So, it's taken us 10 years in Korea to achieve what it took 60 years to do in the UK.</p>
          <p>And if Korea today feels a little like our UK business in the early 90s, then our business in China feels similar to Korea just a few years ago except, of course, the market is much bigger.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to lay the foundations for long-term growth in China with further investments in space, in infrastructure, in management, just as we did in Korea, these are increasing costs in the short term, but building a platform for greater value creation in the long term.</p>
          <p>We opened 17 hypermarkets this year, including, as Laurie said, the first three Lifespace shopping malls. They opened with over 80% occupancy. We will be opening 23 hypermarkets in the coming year and nine of those will be our own Lifespace malls.</p>
          <p>Tesco Lotus in Thailand has delivered another good performance, strong store opening program helped maintain growth in sales. Strong productivity gains have enabled us to increase profits while still lowering prices for customers.</p>
          <p>And in Malaysia, a good contribution from new space has helped us to grow sales and market share. This year we'll be opening three times the amount of new space as the economy recovers. Those Southeast Asian countries really sort of sharp contraction as the export markets closed and they're just coming through the anniversary of that now actually and seeing a sharp recovery.</p>
          <p>In Japan, as Laurie has said, the retail environment remains difficult. We're making progress though in developing the business. Our new convenience store formats receive very good feedback from customers. They &#x2013; its scene is different, they like to focus on fresh food and the new features such as the installed bakery, the extensive wine range and the new own label products, for 100 of them, which in just six months have grown to 10% of sales.</p>
          <p>The development of our business in India continues to make very good early progress. We're helping our franchise partner, Trent, achieve like-for-like sales growths of around 40% in its Star Bazaar hypermarkets and we expect to open the first cash and carry this year.</p>
          <p>Moving &#x2013; sorry, just before we move to the UK, I'd like to update you on Fresh &amp; Easy. Well, I'm very pleased with the good progress we're making. Improving our range, store environment, marketing; each time I go, it's better. As a result, the customer feedback scores which were always very, very high, they were always a record high for the industry indeed for consumer brands, they've moved even higher.</p>
          <p>From the start, Fresh &amp; Easy has had a wide customer appeal. Even though it's a niche, it's had a wide appeal in that niche across income groups, rich and poor, everything in between, across all ethnicities, across all age groups.</p>
          <p>Actually here are at two stores from very, very different neighborhoods; Compton, Southern Los Angeles, I think it's where Magic Johnson comes from, it's a very troubled inner city area. We were part of an investment to regenerate that area, has gone in Fresh &amp; Easy. And Manhattan Beach, which is a more prosperous part of Southern LA, it's actually near where the office is. Now the point there being that Fresh &amp; Easy has traded successfully in both those locations, even though they couldn't be more different.</p>
          <p>But inevitably, it takes time to build awareness and understanding of a completely new concept. So our recent media campaigns have focused on how Fresh &amp; Easy offers both great quality and low prices. And as you can see, we've linked this to our green philosophy by explaining how saving energy can help us offer low prices. So, there is very good word of mouth now kicking in.</p>
          <p>The increased customer awareness and the improvements in store help drive like-for-like sales further into positive territory in the second half. We're also seeing encouraging results from new stores, which are now typically opening with much higher first week sales.</p>
          <p>Now, it's important that we keep our store opening program aligned to the external economic environment, which remains challenging in that part of the United States. We expect to open 50 new stores this year focusing on areas where the economy is a bit stronger. With the softer property market, there are advantages. It's easier now to buy freeholds and the cost of building stores has fallen by around 20%, so we're making use of that.</p>
          <p>We've got growing sales, improvements in productivity, improvements in waste and distribution costs, store economics are improving steadily, so too are the economics around the distribution center and the factory. Even though there's plenty of capacity in there it's already a proven success as a key part of the operation. So we started the year with good momentum in the U.S. Combination of organic growth and new store openings means we'll grow sales this year comfortably &#x2013; by comfortably more than 50%.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I'm pleased with our international performance. Our businesses have balanced well the demands of getting cheaper for customers, delivering profits today and investing for growth tomorrow. This year we'll be stepping up our store opening program to more than 8 million square feet internationally of new space and that gives us good momentum as the recovery develops.</p>
          <p>In the UK, we had a good year. We're growing faster than the industry and we've achieved this by remaining focused as always on doing the right things for customers. Our strategy of earning customers loyalty by helping them to spend less with low prices and affordable new products such as the discount brands, now that deflated sales growth initially but it kept customers shopping at Tesco. And then by rewarding loyalty through Clubcard, we've maintained much stronger, much steadier growth than the industry, much more profitable growth than the industry as a whole, which has seen itself a significant slowdown with a sharp decline in inflation, but as our performance has been much more consistent and therefore, relatively much stronger.</p>
          <p>Even in recession, delivering for customers is not just about great prices and promotions. That's why we've continued to invest in all elements of the shopping trip. The stores have never been in better shape. Availability has improved again. It's a chart showing availability as measured by dotcom pickers over the last, what is it, 5 years. You can see the consistent improvements from an already high figure actually.</p>
          <p>Evening gaps on fresh food have been reduced by 18%. Service remains a key differentiator for Tesco. We've always had tough markets on service. The combination of one-in-front for which we're famous, the introduction of better and better self-service checkouts, which now account for a quarter of all transactions offer customers speed and choice that they really appreciate. We've actually given additional training, additional service staff &#x2013; sorry, additional service training to over 200,000 of our staff this year.</p>
          <p>Tesco is very broad range, broad church, underpins our wide appeal. Through the recession, we've helped customers with lower-priced products, but we've also always been there to offer them affordable treats such as the finest restaurant collection ready meals, which have been a great success.</p>
          <p>Now quality remains important to customers even in tough times but as we emerge from recession it will become even more important. So in the year, we started a major change program raising product quality levels, launching more than 2,600 new and improved products. And of course, that's been made possible as input costs have eased, the price rises and input cost have eased, it's much easier to engineer in better value, better quality into the products. These changes combined with the improvements that we're making to the way we merchandise fresh food and produce and bakery and counters helped Tesco win the Produce Retailer of the Year Award in 2009 and there's much more improvement to come.</p>
          <p>Building on these improvements to the shopping trip is our increased investment in Clubcard. Customers love Clubcard and the fact that they're getting more rewards is changing behavior. More people are signing up. A higher proportion of transactions are now with the Clubcard. 18% more households are redeeming vouchers than a year ago. Their points are going further with improved partner deals, which really people are addicted to. And we're investing, of course, in technology to make Clubcard easier to use like our application for the iPhone. I understand people are loading this &#x2013; 13,000 people a day are loading this application. It's one of Apple's top 5 applications and we've just launched it.</p>
          <p>Our customer strategy is sustainable for the long-term because our low prices and shopping trip improvements are themselves sustainable. They're funded by structural productivity gains, as Laurie mentioned, and, of course, they're unique, because we can differentiate Tesco with Clubcard.</p>
          <p>Our non-food business has also been very resilient through the downturn. During the year, it grew stronger as the economic recovery began. In the UK, our non-food like-for-like sales improved steadily through the year from 1% like-for-like in quarter one to 5% in quarter four. Number of categories had pleasing growth.</p>
          <p>In electricals, turnovers doubled in the last 4 years. Customers recognize our competitive prices and our rapidly improving range in store and online and also actually the benefit of the 1,000 Tesco tech support advisors that we now have in store. That's a big plus for us in terms of our business.</p>
          <p>In entertainment, we've done well in a tough category. Our market share and gains has doubled in a single year, believe it or not. We've revamped the range, improved the layout and so on. We can actually get supply too, which was an issue 18 months ago where they restricted supply on historic measures of market share. We're innovating in the DVD markets with exclusive to Tesco releases, the last of which actually sold a million copies in Tesco alone. We've launched our new entertainment site, which brings together our physical and our digital offer, lots of exciting plans coming down there.</p>
          <p>In toys, we've seen very strong growth. Sales this year grew 25% with online sales up more than 60%.</p>
          <p>Clothing sales also grew very well to reach &#xA3;1 billion for the first time, helped by the launch of our online clothing range in October, which itself is going very well and we're adding to it constantly. Clothing is becoming a global strength. In Central Europe, clothing like-for-like sales grew by 14%, building on very strong growth of the previous year in a market that was actually declining markedly due to recession, so very much booked the trend. We've also introduced F&amp;F ranges to 4 Asian markets this year with great success, I have to say, and that's another step of developing F&amp;F into a global brand.</p>
          <p>Our clothing business is a good example of the benefits of being a global group, joint buying, whereby 95% of the supply base in Central Europe is the same as for Ireland and the UK. It has brought significant benefits in terms of quality, cost, in terms of logistics, planning and so on.</p>
          <p>The outlook for our non-food business, both internationally and in the UK is good. In the short-term they'll be helped by recovering economies and in the longer term the potential upside is substantial given that these are large fragmented markets and that the authority of our offer, both in store and online is improving markedly each year.</p>
          <p>Retailing services is another major engine of growth in our strategy. As you know, the plan is to follow customers into new services and new channels and to leverage our stores, our brands, our customer relationships through Clubcard. These services offer significant growth opportunities both in the U.K, and internationally, and attractive returns on capital.</p>
          <p>Tesco Bank has made good progress this year in developing its infrastructure. We selected our banking system, partnered with Fortis to develop an insurance underwriting platform. The migration is going well. We anticipate launching new savings products and mortgages by the end of this year and current accounts in 2011.</p>
          <p>At the same time, of course, we've been growing the business well, particularly on the banking side, where we've increased the number of accounts by 400,000 focusing primarily on Clubcard customers. We only have to concentrate on Clubcard customers and we can be a very big and successful bank. We achieved double-digit growth in personal loans, also in credit cards where we now have a market share approaching 10% just in credit cards.</p>
          <p>Our online business has had another year, sales of 14% to more than 2 billion; that's on the dotcom business; profits up 26% to 136 million. The number of active customers in our online grocery business has grown to over a million. Basket size has increased, record levels of availability as you saw earlier. And innovations such as price matching on substitutions are improving the service to customers.</p>
          <p>Tesco Direct, the other part of the Internet also had a good year, growing sales by 28%, continuing its path towards profitability. We have now Direct desks in 260 stores. We're building on the success of the stocked-in desks in our Homeplus stores. We're trialing our first stocked-in desk in a superstore format in Bedford. It's got an exciting reuse of the format, initial results are good there, and we'll be doing another 10 superstores this year.</p>
          <p>Our telecoms business made significant progress this year; Tesco Mobile grew its customer base by 14%, that's in a declining prepaid market, to more than 2 million customers.</p>
          <p>We also launched our Pay Monthly offer or contract up in 2009 and we have broadened our appeal with the introduction of the iPhone. Phone shops are transforming the way we sell phones and accessories, they're very popular with customers. We've got 104 opened now. We'll have 200 opened by the end of the year. It's a very rapid growth of our mobile phone business.</p>
          <p>We also signed an important wholesale agreement with Cable &amp; Wireless enabling us to relaunch our broadband offer in 2010 with higher bandwidth speeds and lower prices. We're the only retail customer on that facility. So, I think we'll have very good broadband speeds in the market.</p>
          <p>In its 20th anniversary, Dunnhumby continued its rapid growth with a 28% increase in profits. Now only 15% of its revenues come from Tesco. Dunnhumby is itself a truly global business, serving retailers and manufacturers in 26 countries. Dunnhumby now touches the lives of over 350 million consumers through its client relationships.</p>
          <p>In the same way that we stuck to our strategy in other parts of the business, other parts of the steering wheel, we've also remained focused on our work on community and on the environment. In October, we committed ourselves to these three challenging long-term targets to become a zero carbon business by 2050, to reduce the carbon impact of the products in our supply chain by 30% by 2020, and to help our customers have their own footprints by 2020.</p>
          <p>As David mentioned, we're making good progress, meeting our emissions targets this year. We're actively supporting local communities, including through Community Champions in the UK and internationally.</p>
          <p>And of course, we're creating good jobs and careers in all of our markets, as we grow worldwide. We'll be creating 16,000 jobs this year, of which 9,000 will be in the UK, including those offered to the long-term unemployed through our regeneration partnerships. Our pay and benefits for staff remain industry-leading, and in the UK, we have 160,000 staff in our award-winning defined benefits pension scheme, by far the largest of its type in the UK.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, Tesco has a strong and flexible business model, and performs well at all points in the cycle. Our positions in high-growth, international markets and in non-food means that we're well geared into the global recovery.</p>
          <p>By sticking to our strategy and investing through the downtown, we're emerging from recession even stronger. We're delivering for all stakeholders an improving shopping trip for customers, good careers for staff, growth and innovation with our suppliers, support for local communities, leading on climate change, and of course we're delivering good returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>I believe that the outlook for higher returns is good. We have a strong UK business, growing well. Our international businesses offer significant upside from recovery in the short term and maturity of our investments in the longer term. Our balance sheet is strengthening and we're creating enduring value through our property development.</p>
          <p>Having improved return on capital employed from 10.2% in 2003 to 12.6% in 2006, we committed at that stage to increasing ROCE further to 14.6. Now, despite the impact of recession, we are reaffirming that target.</p>
          <p>With the prospect of an improving global economy and recent investments in acquisitions and space making a greater contribution going forward, returns will improve significantly starting this year.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>...for Q&amp;A, I think we've got some microphones. If you're going to ask question, raise your hand, and if you just say, kindly help us with your name and the company. I think we'll change -we'll start with Andrew Kasoulis this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Andrew Kasoulis, Credit Suisse. You've got a substantial increase in international space this year on effectively the same CapEx. Can you give us a bit of an idea as to how sustainable those two numbers are? I mean, how much, has there been excessive investment in recent years and how much would that maybe even out over future years? You're trying to get this balance between CapEx and space going forward.</p>
          <p>And just secondly, I will try and ask anyway, can you give us a time period for the return on capital target please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, it's a good step up in space year-on-year. The results showed a step-up in capital, we spent 3.1 billion last year, we're going to spend 3.6 billion in the coming year and the majority of that increase will go into international. And as you say, we're stepping up the level of square footage. We're getting a better bang for our buck, so this kind of 20% capital efficiency that we've talked about is coming through well.</p>
          <p>We talked about the Lifespace malls; so they come through as a joint-venture initiative, roughly funded 50:50 between ourselves and our joint venture partners. The majority of the space by the way comes through as a leasehold structure within China. So I think that's about 39 stores, Lifespace malls, 24 leasehold stores, something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think nine of the 24. So, the other, whatever that 13, 14, 15 comes through as leaseholds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that would broadly be it, Andrew. And then on your &#x2013; when are we going to get to 14.6, of course, we've never given a date for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's all going to &#x2013; I'm very sorry, I just grabbed the mic. How very rude of me, I do apologize.</p>
          <p>Yeah, just on the UK growth, you forecasted the long-term 3 to 4% like-for-like, and 3 to 4% from space, 6 to 8%, I think that adds up to. And what assumptions are you making for the market, because it just does strike me that that implies quite strong market share growth over the long-term from your competitors, and given the consolidation of the market, where is it going to come from?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on the U.S., can you just remind us, you've got 145 stores now, how far short are you from where you thought you'd be in your original plans? If we could get some idea of the scale issues? And just finally on the U.S., if you had to do it all again with the recession &#x2013; exiting the recession, what would you do different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the UK, I mean, we are growing share, we're growing share nicely at the moment. We have a good opening program, I think, you'll know, Fergus, the best in the industry, the reason it is the best in the industry is it's been very long-term. And with the difficult planning environments in the UK, you can't turn it on and turn it off.</p>
          <p>And of course, it's across all formats, Tesco is unique still in being strong from tiny stores to the largest stores and on the Internet. A lot of the space access is non-food as well. And of course, our Internet business is unlimited space growth by definition as we grow into that area.</p>
          <p>On the like-for-like side, I think that notwithstanding good competitors, I think that we've demonstrated in the past in the normal cycle 3 to 4% is possible. A lot depends on actually improving the offer, it's not just about what competitors do. If you make coming to a Tesco better, if their products are better, if it's worthwhile spending time and money there, you can get growth. And clearly, no business is immune from a real downturn, but we've come through that in fairly good order I'd say. And then in the normal cycle, I think 3 to 4% is realistic.</p>
          <p>I mean, clearly, we're coming into recovery now. It's not going to be a spectacular recovery in the UK. But remember our business does fine in slow recovery, because people are not off to buy their second home in Spain or getting &#x2013; packing in the third holiday or getting the BMW they always wanted. They're actually able to come shopping in Tesco and get good value there.</p>
          <p>On the U.S., well we &#x2013; if there had not been the economic collapse there, and &#x2013; I mean you'd have to go to central California, Nevada and Arizona to see the extent of the problems, we'd be growing much faster now. We planned to be opening about 4 or more a week by now, and we're opening between 1 and 2.</p>
          <p>We've plenty of capacity the &#x2013; so that will take us to about a couple of 100 before too long; we've got about 150 now. But the Southern depot could comfortably handle 400. So we've got plenty of capacity there. And then as you know, we've got a facility &#x2013; not a factory, but a distribution facility ready in Northern California, so we're not short of capacity.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't do anything different. I think that they're really good shops. They have become a reality, they're better than the idea. The reality is better than the idea. I've never seen such positive feedback, even aiming off for the effusiveness of American consumers. And it is strategically a gap in the market; you know small space is under-invested in the U.S. Small space is the fastest-growing format around the world. And slowly, but surely, the Americans are coming that way with high petrol prices, with changes in urban planning, with environmental issues and so on.</p>
          <p>I mean the trick was that in America the supply chains had big stores on the end of them, they don't have to &#x2013; you can have a very modern leading supply chain with small stores on the end of it, actually delivering more natural, better value food then they've had before. You've got to take &#x2013; it takes time, because if it was the same, people would get it much quicker, but it wouldn't make the difference because it's the same. If it's different, which it is, they don't get it immediately, it takes time for them to try it, add it to their repertoire, then begin to understand it, and then become converted fans. But that's happening, that's very, very good news. And there's plenty more growth to come.</p>
          <p>As we come out of recession, and that hasn't started yet in that part of the world, we'll be able to step up the rate of growth. And that's how we're judging it, really, is that the first signs we see of recovery we'll be increasing the rate of growth.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clive Black from Shore Capital. Couple of questions, first of all, you've obviously done well on net cash generation, but should we actually be expecting a little bit more this year in terms of a lower net debt figure than 7.5 million, bearing in mind what you said about further working capital work and property activity?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the property side you set, I think, 70% as an almost threshold that you wouldn't wish to go below from a freehold/leasehold mix some time ago; has that &#x2013; is that still there or has that changed? And in terms of just Fresh &amp; Easy, if I may, can you give us an indication how many stores are making a contribution at this stage &#x2013; positive contribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, shall I just do Fresh &amp; Easy, and then you can go on to the property issues? Yeah, there are plenty of stores in the turnover range to make a good contribution, the &#x2013; if you remember, I think the range we gave you is 12 to $20 a foot in the original thing. We've got plenty of stores actually over $20 a foot and plenty in the range of 12 to 20. But that's not particularly a focus for us at the moment, because once within that range we know we can make plenty of profits in terms of buying scale, deferring the overhead in the normal way. The basic cost components are all where they need to be in terms of labor expenses, energy costs, waste, and so on.</p>
          <p>The main thing is how big an opportunity do we have? We know we could run a nice chain of a few hundred stores, but we're trying to push to something that has a wide enough appeal to be thousands of stores. And so that's now &#x2013; our ability to read that has been affected by this downturn. And so, we'll get a much better read on it as the recovery comes. We know we've got a success, it's just is it a success in hundreds or thousands, that's the thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, net cash generation and net debt; well, uniquely I gave you a target and a date, which I don't think we've done before. So, to push me on a another target and another date is kind of pushing it in itself, Clive. So, I'm very happy with the progress that we've made. We might beat the target. There's still a lot of ground to cover, ForEx is very volatile, which as you know goes against our net debt. So, good progress so far. Probably update you at the interims in terms of how we did.</p>
          <p>Property and 70% freehold, yeah that is our threshold. We like to keep a large proportion of our freehold assets and to own those and control them. And of course, we're tipping in &#xA3;3.5 billion plus into new freehold investments each year, so that balance will obviously balance itself through the coming years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Chris Hogbin from Sanford Bernstein. Two questions if I can. Firstly, with Dunnhumby now that Tesco's only 15% of their revenue. What's the logic for your continued ownership of the business and would you consider selling it or IPOing the business?</p>
          <p>And then secondly given the importance of scale that you've highlighted in in the international businesses, under what conditions would you consider acquisitions this year, like the Korean acquisitions we saw two years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to take that Terry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Dunnhumby is a very core skill to our business. It's right at the nexus between customers and the retail brand, which is actually where the money is going to be made in international retailing. Commodity selling of flour, and rice and oil against the local market is not going to make you a lot of money. It's actually having insight into consumers' lives and knowing how to respond to that in the most value creating way, which is how you're going to make money. So it's absolutely core to our business. It's a great advantage for Tesco and it's actually also the kind of valuable asset that a good, innovative, risk-taking business like Tesco should produce.</p>
          <p>I don't think that you should view a business like Tesco as being, one sort of pyramid single activity, grinding it out. I think that if you work in Tesco, you're given plenty of responsibility, you're allowed to take sensible risk as long it's in the interest of customers and you can build up businesses. So I don't see it as that exceptional too. What was the second part of your question, was on scale?</p>

          <p>Well it's kind of a two part question then. I mean, of course we run our slide rule over all potential acquisitions. We look at our competitors stores but at the moment we're very much focused on building our business organically in the 14 countries that we operate. And as Terry says, if we took our biggest country, which is Korea, and got it up to the multiple of the UK's market share, it's maturing but it's not mature. It's got many multiples of profit and sales to go after without, indeed, acquiring any other businesses. So summary, focus is on organic growth.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Hi, Geoff Ruddell from Morgan Stanley. A couple of questions, if I may. Firstly on the property evaluation that you've updated us on this morning, could you give us a number for how much of that in the UK and also the yield assumption on the UK element of that property? And secondly, I noticed in the appendices to the pack that you're not planning to open any more Homeplus stores in the UK next year, which is clearly quite a contrast to what Asda Living has announced this week. And I was just wondering, if you'd give us an update on why you're not planning to opening more Homeplus stores in the ...</p>

          <p>I'll come back to you on the yield calculation and the split between the UK and international. I think I know it but I don't want to say it in case I get it wrong.</p>

          <p>Actually our Homeplus stores are doing well and we'll be opening some more Homeplus stores, but we always said that we'd do ten and pause. And if you go in one, you can see that they're improving dynamically. They've been helped a lot by the catalogue shops in there, also actually, by adding service shops like phone shops and so on have done extremely well. So they take good money. They are profitable and we've got a basis for growth. I did notice Asda's announcement that they were going to open 150 stores, but I think they announced they were going to open 300 stores five years ago. So I couldn't work out whether that was an increase or a decrease.</p>

          <p>Hi. Two questions if I may. It's Caroline Gulliver from Execution Noble. Just to go back to Andrew's question on the step up in international new space. Is the 8.5 million a reasonable run-rate for the next couple of years or how much of that is actually sort of pent-up demand from the last couple of years that's going to lead to a blip, if you like, in the forthcoming year?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you just talk about Poland a little bit and the competitive dynamics there? I noticed that you're going to double the new space there next year. But I noticed you've only got 10 BPS improvement in market share where you had much stronger market share improvements in other Eastern European countries and just wondered if you could talk about your plans to increase market share there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think 8.5 million is a particular build-up in that way. I think that if you just look at the businesses as Laurie said, you've got successful market positions, you've got increasing cash flow. You're going to want to chase those markets because you're going to make them a lot bigger and lot more profitable. It will have to be accompanied by improving returns, but it will be, and then the thing becomes a natural exercise in terms of exploiting high returning opportunities.</p>
          <p>The business in Poland is great. I mean not all market share measures are exactly precise. I think that we are the best performing retailer in Poland. The only other challenger has been Biedronka. It's been helped by &#x2013; in recession small stores were doing particularly well. Actually, as it happens our own small store formats have been doing well and are doing better than Biedronka. But that's where they've placed most of their investments. They opened stores very rapidly so they've had a lot of new store contribution. So they will have been putting on some growth short-term and then it's Tesco. And I actually think Tesco has got a stronger spread in the market and has got deeper foundations. So I'm very excited about the Polish business. It's been hardy hearts, hasn't it, because too many retailers went into Poland at the start, but they are gradually getting out and you're left with a much smaller, more realistic group of retailers and Tesco is first amongst them.</p>

          <p>John Kershaw from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Hey, usual couple of questions. First of all, Terry, in the UK, your underlying margins for in-store pre-rent have been building nicely for a few years now. How much further do you think this can go in terms of business mix before that starts to hit a natural ceiling?</p>
          <p>And secondly, in terms of the U.S., just how long do you think you can keep going before you need to &#x2013; before you commit too much capital or some capital as part of the balance sheet because I think you must be approaching towards a billion now, so just a feel on that? And back in the UK on the Bank, just in terms of the insurance element of that, it sounds like you've topped out for now in terms of new customers. Clearly it depends on the new business written under Fortis, but how do you see the profitability in that area given the aggregator size development?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Laurie, do you want to pick up the one on the Bank, and then I'll-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, insurance business has been a bit tougher. I mean a big component of insurance profitability is investment income, what you earn off the premiums that are held for you. And that, because of lower rates in the market, has dissipated quite a bit. It's flat for us year-on-year, but that will rebuild nicely.</p>
          <p>In terms of customer numbers, our motor insurance and household insurance has held strong. Obviously, as we're transferring one &#x2013; from one business to another, we haven't been driving the business as hard as you might want us to, because we want to pull that business into our new infrastructure.</p>
          <p>I don't think it's topped out at all. We've got very low shares. We would be not really past the top five in any of those insurance groups. We've said all along that we've got a very good business for our Clubcard customers. We've got 16.5 million Clubcard customers, yet we'd only have about 2 million insurance customers, and not all of those are Clubcard customers, so plenty of growth potential.</p>
          <p>The aggregators, as you say, they're a new channel. We will compete along with everybody else that has to have the aggregators challenging pricing. So, it's an important part of the Bank's business, and we've got aggressive plans for its growth in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the U.S., we &#x2013; as I say, I'm delighted with what we have. We could certainly go and fill up the first depot, so 400 stores won't be a particular problem. You'll have an improving financial performance at the same time as that anyway. So I don't think you'll ever get to that point where you're carrying a lot of financial strain. As Laurie says, I think as far as the group's concerned, we're through the strain and from now on it starts to improve the overall picture.</p>
          <p>On the UK underlying margins, we look at margins over the course of the year. As you know, it will vary a little bit from quarter-to-quarter &#x2013; well, we don't show you on a quarter basis, but from half-to-half it varies a bit. Margins can go up in the UK. You need to have a very good productivity program. You need to have a very value-creating offer for the customer. And you need a reasonably &#x2013; a following wind, if you like, with the economy overall.</p>
          <p>We don't rely on dramatically improving margins, but there is scope for them to increase steadily, particularly if you include some of the more recent business areas that have still got plenty of more maturity to come from them.</p>

          <p>Hi, Andrew Porteous, Evolution Securities. First of all, I noticed your inc. VAT revenues in your statement they were &#x2013; weren't IFRIC 13 compliant. Does that apply to the like-for-like data in there as well? And if so, could you give us an idea of what the compliant data would have been for the second half and for the full-year?</p>
          <p>And second of all, on your medium-term targets of 3 to 4%, I was just wondering where you see these in the next 12 months. Clearly, current growth rates in the market are some way below this. And also, where do extensions fit into that 3 to 4%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to comment on IFRIC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let's first of all start what IFRIC 13 is; it's merely a presentational change. So, as you lap through, which we will lap  through even the impact of double-up and double Clubcard points by May of this year and August of next year, so I don't expect any questions on this at the interim.</p>
          <p>But having said that, a specific answer to your question, the full-year effect of IFRIC 13 on sales would be about 0.4%. And the half-year effect is very similar to the amount that we said in the Christmas trading statement; I think we said 0.8%, but for the second half I think it's about 0.7%. Very little impact, as you can see, on profits. So it is just purely presentational, taking it out the marketing line and putting it into the sales as a discount line.</p>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; who's going to ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on growth rates, I think that you're going to build into the 3 to 4% range because you're coming out of recession, so it's not going to be a single overnight thing.</p>
          <p>On extensions, extensions for Tesco and I think most others have always been included in like-for-like; it happens, it's not that material to the overall contribution, particularly if you take the disruption period that's usually involved in an extension that affects it before.</p>
          <p>I do see this first quarter &#x2013; if you look at the final quarter of the year we've just reported, I think our like-for-like was around 3%, something like that. It's fairly solid like-for-like. If you look within that we had a good Christmas, but I think you've still got to take the two together, people spent up for Christmas. You then had the VAT change so that will probably have moved a bit of trade around. Then you had stinking weather; really, really difficult weather. So I think you've got to take the 12 weeks overall and I think 3% is about where it is, which is perfectly good.</p>
          <p>Coming into this year, obviously you'll get the update for the first quarter. You've got an unusual spike in inflation. If you remember food-based inflation started to rise rapidly in 2007, it then went up for most of 2008 and then started to come down a bit. But there was actually a spike right at the tail end. So when you lap that into 2009 you had &#x2013; you began with high inflation carrying on. It then came down in the second half of &#x2013; calendar I'm talking about now, second half of 2009 to around about 3%, a bit lower than that at times I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But then there was this spike at the back end, so that at the end of 2008 beginning of 2009 the inflation was actually 9%. And then that fell away very rapidly to 0% by about week 16/17, something of that sort. And so we're up against that spike, so that will depress things for a few weeks, but we're coming through it now as it happens.</p>
          <p>And then you'll get to a situation where you've actually got a benign outlook in terms of slight inflation. And actually, interestingly, beneath that, you've actually got inflation for the first time on non-food as well, because you've finally got coming together, weak pound, shipping rates are beginning to fill up again and Chinese labor's beginning to get employed again and get &#x2013; labor rates are going up.</p>
          <p>So I think the first quarter is a bit unusual in the sense of it's going through that spike.</p>
          <p>You've then also got a bit of sentiment around the election, unless the promising giveaways, elections do cause a bit of a distraction. It'll be clearer when you come to the other side of the election. And I think even though whoever's in power there'll be some kind of reining in of finances. I don't think that will actually offset the strong underlying recovery, it's quite firm with the consumer that there is a recovery underway and that will give us enough through the year.</p>
