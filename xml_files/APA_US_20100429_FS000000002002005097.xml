        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for the Apache Corporation first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. On today's call we'll have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will lead off, followed by John Crum, our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President &#x2013; North America; Rod Eichler, our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President &#x2013; International; and Roger Plank, our President.</p>
          <p>We've again prepared a detailed supplemental data package for your use, which also includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred. This data package can be found on our website at www.ApacheCorp.com/financialdata.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts: operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations front and mention two highlights.</p>
          <p>Our Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil development projects in Australia have now achieved maximum production, ahead of what we forecasted for the year. This is an important step forward in the delivery of a large and visible pipeline of organic growth projects in an international region. And in North America, we ramped up the development of two large resource plays, the Horn River and the Granite Wash. We're going to drill over 60 gross wells this year in these two plays and expect to exit the year with net production of around 175 million a day.</p>
          <p>The Granite Wash is a liquids-rich relative to most other large resource plays in North America, which gives big impact on the economics. It's also differentiated by the acreage position we hold because it is primarily held by production. In the Horn River, the quality of the rock and the development efficiency certainly differentiates it. We can achieve those through large drilling pads, continuous ground acreage.</p>
          <p>In addition as we progress our Kitimat LNG project, our goal is to give Horn River access to international LNG markets. These are just a couple of the highlights on the operations side, and Rod and John will go over more of them as we go. Which is really &#x2013; shows the organic growth engine is stronger than it's ever been.</p>
          <p>Going into 2010, we truly expected first quarter to be slow relative to the sequencing of the quarters, and for production growth to accelerate from there and that's exactly what you see reflected in our numbers. Production ramped up throughout the quarter with March actual production coming in at 608,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day compared to our average for the quarter of 585,000 barrels a day. And we consider our 5 to 10% organic growth production outlook remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the financial front, the highlight really is that we had the best quarter since 2008, both in terms of earnings and cash flow. It's been driven by our portfolio balance and I can't say enough how important it is for our portfolio to be balanced between oil and gas, and then within gas to have a good mix of both North American and international gas. Not only is it important, but frankly at our size it's pretty much impossible to replicate for companies that did not make that balance growth choices that we've made over the last several years in getting to this position.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, on the strategic front, we have taken three very important steps so far in 2010. The merger with Mariner Energy, which we announced after the quarter closed, will give Apache a new growth platform in the deepwater. Mariner gives us critical mass, experience and the opportunity set we want in this area, and Apache's resources will enhance the value creation potential of this platform.</p>
          <p>In addition, Mariner gives us a rich opportunity inventory in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and also in the Permian basin. The asset fit is excellent, the cultural fit is outstanding, and we're working diligently with Mariner's team to progress the merger and are very much looking forward to welcoming them officially on board  as Apache.</p>
          <p>Separately, the Devon offshore property transaction gives us yet another high quality inventory set in a core region, with very attractive returns. And frankly I can't say that we know of anyone that can generate the reserves and value better than we can.</p>
          <p>The third strategic development that took place during the quarter is that Apache became operator at the Kitimat LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada. We discussed that opportunity with you on our earnings call in February, but I'd note just like deepwater, LNG is a big step forward for Apache. It enables us to monetize very large gas resources at LNG prices, which are generally linked to crude oil prices, and gives us a large stable production and cash flow profile to complement our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Instead of following the pack, we certainly picked our own timing and direction in taking each of these steps. Looking back, I can reminisce to going into Egypt in 1995, going into the North Sea in 2003, and going into Australia in 1993. All were important steps for us and all of them were very much against the sector consensus at the time, but which have created great value for our shareholders. And we're confident that the steps that we've taken in the first quarter will be looked back on in the same vein and will provide meaningful long-term value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Crum, who will discuss North America.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third party host platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gulf Coast and Central regions were the primary factors. The ramp up of drilling operations started in the first quarter after very low activity level in 2009 will arrest that drop for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The Gulf Coast region production for the first quarter averaged just under 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Production gains of almost 6,000 barrels equivalent were experienced from additional hurricane repairs and resumption of service of the Sea Robin Pipeline. However, these gains were offset by natural declines and again the third party host platform and pipeline issues during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The first quarter drilling program in the Gulf Coast has given us a nice start for 2010. We drilled 19 gross wells, of which 14 were successful. Four of those successful wells were exploratory and are now in evaluation and developmental planning stages. Two LLOG-operated Mississippi Canyon 199 wells successfully tested two adjacent fault blocks at our Mandy prospect, and penetrated net oil pays of 161 feet and 109 feet respectively at approximately 6,500 foot TVD.</p>
          <p>We are now evaluating subsea development plans for these wells and would expect production by mid 2011, with initial rates of around 6,000 barrels per day from each well. Apache has working interest of 15% in this field and Mariner Energy has 35% working interest in the discovery.</p>
          <p>In addition, we were successful with two tests of the N6 sand at our Boomerang prospect at Main Pass 308 where we identified 12 feet and 30 feet of net oil pay in the N6 sand at our number one and number one sidetrack wells respectively. Regionally the N6 well is quite prolific with recoveries in the range of 1 million barrels of oil from 10 foot pay sections.</p>
          <p>We are currently mobilizing a rig to drill an appraisal well in Main pass 309 to further delineate the reservoir and confirm our platform location for development plans. Initial rates are expected to be around 800 barrels per day per well, with the support of six well development. First production would be expected in the first half of 2011. Apache operates this field with 100% working interest.</p>
          <p>Other successful drilling of two wells at Grand Isle 41 and South Pass 75, as well as a new well at High Island 129 and three new wells &#x2013; new onshore producers will add additional production volumes for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In our Central region, production averaged 34,600 barrels equivalent per day, down 4% from the last quarter. Third party pipeline downtime and delays in completion of new wells were responsible for the decline. With the third party downtime issues resolved and our backlog of completions being worked off, we expect production to be up by more than 3,000 barrel equivalent in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As most of you know, horizontal drilling with multiple stage frac stimulations has really improved the potential of the type formations we typically target in the Central United States. Our Central region controls roughly 1 million gross acres, most of which is held by production. This has provided us with excellent platform from which we actively and efficiently explore. We've been testing various geologic targets across the region to identify the most prospective acreage for horizontal application.</p>
          <p>Since late last year the region has tested eight separate horizontal pay intervals within 20 wells over hundreds of square miles. More than a dozen more horizontal formation tests are planned this year. As plans are verified, leasing efforts have commenced. In the past year 36,000 new gross acres have been leased, with 16,000 of those acres being leased in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The Central region spud 23 wells in the first quarter, of which 13 were horizontal. The region's most active program continues to be the Granite Wash in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. You are all aware that the Granite Wash is a series of liquids-rich stacked gas pay sands which underlay some 4,000 square miles of the Anadarko basin. We've been active in the play for decades, but have only recently ramped up multi-frac operations.</p>
          <p>We have now drilled eight horizontal wells, five of which have been completed. Those wells have produced four Bcf of gas and 150,000 barrels of oil. The remaining three are now being completed. Meanwhile we are expanding the drilling campaign and are currently operating six horizontal Granite Wash rigs. A seventh horizontal rig will be added, as well as an additional vertical rig in May. At the same time, we have another three rigs targeting other horizontal objectives around the region.</p>
          <p>We are quite enthused about the results of our Cherokee formation activity in Western Oklahoma. For the past several years Apache has been successful in acquiring acreage and drilling shallow Cherokee formation wells, primarily in Harper County, Oklahoma, one of the oldest areas of the Anadarko basin. We drilled over 20 vertical oil wells with initial rates typically averaging 100 barrels per day. On those results, we have recently leased more than 11,000 acres and now control over 60,000 acres in the play.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2010 we completed our first horizontal test in this play. The Rose Hill 429H tested 150 barrels of oil per day from a 38 foot, 100 foot lateral and it's held up quite nicely, still producing 120 barrels per day after two months. Our second test, the Bentley 5-5H, tested just over 700 barrels per day from a 4,400 foot lateral, and is still producing 530 barrels per day after six weeks. The region has identified more than 30 additional horizontal locations in this play and we expect to maintain at least one horizontal drilling rig in the play for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>In East Texas, Apache has been active with two horizontal drilling rigs targeting the Bossier sands since late last year. The region has completed three horizontal tests to date: the Polk 6H &#x2013; that was this year, the Polk 6H tested for 9.2 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Moody 27H tested for 9.4 million cubic feet of gas per day, and while the Polk 9H tested for a very strong rate of 15.5 million cubic feet of gas per day.</p>
          <p>The Moody 2-88H is currently testing after frac and early indications are that it will be the strongest well to date. As of this morning it was already flowing at more than 15 million cubic feet of gas per day, while still recovering frac water at more than 2,000 barrels per day. We own 100% of the Moody lease and 77% of the Polk lease.</p>
          <p>Our new Permian region is operating independently after the year end spin-out from our Central region. We've been actively recruiting staff from both inside and outside Apache and expect to be fully operational from our newly leased office space in Midland by early July. Permian production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent, within 1% of the prior quarter. We expect production to be up slightly for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The Permian region drilling program got off to a fast start as well. We are currently operating five rigs, three in New Mexico and two in Texas. During the first quarter the region drilled 51 wells targeting oil reservoirs in 11 different fields across the Permian basin. All 51 wells are either completed and on production or will be completed in the near future.</p>
          <p>As in the Central region, application of horizontal well technology is having a significant impact on our plans. Importantly, we drilled two successful horizontal tests in old water flood units. The Shafter Lake 606H well was drilled and completed in the San Andres with a six stage frac stimulation, and came on production at an initial rate of nearly 500 barrels of oil per day. The North McElroy 4025H was drilled and completed in the Grayburg with eight stage fracture stimulation and tested approximately 200 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Both wells' initial rates and post-drill reserve estimates were higher than pre-drill estimates. Based on this success, follow-up locations are planned in both fields where we will test longer laterals and more fracture stimulation stages.</p>
          <p>We're very optimistic about the potential for horizontal drilling throughout the Permian basin, with additional wells planned at TXL South and Dean Units in West Texas as well as the Monument area of Southeast New Mexico. We expect to keep at least one horizontal rig working the remainder of the year. We also expect to add two additional drilling rigs by the end of the second quarter to expand our traditional low risk, bread and butter vertical oil well programs.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter the region also sanctioned the Roberts Unit CO2-enhanced recovery expansion and just signed an agreement with Kinder Morgan for the purchase of 38 Bcf of CO2 over ten years. CO2-enhanced recovery will be an important piece of the Permian basin &#x2013; Permian region's business for a long time given our extensive holdings in the basin. We have already identified 26 of our fields with CO2-enhanced recovery potential.</p>
          <p>In Canada, Canadian production averaged 68,000 barrels equivalent a day, down 5% from the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, extreme weather early in the year caused extensive freeze-ups across the region and was the primary reason for the drop. We are bringing on production from our winter drilling program and completion operations which are expected to lead to a 6% increase for the second quarter. The majority of the impact of the Horn River activity will not become evident until the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Development drilling in our conventional business units totaled 42 wells resulting in 38 producers during the first quarter, with successful gas completions at Zama, Kabob and Nevis. Oil drilling activity was focused on House Mountain, where six new horizontal wells are producing over 1,100 barrels per day. Also an 18 well winter program in our Provost area has delivered good results, including one well that tested over 500 barrels of oil a day at our proposed Battle River EOR project area.</p>
          <p>Our Horn River activity continues to dominate Canadian operations. Seven horizontal wells were drilled in the Two Island Lake development area during the quarter, with four on the Apache-operated 52-L pad and three on the EnCana-operated 63-K pad. In addition, Apache drilled three horizontal wells in our Dilly area to hold expiring acreage.</p>
          <p>Drilling efficiencies and resulting cost performances continued to improve with average drill times now at 19 days from spud to rig release, and average drill costs at 3.7 million per well for a 7,200 foot horizontal section. Completion operations on the 16 well 70-K pad which was drilled in 2009 commenced in January. We have just finished the mammoth frac stimulation project associated with these wells this week.</p>
          <p>Over the past three and a half months we have completed 274 frac stimulations on those 16 wells, pumping more than 5 million barrels of water and in excess of 100 million pounds of sand. The project also involved conducting a huge microseismic acquisition program with 82 individual frac stages and over 19,000 individual microseismic events mapped. This data will be used to optimize frac design, frac spacing and inter-well spacing on our future pads.</p>
          <p>The first of 16 70-K wells came onstream on March 29 to start recovering frac load water, and we are now producing around 25 million a day from that pad. But ramp-up has been severely limited due to the space restrictions while the frac spread remained on location. We are presently demobilizing the frac equipment and would expect to have all 16 wells on production by early July.</p>
          <p>Construction of the Debolt water treatment facility ramped up in the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early May. While it was not available for our 70-K pad program, utilization of this water supply will ultimately reduce the volumes of fresh water used for frac stimulation purposes and the associated cost for water transportation.</p>
          <p>Steve mentioned the Kitimat operation. During the first quarter we have now received FEED proposals from four parties, and we're under technical evaluation. We would expect to award FEED sometime in the next month and a half, two months.</p>
          <p>And that's all I had. With that, I'll turn it over to Rod Eichler.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. During the first quarter production from Apache's international operations was 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 2% increase over fourth quarter 2009. The production increase can be attributed to drilling successes in Egypt and successful commissioning of oil developments in Australia.</p>
          <p>In Egypt, net production was 151,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 5% from fourth quarter due to higher oil prices and lower recoverable costs, resulting in lower cost recovery barrels. By contrast, gross BOE per day increased 3,000 barrels a day or 1% from 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p>
          <p>Exploration activity continued strong during the quarter with operations being conducted on five 3D seismic surveys representing nearly 3,000 square kilometers of coverage. Drilling activity continued during the quarter with a total of 48 wells reaching total depth including 10 exploration wells. The region exited the quarter with 20 active drilling rigs operating and the success rate for Apache-operated exploration wells was 67%.</p>
          <p>Exploration and appraisal drilling largely focused in our expanding Faghur basin oil play, where four wells tested at a combined rate of 12,000 barrels of oil per day and 10 million cubic feet of gas per day from AEB and Safa reservoirs. 18 wells remain to be drilled in the basin this year, including nine exploration wells.</p>
          <p>Development of the Phiops field at the east end of the Faghur basin continued with the Phiops 8 well, which encountered 124 net feet of pay and multiple AEB sands. The initial completion of the AEB 3E sand tested at 4,500 barrels of oil per day and no water. Construction is nearing completion on the West Kalabsha facilities project which will increase the export capacity of our Faghur basin facilities from the current 11,000 barrels of oil per day to 20,000 barrels by mid year. Expansion of the Malayha crude oil pipeline and completion of a chain of infrastructure upgrades will further boost Apache's Faghur basin production capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day, which we should be able to fill up by year end.</p>
          <p>Notable drilling results were also achieved in the Jade Field discovered by Apache in 2007 on an attruant development lease. The Jade 8 well was completed in AEB 3G sand, put on production this 10th of March, and is currently flowing to the Salam gas plant at a rate of 3,100 condensate per day and 32 million cubit feet of gas per day. The Jade 10 well was drilled in the crested Jade structure and tested 3,100 barrels of oil per day with no water from the AEB 3E.</p>
          <p>Additional field wells are planned in 2010 to accelerate this oil development. To date the Jade Field has produced 47 Bcf and 4.5 million barrels of oil and condensate, and presently produced 107 million cubic feet of gas per day and 12,000 barrels of oil and condensate per day. Apache has 100% contractor interest in all the previously referenced wells.</p>
          <p>In Australia, net production was 61,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 40% increase over fourth quarter and double the rate for first quarter of 2009. Gas production increased by 1% from fourth quarter while oil production nearly tripled. The substantial increase in net oil production from 9,900 barrels of oil per day to 27,000 barrels per day was due to the successful commissioning of the Van Gogh and Pyrenees development projects. The region also benefited from the absence of cyclones in the first quarter compared to three cyclone and storm production interruptions in the same period of 2009.</p>
          <p>At the Van Gogh oil project, which Apache operates with 52.5% working interest, the Ningaloo Vision FPSO arrived on location, and following a five week commissioning period, the field commenced production on February 13. Well performance has been excellent with all wells testing above 10,000 barrels of oil per day on cleanup. Production peaked at 72,200 barrels of oil per day gross in March, and averaged 66,000 barrels of oil per day gross or 34,700 barrels a day net in the last week of the quarter. To date the field has produced 3.4 million barrels of oil or 1.8 million barrels net.</p>
          <p>The nearby BHP Billiton-operated Pyrenees FPSO development, in which Apache has a 28.6 working interest, commenced production February 24. Production ramped up quickly to 90,000 barrels a day gross from the seven WA42L permit wells, with six wells remaining to be completed on the adjacent WA43L permit in which Apache has a 31.5% working interest.</p>
          <p>To date the Pyrenees Field has produced 4.4 million barrels of oil gross and 1.3 million barrels net to Apache. These high initial rates for both fields are essentially flush production as we commission the facilities and we expect the region's net oil production to average 40 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day for the year.</p>
          <p>Work is progressing at our Devil Creek Reindeer development project in which Apache is the operator with a 55% working interest. Gas plant bulk earth works were essentially completed in the first quarter and civil works commenced. The first shipment of the Thailand fabricated gas plant pipe rack modules arrived on site and installation is in progress. The onshore pipeline from the beach crossing to the gas plant and the horizontal directional drilling operation under the beach were started. Fabrication of the Reindeer wellhead platform deck is underway in China. The project is on schedule for first production in third quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>Also during the first quarter, four Apache-operated wells reached TD, yielding two trend exploration dry holes and two successful appraisal wells off Australia's Northwestern shelf. The Julimar Southwest 1 and Southwest 2, in which Apache has a 65% working interest, were drilled from a single surface location to confirm productivity at the Mungaroo formation in the southern part of the Julimar fourth block. Both wells are part of the Julimar Brunello development component of the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, production averaged 58,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 2% over fourth quarter. 3,200 barrels of oil per day average for the quarter was added for new drilling, but we lost 1,800 barrels a day from mechanical failures, unplanned events and normal declines. At the end of the quarter seven development wells and five pilot holes were drilled or completed. Notably, the Forties Alpha 15A53W and the Forties Charlie 24C44Y development wells tested 3,000 and 3,100 barrels of oil per day respectively.</p>
          <p>The field development plan for the Mall Field, a new-field eocene oil discovery made by Apache in fourth quarter, has been approved by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. First oil is expected late in the second quarter of 2010. The field has qualified as a small field development, yielding up to 75 million pounds sterling of supplemental tax breaks as well as exemption from the petroleum revenue tax.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, net production was 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 8% from the fourth quarter. Normal decline as well as mechanical and other related downtime at Neuqu&#xE9;n fields pushed oil production down, while gas production suffered from lower than normal residential seasonal demand and lower demand by power generation customers for increased hydroelectric power capability &#x2013; availability, all resulting in increased gas reinjection and shutting gas wells throughout the first quarter. In total, we reinjected close to 4 million cubic feet of gas per day net more in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>The region's drilling program however was very successful in the first quarter with 10 wells drilled with no dry holes, adding net reserves of 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent. In the shallow drilling program in the Neuqu&#xE9;n basin, three successful wells were drilled at a gross production of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas per day and 335 barrels of oil per day from Centenario and Cuyo reservoirs. All three wells were drilled to a depth of only 4,000 feet. An additional 16 wells are planned for this year.</p>
          <p>Also in the Neuqu&#xE9;n basin, four successful wells were drilled as part of the Gas Plus program. Three wells in the EFO field have been completed in the Lajas at a depth of 11,500 feet and are in production at a combined rate of 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day and 180 barrels of condensate per day after multi-zone fracture stimulated completions.</p>
          <p>A fourth well, the EFO 109, encountered 328 feet of net pay in the Lajas, and is being completed and fracture-stimulated in six zones. The well is currently cleaning up after frac of the first three zones at a rate of 3.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. Based on the quality of pay encountered and results of the first three zones, the EFO 109 is expected to produce over 5 million feet of gas per day and 125 barrels of condensate per day.</p>
          <p>Eight additional wells are planned in EFO field to develop gas volumes for the Gas Plus contract that is currently being negotiated to provide 50 million cubic feet of gas per day at a price of $5 per million Btu on January 1, 2011. 10 additional wells in the AC and Guanaco fields will also be drilled this year to support the Gas Plus program. Apache operates the referenced Neuqu&#xE9;n basin wells and fields with 100% working interest.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter, setting the stage for what has the makings to be a truly exceptional year.</p>
          <p>Earnings of $705 million or $2.08 per share were 21% higher than the prior quarter and our highest since third quarter of '08. Adjusted for the impact of FX on our deferred tax balances, earnings totaled $712 million or $2.10 a share. Cash flow from operations crossed $1.5 billion also for the first time since third quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>Apache's substantial oil and liquids production base was the primary driver behind our results. Oil and liquids represented half of our equivalent production, but generated nearly three-quarters of revenue, and were principally responsible for our revenue rising $118 million sequentially to $2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Long before the current industry stampede to gain oil exposure, Apache took deliberate steps to achieve a balanced production mix. As a result, we're already benefiting from the current 20 to 1 multiple in the price of oil versus gas, and we are ramping up activity on the oil side of our portfolio. In the first quarter for example, Van Gogh and Pyrenees enabled Apache's oil production to rise 3% sequentially, nearly offsetting a 4% temporary decline in gas production. I would note that absent the impact that higher prices had on price-sensitive volume in Egypt and to a lesser extent Canada, production volumes would have been up slightly and pretty much spot on our first quarter plan.</p>
          <p>A few quick comments on costs. Cash costs, excluding taxes other than income, came in at $11.89 per barrel of oil equivalent, impacted by slightly lower production. Rising future production should drive us toward our goal to match 2009's average of $11.25 per BOE.</p>
          <p>You may be wondering about the potential impact of our recently announced transactions on 2010. Because so much depends on exactly when the transactions close, the precise impact is difficult to measure, but here are some broad indicators. Absent the exercise of preferential purchase rates which cover some 7,500 barrels equivalent per day, Apache is picking up 19,000 barrels equivalent from Devon and another 63,000 with Mariner. The combined 82,000 equivalent barrels per day represent 14% of Apache's first quarter worldwide production.</p>
          <p>With respect to the potential 2010 impact, assuming Devon closes in early June and Mariner late in the third quarter, 2010 average volumes should right around 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or 4 to 5% from these transactions alone. Now this is over and above our earlier production growth target of 5 to 10% growth pre-acquisitions.</p>
          <p>I would note that for the last couple of years, Apache chose to build cash rather than pursue transactions of size in what was generally considered a frothy market. That cash was in effect pent-up growth potential that is now being put to work and will benefit all key per share metrics over the next several years. While we potentially pick up 14% more production, share count rises just 5%, resulting in accretion to per share earnings, cash flow, production, and reserves in the first full year of ownership. The bottom line is our outlook for growth is excellent.</p>
          <p>I would also note that in our two recent deals, while 60% of the combined production is gas, approximately 60% of the revenue is generated from oil and liquids. There is also a deep inventory of future development projects as well as exploration prospects that are oil.</p>
          <p>One final note on our balance sheet, while the combined transactions total $5 billion, our financial flexibility remains intact. Approximately $2 billion of consideration is equity and we will also tap a significant portion of our $2.1 billion of cash balances to close these deals. By year end, net cap should be below 25% and cash balances above $1 billion, leaving us in excellent position to continue to carry out Apache's growth strategy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roger. I'd like to sum up what I think are the three main messages from all the information that we shared with you on this call. First, we had a very good quarter operationally. You heard mention a few times Van Gogh and Pyrenees have ramped up. And organic growth engine as strong as ever and our organic growth production expectations for the year remain at 5 to 10%.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we had a very good quarter from a financial perspective, with the highest earnings and cash flow since 2008. We achieved this in spite of the weak environment to &#x2013; price environment from North American gas and it's because of our portfolio, which is really a central part of our strategy and a key differentiating factor from most of our peers.</p>
          <p>And third, we certainly took very important strategic steps during the quarter that further our mission to deliver consistent, profitable long-term growth for our shareholders. We picked our own timing and direction, and we're very excited about the growth and value creation potential by the Mariner merger, the Devon offshore acquisition, and our Kitimat LNG project.</p>
          <p>And with that, we're ready to take your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This will be quick. On the Horn River, you mentioned some metrics, drilled to release &#x2013; rig release, average cost per well, late to final. I didn't hear fracturing stages or EURs. But if you said it I'll look in the transcript, but I didn't hear it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I probably didn't give you the math on it. We did 274 fracs on 16 wells, so that comes out to just over 17 fracs per well. We did as many as 22 stages on individual wells. And the length of the horizontals that we're typically targeting now are somewhere in the range of 2,200 meters or 7,200 feet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, which I had. And anything on EUR as you see it? Is it most recently in decline rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a little early to tell anything about the decline rates here because we're just still unloading water. We couldn't really bring these things on. We're flowing through test separator equipment on location. We've got &#x2013; we're still running with a number that we believe we're going to be able to drain in excess of 10 Bcf per well on all of these.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so no change there. Okay, thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our second question today comes from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, just a quick follow-up on the Horn River here. I think you guys gave a well cost there but I don't think I heard it right. What is your average well cost up there now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we just gave you the drilling cost, Leo. The drilling cost, we're now at 3.7 million per well but that's on a considerably extended lateral length, too. You've heard me talk in the past about spending $10 million per well. We averaged around 11 million per well in this program. We were not able to get our new water plant on production in time to do these wells and that's what we believe is adding another million to our total cost. The real key here and I've mentioned it a number of times to people here, is we continue to add stages as we go forward and of course that's using up some of our ability to reduce the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, definitely makes sense. You talked about experimenting with the horizontals in the Permian basin here. Just trying to get a sense of how long you guys have been doing that and how much of your acreage do you think is prospective, and what types of improvements are you seeing in economics versus vertical drilling from these wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say we're really just getting started in the Permian basin. There are a number of players who have been some doing horizontal drilling certainly in Southeast New Mexico and in Far West Texas for the past year, year and a half. And we're really just getting started.</p>
          <p>These two wells I talked about were especially important because we're drilling these in old water flood units so to get those results in those kind of reservoirs is pretty impressive. We would have expected to have so much water coming back in a typical well there that it would create some real problems for us. But that's going to lead us to try a lot of different things across the basin over the rest of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I mean any sort of you know, kind of estimate as opposed to how much of a benefit you're seeing here? Do you think you're getting two or three times bang for the buck versus vertical in some of these fields or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, a little early on. I've only got two of them completed, but we would be getting more than twice as much from these wells if our estimates hold up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You guys also talked a little bit about East Texas doing some Bossier wells. It's been a hot topic in the industry lately. Just curious as to how much acreage you have you think is prospective out there for the Bossier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have a fairly modest position in East Texas, but we're continuing to add in areas that we're comfortable with. So it's &#x2013; again that's not our hottest area, but we're getting pretty worked up about it because we've had some great results out of our recent programs there on Moody and Polk.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just jumping over to the Granite Wash, it sounds like you had five completions. You talked about cums with all five wells. Any kind of sense of kind of what these average rates are on these wells? I'm not exactly sure when you brought them online.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll have to get you average rates, but I would say we're averaging somewhere around 10 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to see if you could touch a little bit more on cost inflation or lack of it as you go through your major areas both maybe on the shorter-term side in terms of some of the onshore drilling and completion activities? And also anything you're seeing on the steel pricing fronts when you think about the cost of LNG expansions in Australia and in Canada?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let John talk about North America and then I might talk a little bit about overall what we're seeing on cost. I would start off from a generalization. I think it's &#x2013; personally I think it's premature to extrapolate the cost increases that we've seen in the first quarter throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Winter is difficult for us in Canada and unfortunately it was difficult for us in the Central region because we've had one of the more severe freezes we've had through that part of our portfolio in the first quarter. So a lot of cost with respect to activities to get out there and start production again is part of those costs.</p>
          <p>And the other thing is, to be real honest with you, our production was down a little bit and one of the major culprits was because we are in a GIC and production sharing agreement in Egypt. And when &#x2013; the good side of it is oil prices go up, the down side of it is is that we see less production, which costs us about 5,000 barrels per day in Egypt. Gross operated was actually up.</p>
          <p>But overall, I don't think that cost side of it is going to get out of line. On the steel prices, that's certainly going to have an impact. I'm sure everyone's aware that steel prices are going up and we'll just have to wait and see, and see what the impact it is on those projects. John, do you have...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I &#x2013; yeah, I'd add on that steel cost, I guess I'd like to think there's a positive side to that that probably indicates increased demand. So hopefully we can get some strength in price to support some of that activity. But obviously that's something we'll have to watch pretty closely because it has a big impact on virtually all of our business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, great, thanks. And then secondly on the Granite Wash, apologies if you mentioned this earlier but as &#x2013; on a going forward basis for the next batch of wells you're drilling, what are your expectations for percent gas versus percent NGL versus percent condensate or oil?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely. But I &#x2013; or I guess just bigger picture, are you concentrating more on the Atoka or the dryer gas zones relative to some of the shallower other oil prone zones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of questions. First of all, can you give us any better feel for where your CapEx might go this year? Partly on the &#x2013; obviously the increased activity in Granite, but also when you take account of the additional assets you're going to have in the portfolio, any guidance would be appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, can you phrase that a different way maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, your capital expenditure guidance for the current year, how is that likely to change? How do you expect capital expenditure to trend over the balance of this year...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of our overall capital budget, we've indicated before Devon and before the Mariner acquisition or merger that we would be a little north of $6 billion. And I think what you're going to see is from an activity level in our acquisition forecast for Devon, we have about $100 million of capital plugged in. Now that number, depending on what kind of opportunities we see, may increase. But we're going to generate about $285 million worth of cash out of that acquisition.</p>
          <p>With respect to Mariner, they have &#x2013; we probably won't close that until September-ish or later. They have a capital budget of about $550 million internally, which they're going to spend. So from our standpoint, what you'll see out of Apache is not a significant increase from the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Now depending on what prices do, we allocate capital quarterly. So &#x2013; and we put a few more rigs to work starting in the second quarter than we've had running. So you might see a little upward movement on our overall capital program.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I could jump over to Egypt, can you give us some sense as to how you see your production playing out through the balance of this year? Obviously there's an awful lot of moving parts, but if oil prices stay pretty static where they are right now, how would the trajectory play out as we move through 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gross production, gross gas production will remain constant throughout the balance of the year because we are facilities limited with the existing gas processing facilities, although we intend to remedy that by 2012 with additional gas plant construction. On the oil side, I anticipate continued growth in oil quarter-on-quarter because we can't handle more oil. You saw we have a substantial increase forecast on gross oil beginning later this quarter from our West Kalabsha facilities project and by year end, we expect to double that again, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And from the price standpoint if we stay static, as to where we are today, I think our March numbers were about 90,000 barrels a day net. So if we go up on gross and you see exactly the same number you saw average for March, you're going to grow from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I guess where I was going with this, Steve, is that typically you guys tend to spend your cash flow I guess on a regional basis. I'm kind of thinking where that capital expenditure program in Egypt particularly can take you? If I heard you correctly, it sounded like you're going to drill about 19 exploration wells and that's about half what I thought you were going to drill this year. So if you could just give me some clarity around that? And I'll leave it there, thank you.</p>

          <p>Good, and I know these are crazy days for you. As far as what you commented before about the recent developments in the Gulf having no effect on the deal, would you think it'll affect timing in any way, shape or form?</p>

          <p>No, I wouldn't expect it to. I have no reason to believe it would or expect it to.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it changes nothing as far as commitment, desire, anything on your end, I assume?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. In the Permian basin your horizontal drilling is pretty interesting, but I was just interested in sort of the concept of approaching old water flood units with horizontal wells. Is the concept there to try to find some of the lower permeability sections that haven't been swept by verticals or is there something else to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the primary answer. A lot of those reservoirs out there, even under secondary have only recovered somewhere in the range of 35 to 40%. So you're exactly right, that's what we're trying to get done is access reserves that never been touched.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I might say &#x2013; John didn't quite &#x2013; we have a huge position with respect to especially water floods and a few CO2s because John just pointed out we have 26 different projects that we're looking at for CO2. So we &#x2013; it's really at the present time it's somewhat of a experiment, but if it works, you have a tremendous acreage position and a water flood potential to really ramp up production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very interesting. Switching gears to Australia, Pyrenees and Van Gogh, what are your current FPSO volume limitations? I'm interested in &#x2013; is it an oil volume, water, total fluids? And is there any upside if perhaps the water cut is lower than you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a specific limitation on both the vessels. The Pyrenees vessel is a larger FPSO than the one we have at Van Gogh. I think we're kind of capped out at about &#x2013; at the Van Gogh at about a little over 65,000 barrels of oil per day oil processing capability. And I forget the number over at Pyrenees. It's about 100,000 barrels a day I think is their oil capacity. And the second part of your question was what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was really just looking for it from the standpoint of total fluid handling versus oil volume, but I think you answered it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but I think you also had asked about water and to date we've seen no water in the first two months of production, which is really good news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. That's all the questions I have.</p>
