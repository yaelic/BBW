          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to The TJX Companies Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2009 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Wednesday, February 25, 2009.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, President and CEO for The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Before we begin, Sherry is going to make a few comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. The forward-looking statements we make today about the company's results and plans are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and the implementation of the company's plans to vary materially. These risks are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Form 10-K filed March 26, 2008.</p>
          <p>Further, these comments and the Q&amp;A that follows are copyrighted today by The TJX Companies. Any recording, retransmission, reproduction or other use of the same for profit or otherwise, without prior consent to TJX, is prohibited and a violation of United States copyright laws.</p>
          <p>Additionally, while we have approved the publishing of a transcript of this call by a third party, we take no responsibility for inaccuracies that may appear in that transcript.</p>
          <p>Please note that we have detailed of the impact of foreign exchange on our consolidated results and our international divisions in today's press release in the Investor Information section of our website, www.tjx.com.</p>
          <p>The comparable store sales numbers that we talked about today are in a constant currency basis, which is how we will be reporting these numbers going forward. We have also provided the last five years of comparable store sales on a constant currency basis on our website. Finally, to be consistent, all the comparable store sales results we are discussing today excludes the impact of the 53rd week. However, all of our other financial measures include the effect of the additional week.</p>
          <p>With respect to the non-GAAP measures we discuss today, reconciliations to GAAP measures are included in today's press release posted on our website, www.tjx.com, in the Investor Information section.</p>
          <p>Thanks. And now, I'll turn it back to Carol.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sherry. Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor, who, in addition to his role as Chief Administrative Officer, has resumed the CFO position; and Ernie Herrman.</p>
          <p>I've been looking forward to this call. We're going to change it up our approach a bit. I'm going to have Jeff take you through our full year and fourth quarter results first, and then I will share our outlook for 2009 and why we believe that TJX is positioned not only well, but better than most to weather these tough times. I am also going to tell you why we believe TJX will emerge from this recession in a stronger competitive position for the long term.</p>
          <p>So here is Jeff to recap the numbers for this past year and fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. What I'm going to do is begin with the consolidated results on continuing operations basis for the full year.</p>
          <p>So net sales for the 53-week fiscal year increased to $19 billion. That's 4% above last year's $18.3 billion. Our consolidated comp store sales were up 1% for the full year, which was below our plan and was up against last year's 2% increase.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, full year diluted EPS were $2.08 compared with $1.68 last year. We've included a chart in today's press release that details the effect of the computer intrusions and tax-related adjustments on EPS. And so you'll see that in the release. Excluding these items, adjusted full year diluted EPS were $2.01 compared with $1.93 last year.</p>
          <p>I should note that this year's results also include a $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week in our fiscal 2009 calendar and a net $0.05 per share negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. And these are also laid out in the release. Excuse me.</p>
          <p>Overall, pre-tax profit margins for the year on a reported basis were 7.6%. That's up 70 basis points from last year. When we exclude the intrusion-related reserve items for both years, the adjusted consolidated pre-tax profit margin for the year was 7.5%, and that's down 40 basis points from last year. And let me take you through the cause of change.</p>
          <p>To begin, gross profit margin was 30 basis points below last year. Merchandise margins were up over last year, but they were more than offset by buying and occupancy expense deleverage on the lower comp. And Carol will discuss in a moment how we're going to address this going forward.</p>
          <p>The 53rd week benefited gross profit margin by approximately 20 basis points. And as FYI for modeling purposes, the majority of the 53rd week benefit is in the gross profit line.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense was up 10 basis points versus last year primarily due to the deleveraging impact of the 1% comp, but partially offset by our ongoing cost reduction efforts. And then in terms of inventories, at the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis were down 5%. We exited the year with less winter clearance merchandise and entered New Year &#x2013; the New Year with far more liquidity and fewer dollars committed forward than at this time last year on a per store basis. This includes the warehouses, stores and merchandise on order. So we're extremely well positioned to weather inventories, which we believe will help us combat this challenging retail environment. So that's the year.</p>
          <p>Let me now recap fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, net sales were $5.4 billion, which was flat with last year. Our consolidated comp store sales decreased 2% versus a 2% increase last year.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, diluted EPS were $0.58 versus $0.67 last year. Excluding computer intrusion-related adjustment in both years, the adjusted earnings per share was $0.55 versus $0.65 last year and above our latest expectation. So we were about $0.04 above the consensus and the high end of our guidance. $0.02 were due to the stronger-than-expected operating margins. $0.01 was attributable to a favorable tax rate. And $0.01 was due to currency translation having less of a negative impact than we had originally anticipated.</p>
          <p>The 53rd week positively impacted EPS in the quarter by about $0.09, while the overall net negative impact to foreign exchange was $0.10 per share versus the $0.02 per share benefit that we received from foreign exchange last year. And if we exclude these factors, EPS was down 11% from the prior year on a comparable basis. And again, we laid that out in the press release as well.</p>
          <p>Consolidated pre-tax profit margin on a reported basis was 7.4%. Again, excluding the impact of the inventory-related hedges and the intrusion-related reserve reductions from both years, the adjusted pre-tax profit margin was 7.6% versus 8.4% last year, down 80 basis points. And again, I'll walk you through that 80 basis points.</p>
          <p>The gross profit margin declined 180 basis points on a reported basis. It's important to note that 100 of this was due to the negative impact of the inventory-related hedge adjustments. So excluding these adjustments, the gross profit margin was down 80 basis points, primarily due to buying and occupancy cost deleverage, which more than offset the benefit of the 53rd week, which parenthetically, we estimate to be 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>Merchandise margins were flat, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, against last year's very strong performance, as we brought our inventories down throughout the quarter to protect margins.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A costs were 10 basis points favorable versus last year, and SG&amp;A dollar spending was favorable to plan. Net interest expense was up 10 basis points versus prior year. And I should note that the higher interest expense versus last year was basically offset by the benefit of a lower tax rate year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call back to Carol for our outlook on 2009 and the long term. And at the end of the call, I'll recap our first quarter guidance. Carol?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. As I said earlier, I want to share with you the actions we have taken that I believe position this company well to weather this recession. I also want to outline how we've solidly positioned TJX for when times improve and to pursue our long-term strategy which has not changed.</p>
          <p>Our plans for 2009 assume a deep recession for most of the year, and we have taken a very conservative approach. The three main planks of our approach are planning comp sales very conservatively, running with historically lean inventories, and taking out at least $150 million from our cost structure.</p>
          <p>As to how we're handling guidance, with all of the volatility in the economic environment, we will be giving guidance for the first quarter. For the full year, we will provide guidance around a number of elements of our P&amp;L and balance sheet with some assumptions related to the model. Broadly speaking, what I can tell you is that we're setting our inventory and expense plans around the negative low single-digit comp, in line with our fourth quarter trend.</p>
          <p>In terms of sensitivities, however, while we're not assuming a flat comp, you should know that our FY 2010 model would deliver essentially flat EPS on a flat comp, and that's with $0.14 of currency-related pressure. Without the impact of currency, the model would deliver essentially flat EPS at a negative 2% comp, which underscores the expense of operating margin improvement embedded in the model. And Jeff will elaborate on all of this later on the call.</p>
          <p>Now let me share with you the details of our approach. First, as I just mentioned, we're planning comps very conservatively. We believe that this does not only protect our bottom-line, but also gives us upside opportunity and positions the company to be even stronger long term. We have many actions underway to drive sales, and to the extent that we exceed our conservative comp expectation, we will have greater flow through to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight just a few of our opportunities to drive sales in this environment. With much leaner inventories, we are buying even better and closer to need. This creates even more excitement in our stores and the intensity fresher than ever <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:33). Delivering great fashion and brand at extreme value is foremost. We see ourselves as a shopping destination for both moderate and high-end brands at low-end prices. Our traffic count is up which clearly tells us that we're well positioned for today and the long-term. We are aggressively shifting our purchase dollars to the right categories and initiatives in order to drive sales. As always, we continue to expand the initiatives that work and to test new ones and we have many underway.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on sales drivers, we will be bolder in our marketing and more aggressive in communicating our value message to the customers. While we will be reducing our marketing spend in 2009, we will be increasing our TV presence by four to five weeks and hitting 35% of our markets that have never seen our brand on TV before. I'm very excited about our marketing campaign for 2009. The second major strategy that we'll pursue in 2009 is to run with very lean inventories to drive faster turns and even stronger merchandise margins.</p>
          <p>We entered the year with more inventory liquidity and greater open to buy than I have ever seen or ever remember. For 2009, we are planning inventory levels down to low to mid single digits throughout the year on a per-store basis on top of decreases we had at the end of this past year. With conservative inventory management and strong buying opportunity, we believe merchandize margins will be up across all divisions with the exception of winter due to the higher cost of the U.S. dollar purchases which we'll discuss later in more detail. On a consolidated basis, we believe merchandize margins will be up for the year.</p>
          <p>Third, to protect our bottom line, we have taken a comprehensive series of actions to reduce cost. With these actions, we believe SG&amp;A dollars will be essentially flat for the year on a constant currency basis and down on a reported basis. These actions span all areas of the company and most were announced to our organization earlier this week. As I mentioned in total, these actions are worth approximately $150 million of savings to the bottom line of 2009.</p>
          <p>Some of the major actions we are taking encompass the following, we are driving further savings in non-merchandize procurement which we started this initiative a few years ago. We are implementing processes to more efficiently manage payroll in our stores and distribution centers. We are reducing our marketing spend as I mentioned but increasing penetration. We have frozen head count since September 2008 and are eliminating open position. Further, we are eliminating merit pay increases across the majority of the organization.</p>
          <p>We are also restructuring certain areas to improve productivity and efficiency and will be offering a voluntary retirement program. I should note that these reflect our actions at this time. We have identified potential opportunities in other areas including freight and more in non-merchandize procurement. We are maintaining our flexibility and keeping our options open to take additional actions should the environment worsen.</p>
          <p>In today's economic environment, our organization is more focused than ever on executing even better and even smarter, understanding that this is what will drive our success in the short and the long-term. I'm confident that strong execution today will help us be an ever bigger player in what will be a smaller retail landscape. Our long-term vision of the company as a global off price value retailer has not changed, while the execution of our vision has shifted to accommodate the current retail environment. I am confident that the right strategies in place &#x2013; with right strategies in place, we will come out of the recession with an even greater competitive edge.</p>
          <p>Today, we are gaining market share in a challenging environment with the strength of our value proposition. Value is where you want to be in this economy. In 2008, our comp sales were at the high end of the retail industry and our customer traffic remained healthy. We believe that our momentum will continue. Our history tells us that when we capture new customers, they stay with us when times improve. This is key because even a slight increase in consumers' discretionary spending and capturing a piece to that in our average basket would be very meaningful for our business.</p>
          <p>The consolidation we are seeing in the retail sector also offers major opportunities for us to gain market share. According to recent data, bankruptcies and store closures to-date across apparel and home fashion retailers will result in approximately 1,200 cloth stores and a $10 billion market share opportunity. This is just what's been announced, and sadly, there will likely be more to come.</p>
          <p>As everyone knows, consumer demand has decreased significantly, but the fact that the retail landscape is also shrinking creates an opportunities for TJX. I talked about future real estate opportunities in the third quarter conference call, and we are now beginning to see some of these opportunities come to fruition. The deals we are seeing are truly advantageous. Further when I talked about real estate deals, it's not only about opening new stores but also opportunities to renegotiate more favorable leases and relocate stores to better location. We have committed to fewer locations for 2009, allowing us to be very opportunistic.</p>
          <p>Our younger and newer concepts are performing well despite the current economic climate. In the U.S., A.J. Wright made significant improvements and held up very well in 2008 and is off to a very good start in 2009. Four-wall profitability was up significantly last year, which gives us the confidence to add 13 A.J. Wright stores in 2009 including one new market. We will continue to grow this business conservatively and expand the chain to the size that delivered solid returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our Marshalls Shoe Megashop which builds on our success in shoes and accessories had two solid openings this fall, one in Yonkers, New York, and the other in California. We will be adding one or two of these stores in 2009. We also tested StyleSense, a similar shoe and accessory concept in Canada in 2008 and it too was very successful. We plan to open just one StyleSense in 2009.</p>
          <p>Further, we believe that being an international company gives us advantages in the short and the long term. Our younger European concepts are all working well and performing beyond our expectations, and we believe we have major opportunities in Europe. With very strong performance to date, we believe our German business will be profitable towards the end of calendar 2010 and are very encouraged by the HomeSense business in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Now, let me spend a moment on our financial strengths which has become even more critical in today's economy and gives us great confidence in the short and the long-term success of our company. In this very uncertain economic environment, our approach is to manage our strong balance sheet and cash position to preserve our flexibility. We have a A rating, an A credit rating, one of the strongest in retail, and ample liquidity including the significant excess cash that we expect to generate from our operations in 2009. With this flexibility, we will be well-positioned to respond to the challenges of this environment and to take advantage of opportunities it may present.</p>
          <p>Cash is a big part of the TJX story. This past year, the excess cash regenerated on a per share basis, at current stock prices, was equivalent of 7% cash-on-cash yield. In 2009, we estimate this yield at 10% as we manage our cash even more tightly. Jeff will cover the details of our plans in a moment.</p>
          <p>So in closing, I believe we have the right business model to endure this environment and win in the long term, and we don't have to make drastic changes to our model to do so. We can manage through these difficult times by making adjustments, and 2009 will be defensive and cautious and flexible. We will plan for conservative comp, keep inventories extremely tight and take a sizable piece out of our cost structure. We will also manage our substantial cash flow and financial liquidity to optimize our flexibility.</p>
          <p>In the short-term, we believe we'll be gaining market share, building our vendor base and maintaining a leadership position in the consumer marketplace and retail landscape, offering both moderate and high-end brands at low-end prices with a compelling value proposition. It's important to remember that even a small uptick in consumer confidence can have a meaningful benefit on our business. When this dust settles from this recession &#x2013; when the dust from this recession settles, we believe we'll be even stronger competitively. We have grown our customer and vendor base. The retail landscape is consolidating, the consumers will have fewer place to shop.</p>
          <p>Real estate, which has always &#x2013; which has already become less expensive, that offer us opportunities in the future. Our new and smaller concepts including A. J. Wright, Marshalls Shoe Mega Shop, StyleSense in Canada, HomeSense in the U.K. and T.K. Maxx in Germany are all doing well and should provide platforms for future growth. I hope I helped to explain how we are taking on the difficult environments ahead on, and while we're confident to say actually it will be positioned now and certainly for the future.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn the call back to Jeff and he'll go through our 2009 plans in details and then we'll open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Before moving to guidance, I want to take a moment on the impact of foreign exchange as we've received quite a number of questions from investors regarding this over the past month. So let me start with that.</p>
          <p>I guess first of all, we've included some charts on our website that layout the impact of currency on TJX on Winners and on T.K. Maxx results. And we hope you find these helpful and we're going to continue to provide them in the future. Clearly, foreign currency translation has impacted our EPS this past year, particularly in the fourth quarter, where it had a negative $0.05 impact due to the precipitous declines in both the Canadian dollar and the British pound. In contrast &#x2013; through our contrast over the four proceeding years, foreign currency translation benefited EPS by an average of about two pennies per year and the impact on any one quarter was no greater than $0.02. So what we're seeing is extraordinary and it's impacting us as well as other multinational retailers.</p>
          <p>In addition to translation, I want to call one other thing out. I need to point out that the sudden and unprecedented decline in the Canadian dollar will economically impact Winner's gross margins particularly in this coming year. So let me explain. Over 50% of our Canadian business is merchandised purchases are denominated in US dollars. When currency rates move gradually, retail prices adjust gradually and the impact on gross margins is not terribly significant. However, when rates move suddenly as they've done, we're unable to immediately adjust our retail prices and we have to do so gradually and in line with the competition.</p>
          <p>This compresses Winner's gross margins in the short term, because in essence the cost of merchandise has increased, because the US dollar has as appreciated. We began to see some of that impact approximately a 100 basis points in the fourth quarter, segment margins of Winners. So Winners margins for the fourth quarter, there's about 100 basis points of impact from this item. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, our consolidated fourth quarter merchandise margin would have been flat, were it not for this impact.</p>
          <p>So that's currency. Let me delve into more detail about our outlook for the full year. As Carol noted earlier, we'll provide full year guidance around a number of elements of our P&amp;L and balance sheet along with some assumptions about the overall profit model, but are not providing sales and EPS ranges. Let me run through some key elements of our plan for fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>First, we've built our plans around a low single digit comp decrease, which is in line with our Q4 trend, and we've done this to protect the gross margin. With this approach and the terrific buying opportunities we have, we believe merchandise margins will be up for the year.</p>
          <p>Second, we've taken actions to reduce cost by $150 million. These will protect our bottom line. They will also offset expense increases in other areas such as pension and health insurance that you've been hearing other companies talk about. This implies flat SG&amp;A in dollar terms, versus fiscal 2009 on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Third, while we're not planning flat comps, our model for fiscal 2010 would result in flat earnings per share versus the prior year on a 52-week basis, if the comps were flat. It's important to note that this model includes $0.14 per share of negative currency impacts for the year, $0.05 from foreign currency translation and $0.09 from the lower gross margin at Winners, which I just discussed. Excluding currency impacts, our model would result in essentially flat EPS on a minus 2% comp. So we hope those data points give you some ability or some insight as you're building your models.</p>
          <p>Fourth and very importantly, we expect the first half of the year to be much more difficult than the second half, as we're up against tougher comp store sales comparisons, and we'll continue to have negative foreign currency translation until we anniversary last year's decline, which won't be until late in the third quarter. Additionally, many of the cost reduction actions will not begin to take effect until the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally in this environment, we're managing our liquidity conservatively to preserve flexibility. We've reduced our CapEx budget to $450 million in 2009 from $583 million in the prior year. This plan reflects the reduction in the pace of store openings as we keep our powder dry for what we think will be terrific real estate opportunities.</p>
          <p>We're going to take a more conservative approach to our stock buyback program. Currently, we anticipate spending up to $250 million. However, we could potentially adjust this up or down and adjust the timing, depending upon the economic environment. At current prices, this level of buyback represents a slightly &#x2013; represents slightly less than &#x2013; represents a slightly less than 3% reduction in our share count, and that's just slightly below what we've done historically.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, we're also reducing our inventories, which will also provide some incremental cash. So if wrap all this together on the liquidity front, including all of these actions, we would expect to generate positive cash flow in the $500 million to $600 million this year on top of the $454 million balance we had at the beginning of the year, which gives us significant flexibility. However, to be clear, we will, as we've always been, be conservative at how we manage TJX's balance sheet and finances.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to first quarter guidance. As I just noticed, this is not indicative of the first year, given the more challenging first half. I'm sorry, this is not indicative of the full year given the more challenging first half. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.38 versus $0.44 per share last year on a reported basis. This outlook includes a $0.02 per share negative impact from foreign currency translation and inventory-related hedges.</p>
          <p>Last year's results included a $0.02 per share benefit of non-recurring tax benefits as well as a $0.01 negative impact from inventory related hedges. Excluding these impacts, on a comparable basis, EPS would be in the range of $0.34 to $0.40 versus an adjusted $0.43 last year. That said, we understand and would endorse that most analysts submit consensus estimates on a reported basis unadjusted for these items.</p>
          <p>Some of the details on Q1, we're assuming a first quarter top line of $4.2 billion in that range with the 2% to 4% comp sales decrease both on a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. For the month of February, we're planning for a consolidated comp store sales decrease of 1% to 2%. We're anticipating a 2% to 4% decrease in March and a 4% to 6% decrease in April. April's comps reflect one less selling day in the month due to the shift of Easter from March last year to April this year.</p>
          <p>For Marmaxx, we're planning a 1% to 2% comp decrease in February, a 1% to 3% comp decrease in March and a 4% to 6% comp decrease in April.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 5.4% to 6.2% range, down 70 to 150 basis points in the prior year. This decline is entirely due to expense deleverage on the negative costs, as merchandise margins are expected to be up for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We're anticipating first quarter gross profit margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.0%, and SG&amp;A as a percent of sales to be about 17.7% to 18%. Again, the majority of the benefit of the cost reductions will not begin until the second quarter and we are anticipating cost deleverage on the 2% to 4% comp decrease.</p>
          <p>For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.2% and net interest expense in the $4 million to $5 million range.</p>
          <p>So that's it for the quarter. I'll wrap up my comments with our store growth plans for fiscal 2010. Beginning with our domestic concepts: At Marmaxx, we plan to increase its store base by a net of about 17 stores for a total of 1,697 stores by the end of fiscal 2010. Very importantly, as Carol mentioned earlier, we are keeping our real estate powder dry and believe we'll have the opportunities to do more Marmaxx stores than we currently plan.</p>
          <p>At HomeGoods, we plan to add a net of four stores for a total of 322 HomeGoods stores by the end of the year. At A.J. Wright, as Carol mentioned, in fiscal 2010, we anticipate netting 13 additional stores for a total of 148 by year end. In Canada, we plan to add a net 13 stores to end the year with a total 290 stores in that country.</p>
          <p>And then finally, moving to Europe, in the UK, we plan to add five T.K. Maxx stores as well as three HomeSense stores for a combined total of 241 stores by the end of the year. We also expect to open additional 10 stores in Germany for a total of 19 in that country by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So that's it. We're going to open it for questions now. To keep the call on schedule, we ask that you please limit your questions to one per person. And I'll now turn it back to Elon.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today is from Jeffery Black.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Jeff, a question for you and then a question for Carol. But on the expense initiatives, can you help us out with how to think about occupancy deleverage in the back-half of the year? I mean, are you still going to delever on occupancy if we see negative 2% comp?</p>
          <p>And then, Carol, could you just give us a quick update on home, what we see there, is there any progress? It looks like the third quarter was &#x2013; or the last quarter was very tough in the home business. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. I'm going to take it. First I'll talk to you a little bit about home. We just really had a tough home business in the fourth quarter. And I think we've made a lot of changes in the strategy going forward, and we're already seeing some very positive signs. I'll talk to you generally about HomeGoods. We've really changed up our strategy there. Now, obviously across all divisions, everybody is looking at cost reduction. But more importantly, we think we brought tremendous value into our home business, especially in HomeGoods and HomeSense, a much better value than we had in the past, much leaner.</p>
          <p>We have a completely differently strategy in terms of freshness, breadth of SKUs, our new marketing campaign. And I can tell you that we're really seeing a change, and I'm very excited about going into February in terms of the home businesses.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing that where there is a HomeGoods, and a Linens 'n Things has closed, we are seeing some very substantial comp increases in those stores. So again, we think the landscape is going to change, and I think I'm feeling a lot better about our home business going into this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, on your question on the buying and occupancy deleverage, I mean clearly, we would anticipate buying and occupancy deleverage in the first quarter on a minus 2% to a minus 4% comp, and that's partially offset by increased merchandise margins. But we are seeing buying and occupancy deleverage. It's really hard with &#x2013; the cost &#x2013; there are a number of cost elements in buying and occupancy expense which are fixed on a short-term basis. So it's awfully difficult to get leverage when you have a negative comp.</p>
          <p>In terms of the back-half, it all depends on the comp. I would estimate we would need about somewhere between a 2% to 3% comp to leverage buying and occupancy. We'll leverage SG&amp;A at a much, much lower comp given some of the expense cuts that we've made.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Michelle Clark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter in a difficult environment. In terms of the expenses, I just wanted to get a little bit more color there in terms of timing. I know that you said that they would start primarily in the second quarter. Jeff, how can we think about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:38) as we proceed through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you're going to get some &#x2013; we don't mean to say that you're not getting any benefit in the first quarter. There are a number of things that we've done that are going to benefit the first quarter, but I don't think we're &#x2013; we won't see everything kick in until the second. I think that said, looking at my list here, but I think the lion's share of what we're doing will be done by early in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michelle, to go through some of those, we have DC efficiencies, which we'll see a little bit of, the in-store labor piece of it, we're beginning to see a small positive there, but that will really start in second quarter and follow up through.</p>
          <p>Higher increase, April is usually the time where we do our increases. We talked about some voluntary early retirement. And in terms of positions, we really basically froze our positions since last September. So that will continue throughout the year.</p>
          <p>There's some strategic restructuring going on that will probably be in the next two to three months. We have a little bit going on in our benefit plans, and that really has to do with communication and just doing a better job at some of the things that we already have. Tightening travel expenses, we'll start to see that. And then non-merchandise procurements, which is a big chunk and which was a big chunk last year, again we'll probably start to see a little bit of that, but most of that in second, third and fourth quarter. So that gives you more of a breakdown.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. It certainly seems like A.J. Wright has reached a new level of stability. Can you talk a little bit about that division and any additional color on their ability to gain share in this environment of what you're seeing product-wise there? And also, you mentioned shifting dollars to the right categories. What will we see more of or less of in this environment and how does the advertising work with that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, in terms of A.J., first of all, we are off to a very good start. We're building on a stronger year. We definitely have a better understanding of this customer and had a market for this customer. Our four-wall contribution has certainly improved dramatically. We think we have upside in margin, and we're running again with much, much leaner inventories and focusing on what this customer wants, which is basics, kids, juniors, dresses and young men's which is really the key categories that we focus on and shoes in the A.J.'s business.</p>
          <p>So we are opening a new market this year in Atlanta which we're pretty excited about. The goods are so plentiful in this market that this is &#x2013; again, when I say it is impossible to keep these guys home, and absolutely there is buying mania out there and we have to control them. So the goods are very, very plentiful in this marketplace. But we're just feeling really good about A.J. Wright and the future of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Real solid year, last or two &#x2013; Dana, if you look at A.J. now, <mark type="ph" /> you see a 4% (37:05) comp, making money above breakeven. And I think we've got a team &#x2013; a strong team and they're really beginning to click.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dana, as far as shifting categories, without giving away all our trade secrets, there're places that are just working very well. The CUBE, the younger customer which I'm probably the most excited about, because again that bodes so well for our future. We have new things going on in accessories and shoes that are just making those areas even stronger going forward and we see some tremendous opportunities.</p>
          <p>And there is a lot of fashion starting to happen. So it's still getting pretty exciting out there. And more importantly, what I like is that we entered the spring season just so clean, our stores are reading color and excitement and the breadth of assortment. We're very, very well assorted versus being deep. So it's getting pretty exciting. I am in there every single day checking it out.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Very nice quarter. A question I guess regarding the sensitivity around some of the comp leverage point that you talked about or I guess if comps were to be at that flat range, which you're not projecting, but as far as the movement around that and what that would &#x2013; what the sensitivity would be there, operating margin, et cetera, if you can provide any color on that? And then secondly, if there is anything you could say regarding the content of the advertising, how other than increased emphasis on value and offering, any other details you might be able to share? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Daniel, I'll take the marketing and then Jeff will give you some of the sensitivities around the model. We're going to be coming out with a very unusual different marketing campaign. So I am not at liberty to tell you, but it's very unique. It's about educating the customer, and it reads very, very well to our model and the value of our model.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to keep it a surprise. I am sorry I can't give it away yet. But it's going to &#x2013; we will be on network TV for the first time. We will be able to hit 35% of the stores that we haven't been able to hit in the past. And in addition to that, stores will also be &#x2013; they will have increased direct mail. So this is quite breakthrough for us. So we look forward to sharing it shortly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, in terms of the sensitivity, I'll give you two benchmarks. One is every point of comp is worth about $0.08 to the bottom-line, and you could actually see that now we've provided the model today where we said flat EPS on a flat comp with $0.14 of currency pressure, maybe pull the currency pressure out, $0.14, you're flat on a minus-2% comp. So you can see that in there. The other point I would call here or the other benchmark is every point of comp is worth about 20 basis points in bottom-line pre-tax margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just if I could clarify that, is that &#x2013; would that be more on the gross margin and the leverage or deleverage of fixed occupancy or do also you also tend to see some flex up and down in the SG&amp;A dollars? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as the comp moves up and down, you'll flex on both SG&amp;A and buying and occupancy cost. Our merchandise margin doesn't react and swing as strongly to comp changes either way because of the flexibility in the model and how short our purchase cycles are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Stein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carol, a question for you on your purchasing strategy. Historically, the company has always said we buy closer to need and it just seems that that has been a continued focus. And I'm wondering this year, is it any different or is it just more of the same and incremental. So what I'm suggesting is what percent of your merchandise for spring have you committed in the upfront market this year versus historical.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Jeff, you know you can pry that number out of me if you try. But I will tell you that our purchasing closer to need is greater and planned greater this year than it was last year with leaner inventories. So along with that, we've been working on our distribution network the last several years to be able to get very, very close to delivery.</p>
          <p>So we're literally in Marmaxx hitting the DCs and in some cases within 24 hours they're hitting the floor. So our plan is the goods are coming in and going straight on the line and going out to the stores. It makes a big difference in the timeframe. So that's what we've really been what I see as a bigger positive in 2009. We started to see this in 2008, but we've gotten better and better on our network. So that's what's also changing the model a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And could you just talk roughly how many of your HomeGoods stores overlap with Linens 'n Things?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Adrianne. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good, thanks. Great quarter. I just &#x2013; digging into that marketing spend seems like an interesting intensification of the TV penetration, especially across more market. Can you share with us what you've seen already with the TV marketing in existing markets and what sort of comp lift you've benefited with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, first of all, our traffic has been for the whole year. And I think you've probably noticed that we've taken more of an educational positioning in terms of off-price to our consumer. Markets where we certainly have had TV have been more positive, and we've been testing many things for the last couple of years in terms of what really is increasing our traffic.</p>
          <p>And I think this past year &#x2013; two years ago, we started testing, and this last year we started expanding the strategy. And this year is probably the big year that we're really going network and making much larger penetration. So that's our strategy. But I can't share with you how we're going to do it. You'll look these at shortly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, looking forward to it. And then just following up on the merchandise margin, obviously given the aggressive discounting we've seen across the landscape this holiday season, really impressive to see that flat merchandise margin. Just wondering going forward &#x2013; understand the place your core competencies in terms of lean inventories and buying closer to need, but when you think about continuing to be flat merchandise margins, perhaps tell us how sharp you think IMUs have to be as we are in a clearly very intensified promotional environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Adrianne, first of all, I think we gave great value in the fourth quarter certainly in the holiday period, which is probably the most promotional environment any of us can remember. I'm going to be honest with you. I would be disappointed if our merchandise aren't stronger than what we're planning them. I think our opportunity is just very, very strong in this market. And Ernie has certainly been out there in Marmaxx and Winners and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adrianne, I'd just validate what Carol said. I think &#x2013; and we've talked about this before. The availability is rather plentiful out there, I would say, and it's at all levels in the market, so moderate, high end, et cetera. And so amidst all of that, we're having to usually kind of pace ourselves. And because we're liquid, however, we're be able to take advantage of these opportunities and I think far better than pretty much we ever have before. So I don't see that dynamic changing at least in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, Adrianne, we keep track of &#x2013; if a department store has a promotion and then a point-on-sale on top of that, a point-on-sale on top of that and a point-on-sale on top of that, and we're still giving great value.</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Adrianne, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:41) &#x2013; we comp shop all the time and we make sure that our model said that we have to be out-the-door at a gap between our retail and what the out-the-door retails are at the other retailers.

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, congratulations. I've never been so happy to not be negotiating price of inventory in my life. So I'm curious about your negotiations. Have you guys been able to negotiate any different terms away from just the prices? I know vendors can negotiate certain terms and concessions to the buyers of their inventory. And I'm curious if you've been able to play with that end of the market as well.</p>
          <p>And walking a couple of shows recently, there are brands that I'm seeing that are valid brands that could clearly not exist in six months or a year from now, smaller private brands, because they're valid. Is there any interest on your part in buying a brand name on the cheap to do something with it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>First of all, we're always looking &#x2013; part of our strategy and a small piece of it, we do some product development. But we have bought many brands in the past, and we will continue to do so. And that's just part of the over 2,000 vendors that we work with.</p>
          <p>In terms of terms, we work in million different ways. If a vendor needs cash, we can give them cash. We're working with these people, not against them. And it depends on the situation, and we're flexible and we work with whatever opportunity or whatever situation presents itself.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I could just jump in there, we haven't &#x2013; we do that &#x2013; in terms of part of the negotiation and the point I want to make is that when you look at the term at Marmaxx, it really hasn't changed significantly though in this environment. I think one of the things that I would want to call out is when you look at our balance sheet, Marni, you'll see that the relationship of payables to inventory has come down, meaning we have less leverage in our payables. That's more a function of how we manage through the fourth quarter, we brought inventories down. And when you bring inventories down, typically you're paying off your old payables but you're not building new payables as quickly. So you lose leverage until you get your inventories down and then you rebuild that leverage. So, I don't want anybody in the call thinking that we may be deleveraging our payables. We're not and we would expect this temporary deleverage you're seeing at the end of the year to reverse in the first quarter, which by the way is worth about $150 million to us.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. And Jeff, it's great to have you back on the call. Normally, you guys give a division-by-division sort of highlight or recap, and I think Carol, you generally do that. I was wondering if you could share with us just some high-level comments on each of your divisions, either growth, sales, gross margin, SG&amp;A, anything that you felt was a needle-mover in the quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondarily on Winners, can you just remind us what the exact impact on the operating margin at Winners was from the reversal of that foreign currency hedge? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Well, I think just asking about the reversal of the foreign currency hedge, Marni, hang on, one second.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, Kimberly. Sorry. I'm really sorry, Kimberly. Hang on. For the quarter &#x2013; for the full year, it didn't have a significant impact at all. For the quarter for the company, it was a difference between 10 points &#x2013; so for the quarter, we reported a 4.7% margin for Winners. Last year it was 14.9%, so it was down 10.2%, 7.6% of that was due to the reversal in the hedge.</p>
          <p>Remember, we booked a gain at the end of the third quarter and then we had a &#x2013; we reversed that gain, which resulted in a hit in the fourth quarter. So when you apples-to-apples, Winners' segment margins were down 260 basis points for the quarter. The majority of that is merchandise margin and a big piece of that was that issue I mentioned earlier about the cost of goods going up because the amount of goods they purchase in U.S. dollars is a high percentage of their mix. And the U.S dollar obviously appreciated against the Canadian dollar. So down 260 basis points ex the mark-to-market with about 7.5, 7.6-point impact from that mark-to-market.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Kimberly, in terms of the divisions, I'm going to kind of give you an overview and I'm going to also pass it to Ernie to talk about Marmaxx and Winners a bit. But generally, if you look at Marmaxx, for the year I think that profit margin was down about 40 basis points. And if you look at it on the flat comp, the segment profit dollars were, I think, very much flat to LY.</p>
          <p>We think that this year there is obviously the cost opportunities, there is definitely opportunity on the margin side and I can go through &#x2013; I don't want to be overly positive, because I know we are in a very, very difficult environment, but I believe between the initiative and the focus, there is still opportunity there. In terms of home goods, I think part of this I think was our fault in our execution, and I can see it changing very rapidly in home goods right now. I am very excited about how they are off to such a positive start in the month of February.</p>
          <p>So I &#x2013; again, I think sometimes we do it to ourselves and sometimes it's the environment, and I think in this case, it's a combination of both. I think it was a tough housing market, but I think HomeGoods is going to be the place to shop, and I do believe that there will be less home retailers out there in the future. So this is going to be hopefully a very short bump in the road for them leading to a very positive future.</p>
          <p>A.J.'s, I've talked a little bit about focus and we've got a great team in place right now. We have a head at stores that is absolutely sensational, that was over in the U.K. that I think is going to do a terrific job. I think our stores are going to be run a lot better. I think we understand that customer. They are in the profit zone, and I think they are really understanding how to flow the goods and the value, and I'm pretty excited about this concept going forward.</p>
          <p>As far as the U.K. goes, that is again one of &#x2013; to me, one of the most exciting places right now, because not only do we have incredible real estate deals going on and opportunities, but Germany has come on very, very strong. They had a four comp on top of a six comp at T.K. The segment margin was up 40 basis points including Germany and HomeSense. And we are seeing unprecedented deals over in the U.K. and I think they're just getting stronger and stronger, so I just think there is a lot more to come there.</p>
          <p>Winners, we're going to battle the margin. Their segment profit was 11% against last year's 11.5% and we will get through that and I think &#x2013; already think some positive things that could help mitigate that. And I am going to turn it over to your thoughts on Marmaxx and Winners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carol. Let's go right to Marmaxx. I would say two of the big focuses right now are one on brands because with what's going on out there, we have an opportunity I think to do more business with some brands that we've done a little less with that are desirable, and two, to really take advantage of the market, yes, but to buy on a weekly basis and flow on a weekly basis throughout the whole store.</p>
          <p>I think we're really trying to focus the organization on those two things, which should yield I think more excitement down the road here for the season. And going back to something I think Carol mentioned in the earlier comments, the most exciting opportunity I think to me is new customers. So I think if we have customers walking in the door now that perhaps did not shop us before, when they see some of these brands at the values we potentially will have, I think that will be a key strategy for us even longer term to gain market share there.</p>
          <p>Secondly, at Winners, yes, we have a currency issue. One positive thing we are hearing amidst that is, first of all, every retailer will get hit with the currency issue. And some of them buy out further, but what we are hearing is that they will be adjusting their retails going into like second, third quarter which should allow us surgically in places to adjust our retails accordingly.</p>
          <p>So, I'm thinking that should be a pretty positive strategy for us going forward. Clearly with the economy up there softening, we'll have to be careful with that, however, again it's creating additional buying opportunities up in Canada as well that we will take advantage of and buy goods better and there again hopefully win market share in Canada as well beyond what we have already. So I think high level, we're feeling pretty good about both those situations.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Carol. How are you? Unfortunately, I guess the questions are mostly for Jeff here. I guess on the real estate side, did you give us the CapEx that you have assumed in your free cash flow generation? And then maybe talk about how many of your stores are up for renewals over the next two years? And then maybe the number of stores that you might have co-tenancy agreements on, and if we see some impact from the Linens and Circuits going away in those centers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't give you that co &#x2013; I don't have that co-tenancy information, Brian. But in terms of &#x2013; in term of the number of leases, the majority of our stores &#x2013; when we open a new stores, there are almost always on a 10-year term, and with as many five-year options as we can get. So if you look Marmaxx, just this year number of stores in Marmaxx, most of those stores are going to be coming up every five years for a renewal other than the stores that we've opened in the last five years. So, you probably have 70% to 80% of the Marmaxx base coming up every five years right now. So that'll give you flavor for that. And that's obviously where we have the majority of our stores.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital, in that $500 million to $600 million cash generation, that's &#x2013; we're calling out there the $500 million to $600 million. That's the amount we believe our cash balance will increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that is after $450 million in capital spending, which as I mentioned was down $583 million &#x2013; down from the $583 million we spent last year. In the $450 million CapEx, we have a fund in there to allow us to invest opportunistically. So there is a pretty sizable piece of that that's being held back and controlled by the corporate office, and that we've earmarked for opportunities as they come up during the year. And we believe we will see some real estate opportunity. So we didn't want to deploy our entire capital budget to the divisions, we wanted to hold some top side to based on what we see coming up.</p>
          <p>The last point I'd make on the $500 million to $600 million bucks, that's after an assumed $250 million buyback and after about $200 million in dividend, it would be our intent this year, while it does require board approval, it would be our intent to increase the dividend. So if you look at that, $500 million to $600 million, with the $250 million buyback and with $200 million from the dividend would tell you that pre any distribution to shareholders, we would generate $950 million to $1.050 billion in cash and we think that's a good thing. We think that gives us a lot of flexibility. The one other last point I would make regarding the balance sheet is we have $400 million of debt coming due at the end of the year. We believe we'll be able to refinance it, but in this environment, we have to be conservative and so we are going to be prepared that in the event the markets are not our friends, that we can retire that debt should the markets force us to do so, which by the way is not what we want to do, but one has to be ready.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, one other comment on the real estate. I think one of the biggest opportunities for us is places such as New York City and the New York area, highly dense areas, high streets in the U.K., are places that it was more difficult for us to enter. We believe this may be our time in those areas, which will really bode well for the future and that's what we're pretty excited about.</p>

          <p>Just a question on the A.J. Wright decision in the Atlanta market, what are the operating margins that you're willing now to live with before you pull the trigger on adding more stores or a wider roll out and how close are you achieving that level of rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're never &#x2013; I mean, <mark type="ph" /> Todd (1:00:50), we're not going to suddenly add on 100 stores. That's really not the way we do it. Right now, we're approaching our four-wall, I think, we are over 12 now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're &#x2013; the target is mid-teen, so <mark type="ph" /> Todd (1:01:06), at a mid-teen store contribution margin. Fully leveraging our distribution centers and our G&amp;A would give us about 7% bottom line and an ROIC in that sort of 15% to 20% range. So that's what we're targeting. Obviously, you can't drive the pre-tax margin up until you &#x2013; you do need to open stores. We're going to go slowly and cautiously, but what really gives us, there is two things that we find encouraging, one is that the store four-wall contribution, we're probably within 100 basis points of where we need to be. Two years ago, we were at 300, 350 basis points away.</p>
          <p>So A.J. Wright has been really making significant progress in their store contribution margin over the last several years. The other thing is our new stores that we've opened have performed well. So that gives us &#x2013; having a four-wall contribution close to what we need for the model and also having pretty strong new store performance. And that we think that new store performance only improves in this environment given the quality of deals that we're going to see, but as Carol mentioned, we don't throw Hail Marys at TJX, so we'll go slowly and cautiously.</p>

          <p>Just a few follow-ups. On the comps at Marmaxx, can you breakdown traffic versus ticket? Can you say what the comp differential has been in the markets where you've had TV. What is the comp required to leverage SG&amp;A in the back half? And then finally, Carol, just on the Mega Shoe, how close is the California store to an existing store, and what cannibalization are you <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:14)? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to through a couple, I'm going to throw some of them to Jeff. First of all, our traffic is slightly up and our ticket is slightly down. In terms of the Mega Shoe, it happens to be right next to a Marshalls. So we have not completely measured the cannibalization, but obviously between the two, we're pretty happy with the sale &#x2013; with the overall sales, and we'll continue to measure that. We purposely put one of the boxes right next to a Marshalls, and in our other location, we don't have it next to a Marshalls. And that's why we will always go slowly and the measure the cannibalization. We &#x2013; I will not give you the information in terms of TV, you know how it hits our market and the percent of increase, we see is it that &#x2013; that's really &#x2013; that's really something that we don't share. And then I'll give &#x2013; Jeff, you want to talk to the leveraging of Marmaxx.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:06:30) just in the back half, you said &#x2013; you gave us some information on occupancy, you didn't give SG&amp;A.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think right now, look for the first quarter, we're calling SG&amp;A deleverage on a minus two to minus four comp of about 60 basis points to 90 basis points. So that's &#x2013; clearly, we would see an improvement in that trend with the performance of some of the &#x2013; with the execution of some of the cost reduction and issues. I don't have specifically back half information because you're not giving guidance on the back half. The <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:04) to tell you I would expect that we'll be significantly lowering that leverage point, we mentioned for the year that on a constant currency basis, so excluding the favorable impact of currency that we would expect SG&amp;A to be flat on a dollar basis year-over-year and it's down slightly including the impact of currency, so...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks guys. Can you may be, Jeff, break down that CapEx in new stores versus ITDC maybe share with us how much you're keeping at corporate for opportunities? And then just hearing your guys talking about these opportunities, in this environment, have reconsidered the right number of stores for any of your concepts? And I guess in particular, I'm wondering how you gain comfort on what the right number of Marmaxx locations is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer that first, Paul, and then I'm going to hand it over to Jeff. We've always given Marmaxx a range, our comfortability is still 1,800 and we've ranged that 1,800 to higher than that to 2,200. Again, with less stores out there in the future we don't know what that number is. So I would think that there would be only upside to that versus downside. And then the same thing in Europe, we're seeing Germany where we felt that Germany was at least 350 stores and we're feeling very, very confident about that.</p>
          <p>So we really don't see much downside. And as A.J. Wright is working, we've ranged that between 500 and 1,000 stores. And we're just going to keep moving in that direction, because each day we're feeling more confident about that business. So if anything we don't see downside to the number of stores. And Jeff you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in terms of how much we've earmarked and held at corporate and rather be mum on that, that doesn't save significant amount of CapEx. But I don't think it's something &#x2013; we're going to be &#x2013; frankly, I want to go public on. The &#x2013; in terms of the mix, if we look historically, we spend the bonus with some quick math here, but about 50% of our capital budget is on store renovations and improvements that's where we have all of our initiatives, our re-models, et cetera. New stores represent about 25% and our office and distribution centers represent about 25%.</p>
          <p>I think those percentages are going to hold up relatively well this year. We've reduced the number of new stores. But we've also been tighter on store renovations and improvements and the office and the distribution centers. So I think the mix will be a little bit different than that. I think we're going to end up with a little bit more in store renovation, a little bit less in new store. But it's generally along those lines, Paul.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick to give you an idea, we are looking at another handful of runway stores potentially being added. We've gone to a large degree of the Marshall Shoe Mega Store to a large degree of a chain approaching like 90%. So maybe we'll add another 20 there. Single queue lines, we'll add like another 100 or so. And I think, junior CUBE I think we talked about, we'll probably add give or take a 120 junior CUBE stores during the course of the year to end up like kind of give or take about 450.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

          <p>Yes, yes, that's &#x2013; we adjust &#x2013; we would be adjusting these game plans or these numbers that we were running into our results that weren't saying, we just still do it. So yes, they're all working as planned.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, I guess now. A question back on gross margin, Jeff, can you talk a little bit about the sequential improvement that it looks like you're guiding to in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. If you go through some of those components how you think they're going to be improving or still be the same or worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The &#x2013; I have to look at my numbers here for both periods. So can you &#x2013; so just hang on for a moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the first quarter &#x2013; sorry, the fourth quarter, I'm just checking out the merchandise, the merchandise margin. Yeah, we see &#x2013; the sequential improvement, so the merchandise margin was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, if I back out that Winners currency issue that we talked about. And then we have an increase in the first quarter. What's happened is that we brought our inventory down significantly in the fourth quarter, we have much, much more liquidity opened to buy, we're sitting on more purchase dollars that are uncommitted and there is terrific buys in the marketplace and when that happens, your mark on goes up. The other thing that happens with very lean inventories that tends to have an improvement in your markdowns. So yes there is a sequential improvement from Q4 into Q1 and those would be the factors and it's not surprising to us given the way that we're managing our inventories in this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Winners issue, should that be fairly similar in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Winners, now, it'll be more in the first quarter. We would estimate about 200 basis points of impact on Winners' merchandise margins, because of this currency issue of sourcing good and more expensive U.S. dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Winners is about 10% of the full company, so &#x2013; but 20 basis points.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>David, we're up after that. I want to point that the merchandise margins, we've been &#x2013; the up merchandise margin is after absorbing that hit from Winners.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Jeff, just a clarification on your outlook for fiscal 2010 on your base case, which is the minus 2 comp. So what you're saying is using the $2.01, you would take out the 53rd week $0.09, FX $0.14 and that would your base case were approximate to roughly $1.78. Is that the right way to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hang on up to that. I did all that reverse math.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to try to put it in a simple terms...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And understandable terms as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's &#x2013; on a reported basis that would be right. So on a reported basis we're seeing flat including $0.14 of currency pressure. So flat to us is about &#x2013; we have a $0.92 on a 52 week basis excluding the intrusion in the mark-to-market adjustments. So the $1.92 would be the base case. And we're saying we're basically that we're &#x2013; on a flat comp, we will be flat to that and that including $0.14 of currency pain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the $1.92 would be the pro forma, the $1.78 would be the reported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that would be at a flat comp. And then obviously, at a minus 2% comp, you pull $0.14 out of both ends.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then a follow-up for Carol, in terms of &#x2013; you've mentioned that price competiveness is a key issue. There's a lot of pricing upheaval in the department store industry. When you look at the fourth quarter, your business was a little bit tougher in November than December. I know some of it was due to some marketing shifts. But were there any lessons learned there? I mean just from my walk through the stores and just hearing anecdotally from competitors, there seem to be, that you got more aggressive on pricing as the quarter progressed. And I'm just wondering if the November underperformance relative to December had anything to do with that or did you feel like you were price competitive all along the way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say, David, I mean the economy definitely hit pretty quickly in October and November. So I would say to you that we did have some catch-up in understanding what the true value needed to be. And I think we started catching up in December. So yes, if I said to you, do I think today, looking back, that we have done a better job in November. The answer is yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, obviously going forward, you're taking those lessons from December and applying the same...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks a lot. Quick couple of questions. First with just on this marketing spend, so you're going to hit 35% more stores. Can you just kind give us &#x2013; walk us through the regions where you hadn't had some regional advertising in the past, so we can just kind of monitor the impact of that first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't even answer that, Randy. I mean I don't have it specifically in front of me. Some of it's the smaller market and it's different between Maxx and Marshalls. Maxx tends to be in smaller markets. So the impact is going to be in &#x2013; again in a $5 million or $6 million or $4 million store. And then Marshalls will probably hit some of the bigger markets. So we'll hit areas in Florida and California that maybe today it doesn't hit. And it's certainly where we weren't highly penetrated before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>But I don't have specifics in front of me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the, just to move on to the expense savings of $150 million. You talked about the reduced marketing spend, it sounds like it would be modest and you gave us like four or five buckets. Can you just kind of give us a little bit more clarity on what's the higher weighting bucket towards that $150 million, where is the least weighted bucket in terms of the expense savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The biggest bucket is really non-merchandise procurement. And then, we have the big chunks in leveraging best practices in DCs and probably in-store labor is a big chunk of that also. And then we have some other areas, where we think that are non-including in this number is, we have an initiative on freight that we think hopefully will end up being a big number going forward.</p>

          <p>Right. Not included in the $150 million. So those probably are the three biggest chunks.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And well just on that freight, to give a little more clarity what would that be? What &#x2013; would it be...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know what the numbers are yet, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, not the number. But what are you trying to do with the freight? What are you trying to do, go to change your shipper or what are you trying to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of things. It's really leveraging the corporation more efficiently. We have a lot of places that I think we can leverage a lot better than we are today and that's what we're digging into.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, just on the HomeGoods, we've been through a little bit of fits and starts, fits and starts here. You sound a little bit more constructive on it in terms of February trend. What specific changes can you point to in the last three months or so that you really &#x2013; make you feel better about really where the direction is going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you walk in to the stores today, it's &#x2013; we've really changed it up. And we've looked at a much stronger value equation. I think there are places where we weren't offering enough value to the customer and I think we are today. I think we're marketing in-store a lot better than we have. I think we're moving the stores around and making them much more exciting, before you would walk-in and you'd specifically see a department and it never moved through the entire year. So there are a lot of changes and then within categories where we're putting our dollars, we're seeing some new categories that are working and some old categories that we're just doing a lot better job with. So it's a lot of different dynamics that are going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any particular categories you're taking dollars away from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're always flexi on our categories, but I really don't usually give that kind of detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, fair enough. Thank you.</p>
