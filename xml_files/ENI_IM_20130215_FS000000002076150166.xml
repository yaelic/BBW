          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Eni's 2012 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call Hosted by Paolo Scaroni, Chief Executive Officer and Massimo Mondazzi, Chief Financial Officer. For the duration of the call, you will be on listen-only mode. However, at the end of the call, you have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to your host to begin today's conference. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our conference call. I will take you through some of the highlights of this year and then I will hand you over to Massimo Mondazzi, our CFO, who many of you know well from his time as Deputy CFO of Eni and in key positions in E&amp;P for a more detailed look at the Q4 and full year numbers.</p>
          <p>With regards to the highlights, in 2012, Eni delivered a robust performance. On top of that, we've fundamentally changed the profile of our company. Eni is now financially stronger and more focused. Our balance sheet has been transformed through the disposal of significant stakes in Snam and Galp, we have reduced net debt by almost &#x20AC;15 billion bringing our leverage to 25% from the previous 46%.</p>
          <p>Our remaining stakes in Snam and Galp are worth around &#x20AC;5 billion at current market prices and we will continue to pursue value-creating opportunities. The transformation of our balance sheet has gone hand-in-hand with that our &#x2013; of our long-term growth prospects.</p>
          <p>Exploration has been truly exceptional. In 2012, we have added over 3.6 billion boe of new resources, or almost six times our 2012 production, and this is not just Mozambique. We've also had significant success in the balance sheet, West Africa and in Egypt. And through efficient project functioning, we have achieved an organic reserve replacement ratio of 147%. We are on track with our major development projects, in particular, we are pressing ahead with Mozambique. Thanks to the agreement struck with Anadarko in December and confirm FID by 2014.</p>
          <p>And with regards to Kashagan, we are progressing steadily towards completion and we will start that before the contractual date of June 2013. Of course, growth needs to be built on a secure base and on that front, you should note that Libya has delivered a robust performance with a quicker ramp-up than many were expecting, although there is still a shortfall compared to pre-revolution production levels.</p>
          <p>While Eni's value creation opportunities have never been stronger, reaping the full benefits of this transformation requires structural reform of our mid and downstream businesses.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, we have seen continuing demand <mark type="ph" /> distraction (03:20). In 2012 consumption was 6% lower in Italy and in key European countries year-on-year and 12% lower compared to pre-crisis 2008. This has prevented European oversupply from being absorbed and spot prices from closing the gap with oil-linked prices. In this context, our focus is on the renegotiation of our supply portfolio. We have now opened renegotiations regarding around 80% of our supply base. At the same time, we have focused our commercial efforts on segments in which we can add value such as retail and LNG.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we have launched a reorganization to integrate the supply activities of Gas &amp; Power and R&amp;M together with trading, risk management and the wholesale commercial activities of Gas &amp; Power including LNG. This integration will allow Eni to capture synergies between supply, trading and sales, which have become increasingly interconnected as the market for natural gas becomes more liquid. This activity will be led by Marco Alver&#xE0; who is currently in charge of our trading arm, and in the past has run the supply activities of Gas &amp; Power.</p>
          <p>Turning to R&amp;M, here too we are facing unprecedented product demand declines, down 10% year-on-year in Italy, adding further pressure to Europe's structure refining overcapacity. We have made progress in aligning capacity with demand through the temporary closures at the Gela, Venice and Taranto refineries and have reduced cost by over &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Versalis has experienced the worst scenario on record with high naphtha and utility costs and low prices for commercial chemical &#x2013; for commodity chemicals. We are working to reduce our exposure to loss making commodity chemical while at the same time strike international alliances to strengthen our position in more profitable niches.</p>
          <p>Overall, 2012 was a strong year for our company with robust results in E&amp;P and good progress on the restructuring of our downstream businesses. As a result, the board of directors intend to submit a proposal to the AGM for a full year 2012 dividend of &#x20AC;1.08 per share.</p>
          <p>And now over to Massimo for a more detailed look at our numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the market environment was mixed. The average Brent price was &#x20AC;110, slightly up versus last quarter and year-on-year. The refining margin in the Mediterranean area remained volatile and the Brent overall margin dropped down from the high level seen in the third quarter to around $2.80 per barrel, 10% lower than the same quarter last year. Despite the improving trend of the euro against U.S. dollar comparing fourth quarter 2012 with fourth quarter 2011, the U.S. dollar has appreciated 3.8% versus euro.</p>
          <p>Before we turn to our results, you should note that following the sale of the 30% of Snam to Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, which occurred last October, from the fourth quarter, Snam is completely deconsolidated while a portion of it, the so-called continuing operation contribution under IFRS number 5, was present in the fourth quarter 2011, as you may remember, until third quarter 2012, continuing operations including the result of Snam transaction with Eni.</p>
          <p>This change in <mark type="ph" /> perimeter (07:28) affects our year-on-year comparisons. In term of adjusted operating profit, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we reported a 17% increase to &#x20AC;4.96 billion. Excluding Snam from fourth quarter 2011, Eni would have reported an increase of approximately 30% in adjusted operating profit. The result reflect a robust operating performance in Exploration &amp; Production division, up 15.4%, also due to the ongoing production recovery in Libya.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power reported a profit reversing the prior year loss driven by the marketing activity which benefited from the renegotiation of certain supply contract and the ongoing recovery of the Libyan supplies.</p>
          <p>Refining &amp; Marketing reported a substantial reduction in operating losses driven by efficiency and optimization gains.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the adjusted net profit from continued operation, in fourth quarter, it was &#x20AC;1.52 billion, a 3.6% decline year-on-year. Adjusted for the Snam deconsolidation, this metric would have shown a 9% gain year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter net profit was also impacted by higher than average adjusted tax rate of 67.3%, affected by a write-down of the surplus asset accrued as adjusted profit in the previous quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Excluding this effect, the fourth quarter tax rate would have been 62.5%, still higher than the 56.4% recorded in the corresponding period 2011, due to the higher E&amp;P tax rate and the lower result from associates.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to give you some highlights for each business. First, E&amp;P: in the fourth quarter of 2012, reported liquids and gas production was 1,747,000 boe per day. This figure is calculated assuming the new Eni conversion rate of gas to barrel equivalent which was also used in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Performance was sustained by a recovery of the activity in Libya, the startup and ramp-up of fields particularly in Russia and higher production in Iraq. These positive factors were partially offset by the shutdown of Elgin-Franklin fleet in the U.K., force majeure event in Nigeria, and much European decline. The stronger production led to higher E&amp;P EBIT which was up 15.4% to 4.87 &#x2013; &#x20AC;4.86 billion.</p>
          <p>And now Gas &amp; Power. In the fourth quarter of 2012, despite the contraction in European demand, Eni's gas sales of 24.4 billion cubic meter were in line with the fourth quarter 2011 excluding the impact of the Galp disposal. Eni's sales in Italy increased by 9.1% from the fourth quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>The positive performance was driven by increased sale observed in Italian spot exchanges to wholesalers and industrial customer following the positive effect of commercial initiatives. These increases were partially offset by lower sale to the power generation sector, reflecting the ongoing economic downturn, while sales to residential customer were stable.</p>
          <p>The increase in the sales in Italy was offset by the fall in European markets, which on a comparable basis were down 8%. This decline is mainly attributable to the U.K. and Northern Europe due to the unavailability of gas, a result of the accident which occurred at Elgin-Franklin and the Iberian Peninsula market, which was down 9%. In terms of economic result, in the fourth quarter 2012, the Gas &amp; Power division reported an adjusted profit of &#x20AC;41 million reversing the loss of &#x20AC;72 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This performance was driven by the marketing activity, which benefited from the renegotiations of certain supply contract and the ongoing recovery of Libyan supplies. These positives were partially offset by lower sale prices due to the current demand downturn in gas and electricity and strong competitive pressures.</p>
          <p>The international transport result that generated a result of &#x20AC;75 million was broadly in line with the same period 2011. As you may recall, a number of our Gas &amp; Power activities among which Union Fenosa Gas and Galp are not consolidated in EBITDA. Income from these associates in the fourth quarter are accounting for &#x20AC;23 million versus &#x20AC;93 million last year impacted by the European recession and lower income from Galp following the sale.</p>
          <p>As for R&amp;M, in the fourth quarter 2012, it recorded an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;9 million with a significant improvement for the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting the efficiency gains and optimization measures, lower throughputs at less competitive plants and better marketing performance due to additional sales to the Italian wholesale sector as a consequence of the shutdown of certain competitor refineries. These positives have to mitigate continuing margin weakness and volatility.</p>
          <p>Finally, the other businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Chemical division reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;117 million. The improved performance versus last year was mainly due to slightly better margin at cracking plants, which benefited from lower supply cost of oil-based feedstock and efficiency measures. Engineering &amp; Construction segment reported a lower adjusted operating profit which was down by 18.7% in the fourth of 2012 to &#x20AC;317 million. Other activities was in line with the previous year while corporate shows a loss of &#x20AC;83 million compared to &#x20AC;19 million last year, as a consequence of lower contribution from Eni Insurance, the group insurance <mark type="ph" /> captive (14:17) company related to the increase in claims settled.</p>
          <p>In line with our new structure, we are strengthening our net debt position which as of December 31, 2012 amounted to &#x20AC;15.4 billion, a reduction of &#x20AC;12.6 billion from December 2011. Net cash generated by operating activities was &#x20AC;12.4 billion in the year. It was impacted by deterioration of working capital of &#x20AC;3.4 billion, due mainly to the Engineering &amp; Construction business and Gas &amp; Power, with Gas &amp; Power payment has been delayed from client and take-or-pay prepayment to suppliers and the general deterioration in European economic environment.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure amounted to &#x20AC;12.8 billion, mainly related to the continuing development of oil and gas reserve and the upgrading of Saipem's offshore vessels and drilling units. Financial investment amounted to &#x20AC;0.57 billion. Dividend payments to Eni and minority shareholders were &#x20AC;4.4 billion. Our balance sheet transformation was driven by the streamlining on our corporate structure. Asset disposals mainly related to the sale of 35% to Snam, 9% of Galp and upstream assets including 10% stake in Karachaganak, generated proceeds of &#x20AC;6.6 billion and consolidated &#x20AC;12.4 billion of debt. This stronger balance sheet position has been accompanied by an improvement of our cash and cash equivalent position from &#x20AC;1.5 billion year end 2011 to &#x20AC;7.8 billion at year end 2012.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. Now, I will hand you over to Paolo for his final remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Massimo. Looking forward to 2013, in E&amp;P, we will grow production by over 3% as our planned scenario $90 a barrel driven by key startups such as Kashagan, Angola LNG and the Algerian projects. We will also continue our focus on exploration and target over 1 billion boe of new resources. In Gas &amp; Power, we expect results to be lower than those reported in 2012 owing to significant competitive pressure, especially on the oversupplied Italian market.</p>
          <p>We will contain the impacts of the market deterioration by accelerating our renegotiation effort with all our major suppliers. In R&amp;M, we expect results to be better than those reported in 2012 as cost efficiencies and a stronger retail performance will more than offset the expected deterioration in the refining environment and weak product demand.</p>
          <p>CapEx will remain broadly in line with 2012 and would be mainly focused on the development of our new major projects, which will continue to fuel Eni's growth in the future, a theme which we'll discuss further in our strategy presentation next month.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. Massimo and I, together with other key manager from the business unit will now be pleased to take up your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&amp;A session is now open. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The question comes from Mr. Theepan Jothilingam from Nomura. Mr. Jothilingam, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two areas, please, I would like to make my questions on. Firstly, just on Kashagan, could you talk about the exact milestones that you now need to reach First Oil and then the speedup, the speed of the ramp-up to the threshold for commercial production and if there is a number that you may give that you've assumed in terms of the contribution from Kashagan for 2013?</p>
          <p>My second question comes on to Algeria and the recent news flow around Saipem, I wanted know, has Eni executed its own internal investigations on activities and relationships in Algeria and then has the company taken any further steps there? And are you comfortable with your corporate governance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Claudio will answer the first question on Kashagan. I will answer yours on Algeria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Kashagan, so we have three mine &#x2013; main milestones. The first one is unsure, we have to finalize the completion by March. And then we start testing with the gas &#x2013; through the gas and diesel. And we have finalized the completion &#x2013; mechanical completion of onshore and we have to start &#x2013; we have finalized the completion onshore for the second train by March &#x2013; April, so that are the main milestones. In term of production, we budgeted about a contribution, our equity about 19,000 barrel per days for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And now on Algeria. First of all, thank you for your question. Before going into the details of it, perhaps it would be useful to set out my thinking on the whole subject. First of all, Eni's policy is nothing illegal is ever acceptable. It is perfectly possible to do business anywhere in the world without paying bribes. And if it wasn't, we wouldn't do business there. That needs to be crystal clear.</p>
          <p>Second, to ensure that our actions are compliant with our policy, since I joined Eni in 2005, I've ensured that no contracts with intermediaries were entered into. In addition, we have introduced strict anti-bribery processes and procedures, which are recognized as some of the best in the world. Bribes are not only illegal; they would also damage our business. Our reputation has always been one of the major drivers of our growth. The goodwill this creates has made Eni one of the major companies in our sector.</p>
          <p>Now, specifically with regards to Saipem, which is an independent listed company, neither Eni nor I have any involvement whatsoever with alleged practices under investigation. Indeed, when we found out about the allegations at the end of 2012 in line with our role as major shareholders, we made our concerns known to the board of Saipem, suggesting they take all appropriate measures including possible management changes in order to rectify the issue. This step indicates our zero tolerance approach on the subject. While any wrongdoing will need to be evaluated by the Italian magistrates, we felt our concern was justified by the red flags which the investigation raised on Saipem's processes. More specifically on your question, we commenced our own internal audit with a view to act in a completely transparent method.</p>
          <p>And as far as our procedures are concerned, particularly our anticorruption procedure, we believe that we are at the top of the best practices in the world as far as Eni is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Hootan Yazhari from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mr. Yazhari, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen, and good afternoon. I just really wanted to focus around the gas renegotiations, which you say are underway. Maybe you can give us some color on how receptive your gas suppliers are to renegotiations, whether they're going to be applied retroactively like we saw last year. And we obviously had a very good first quarter result in 2012, and whether we could potentially expect similar sorts of effects coming through from renegotiations there.</p>
          <p>And the second thing, I just wanted to move on to Mozambique and just get some &#x2013; just get an update in terms of how the asset negotiations are going there with your partners and whether you're looking to farm down. And indeed, has there been any progress on farming down your 70% stake? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. On the first question, I would ask Marco Alver&#xE0; to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo. Good afternoon. I would like to say without going into the specifics of each contract, that if on the one hand, the increasing liquidity at the hubs is putting severe pressure on our commercial margins, on the other hand, this increased liquidity is giving us some benefit in the negotiations as the suppliers are now finally coming to terms with the fact that liquid markets and hub markets are to be reckoned with and have to be taken into account into the contracts. We're in an unprecedented phase where we have effectively all our major contracts open; that's about 80% of volumes. We expect to close most of these in 2013. The timing of the closing of these is not predictable because it's a lengthy negotiation so we expect some volatility in the quarters as when we close we also have retroactive impacts on the accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good, Marco and with regards to Mozambique, this has been an exceptional success for Eni. We have now 75 tcf of gas in place and an agreement with Anadarko that basically means we can go ahead with a development at full tilt while fine-tuning unitization agreement. Now, we are very happy to be sitting on 70% <mark type="ph" /> of (25:46) 75 tcf and are progressing towards FID by 2014. However, if we were to receive an offer of a strategic alliance which adds value to the project, we would, of course, consider it and inform the market upon its signing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wonderful. Thank you. Just a follow-up on that. How comfortable are you going to FID on the Mozambique project without having announced major off-take agreements for gas just as yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Claudio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the answer is that we don't get here any FID without any contractual option on the off-take, so that is one of the conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Thanks. Afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions, if I may. First one is on your guidance. You've guided to a no change in gearing in 2013 versus 2012 under $90 oil price scenario after factoring in portfolio management. My question is what extent of portfolio management have you factored in? For example, does it include any further stake sale in Galp? And the second one on dividend, what is your thinking on both the dividend policy and payout in 2013? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Okay. Massimo will answer the first question and I will answer the second one.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As you can imagine, we are unwilling to disclose our assumption as far as the disposal are concerned. So I understand your point, and I'll try to give you a different guidance, if I may. So if &#x2013; I would say if we imagine the current scenario, I mean Brent price around $110, and we assume still a negative and deteriorating environment in Gas &amp; Power and downstream and euro versus dollar exchange rate around 1.3, I would say that the &#x2013; in leverage, it should be just slightly higher than what we experienced in &#x2013; at the end of 2012.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as dividend is concerned, you took note that our final dividend for 2012 is up 3.8% year-on-year. As for next year, and in general for our future shareholder remuneration policy, we will give you further detail at our strategy presentation in March.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. First, just on the upstream earnings in the fourth quarter, which looked very strong, can you just talk about if there's anything there on the cost side or talk about cost in the 4Q relative to the last couple of quarters? And also when you have a force majeure in Nigeria, does that mean you don't pay royalties? And therefore, was there royalties not being paid in terms of fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just on Libya, you mentioned there's still a bit of a shortfall versus previous production levels. Do you expect to get back to those levels? And if so, over what time period? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The three questions. So cost, in 2012, we have been quite good on cost because we reduced our operating cost and we are in a range of $6.70 per barrel which is one of the best in the industry, and that is also all the reason of our best result. So cost is quite good and that could be also true in &#x2013; looking forward.</p>
          <p>For Nigeria, when we don't produce, we don't pay royalties. So the royalties is linked to production.</p>
          <p>And for Libya, as you said, we are &#x2013; our performance in 2012 has been quite good. The average is 255,000 barrel per day, and that also was our target. We think that we can recover full production by 2014 or, it's better to say, in 2014. So in 2013, we continue progressively increasing and updating our project and our maintenance.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I had three questions, please. Firstly, in 2012, did you have some take-or-pay obligation? And if so, could you give us the cost and the volume? Secondly, you point to 2013 production growth at $90 oil of over 3%. Can you just remind us of your oil price sensitivity in terms of the PSC effect? So what would it be at the current prices? And thirdly, in 2012, you had a &#x20AC;4 billion asset impairment, of which &#x20AC;2.8 billion in Q4, it's a substantial amount. Can you just remind us of what it's made up of? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A quick answer to your first question. We had a take-or-pay of &#x20AC;500 million in 2012. On the second question, Claudio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, at the to-date production, the growth should be 2% instead of 3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Irene, Massimo speaking. As far as the impairment, the total impaired costs are &#x20AC;2.9 billion in the fourth quarter 2012. So some color, around &#x20AC;500 million relate to the E&amp;P assets, some asset in U.S. and in Middle East. All this write-down relate to, I would say, industrial reasons. The majority of the total write-down relate to Gas &amp; Power. The total amount is around &#x20AC;1.6 billion and relate to the write-down of the Distrigas goodwill. For your information, the remaining goodwill at year-end is around &#x20AC;400 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the remaining part relate to the Refining &amp; Marketing, the write-down amount to &#x20AC;600 million &#x2013; around &#x20AC;600 million and relate to some refinery plays we have in Italy.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon everyone. Can I just ask for a bit of disclosure around the reserve replacement figures for 2012, what are the big moving parts in the billion barrels that you've added?</p>

          <p>So the replacements of this year, the &#x2013; one of the main contributors in term of countries in the replacement of 2012 are Venezuela, Nigeria, Algeria, Congo and Libya. That are the main &#x2013; and Russia, yes, Russia <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:19). That are the main contributors coming from the project that we sanctioned in 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, Mozambique. We can't put as a P1, a non-development P1 when we get the FID in 2014.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With Kashagan we have nothing this year because we already booked because we took the FID. Then we will &#x2013; during the production, after the production, we can book something following the start-up of the different wells. But this year, there is no Kashagan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions, please. First of all on Kashagan, just wondered if you can give us any sense of whether there's going to be a significant working capital build prior to that project starting commercial production? And on that point, perhaps you can give us some sense of when you expect to book first revenues? Also on Kashagan, perhaps you can give us a sense of what you see the exit rate at the end of 2013, please?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Refining &amp; Marketing. A very strong result in the fourth quarter despite indicator margins and throughputs essentially flat year-over-year. Perhaps you could quantify for us a year-over-year contribution from efficiency gains in operational improvement and maybe give us some sense of what the expected benefit from those factors is going to be in 2013? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Claudio will answer the first one &#x2013; no, maybe Massimo will answer the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one about the working capital within Kashagan, I don't have any significant value <mark type="ph" /> add light (36:17) in this respect. So there will be no &#x2013; any significant amount capitalized as far as Kashagan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; and &#x2013; by the end &#x2013; answer to your question about production is, by the end of 2013 or early 2014, we are &#x2013; we aim to reach about 200,000 barrel per day and then this will grow, going up to 370,000 barrels per day during the 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as far as the Refining &amp; Marketing margin is concerned, obviously, the shape of the result we've got quarter-by-quarter in 2012 is related to the trend of the margin. So by definition, we benefited from the spike we had in the third quarter. And then as far as the internal effects are concerned, what I could add is that we gained something like &#x20AC;100 million in term of efficiency. So reduction in fixed cost during the 2012 and we also benefited from the partial closure of some site we have in Italy that are the one, for example, Venice, that now is under a transforming process to a bio-refinery and some other sites, among which Gela, that has been partially stopped and this result in a total benefit for our margin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I'd like to ask two questions, if I may. The first one is on E&amp;P. We've seen a big improvement in the realizations for both oil and gas in Q4 versus Q3. I was wondering what the key drivers are there?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is regarding buybacks. You approved a program with your board. I was wondering under which scenario of oil price or further disposals you would start to use that to avoid going into an inefficient balance sheet? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the first question, we &#x2013; the good increase comes from mainly Libya, but good production <mark type="ph" /> in Karachaganak (38:56) in the last quarter, then the U.S., Italy and Iraq that we had some good increase. That are the main contributors in &#x2013; and Ecuador, sorry. That are the four main contributors in the last quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Now as far as the buyback program is concerned, you are aware that at the last AGM, we acquired the authorization of buying back up to 10% of our shares.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. I've got two clarifications, and then one broader point. On the guidance you've given for 2013 on production, can you explain what your adjustment is if you've done any for Elgin-Franklin? So is this an underlying number? And can you just &#x2013; are you able to lay your hands on the number of what Elgin-Franklin did contribute to your production in 2012? And also on your Gas &amp; Power guidance, going back to the comments right at the start of the call on the Q&amp;As, does the guidance that you're providing take into account any expectation on the retroactive adjustments that you mentioned?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, that was a double-part first question, the second question is around Saipem. And I know, Mr. Scaroni, you made some comments, I'm not sure how official they were or not, a couple of days ago about Saipem. But it does raise the question, a point that you've made before of having equity ownership and no control, if the sort of arm's length investment that you have runs the risk of damaging both Eni and your personal reputations. And I just wonder whether you were prepared to just to expand a little bit about that in the aftermath of what's taken place? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very, very, good. Claudio on the first one, I will answer the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first on Elgin-Franklin, our hypothesis was to have a start-up in March, and that has been confirmed by the operator, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:40), and by &#x2013; also by the authority in the U.K. And so that is, we will start, as you know, with four wells, two plus two. And then during the year, if all the technical issue will be fixed, we can add additional two wells. That is the program. In the year 20 &#x2013; for further years, we have a &#x2013; so for the three months, we have a loss of 88,000 barrels. In 2012, Elgin-Franklin for us was a loss of 20,000 barrels per day. That was the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the guidance on Gas &amp; Power for 2013, let me try to give you some insight into the various moving parts. First, when looking at year-on-year comparisons, you should remember that 2012 included a number of extraordinary positive and negative impacts from supply and sales contract negotiations. While we do not disclose the individual numbers, you should bear in mind, and we said it before, that on a underlying basis, Gas &amp; Power was not profitable in 2012 as our supply does not yet reflect the deteriorated market conditions. Now, how this situation will evolve in 2013? It's a kind of a complex answer to give you, but it requires several elements.</p>
          <p>Now, first of all, gas and electricity demand will continue to be weak in our hypothesis. On the back of an extremely weak 2012, we're expecting only very limited improvement in Europe and none in Italy. Now, the negative market context coupled with a significant take-or-pay pressures, accumulated not only by us but by all major operators mean we expect competition to increase further especially on the Italian market.</p>
          <p>Already, we've seen the Italian hub price, which we call PSV, trading below European hub prices, a trend which has impacted the 2012-2013 commercial campaign significantly. Now, given the increased pricing pressure, absent any changes to supply costs, we will see Gas &amp; Power results well below those achieved in 2012 on an underlying basis. So the question become, what will happen to supply cost in 2013?</p>
          <p>Now, on the assumption that we will close all the negotiation in 2013 and including the retroactive benefit of the negotiation we are working on, we expect to limit the impact of the market deterioration. In that case, 2013 would look similar to the underlying 2012. I don't know if I gave you an answer, but it's a kind of complex guidance to give you in such a complex market.</p>
          <p>Now, on Saipem, your question is, in fact, does &#x2013; what has happened change our view on what is an appropriate shareholding in Saipem. Now, let me first point out something, which has gone somewhat forgotten, that despite the recent share price fall, Saipem has been extremely good investment for Eni. Investors who bought the shares at the listing &#x2013; listing in 1999 have made their money 18 times over between the reinvested dividend and share price appreciation. And the total shareholder return in the last 10 years has been 300%. This, using as number &#x2013; the today numbers, not the numbers of two months ago. As I have said, reviewing our longstanding relation with Saipem is not a priority at this time.</p>
          <p>However, just to give you some insight into our thinking. As we have shown in 2012, we have a pragmatic view of our corporate structure and while our North Star is shareholder value creation, today &#x2013; to date, our view has been that on balance disposing of any stake in Saipem would not be in the interest of our shareholders. That's because we judged that the synergy between the two businesses on top of Saipem's extremely strong prospect, were worth the complexity of consolidating and guaranteeing the liabilities of a company we don't control and can't control by law, and because we did it, if we did it, we would damage its business model.</p>
          <p>Now, we periodically review the advantages and disadvantages of our corporate structure and our judgment of the best way to create value for our investors may change over time and what has happened recently might contribute to it.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Just two questions, if I could. Firstly, if I could ask the, I guess, the usual question on Galp. I believe we're approaching the end of the lockup period on the 28th of February. And I was wondering if you could offer any thoughts or comments on how you see the remaining stake.</p>
          <p>And my second question, I guess, is on Chemicals. I think last year, you guided to a &#x20AC;400 million EBIT improvement by 2015 but you actually made a record loss in 2012. So do you still believe that you're on track to achieve that target? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, but I cannot give you clearly any guidance as far as Galp is concerned. So what we can confirm is that our idea is not to keep this position for a longer period, but again, not able to give any clear guidance about when and how we will go on disposing these shares.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, about Chemicals. 2012 was the year when we started to engineer. We announced that the new strategy at the beginning of 2012. We changed the name. We started to engineer, then intervention on the structural reforms we had to do in our industrial system. And we are going to apply those starting from August to this year. So the full effect on what we have under control will start to happen from August onwards. This means that restructuring of the poor performing side, change of our portfolio. So alongside the engineering of that during 2012, we have strike a few deals to reposition ourselves internationally in most growing market and interesting markets for the Chemical business. It has been an unprecedented combination of scenario for us in terms of raw material price and commodity price of our chemicals, which made us to make an unprecedented loss. But we are confident that this will come under our control during 2013.</p>

          <p>Yes. I would say, yes. We expect also &#x2013; we included in this guidance some positives.</p>

          <p>No, no, we are in the middle of a negation and of course, in the middle of several negotiations and I &#x2013; it would not be appropriate to give you more details now.</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Just a short question. I'm sorry if you did mention it earlier, but I joined the call late. Just on tax guidance for this year, obviously, surprisingly strong tax charge in the fourth quarter with the hit of &#x20AC;230 million. But if you guide for what 2013 tax should be and how we should think about tax with a rising upstream contribution that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the guidance I can give you as far as 2013 is concerned is that a slightly higher tax rate than the taxes we experienced in 2012, due to the fact that as &#x2013; I would say is clear after this discussion we had &#x2013; had the contribution of the Italian businesses will be poor in 2013. This was an increase in the contribution from the E&amp;P businesses abroad that you know suffer higher tax rate, and so that's the reason why the guidance would be slightly higher.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you. Well, perhaps, as there is no more questions, we can wrap this up. If you do happen to have any more, you can get in touch with us at the Investor Relations number. Thank you very much.</p>
