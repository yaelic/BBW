        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our solid top and bottom line growth for the quarter demonstrated our company's ability to adapt our operations to changing market conditions. Our acquisitions, our successful rollout of new beverage categories and the price increases that we implemented across Latin America during 2008, extended our company's track record of growth.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, our consolidated revenues reached MXN22.5 billion, up more than 30% from the first quarter of 2008. Organic growth, mainly driven by pricing, accounted for approximately 40% of our incremental revenues, the consolidation of REMIL in Brazil contributed more than 25% of our incremental revenues and the effect of a positive exchange rate translation provided the balance.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated sales volume rose more than 7% year-over-year. Excluding REMIL, our consolidated sales volume increased close to 2% during the quarter, mainly driven by growth from our still beverage portfolio in Mexico and Columbia, and our water business, including jug water.</p>
          <p>Our gross profits increased more than 26% in the first quarter of 2009. Higher revenues partially compensated for higher costs of goods sold, which resulted from the effect of the devaluation of local currencies as applied to our U.S. dollar denominated raw material cost and higher year-over-year sweetener costs in our operations. Our gross margin declined 150 basis points during the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Consolidated operating income improved more than 17% to MXN3.3 billion in the first quarter. Revenue growth compensated for normalized marketing expenses and higher labor costs, mainly in Venezuela and Argentina. A positive currency translation effect provided almost 40% of our incremental operating income. Our consolidated operating margin declined 160 basis points year-over-year to 14.7% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated EBITDA rose close to 20% to MXN4.3 billion in the first quarter. During the first quarter, our majority net income decreased 18% to MXN1.3 billion. This decrease was mainly due to the impact of the devaluation of the Mexican peso as applied to our U.S. dollar denominated net debt during the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let me expand on our operations. Our Mexico division delivered more than 3% volume growth for the quarter. The Jugos del Valle line of beverages and our water business, including the integration of our Los Angeles jug water operation in the Valley of Mexico compensated for lower volumes of sparkling beverages.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter of 2009, our sales volume of sparkling beverages in Mexico declined 3.6%, mainly driven by a high single-digit decline in flavored sparkling beverages. Our water business grew more than 11% during the quarter, driven by volume growth in our single serve water portfolio and the integration of our Los Angeles jug water business.</p>
          <p>In the still beverage category, the Jugos del Valle beverage portfolio continued to expand its pace of growth. Last year we started to distribute this product in our Mexico division, selling approximately 3 million unit cases during the first quarter. One year later, thanks to our innovation and our experience with new categories, we served our consumers more than 12 million unit cases of juice-based beverages for the quarter. Still beverages, including personal water, and categories such as isotonics, energy drinks, orangeades, and juices and nectars have played a key role in our portfolio growth over the past year, reaching more than 10% of our total portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our average price per unit case increased 1.6% during the quarter. This increase was mainly driven by the average price increase implemented last year in our Coca-Cola portfolio, combined with higher average prices per unit case of the Jugos del Valle of beverages. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes of sparkling beverages and higher volumes of jug water and Valle Frut, our orangeade, which carries a lower average price per unit case.</p>
          <p>Our Mexican operations total revenues increased 4.8%. Incremental volumes accounted for the majority of our total incremental revenues. On the profitability front, higher cost of goods sold was mainly driven by the devaluation of the Mexican pesos applied to our dollar eliminated raw material costs, and was partially compensated by lower year-over-year resin prices. Our gross profit reached MXN4.1 billion, growing 3% as compared to the first quarter of 2008, and our gross margin in Mexico decreased 90 basis points.</p>
          <p>Operating income grew close to 1%, reaching MXN1.3 billion. Higher revenues compensated for normalized marketing expenses, the addition of a specialized sales force for Jugos del Valle products, and the integration of the Agua de Los Angeles jug water business in the Valley of Mexico. Our operating margin declined 60 basis points to 16.4%. Our EBITDA remained almost flat compared to the same quarter of last year, reaching MXN1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The economy in Mexico continued to experience a slowdown with lower industrial activity. Nonetheless, despite this environment, our Mexican business managed to produce positive results. Our new avenues of growth, combined with our brand portfolio approach, allow us to offer an array of value alternatives for our consumers. We will continue to leverage our large returnable base and deep understanding of retail dynamics, our intense execution at the point-of-sale and our effective deployment of marketing resources.</p>
          <p>As you may know, case of swine flu has been recently reported in Mexico, mainly in the Valley of Mexico. Last weekend, this disease came to the attention of government authorities and the private sector, who are implementing several measures, such as the interruption of school for several days and the avoidance of large congregation of people to minimize the spread of the virus, including the closing of bars and restaurants in Mexico City for one week.</p>
          <p>As of April 24, our Mexican operations volumes were off to a very good start for the second quarter. Innovation in our still beverage category along with very good weather in our Mexican territories has driven solid volume growth for the month. Our volumes in the Valley of Mexico represent approximately 35% of our Mexico's division volume, or close to 18% of our consolidated volumes. We expect this event will affect some of our volumes in the on-premise channel, as we have senn recently, given the deceleration of the economy.</p>
          <p>This volume decline is being partially compensated by volumes sold through supermarkets and the traditional channel for home consumption. We are still assessing the impact of this event, while reinforcing our marketing strategies to ensure the availability of our high quality portfolio beverage in every channel.</p>
          <p>Our Latincentro division recorded close to 2% volume growth. This increase was mainly driven by brand Coca-Cola in Venezuela and still beverages in Columbia. We successfully rolled out the Jugos del Valle line of beverages in this country, reaching more than 3 million unit cases during this quarter.</p>
          <p>In Central America, we recorded a sales volume decline of 6%. Central America relies importantly on remittances from the U.S. and tourism, all of which have experienced a substantial slowdown given the current economic condition.</p>
          <p>Our Latincentro division's total revenues grew more than 50% year-over-year, reaching MXN8 billion. Organic growth, mainly driven by price increases implemented last year, accounted for more than 40% of our incremental revenues, and a positive currency translation represented the balance.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, our gross profit increased more than 50% to MXN3.7 billion in the division. Higher cost of goods sold was driven by the devaluation of local currencies as applied to our dollar-denominated packaging costs and higher cost of sweeteners across the division, which was partially compensated by lower cost of resin. Gross margin remained almost flat at 45.6% as compared with the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our operating income grew 32% to MXN1 billion. Operating leverage achieved by higher revenues, compensated for higher labor cost in Venezuela. A positive currency translation effect accounted for more than 70% of our incremental operating income. Our operating margin declined 180 basis points to 13% as compared with the first quarter of 2008. Our EBITDA grew close to 40% to MXN1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter we expanded our sparkling beverage portfolio in Latincentro. At the end of March, we launched Coca-Cola Zero in Venezuela to complement our portfolio in the country. Coca-Cola Zero has played an important role in our sparkling beverage portfolio over the last three years, allowing us to develop our three-tier cola strategies. Also through our Jugos del Valle joint venture with the Coca-Cola Company, we will continue to analyze the introduction of new juice beverage alternatives to satisfy our consumers' changing taste and to complement our existing product offerings in that category.</p>
          <p>In the following months, we expect to finalize the installation of our new production line for juices in Bogota in Columbia. This incremental capacity will improve our go-to-market capabilities of non-carbonated products in Colombia. Now let's talk about our Mercosur division.</p>
          <p>Our Mercosur division net revenues grew 53% to MXN6.2 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding beer, which accounted for MXN608 million, we increased net revenues 50% to MXN5.6 billion. REMIL accounted for more than 60% of this growth. Organic growth driven by higher average prices per unit case represented close to 30% and a positive currency translation effect provided the balance.</p>
          <p>Volume growth in our Mercosur division was up almost 21% in the first quarter of 2009. Sales volume excluding REMIL and beer declined 1.5%, driven by flat volumes in Brazil and a volume decline in Argentina. In Brazil, sparkling beverages declined 1%, mainly due to bad weather in the month of January and a 3% weighted average price increase implemented at the beginning of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Growth in the still beverage category, mainly driven by a revolutionary isotonic product, Inove, offset the volume decline in sparkling beverages. In Argentina, our sales volume declined 4%, mainly driven by sparkling beverages. This decline was partially compensated by more than 75% growth in the still beverage category resulting from the successful performance of Aquarius, our flavored water brand.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, our Mercosur division gross profit increased more than 44% to MXN2.7 billion. Cost of goods sold increased as a result of the integration of REMIL in Brazil, the important devaluation of local currencies as applied to our U.S. dollar denominated raw material costs and higher sweetener costs in the division. Our gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 42.5% in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our operating income grew close to 32% to reach more than MXN900 million. Operating leverage achieved through higher revenues more than compensated for higher labor and freight costs in Argentina. A positive currency translation effect accounted approximately 10% of incremental operating income. Our operating margin was 14.6% in the first quarter of 2009, a decline of 240 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA grew more than 36% to MXN1.1 billion. During the first quarter, we started to distribute our Jugos del Valle line of products in the S&#xE3;o Paulo region. We expect to increase this product coverage in our regional territories over the coming months. We will continue to evaluate new product launches of juice-based beverages to expand our product portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk about our financial performance for the quarter. In the first months of the year, the global economy continued to experience a slowdown that was also felt in Latin America. However, our industry and our portfolio have shown resilience to this crisis. Our company has been able to successfully weather so far this slowdown based on our ability to implement revenue management initiatives across our territories. The acquisitions that we have made and the strong pipeline of innovation that we have developed.</p>
          <p>We are continuously reviewing the performance of our business to protect our cash flow. As of March 31, 2009, we had a cash balance of MXN9.8 billion, an increase of MXN3.6 billion compared with year-end 2008. This increase net of $46 million we paid to finance our share of Brisa water business acquisition mainly came from cash generated in the quarter and the proceeds of the bond issuance we did in the month of January of 2009 for an amount of MXN2 billion.</p>
          <p>Our total debt increased MXN2.4 billion compared with year-end 2008, mainly driven by the previously mentioned bond offer. As a result of these factors, our net debt decreased MXN1.2 billion during the quarter. As of March 31, 2009 our short-term bank debt was MXN8.2 billion and our long-term debt was MXN12.8 billion.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned on our last conference call, we have maturity for the equivalent of approximately $400 million coming due in July of 2009. On this debt, approximately 70% is dollar dominated. The majority of our remaining debt matures from 2012 onward.</p>
          <p>As of April 28, we had the equivalent of US$687 million in our cash balance. Over 435 million of this balance is already denominated in U.S. dollars, representing close to 70% of our cash position. These funds are sufficient to meet our maturities coming due in July of this year, as well as other operating needs.</p>
          <p>On April 13, we paid dividends in the amount of MXN1.3 billion, highlighting the strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow generation. As of March 31, 2009 our net debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio was 0.6, underscoring our solid financial position. Our net debt as of March 31, 2009 is MXN11.2 billion, the equivalent of approximately $780 million. Our liability structure is comprised of a balance mix of currencies. Approximately 43% of our debt is dollar denominated, and the remainder is comprised of local currency denominated debt, mainly Mexican pesos.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, 2009 approximately 49% of our debt had a fixed interest rate. The effect of foreign exchange fluctuation between the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar as applied to our dollar denominated debt is reflected in two lines on our consolidated income statement. On our debt that was contracted in dollars, the effect shows on the foreign exchange loss line. On our debt that was contracted in pesos and swapped to dollars, the effect shows on the fair value loss on derivative instrument line. The combined amount of these two lines on our income statement is approximately MXN460 million.</p>
          <p>As we announced at the end of February 2009, Coca-Cola FEMSA and the Coca-Cola Company closed a joint acquisition of Brisa bottled water business from Bavaria, a subsidiary of SABMiller. This transaction will complement our growth portfolio allowing us to develop and offer our consumers a multi-brand water <mark type="inaudible" /> in Columbia. As part of this transaction, we agree to a transition period in order to consolidate this operation into our Columbian business. We expect to start direct sales and distribution activities of Brisa at the beginning of June of this year.</p>
          <p>This first quarter of 2009 was another good quarter for our company. Our performance is not driven by random events, but by the strength of our brands and the intense execution capabilities of our operators. This year market conditions present us with the opportunity to reinforce our product portfolio with new beverage offerings. We have introduced extremely novelty products across Latin America over the past couple of years, and especially during last year in the still beverage categories through the joint venture we have with our partner, the Coca-Cola Company. We will continue to measure the pulse of our market conditions and adapt our business as necessary to protect our cash flow generation and continue on our path for growth.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your continued trust and support. And now I would like to open the call for any questions that you might have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Ford with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everybody. My one question, H&#xE9;ctor, is for you to expand on the CSD business in Mexico, if you could. And just let us &#x2013; if you can remind us what the percentage of total flavors is of sparkling. You &#x2013; typically in your press releases you've mentioned that Coca-Cola continues to grow, so brand &#x2013; if you could comment on brand Coke. And then any impact that you may have had from Easter in the comp, as well as any impact you would've had from the upscaling initiative in flavors as well please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bob. Let me talk to you some of the main trends that we are seeing in the industry in Mexico. As you correctly pointed out, usually we'd see &#x2013; we'll notice increases in brand Coca-Cola quarter-over-quarter. This first quarter of 2009 we have seen small reductions in brand Coca-Cola, a trend where we are seeing reductions in single-serve presentations and some increases in multi-serve presentations, specifically about brand Coca-Cola. But the total portfolio of colas show a small reduction during this quarter.</p>
          <p>The main impact of this is that, if you remember, we have been increasing prices importantly in some of these products, especially at the end of last year. For example, our 600 ml going from seven to 7.50 and some price increases also in the large format presentations. But in general the trend is small reduction in colas, a substantially higher number in single-serve colas and an increase in multi-serve colas. For the total portfolio, colas in unit cases coming down slight.</p>
          <p>Now when you look at flavors, we did an upscale in flavors with no price movement. So in other words, we moved from two liters to 2.5 liters maintaining the same price. And in spite of that, we saw a high single-digit reduction in flavors. The main impact or the main reflections here is that because of the introduction of some of the juice-based products on the Jugos del Valle line of this business, especially this product Valle Frut, or what we call this orangeade, where we're seeing tremendous growth, we believe that the main reason for flavors reduction has to do with the large increase on Valle Frut.</p>
          <p>So just to give you an idea. Valle Frut right now is selling on one month close to two to three million unit cases. That's more than what Coca-Cola Zero sells in a quarter in Mexico. So the success of that brand has been very large and obviously had an impact on the consumption of some of our flavored sparkling products. I think that these trends within the company are good for us. You need to remember that some of our competitors are moving to this kind of products also, this orangeade or products with low content of juice. But at the end of the day, it's a trend that we need to focus on and to pay attention to that trend. So I would say those are the main trends in Mexico with respect to CSDs and some of the still beverage categories. And that's basically what &#x2013; I think that will answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Could you just touch on that cola/flavor mix as a percentage of all sparkling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bob, this is Alfredo Fern&#xE1;ndez. Yes, cola represent of our sparkling beverages in Mexico around 80%, and flavored the balance. Given our upscaling terms developing on the explanation of H&#xE9;ctor, of upscaling of flavors, we have seen the decline diminishing, and that's why he made on his remarks that we were off to a good start during the second quarter. And the segmentation we're doing with the multi-serve packages, including one-ways and returnables, on brand Coca-Cola are helping us to going back to the part of growth in brand Coca-Cola.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Alan Alanis with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, H&#xE9;ctor. Hi, Alfredo. Good morning. Could you walk us through the relative profitability of CSDs versus non-CSDs, specifically in Mexico and in Brazil? Because we're seeing this gross margin contraction and I wonder how much it's coming because of &#x2013; purely because of the exchange rate or because of the different economics between non-carbonated soft drinks and soda. And how do you see this profitability going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Alan. Let me start with Mexico and then I'll move into Brazil. Clearly, if you look at the profitability for the different categories, the most profitable category for us are single-serve carbonated soft drinks. The trend that we're seeing and that I explained in the last question of a substantial increase in products like Valle Frut, we think that in general those products have a lower profitability than single-serve CSDs, and most of these presentations in Valle Frut are also single-serve.</p>
          <p>I think that it's important from a strategic point of view that, first, we take control of the transaction, that we own the transaction and then start moving prices of those products. And as a matter of fact, we have started to increase the products &#x2013; the prices of Valle Frut to start improving the profitability of those products. But that's normal when you do &#x2013; that's normal for when we do introductions. We usually start with a price that attracts consumers, then you start little by little increasing prices as you deem appropriate and as you also start seeing how competitors evolve and how the new cost structure evolves.</p>
          <p>One thing that is important to highlight is that <mark type="inaudible" /> let me call it juice categories are managed through the joint venture. And remember that joint venture we split 50/50 the profitability with the Coca-Cola Company. But it's important also to highlight that we also split 50/50 all the investments that are required for this branch, which at the pace that we are growing the volumes on this category, you can imagine the high level of investment that we are needing for production lines through all Latin America. I think that in general my feeling is that once we stabilize these products, we will get close to the profitability of CSDs. But I don't think that we will get to the same level of the profitability of CSD stock that we have present.</p>
          <p>Another important element, even in some high priced products like juices, the cost structure of those products are also higher because the raw materials really &#x2013; you have a lot of raw materials that are very expensive on the production of that. So in general terms you will CSDs being more profitable than the other categories, but that doesn't preclude us from trying to find avenues of growing that profitability on those other products.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, it's quite similar to what I have described to Mexico, with the distinction I'll say that really the push for these new categories just started during this quarter as we finalize all the agreements with the other bottlers and the Coca-Cola Company on the formation of this joint venture that was basically started at the end of January. So we will see a positive trend in the growth of these products in the <mark type="inaudible" />. I don't know if I answered the question <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Basically what you are saying is that part of the increase in cost of goods sold will continue in that way because the costs for this, particularly for you is slightly higher. But eventually you will be taking pricing on this product as well once you, as you said, own the transaction. But that you don't anticipate that even after finishing taking this pricing that the profitability levels will be similar to the ones that you currently have or to the ones you previously had with CSDs.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Alan, just developing on the remarks that H&#xE9;ctor made, regarding the contraction of the gross income level during the first quarter of '09, the contraction was mainly driven by the depreciation of the local currencies versus the U.S. dollar applied to the dollar dominated raw materials. I mean, it was mainly driven above that. And in the Mercosur division because of the inclusion of the new numbers. I don't think that is relevant at this point to non-carbonated line of business in that line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now the 50/50 joint venture, is that 50% the Coca-Cola Company and 50% all of the bottlers, correct? I mean, you have your proportional part of that 50% among all the Mexican bottlers and all the Brazilian bottlers now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But let me clarify this. In the territories that we operate brand Coca-Cola, it's 50/50 to Coca-Cola and ourselves, and that's it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys. I'm trying to isolate the Valle benefit this year. I thought last year it was said that you reinvested about 100 basis points of a benefit from Jugos Del Valle in Mexico. But it would appear that the benefit in the first quarter of '09 was significantly lower than that. And then, so following up on that, 1Q away looks like there was an operating expense shift from Latincentro to Mexico, so wanted to get a little clarification on that. And finally what the plan was for Brazil? I assume you'll be reinvesting a lot of the profits there for Valle as well. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Sean. Last year it was a special year speaking about Mexico with the Jugos del Valle position, because remember that on production for Jugos del Valle centralized and in that the factories are owned 50% by the Coca-Cola Company and the other 50% by all the bottlers. And we were in a way in a transition period in trying to measure how to allocate these divisional selling expenses that are shared with CSDs in order for us to properly compute this 50/50 sharing with the Coca-Cola Company and other territories.</p>
          <p>So last year most of these profits were left in Jugos del Valle to reinvest heavily on the production facilities, because it was needed for, as I mentioned, us to comply &#x2013; to cope with all this volume growth that we are experiencing in this category. And very similar is what is happening in Brazil, where we share the operation of Jugos del Valle with other bottlers and therefore other production facilities are shared among the different constituents. It's not so much the case in Latincentro where we operate basically the whole country. For example, in Columbia, the Coca-Cola Company and ourselves alone, we are investing in new production lines and we are sharing 50/50 because of the production line and we will share 50/50 the profits of that.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, that still leave us the question of finalizing the agreement with the Coca-Cola Company on how much of the selling and distribution expenses that we incur in the CSDs business that are now distributing and selling juices, how much of that cost should be allocated to the joint venture. And we are still kind of fine-tuning that number. I think that we are in a much better shape this year. But &#x2013; and definitely last year everything was left at the production facilities for reinvestment. So my feeling, Sean, is that this year we should be seeing a larger benefit of these juices, the effect of the probability of this joint venture, as opposed to last year when everything was kind of left at the production facility.</p>
          <p>In the case of Brazil we are still, because of tax considerations, special tax considerations, the effect of the joint venture will be, for us, basically to the equity matter because all the profitability will be staying in the joint venture when we share as a shareholder of this production facility with the rest of the bottlers, because there are important tax considerations to consider there. So in Brazil we will be receiving dividends from this joint venture, and that's the way we will account for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And sorry to &#x2013; so that shift &#x2013; the operating expense shift from Latincentro to Mexico for one quarter of '08 I would assume that was Valle related because of production?  Or that's totally separate?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. The Consolidated &#x2013; or the consolidated EBITDA's was the same first quarter '08 as originally reported, but there was a shift. The EBITDA came in higher in Latincentro than Mexico, right? So Latincentro's 1Q '08 margin is now higher than it was originally reported. And it was just -basically it looks like it was a shift of operating expense from Latincentro to Mexico. So consolidated it was breakeven.  And I just kind of was curious as to what that was.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Lore Serra with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I wanted to ask just two questions. One was, if you could just comment on how you feel about the price increases you've implemented. I mean, you made some pretty aggressive actions in the third and fourth quarter. Volumes were weak, but I suppose within expectations given the situation. Although I was a bit surprised that you had no volume growth in Brazil, ex-REMIL. If you could comment on how comfortable you are with the current pricing structure and when do you see opportunities down the road in '09 to take any more pricing?</p>
          <p>And then separately, I think I was surprised, this quarter to me anyway, was that your operating expenses didn't look that tight. And I know that you explained why they were very tight in the fourth quarter, and that was sort of a one-off. But when you're getting that much revenue growth that's coming from pricing and volumes from not growing that much, is there some reason why you're not picking up more leverage there? Is there some way as we see the rest of the year you could see tighter OpEx? You've explained some of it in terms of Argentina and Venezuela and Jugos. But it doesn't seem to add up, given that none of that is a sizeable portion of the total revenue. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Lore, with respect to prices, I don't know. It's always kind of, when you move prices you have all these questions about what the competitors' reactions will be. So far we feel comfortable in some of these actions and as you probably saw we were moving prices on some of our strong brands, mainly brand Coca-Cola. We increased some of the prices on Jugos del Valle. In flavors in Mexico we reduced prices, we increased prices in Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil, everywhere. Because you need to take into consideration that when you suffer such a high movement on the exchange rate and such a high impact on the cost of goods sold because of the raw materials that you have to import, it's important that you try to compensate for those increases.</p>
          <p>Our experience in different situations like this in the past is that it's better to take the price and maybe suffer a little bit in the volume, and sooner or later you will capture again the consumption occasion on the volume. I think that with the price increases that we have done, we feel comfortable. It's too early to know if we will increase a little bit in second half of the year, but that's a possibility. But we need to continue measuring obviously our &#x2013; or the impact of this on the competitive environment in the second half the year to see if we can move prices again.</p>
          <p>On the operating expense line, I think that the main impact here is what we explained with respect to the increased &#x2013; very strong increases in labor costs in Argentina and Venezuela. And obviously the Jugos del Valle introduction also brings from &#x2013; all the way from specialized sales force to additional initiative expenses that are related to all this new volume and all this new joint venture. Other than that, really I don't see any specific increases that is important to highlight and I agree with you. I think that we need to start seeing some additional traction on these original levels of operating expenses in the rest of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow-up in Brazil. Do you think you lost market share as a result of your pricing actions? Or do you think the market was flat in the first quarter in volume terms?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at the share of volume, we probably lost a little bit of market share, but I'm speaking some basis points. If you look at share of sales, it's basically flattish.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick question about the volumes. You gave the figures for total volume growth and excluding REMIL. But I was wondering what the organic volume growth would be if you also excluded the Agua de Los Angeles and to the extent you consolidated Brisa volumes into Colombia for the month of March. If you excluded that too &#x2013; if you were to exclude that too, what would be your organic sales volume both for Mexico and for the consolidated entity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jose, this is Alfredo Fern&#xE1;ndez. We have been migrating some of the volume of Agua de Los Angeles to volume being shown under the brands Ciel right now. So it's not that easy to differentiate one against the other. But on a net-net basis certainly that is giving us around 5 million unit cases of incremental volume that we were getting on a priority basis. That is one way to see the jug water business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So excluding five million cases, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm giving you the rough figure, probably could be four. But this is because of the combination of gradually migrating the brand Agua de Los Angeles to our brand Ciel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Brisa? I appreciate your earlier comment about not distributing directly until June. But did you include those volumes for March since you closed the deal in late February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Let me explain on that. The agreement with SABMiller is that on June 1, we will start selling and distributing the products. And right now they are selling and they are distributing and they are producing the volumes, because we need to do all this transforming on the production, of moving all the production equipment that they have in 13 different plants to our plants. So if we move &#x2013; when we move that, starting June 1, we will start to account for volume for Brisa. So far it's volume that we are not adding a single case of Brisa water to our numbers until June 1. I did a small computation for the first question that you had for our board meeting. Excluding the Agua de Los Angeles and REMIL; excluding REMIL, the volume is growing around 2%. And if we exclude Agua de Los Angeles, that number is around 1.4, 1.5%. The so-called organic volume growth.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I guess my one question. Just kind of going back to the organic soft drink growth rate in Mexico, and I guess I was little bit surprised at the 3.6% drop. And I guess looking back it seems to me the largest such drop that you've had in recent history, and I'm trying to get a sense of just where we are in the weakness and recession type of issues. In other words, clearly the remittances are less, as you've talked about. The general GDP growth, or lack thereof, is also an impact, and you've given us some good color as far as flavors versus colas. But, I mean, if you think about it, I mean, as far as how you are in your territories, how is your market share, I guess, is the first kind of question here in the first quarter in CSDs vis-&#xE0;-vis Pepsi and the B brands? And I mean are we kind of just &#x2013; if you could give us some kind of notion of organic guidance perhaps for the year. The brewers are kind of giving us some organic guidance vis-&#xE0;-vis basis points of growth above GDP. But I'm trying to get a sense of &#x2013; or maybe you could give us a sense of really based on the first quarter, where could we see that organic growth rate for your CSDs for this year as far as kind of a range would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alex. Well, I think that in general the message that I want to translate I think is very clear. The economies are suffering in general. It is not particular to Latin Americas; it is the world in general. We are suffering because of the weaknesses, because of tourism, because industrial activities that have fallen importantly in most of the countries where we operate, and that has had an impact on some of the consumption, that consumption pattern is that we have. If you look at the restaurant activity in Mexico City or S&#xE3;o Paulo or any city that you visit, it's not the same as a few months ago. So that's on number one. We are going through a slowdown in the economy. That is important to take into consideration. And I think that under that environment when you see industrial production falling close to 20% into the countries that we suffer a little bit on this volume on CSDs, I think is a remarkable achievement for our company and shows also the resilience of our operations.</p>
          <p>The point number two is that as we have anticipated for many years we are trying to diversify our platform of beverages through acquisition, but I think that we have been very successful showing that and through innovation. And that's why our annual report also focuses a lot on innovation activities. And I think that what we have been doing in this industry is remarkable. Having Valle Frut, a product didn't exist a lot &#x2013; at all in our operations, selling three million unit cases a month after launching that a few months ago I think is a remarkable explanation of how our business adapts in this environment. True, it doesn't have the same profitability that CSDs, as I explained especially when you referred to single-serve. But again, I think that there is message that we've been trying to convey for many years. I mean, we started in from a Mexico centric operator to now being a diversified company operating in nine different countries, where the other countries have also an important weight. And two, with this acquisition, we feel this and different categories we are showing that we have the potential to continue showing top line growth. We need to adapt our operations to have better traction and better leverage on some of these operating expenses and marketing expense and all of that. But I think that that's the message that I want to convey, Alex.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the idea I guess you don't want to comment on the market share, but I guess I'm...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give you some flavor on market shares. Market share in Mexico, we have lost a few basis points on volume. And when you look at share of sales, we're almost flat, slightly below what we had last year. When you look on a sequential basis, we're improving versus February and January of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as trading down, H&#xE9;ctor, do you think that this is something that we can kind of expect going forward as far as just generally &#x2013; as consumers look for options in the CSD &#x2013; the CSD category and does this mean kind of a renewed focus at cost this year in CSDs in Mexico toward the multi-serves and returnables?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, this is Alfredo Fern&#xE1;ndez. We have seen now that &#x2013; that's why H&#xE9;ctor made in his initial remarks that we have a good start in the second quarter. The trend that we're seeing is that brand Coca-cola in multi-serve packages, three liters, two and a half liters, and the two and half returnable are starting to grow, and that have given us growth of brand Coca-Cola. Now at the same time, we're seeing that the declining carbonated soft drink flavors or sparkling beverage flavors is less than what we have seen before. And the single-serve transactions that probably we lost in soft drinks during the previous quarter, we have been able to make up for the majority of that in the innovation with non-carbonated products. So in a way all these things combined are showing that our portfolio has been able to capture the consumer under the current circumstances.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. You just touched upon it, I guess, with the previous question, but I also was curious to learn more about the consumer environment. Some other bottlers, be it Coke or Pepsi bottlers over the last week have talked about trends improving a bit. Nothing too fantastic, but some sequential improvements over the last four months of this year. Just curious, once again, to get your thoughts, if you are just generally seeing any improvement there, be it by channel or product. Even though your results and your volume growth has been relatively good, I was just curious with respect to the consumers if you're seeing that at all. And if you'd also comment on the weakening of volumes in Argentina and what your thoughts are there going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Lauren. I think that in general we have seen volumes improving, especially for this second quarter. We need to understand what is the full impact of this thing with the flu will be in our market, especially northern Mexico City is a very large market for us.  The numbers that we have up to yesterday, we haven't seen anything is happening yet because of the large trend of people being scared and doing a lot of supermarket purchases as a way of accumulating some food and beverages in their houses, and that more than compensated some of the reductions of the restaurants that are closing since yesterday. So restaurants will certainly have an impact, restaurants and bars and discotheques will have an impact on some of our volumes in Mexico City.</p>
          <p>I believe my feeling that we need to wait a little more for more time is that the extraordinary purchases that we saw in supermarkets and traditional sales are going to weaken <mark type="inaudible" /> are more than a one-time thing that is not going to be day-over-day, but it's more like stocking or doing some pantry load for the house. So far when you &#x2013; if you look at the trends that we have before these prices with the flu started, we were looking at volumes for CSDs in Mexico growing close to 4% during the month of February. That also has &#x2013; might have an effect with respect to the Easter that happened in April, and all those effects. I think that the weather has helped us a lot with some of the trends, especially in Mexico during this first month of the second quarter, during April. May is always our strongest month in Mexico, and so far if the weather continues to have this trend, I think that May will be a very good month, although we have one less sale of &#x2013; one less day of sales during the month of May, but I think that the trends continue to be very important.</p>
          <p>Obviously this thing with the flu <mark type="inaudible" /> that it's too early for us to understand what the full impact of this will be. In general the other countries were also growing, probably not at the same pace that Mexico because of different weather conditions or whatever. In some of the Central American countries we changed the trend from a negative number that we show in the first quarter to a positive number in soft drinks and everything. The same is in Columbia, and Venezuela is a little bit flattish compared to last year because of the economic situation and all of that. Obviously, when you look at the production of all &#x2013; and I'm speaking basically about CSDs. In every country when you speak about all our products, including juices and still beverages, those continue to show very, very important trends of growth. I think that will basically be the comments that I have for you, Lauren.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Argentina, yes. Argentina, I don't know, it's kind of a tough situation. I mean, the report of inflation is around 6%, but salaries continue to increase closer to 30% base. So it's kind of a &#x2013; the economic situation in Argentina is complicated. We have been passing some pricing increases with &#x2013; obviously some restrictions, as you know, tat one of the main focuses of the authorities is to control inflation in Argentina. But we have been able to continue moving &#x2013; or having a richer mix of products in our &#x2013; in terms of the pricing formula in Argentina. And that's why I think that the volumes were a bit tough during this quarter. During the month of April, we basically have flattish volumes compared to what we had last year in this first month after we are close to an end.</p>
