          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Conference Call of E.ON AG. At our customer's request, this conference will be recorded. As a reminder, all participants will be in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I now hand you over to Mr. Sascha Bibert, who will defer this conference. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the E.ON nine months 2011 results. Once again, a volatile day in the financial markets with lots of political news flow. Our numbers are in line with expectations and in line with the outlook given in August. Accordingly, we intend to be brief, with the call lasting about one hour, including Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Marcus, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone, welcome to our call to the first nine months results. Broadly speaking, our results for the first nine months are a continuation of the trends that we observed during the first six months. In other words, the isolated third quarter was not very eventful from a numbers point of view. On the one hand, we remained very negatively impacted by costs of the nuclear exit, the challenges in gas supply and sales, as well as by the effect of disposals.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we see positive developments in renewables, in Russia, and in upstream oil and gas. Excluding scope effects, i.e. the disposals, which in total are &#x20AC;300 million, currency effects and the nuclear one-offs, i.e. the &#x20AC;1.5 billion that we spoke about during our Q2 results, EBITDA would be down 23% year-on-year to &#x20AC;8.3 billion, instead of the officially reported number of minus 39% to &#x20AC;6.6 billion. Given the absence of major changes in the third quarter, we keep the outlook for the full year unchanged with EBITDA is expected to come out between &#x20AC;9.1 billion and &#x20AC;9.8 billion and adjusted net income between &#x20AC;2.1 billion and &#x20AC;2.6 billion. We also keep our plan to payout a dividend of &#x20AC;1 per share.</p>
          <p>Before I review the figures in detail, I will address three topics, the current operating environment, the first measures taken to reduce controllable costs by &#x20AC;1.5 billion and last but not least, in these financially troubled times I will illustrate the financial flexibility of our group.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the operating environment. Fears of a weakening economic growth and inadequate subsequent policy response have triggered discussions about a recession. Those fears have also shown up in many surveys of consumer and business sentiments. However, so far, the influence on the real economy has been limited. In Germany, for example, industrial production was up 5.5% year-on-year in September and 9.6% year-on-year from January to September.</p>
          <p>And according to our own internal data, sales of power to industrial customers were up 9% year-on-year in September, and up 7% year-to-date. We observed very similar developments for example in the Czech Republic and in Hungary. Thus today, we do not really see a contraction of economic activity in our operational statistics. Whether this is a timing issue or whether some fears prove exaggerated of course remains to be seen. This is just the data and facts that we can report.</p>
          <p>Forward prices for most commodity inputs have declines only slightly or have stayed stable since July. Oil has risen only marginally to $113 per barrel. Coal is down from $1.28 to $1.20 per ton and TTF calendar year forward has stayed stable at about &#x20AC; 26 per megawatt hour. CO2 saw the biggest move with a drop from &#x20AC;13 to around &#x20AC;9 per ton as the expected slowdown of European industrial activity reduces demand for emission allowances.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, forward power prices have also declined slightly in the main European markets to reflect those lower coal gas and in particular CO2 prices. Baseload forwards, in Germany, the Benelux and the U.K., all fell by about &#x20AC;2 to &#x20AC;3 per megawatt hour since the start of July. German base forward, for example, declined from &#x20AC;57 per megawatt hour to &#x20AC;54 to &#x20AC;55 by now.</p>
          <p>However, forward clean spark and dark spreads held up rather well, thanks to the fall of CO2 prices. Spark spreads remain broadly constant or declined only marginally in most markets. Darks went up by &#x20AC;2 per megawatt hour in Germany and in the U.K. So whilst the volatility in financial markets increased in the past month, we seem to observe the opposite in the power markets. This limits our ability to capture full intrinsic value of our flexible generation fleet.</p>
          <p>So what are then the implications of all of that for E.ON? First, we continue to apply strict investment discipline. We will invest in renewables where appropriate, however conventional new builds in Europe remain off the agenda. We are only investing in very selective projects, which appear from &#x2013; which benefit from particular circumstances. Furthermore, to ensure that our investment projects deliver adequate returns, we have decided to increase the hurdle rates for all investments in non-regulated activities from at least 150 basis points above cost of capital to at least 250 basis points. Second, we have performance improvements as a key priority across the group. We are focusing most of our efforts on the value levers that we can control and do not just hope for the pricing environments to support profitability.</p>
          <p>I will now give you an update on our performance initiatives on the following slides, and moving to Chart number 2. Enhanced performance is one of our four strategic pillars that we announced in November. We have now completed PerformtoWin, which has improved our EBITDA by more than &#x20AC;1.5 billion between 2009 and 2011. On the 10th of August, we announced a new very ambitious target to reduce controllable costs by &#x20AC;1.5 billion to &#x20AC;9.5 billion by 2015 at the latest, which comes on top of the additional &#x20AC;600 million of performance improvement efforts that we had announced on the 10th of November 2010.</p>
          <p>Key objectives are to reduce costs, especially administrative costs, to ensure competitiveness in our operations and investments and to simplify structures to speed up decision-making. We are convinced that enhanced performance is the decisive factor in our industry going forward and the one capability that will enable us to outperform cost of capital in the future.</p>
          <p>So far, we are working on four specific implementation measures. First, we want group management to refocus solely on steering functions. In addition, we have presented a plan to reduce group management from 630 FTEs to 400 full-time equivalents to streamline those steering functions.</p>
          <p>Second, in the U.K. we will reduce support staff by up to 500 jobs by integrating our retail organization into our holding entity in the country.</p>
          <p>Third, we plan to bundle our gas trading and optimization activities with E.ON Energy Trading into a common entity. In a first step we have fully aligned the top management of both our trading and our gas units with Klaus Sch&#xE4;fer as common CEO.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we should be able to announce in the short-term a plan to simplify the management structures in Germany, e.g. by way of producing legal entities that management layers. This is only a first set of measures.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, this program is expected to reduce our 79,000 strong workforce by 9,000 to 11,000 jobs. Mid-December, we plan to present to the Supervisory Board further details on our plans, including details on more than 50 specific projects.</p>
          <p>Over to Page number 3. I would like to take the opportunity to expand on our concept of controllable costs as it has become a key performance indicator at all levels of the group. Controllable costs basically are defined as those costs that operational management can meaningfully influence through its own actions. Our generation business, for example, has very little influence over the price of the fuel consumed or over the price of the CO2 emitters (sic) [emissions] (9:58). Therefore, fuel and CO2 costs are not part of controllable costs. Neither is depreciation part of controllable costs as it reflects past decisions which cannot be influenced by operational management anymore.</p>
          <p>By contrast, most personnel expenses can be considered controllable, also cost of materials such as office supplies and other operational expenses such as marketing, IT and purchases of various services. With this definition, the controllable costs can be derived from the standard group P&amp;L. &#x20AC;4 billion of these, about &#x20AC;74 billion of material costs are group level &#x2013; at group level are controllable costs. The majority of the material costs are purchases of coal, gas, CO2 allowances and power, which are non-controllable. Almost all of the &#x20AC;5.3 billion of personnel costs are controllable costs. Those personnel costs which are classified as non-operating such as restructuring expenses are, however, are not included in the controllable costs. Finally, about &#x20AC;2 billion of the net other operation income and expenses are controllable. That includes various items such as insurance, marketing, or IT just to name a few. In total, controllable costs amounted to about &#x20AC;11 billion in 2010. That figure consisted of 46% of personnel and 54% for non-personnel cost.</p>
          <p>I hope that this background information will be helpful in your analysis over the overall program. To conclude on this topic, improving performance is a key focus of our strategy. Our objective is not simply to reduce cost but generally to improve E.ON's agility. Indeed, we will only be able to reduce controllable costs if we succeed to do things in a different way. More than in the past, staff and management will have to take full responsibility in their respective area of competence.</p>
          <p>In light of the current situation of the financial markets, I would now like to emphasize that we are well on our way to regain our financial flexibility. E.ON has recently taken considerable efforts to reduce overall financial indebtedness, more than &#x20AC;9 billion of divestments since our last Capital Markets Day on the 10th of November of last year. Economic net debt has been reduced from &#x20AC;45 billion to &#x20AC;34.5 billion, while financial net debt went down from &#x20AC;27 billion to &#x20AC;17 billion in a 12-month period.</p>
          <p>Our rating position, as seen by the rating agencies, has changed. S&amp;P has confirmed our single A flat rating but has put us on negative outlook which was to a large extent due to external impacts such as the nuclear exit in Germany. Moody's has lowered our rating for similar reasons to A3 and views us now as solidly positioned within this rating level. Both ratings are clearly in line with our finance strategy which postulates a solid single A rating.</p>
          <p>Economic net debt to EBITDA is likely to surpass our mid-term target of smaller than 3 times in the current year. However, without the &#x20AC;1.5 billion one-off hit in nuclear to EBITDA in 2011, it would be 0.5 points lower. I think this is important to understand when by year-end you analyze the situation.</p>
          <p>Can we move to chart number 5? Next to leverage, moving in the right direction, we currently also have a very comfortable liquidity position of in total &#x20AC;11.5 billion. There are &#x20AC;6.5 billion in liquid funds and &#x20AC;5 billion in non-current securities which can also be monetized if necessary. In addition, we have access to a revolving credit facility of &#x20AC;6 billion, currently and actually also in the past never tapped. And we can reactivate our &#x20AC;10 billion and $10 billion commercial paper program at any time. Today, we have no commercial paper outstanding. Our bonds have long-term and well-balanced maturity profile with an effective duration of 6.8 years. In light of the comfortable liquidity profile, we do not expect to have a refinancing need before the year 2013.</p>
          <p>So let me now comment on the key drivers of our group EBITDA on chart number 6. As EBITDA down 39%, I will start with the key negatives. The single biggest item is the decline in our German nuclear business caused by the exit decision and the fuel tax. For the first nine months, this adds up to a total of &#x20AC;2.3 billion. Second largest effect is the expected deterioration of our gas midstream results by &#x20AC;0.8 billion. Overall, we lost &#x20AC;0.5 billion year-on-year in our power portfolio, mainly due to lower achieved prices for the Central Europe outright portfolio but also as a result of falling spreads and in particular declining volatility. Then, the absence of last year's positive one-off effect in our German-regulated DSOs dropped down EBITDA a further &#x20AC;0.3 billion. Portfolio effects from E.ON Rete and Central Networks sale contribute a negative &#x20AC;0.3 billion. A series of minor smaller effects, such as the missing Gazprom dividends or others leads to a negative delta of another &#x20AC;0.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Over to the positives, performance measures resulting from our Perform-to-Win program contribute &#x20AC;0.2 billion. Gas upstream operation is benefiting from rising gas and oil prices and our Russian business from the newly added capacities. Also, EC&amp;R contributed positively, with mainly capacity-driven volume growth and an EBITDA uplift of &#x20AC;130 million.</p>
          <p>I would actually like to skip the next chart and go straight to the Generation segment. That segment comprises the results of the group's nuclear, coal, and gas-fired generation activity. Hydro, wind, solar or any other type of renewable generation are reported in the segment, Renewables. The earnings dynamics of this segment may differ from what one might expect when purely taking into account our chief prices due to the interplay of this segment with internal transfer prices to EET, Energy Trading. This year's developments, disregarding the effects related to German nuclear policy, illustrate this quite well. The transfer prices, driving the top-line of this unit, date back to the year 2008 when forward power prices for 2011 were on average very high; hence, the Generation segment benefits from these higher transfer prices, whilst Energy Trading suffers from that development. More to that later.</p>
          <p>Higher transfer prices improved nuclear generation EBITDA by almost &#x20AC;400 million, followed by positive volume effects in our Nordic nuclear fleet. As you know from our Q2 results, these positives were overshadowed by the political turmoil in Germany in the aftermath of Fukushima. The moratorium, the following permanent shutdown of 3.2 gigawatts of our German nuclear capacity, and the nuclear tax cost us in total &#x20AC;2.3 billion compared to last year, driving EBITDA of our nuclear fleet in Europe into negative territory.</p>
          <p>After the decision of the two lower courts in Hamburg and Munich, we received a cash-back for the nuclear tax we already paid for Grafenrheinfeld. You will not notice a change to our P&amp;L from this decision as, instead of actually expensing against the cash out, we have to record a liability for the nuclear tax until a definitive decision on its legality. This treatment will apply to all other cases where we paid or still expect to pay the tax. The total process is likely to take several years as we'll have to take several legal hurdles.</p>
          <p>Our steam fleet benefits primarily from higher transfer prices, mainly in the U.K. In the CCGT fleet, the results were burdened by falling spreads in Italy and Spain, which was not fully offset by the additional earnings contribution from our CCGT Grain and Irsching 4, which is now named after our former Chairman, Ulrich Hartmann.</p>
          <p>In the segment Renewables, we report the results of our European hydro fleet as well as our wind, solar, and other renewable activities. Transfer price effects also impact this unit as it sells almost all of its hydro output to Energy Trading where it is then marketed. The higher transfer price compared to last year had a &#x20AC;124 million positive impact on earnings. Higher prices mainly due to green certificates in Italy added another &#x20AC;12 million. On the negative side, we produced lower volumes in Germany, Sweden, and Italy.</p>
          <p>In wind, solar and other renewables, we see additional volumes from higher installed capacity compared to Q3 2010 and also higher load factors, especially in the U.S., where we have just crossed the 2 gigawatt mark in terms of installed capacity. In total, we're now at 3.8 gigawatts compared to 3.6 gigawatts at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Next to the London Array project, where construction is progressing quite well, and a list of smaller projects across Europe. We currently have 800 megawatt of wind onshore capacity under construction in the U.S. This confirms that next to our ambitions to grow outside Europe in conventional generation, the growth in renewables and outside Europe is E.ON's core focus for future growth.</p>
          <p>Our segment Gas saw a continuation of the negative trends shown at the half year stage, albeit less pronounced. Let me first start with our upstream activities. Actually, volumes in our North Sea fields, Njord and Rita, were very weak and saw strong declines, almost overcompensating positive pricing effects. However, our Russian gas field Yuzhno Russkoye saw its EBITDA &#x20AC;137 million higher than in the first nine months of 2010, mainly driven by higher prices.</p>
          <p>Our midstream business is down by 95% to &#x20AC;45 million. This, again, is attributable to our supply and sales activity where the negative mismatch between oil index prices for the gas we procure and the increasingly spot price driven prices for the volumes we sell to our customers become apparent. Despite the fact that we have by now renegotiated 37% of the oil index volumes with several suppliers, we're still making losses in this segment. However, the isolated third quarter shows an improvement of our midstream earnings compared to the half year stage by &#x20AC;0.3 billion. This is mainly a result of optimization activities regarding our spot and oil index procurement volumes. These give us a &#x20AC;200-million benefit in 2011 but will cost us around half that number in 2012, net from an NPV point of view, a good deal for us. Also positive pricing effects from storage usage helped as we were able to fill our storage with relatively cheap gas in June and July.</p>
          <p>Now over to trading on chart 11. We continued to see the strong swing in the optimization results of our trading operation. It is driven by the different dynamics of transfer and achieved prices. For trading, this year's procurement side is based on market forward prices that we're seeing three years ahead of delivery, i.e., in 2008 in terms of average power prices for delivery year 2011. The achieved prices for 2011, however, which represents trading's revenue line date back only in parts to the strong period, but to a larger share were hedged in the weaker years, 2009 and 2010. This alone already explains why we'll record a loss in optimization. The even stronger swing in earnings comes from the fact that in 2010 the situation was exactly the other way around. Back then, trading's top-line profited from record achieved prices, whilst transfer prices, which dated back to 2007, were relatively lower. The proprietary trading activity has recovered from the negative hit it took in Q1 of last year. It's back to neutral territory, which is an improvement of &#x20AC;66 million compared to last year. Again, not yet a great result but at least some first improvement.</p>
          <p>Over to the regional segment, Germany, on Page 12. In the first nine months, the adjusted EBITDA of this segment was up by 2% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion. The regulated DSO business suffered from lower network revenues. Remember, throughout the whole year 2010, we were positively impacted by certain one-off developments in this area, around &#x20AC;0.2 billion. In the unregulated activities, we improved substantially compared to 2010 by &#x20AC;255 million. The biggest driver are higher sales revenues and a number of optimization activities on the cost side.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll move on to the other &#x2013; to the regional segment, other European countries. Chart 13's functional breakdown is additional information compared to the Interim Report where we are showing you the earnings along the country lines. Of course, you can find the latter also in the backup to this presentation. Adjusted for the <mark type="ph" /> parameter effect (25:12), i.e., the sale of U.K. Central Networks and E.ON Rete, the Italian distribution business, the European distribution businesses showed an overall positive earnings trend. Biggest driver is our Czech DSO where we passed on increased renewable energy costs, mainly from photovoltaic to the end consumer. Also, the Spanish DSO improved.</p>
          <p>Now to our sales business where was saw a &#x20AC;464-million reduction. The biggest negative driver continues to be the U.K. with more than &#x20AC;300 million. The key reason is the very strong prior-year performance, especially that of Q1 2010 which we had always flagged as quasi one-off. Still our sales business is a profitable operation. In the first nine months of this year, U.K. sales EBITDA was &#x20AC;150 million. The second factor, which we noticed in Romania as well as in Italy was a deterioration in our bad debt position.</p>
          <p>Our regional unit Russia continued the positive trend which we have seen throughout the full year. The electricity market liberalization and demand growth had a &#x20AC;61-million positive impact. The bigger group of effect is related to earnings from newly commissioned units, about &#x20AC;40 million from the electricity market and about &#x20AC;60 million from the capacity market. All this growth is, of course, accompanied by some cost expansion but also overall inflation has some impact.</p>
          <p>On the following slide 15 and 16, we reconcile net income starting from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted net interest expense improved quite substantially due to the improvement in our net financial position but also as a result of the reversal of a provision which we had built late 2010 related to the expected prepayments into the German renewable energy fund. And, as you know that concept was then waived in the context of the exit decision.</p>
          <p>Within net book gains, next to the remaining gap from disposal, we recorded a book gain from our disposal of Central Networks. This compares positively to the &#x20AC;0.9 billion we realized last year, which were related to the disposal of generation capacity and various other items.</p>
          <p>Other non-operating earnings include negative impacts from currency-related reclassifications of our equity impairments as a result of the change of the nuclear lifetime as well as prepayment effects for bonds we bought back. Last year's other non-operating earnings were mainly impacted by impairments related to Spain, Italy, and France. This year's impairment tests will be conducted during the fourth quarter as part of our ongoing planning process.</p>
          <p>Our reported tax rate has come down from 28% to minus 2% as a result of a reduction in the pre-tax result in combination with a relatively high share of tax-free income, mainly from the disposal gains. In addition, the third quarter tax rate decreased due to a deferred tax gain which reflects a slightly lower statutory tax rate in the U.K. Nothing to comment on for 2011 in terms of discontinued operations. The loss last year, as you will remember, relates to the disposal of U.S. Midwest.</p>
          <p>As you might notice for chart 17, we have chosen a new representation for this slide. We believe it is a bit clearer, and the old presentation, however, you can still find in the backup to this presentation. The &#x20AC;4.3 billion drop in adjusted EBITDA was in simple terms only offset by &#x20AC;1.3 billion lower tax and the &#x20AC;0.3 billion lower interest cost, translating to the &#x20AC;2.8 billion or 64% drop in adjusted net income.</p>
          <p>Over to page 18; our operating cash flow saw a steep drop in the first nine months. The biggest impact driving down operating cash flow is the lower EBITDA, but there's also a substantial non-cash portion in this number of &#x20AC;1.7 billion. As you know, we recorded around &#x20AC;1.5 billion as cash neutral one-off effect resulting from the nuclear exit in Q2 of 2011. In the U.K. and Germany, we booked a funding of a deficit in the amount of &#x20AC;0.3 billion. It is also largely a one-off effect.</p>
          <p>In global gas and trading, we have a group of working capital movements, for example, at Energy Trading, mainly because higher volumes which have been transferred to the trading unit from global gas and then sold into the traded markets. That led to an increase in working capital. You may recall this effect was slightly higher at half year. Minus &#x20AC;0.2 billion in renewables where we received less cash grants in the U.S. compared to prior year. The bond buyback cost an &#x20AC;0.3 billion prepayment effect, also another one-off, and other working capital movements add up to &#x20AC;0.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Our economic net debt, as you can see on chart number 19, has slightly deteriorated compared to the second quarter of 2011, but is still a &#x20AC;10 billion improvement year-on-year compared to the level we had 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>Dividends paid in May amount to &#x20AC;3 billion, CapEx is down by 26% compared to last year's nine month, CapEx level. Divestments including the deconsolidation of debts amounted to a positive of &#x20AC;6.5 billion; and the operating cash flow as described, adds another &#x20AC;4.5 billion. Other effects were in total minus &#x20AC;0.7 billion, include mainly an increase of nuclear provisions as well as higher margining at energy trading.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me now comment on our outlook for the current year. We're leaving the group outlook range as set in August unchanged. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to come out between &#x20AC;9.1 billion and &#x20AC;9.8 billion and adjusted net income is between &#x20AC;2.1 billion and &#x20AC;2.6 billion. While there is no change to the group headline outlook, we have made some adjustments to the individual segments, as shown on chart number 21.</p>
          <p>Generation, here we expect a slightly lower result at the end of the year due to unexpected power plant outages, for example, at our nuclear plant, Burgdorf. Gas, the earlier mentioned optimization effects that we have seen in the third quarter are the main driver behind the increase of the full year guidance. Admittedly, the positive effect this year will lead to a negative, albeit, lower counter effect in 2012.</p>
          <p>We also have produced a guidance range for our trading business. This is mainly driven by a more difficult environment for our flexible fossil generation fleet. Falling volatility and reduced time to maturity have led to a strong reduction of the extrinsic value, we expect it to extract from the fleet.</p>
          <p>Finally, we also slightly increased the range of our region, Germany, because of higher profitability in our sales activity.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks, and now Sascha and I will take your questions.</p>

          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. Two questions; the first one is on the gas supply business and here are the negotiations which are taking place on the arbitration; is there anything in terms of news flow which we could expect in next weeks or months to come?</p>
          <p>Second question on the nuclear phase out in here with respect to the latest news E.ON will embark upon or has already embarked upon. In terms of the guideline, can we here expect first meaningful news flow in the next two years or can you be a bit more specific on the timeline? You said probably that it takes several years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question regarding Gazprom, of course, it's always difficult to say whether there's going to be news flow in the coming weeks or months. I think as my colleagues said yesterday in Russia, we are continuing of course to negotiate with Gazprom in parallel to the arbitration proceedings. Whether or not that will lead to something in the coming months, it's too early to tell.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the timeline on the nuclear side, I think, this is basically something that is beyond our control. This will depend on how quickly the courts work, but I mean realistically, I think our assessment will be this is probably something between two and four years.</p>
          <p>Other parties on the gas upstream side that we are discussing with, again we will have to see, in particular when you look at &#x2013; when you think about Statoil, there I would say it's unlikely that we will see a sort of news flow before the end of this year. This is a topic that will keep us occupied during the next year and then we will have to see whether we can quickly get to something or whether it takes longer. This is, I would say too early stages. As we have always said, the discussions have just recently been taken up and we will have to see how quickly or not we will come to agreements with our partners in Norway.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Marcus and Sascha. Two questions from my side; first, I wanted to get your thoughts on 2013, since you haven't mentioned the targets in your official presentation here. I think three things have happened since August. Power prices are down a bit, spreads are up a bit and you've progressed a bit in terms of your preparation work for the cost cutting. So I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on how confident you still are with your 2013 guidance, whether there's a negative or positive bias relative to what you said in August?</p>
          <p>And second question is &#x2013; actually tomorrow is going to be the first anniversary of your emerging market strategy. Nevertheless, there is no slide in the presentation, so I wonder if there is anything to say on that part? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On 2013, quite frankly, we will refrain from doing a mark-to-market every other day of that target. I think we provided you with a framework that puts you into a position to do &#x2013; to somehow assess the commodity price swings and the resulting economic effect for our portfolio, I'm sure, when we discuss this three months from now, the numbers will again look different.</p>
          <p>So in that sense, I would refrain from actually coming up with a view there. And I can also only take note of where the prices are today. But again, next week they may be different, so there's no bias on our side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I just sort of follow-up &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; on maybe the personnel costs is the key element here, because you said last time that &#x20AC;750 million should already be achieved by 2013. So I guess is there any change to that expectation now that you're a bit further down with the progress?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no change, but just to make sure, I think I said, up to half, we expect to achieve by 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's no new information on that and no change to that. Emerging markets, as you call it, i.e., countries that I would rather call, emerged markets, there's nothing in it because right now, there's no specific transaction that we can talk about. I think we always made it clear that when we have something tangible, we will let you know.</p>
          <p>We are in specific discussions with a number of people, but we find it more useful to come out and talk about it when there is something agreed. Then we will talk about it. That is not yet the case. I think we always told you that we will take a very cautious approach here. We will focus on trying to find solid partners where we also culturally get along with quite well and where we can focus on organic development. All of that has to come together. And I keep saying one needs to be patient. There are number of things we have turned down by now. Every quarter we're turning down one or two sort of discussion paths that we have. That was also the case in the last three months. But again you just have to expect that it does take some time and that's where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if there was an M&amp;A opportunity for a single market, say Brazil for example, would that replace any organic growth or would that just be on top?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we always said that we are not ruling out acquisitions but our focus, even if we were to do an acquisition, the focus would be to then &#x2013; to have that as a basis or a nucleus, which would allow us to participate in the growth that we see in those markets, i.e. new build opportunities. And I think I've said that on many calls. Of course, a number of the situations we are discussing is with partners that also do have an existing in-store capacity, typically not very big. And yeah, it might happen that we also take a certain position in such an existing capacity. You can then call that "acquisition", and we're not ruling that out.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Vincent Gilles from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on cost cutting, if you could refresh our memory on, and as you've obviously progressed on detailing it, how much of the &#x20AC;1.5 billion you expect to be able to keep on the net basis, net as in post the cost of restructuring over which period of time obviously?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be this optimization you've been highlighting for Q3 in the certain supply gas business, how replicable is that for Q4 for the beginning of next year, because I mean we all remember that you had part of your losses frozen. What should we expect here? You gave us an update on the views for '11. What should we assume for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your first question the restructuring costs, we do not know yet, how much it's going to be. A key reason for that is that we need to make sort of more progress with regards to the discussions and negotiations with unions and employee representatives in the various countries. And once we've made more progress there, I think we will also have more visibility on the costs, i.e., it's too early to actually assess that.</p>
          <p>Typically, one would say that at least when you look at the &#x2013; sort of at the HR related cost savings, which we've always said is likely going to be half the targeted amount, half of that &#x20AC;1.5 billion, then you tend to see some 0.5 to 1 times that cost as restructuring cost. But we will only be able to book that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On a yearly basis, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the one-off effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is just one year and it's not cost every year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the one-off effect, which can only be booked when you have specific agreements in place. An example is we have booked in our neutral results a restructuring expense in the form of a provision of &#x20AC;30 million in our UK business, because there, we have a specific plan to reduce head count by a restructuring measure that is right now being implemented and discussed with the unions. We expect implementation more or less until the end of the year, so this was specific enough that we could already take a provision, &#x20AC;30 million booked in neutral, and the same will happen to other restructuring efforts and agreements in the future.</p>
          <p>With regard to the optimization question, of course, we always hope to repeat this, but quite frankly, these are market opportunities that may or may not arise. What happened here is we saw a quite a substantial widening in the summer/winter spreads in gas, and we could simply take opportunity of that. And it gave us a nice additional earnings impact in 2011. We will admittedly, lose about half that number then in 2012, but net, net on an NPV basis, it is a very favorable deal. But these are market opportunities that you cannot sort of plan for because in a way, you could almost say we're using more or less time arbitrage that is possible here and trying to capture the value that sits in those time spreads. And as I said it's difficult to predict whether or not we will have a similar situation next year. That may or may not be the case.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon to everybody. Just the two questions. The first is going back to your, shall we call it, expansionary strategy for the new markets. There are quite a lot of suggestions that you have made an offer for the 21% of EDP that the Portuguese government is selling. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the rationale behind that and whether you're looking to be at 21% or want to do something a little bit more?</p>
          <p>And then continuing with the gas side of things, obviously a number of contracts which were profitable in 2011 have rolled off and when you reset those sales contracts at the beginning of the gas year in October, you may be in a loss making position. So maybe you could give a little bit of guidance as to how you expect the supply and sales business in global gas to move through into 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. EDP I think that all I would say is it is correct, that we are looking at that situation. And I think the only other thing that I'm happy to say is that just buying a 21% or buying the majority in this company is of no interest to us. But more than that, I cannot say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin, let me take a stance at the gas question. I think we have collectively speculated quite a few times, regarding the '12 number and today we don't do that. But let's look at 2011 once again and maybe that helps you a little bit.</p>
          <p>I think due to our communication in previous calls, you and most of your peers, I would say, have a supply and sales number gas for the full year 2011 slightly better than a &#x20AC;1 billion loss. Yeah. If I take note of that and we feel comfortable of that, and contrast that with the nine month number, knowing that Midstream was just barely positive. Midstream comprises the supply and sales business as well as storage. Storage was a positive number. Then you have an idea of what the fourth quarter will do, i.e., it will look somewhat similar to the fourth quarter 2010, which was a couple hundred million loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Benjamin Leyre from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you and good afternoon. Two questions please; first one is precisely on the full year 2011 guidance for the adjusted EBITDA for &#x20AC;9.1 billion to &#x20AC;9.8 billion. This seems to imply quite a wide range of possibilities for Q4. I wonder what keeps you so prudent and so vague on the Q4 expectations as we're in mid November?</p>
          <p>And the second point, can you also elaborate a bit on the big gain in sales in Germany? Does it relate to retail margins being particularly high? Does it relate to maybe decreasing state of the competition in that segment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your second question, indeed the retail margins were better in that segment. This is partially related to the &#x2013; just simply to the regionally-specific pricing position that we take there because it's not that it's Germany, it's just one market. It's actually several markets and you're competing in several cities and several regions. And all in all, we have seen a favorable development there. There's also some cost benefits that we have achieved in this segment which we saw come through. And those are the main drivers for the German retail business.</p>
          <p>The question why we leave the ranges still so wide, quite frankly, we simply didn't want to change it. If I &#x2013; when I look at the range, then I would say there is a higher chance that we would sort of be somewhere in the sort of lower half of that range, but maybe slightly better than that. But we simply didn't want to change those numbers. Q3 was an uneventful quarter from our perspective, and in that sense, we're still on the same track as we were with the half year numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Just one follow-up question, whether I heard it right with respect to the EDP situation, you said we're looking at it but buying just a 21% stake or a minority stake or a majority stake is not an option?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A majority, okay fine thanks. And then the other question is with respect your mentioning of &#x2013; your reference to last year Q4 impairments in Southern Europe, I mean mentioning the situation what we've heard in the Capital Markets Day in the 10th of August and bringing the two things together there's obviously potential headwinds down there.

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just one question on numbers, depreciation was &#x20AC;2.8 billion in the nine months so I think your full year guidance is &#x20AC;4 billion. Investments were &#x20AC;4 billion or &#x20AC;4.1 billion in the nine months and your full year guidance is &#x20AC;7.5 billion to &#x20AC;8 billion. So both running quite a way bit behind what you're expecting for the full year. Is there going to be something substantial that changes in the fourth quarter to bring it up to the level you're forecasting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, when you look at the development of last year, you could also observe that in the fourth quarter the run rate was higher than implied by the first nine months, i.e., last time, it went up from &#x20AC;2.8 billion to &#x20AC;3.8 billion. Now if you would do the same for the current year, you would expect it to come out at &#x20AC;3.8 billion as well. We guided for &#x20AC;4 billion, let's call it <mark type="ph" /> concussion (55:00).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on investments, I would say the nine-months numbers are suggesting that we will &#x2013; there's a certain likelihood, actually, not spend the overall number that was the original target; i.e., I would expect to come out either at the low end of that range if not a bit below.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, is that a timing issue or have you actually cancelled some investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is both. There is one timing effect in our renewables segments where we had a project delay with a windpark in the U.S. but there are also, I would say, ongoing CapEx reduction activities that we have requested our units to undertake basically as a &#x2013; yeah, as a continuing process. And admittedly I think you always also have a bit this component of &#x2013; you always when you budget a project you build in some contingency and thankfully not always all of the contingencies needs to be used. And when that contingency gets released then we see that CapEx is a bit lower and as you may have spotted we have seen that effect also in the previous years.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, one is on working capital. You ran through quite a lot of detail on the cash flow slide and I think there were two relatively big negative working capital movements in gas and in trading. Would you expect to see those reverse at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In trading, the effect is indeed a bit impacted by the fact that in 2010 there were a lot lower volumes that were sold via energy trading. This is why we have sort of an increase in working capital. Assuming that sort of the level of volumes that get passed through each stay at comparable levels, I would not expect a further decline there; i.e., a further buildup of additional working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that is trading. In gas, I mean you know this from also our previous years, this is always the most difficult one to predict because it is also impacted by what we said earlier, namely what does the summer/winter spread look like and how do you then use the storage? And the usage of the storage can, of course, lead to also just within one quarter to quite a substantial buildup in working capital, which at beginning of the year is always difficult to predict. But if you assume that over a cycle, you will not continue to just only build storage but eventually you also take the gas out, then also that effect should over time &#x2013; you should see the opposite of that, whether that is next year, in two years, I can't tell you. But in principle these are effects that will always show us swings in a certain year into the negative, in another year into the positive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, so my second question was just on the tax rates. You've shown that slightly different breakdown of how you get to adjusted net income, which implies a sort of an adjusted effective tax rate of around 21%. How do you expect that to evolve over the rest of the year?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bobby, if you look at our half-year presentation, towards the end of that we reconciled from the EBITDA range towards adjusted net income and EPS. And if you look on that page, actually what we guided for was an absolute tax number in the area of &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you put those numbers into the same format that you have in front of you for the nine months, you will actually see that the percentage number is very similar to the nine months percentage; i.e., it reconciles quite well; keeps the &#x20AC;800 million tax expense.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I had one question left. On hedging you don't give hedge ratios for spread generation anymore but spreads are moving quite a lot. Could you maybe give us a number in terms of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (60:48) that you've hedged for 2013 at the end of September and ideally an average spread level in euros <mark type="indiscernible" /> (60:57)? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Vincent. Indeed we have stopped reporting hedge ratios for --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think he was talking &#x2013; you were talking about the outright position or --</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The spread. So --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Sorry. Then I misunderstand &#x2013; yeah, the spread, when did we stop that?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Six months ago. The reason is that the economic generation very much depends on where the spread is. So a percentage does not tell you a lot because the 100% is changing, which is why we actually didn't find this a terribly helpful or insightful number. And that's why it's no longer being reported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes so I mean it is possible to have a number in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:52) rather than percentage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also that number I think you might run the risk of being misled because the number may go up a bit or may go down a bit from quarter to quarter because it may financially make sense to from time to time also buy back certain volumes. When you think about the concept of delta hedging I think then it's quite obvious. And that's why we think the number would actually not help you. And you rather run the risk of being confused.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Two questions: just very broadly speaking on your &#x20AC;1.5 billion cost reduction target, could you give us a number on how much of that volume has been clearly identified by concrete projects so far? And second, you mentioned that a final decision for the nuclear fuel tax might be &#x2013; might take 2.5 years &#x2013; sorry, 2 to 4 years from now, but I was interested in getting a kind of timeline for the next court decision. I mean you remind us <mark type="indiscernible" /> (63:38) have won the case in Hamburg but what about the other nuclear fuel tax payment? Have you gone to court there as well and when are you expecting the next regional tax court decisions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you mean when you say, clearly identified? I would say, what we know is what are the 50 to 60 projects &#x2013; initiatives that we believe will allow us to capture that number. They are not necessarily or they are not specified down to and these are the specific individuals, for example, that are impacted by that. But we do have a clear visibility on &#x2013; in what areas we do expect to realize the savings. So it's a gray zone where &#x2013; when are you at a point where you would say, oh, this is now clear enough.</p>
          <p>Of course in the U.K., it's clearer. There it's going to be implemented in the next three months. There are some other projects where we have a clear understanding on what the savings target is and also what's broadly speaking the different cost items are that are impacted and FTE impacts. But it's not yet that we can explicitly say, it is this, this and that, yeah? But it's not that we are still at the stage where we would say, well, we have a target of  &#x20AC;1.5 billion, and then we have 30 projects which in total add up to  &#x20AC;900 million so there still is a  &#x20AC;600 million gap. No. We do feel comfortable that we have identified the projects, the initiatives that will allow us to back the number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry, I should have been a bit more precise. Regarding the detailed plans you are going to present to the Supervisory Board, how much volume could these have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect to be able to backup the number that we targeted with projects. And as I said, it's not just 2 or 3, it's probably something like 50 to 60 projects which eventually will translate into some 8,000 or 10,000 individual measures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, that's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (66:19).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the timeline, and I understand you're asking with regard to the court decisions on the proceedings related to nuclear fuel tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is difficult to say. How can I &#x2013; yeah, it is a matter for the next year in particular because as you have seen whenever there we get an invoice, we initially would normally pay and then we basically immediately go to court and say we should not pay. And then you've seen how long it takes the court to come up with a view, typically a few months. Now the question is: will this process really continue this way when it's always the same question? Or &#x2013; and does that make sense? Or isn't there at some stage a case where one would say, okay, this is how we deal with it until the higher courts have clarified whether or not the fuel tax is legal?</p>
          <p>But I &#x2013; this is not just us to form a view there. I think this is something where there is &#x2013; yeah, the government and the respective tax authorities need to come up with a view, whether we always take this process as I described it, which again given that every plant will most likely have paid within the next 12 months and then you always have a few months to wait until you have the court decision. That I would say is the base case, maybe there is a way how to accelerate this but this we have to see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I just have one question. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (68:19) contract renegotiations, you've mentioned that 37% of contracts have been renegotiated. I take it that it's just as far as compensation, payments are confirmed, not the structural level of the contracts and also seemed that these are one-off compensation payments you get. How much was that at the nine-month stage?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lueder your line is quite bad but I took away that you're asking for the compensation payments that we have received &#x2013; that we have booked until nine-month stage. I think from memory, Marcus can correct me. I thought we have booked around &#x20AC;200 million at the half-year stage and let's say it was another &#x20AC;100 million in the third quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Had one question regarding the wording of your dividend outlook for fiscal year 2011, if you compare the wording on the dividend in the strategic and financial update as of August 10 was the wording in the nine-month report. You could interpret the later one as a sort of softening; i.e., in the strategic and financial update it is talked about a dividend floor, while in the current nine-month report only stated or talked about that you are planning a dividend of &#x20AC;1.00 for fiscal year 2011, so could you please clarify on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as I recall we always said, since August 10, that we &#x2013; our objective is to be able or to pay a dividend of &#x20AC;1.00 flat for the year 2011. Ultimately in a pure legal sense this is a decision that the shareholders need to take which is why we have to say that we planned to do this but it's the shareholders that have to take the decision. That is the only background why this is phrased this way. If there is a different way this is now worded then quite frankly, there is no intention to change this and please do not interpret any change into the language that is now being used in case that language is different from the language that was used at a different point in time. There's no change to what we said. We will make the proposal of the &#x20AC;1.00 and then the shareholders will have to decide.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Firstly, on the guidance in the trading business where you explained the deterioration, can you please help me to understand how much of that is of the now minus &#x20AC;0.5 billion to &#x20AC;0.7 billion is due to negative trends for prices in the optimization and what would be, let's say, the remaining part of that? And the second, is it &#x2013; it's just a minor thing but is it correct that if I look on the depreciation in nuclear business, that you have written down all assets there to zero and that there's no depreciation anymore or did you have any kind of special effects in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are &#x2013; there's no depreciation in the nuclear on your second question. And on your first question, the transfer price effect is roughly half, maybe a little bit less than that, than the entire data. And the other half is the sort of &#x2013; is where we see the realization of the lower achieved power prices. And we do see there also the effect that I mentioned that results from the low volatility, which we are seeing in particular since three months or so, which is not allowing us to realize the extrinsic value of the flexible fleet to the extent that we were able to capture that in the previous year.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I just have a follow-up question on Lueder's point on the gas compensation payments. I would be interested in how sustainable these payments are? Can we expect these payments to continue over the next quarters or will they stop after the gas business year is finished?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean the payment &#x2013; let's just make sure that we understand this correctly. I think that the payments that we have received allowed us to recover losses that were made in the past. In particular, we had this effect in the second quarter. We also had &#x2013; which was the bigger number that Sascha mentioned. There was also some effect in the third quarter, which was then as we said slightly lower. We have with some of the upstream partners' agreements that will give us benefit not just in 2011 going forward but also in 2012. I think we've said that in the past. And with some, we only had agreements on fixing the loss situation for 2011, where there are then discussions going on with regard to how the contracts should work going forward. This has been about changing essentially the pricing mechanisms. Those discussions are ongoing with some of the partners.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one question, just keen to know with potential investments in EDP how urgent you feel your disposals that are outstanding still are and whether you can give us an update on what's slowing around in the prices, whether that's URENCO open for Europe or, well, you take your pick. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't feel under pressure. There are two processes that I think we've publicly made it clear that we will initiate those shortly. One as you mentioned relates to Open Grid Europe and the other one relates to our energy from waste business. There I would expect those to be transactions that then take place next year.</p>
          <p>As it relates to URENCO, to the best of my knowledge there is no process in place. This is an asset that certainly from a strategic point of view no longer carries the same weight for us that it did carry until the German government decided to exit nuclear, whether or not that will at some point in time translate into us leaving that 17.5 position, too early to tell. There's no decision that has been taken and quite frankly this is also not something where decisions will be taken by us. As you will likely know, there are two governments, the U.K. and the Dutch, which are co-owners, together also with RWE and in particular I think we have to see how specifically the U.K. government wants to handle its position going forward. And once that is clarified I think then we will also have more clarity on what that means for us.</p>
