          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter 2010 financial results and outlook Conference Call. And with me today on the call are Mike White, our President and CEO; Larry Hunter, General Counsel; Pat Doyle, CFO; and Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America. In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Mike, Pat, and Bruce for some introductory remarks, but first I'll read to you the following.</p>
          <p>On this call we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in each of DIRECTV's and DIRECTV U.S.'s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and our other filings with the SEC which are available at www.sec.gov.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to most directly comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures which are attached to our earnings release and posted on our Web site at directv.com.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm pleased to introduce Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start with just a couple of opening remarks, and then I'm going to turn the call over to Pat Doyle and Bruce Churchill for additional color on both our U.S. and Latin America businesses.</p>
          <p>Overall, I think we got off to a terrific start in 2010, as our businesses in both Latin America and the United States turned in extremely strong first-quarter results, leading, as you saw this morning, to more than doubling our free cash flow to a record billion dollars, while our earnings per share nearly tripled to $0.59.</p>
          <p>Now with that said, I certainly would not suggest you just take our first quarter results and multiply them by four to predict our full-year outlook. Sooner or later, we will have to pay some taxes. However, it's clear that our businesses are demonstrating tremendous operating strength, and I think that positions us nicely to meet or exceed the full-year guidance we provided on our last earnings call.</p>
          <p>Let me first turn to the United States where I believe there are three key takeaways from the quarter. First, our top line results were strong and appear to have been modestly supported by the slowly improving consumer economy. Second, the significant increase in margins reflects the benefits we're capturing from DIRECTV's operating scale and efficiencies, as well as ongoing efforts to focus on more disciplined cost containment. And finally, fuelled by strong top line growth and expanding margins, DIRECTV is demonstrating the very substantial cash flow generating capability of our company.</p>
          <p>Let me touch on each of those three items. First, in terms of revenues. I was very pleased with our 11% growth. We did see some very encouraging trends in the quarter, particularly related to sales of premium movie channels, Pay Per View movies and events, as well as higher advertising revenues. Now, I'd attribute much of that improvement to better execution, but as the economy also continues to improve, customers do appear more willing to purchase additional content and premium services.</p>
          <p>Net subscriber additions of 100,000 were generally in line with our internal expectations. It's certainly still very competitive out there, but I would say no more so than the trends we saw in the fourth quarter. At DIRECTV, we all believe there's still plenty of growth left in the pay TV market, particularly when you consider both our differentiated advantages and our planned innovations.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the second half of the year and into next year, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll see favorable growth trends, particularly if the housing market expands and the competitive landscape remains stable. In addition, we're expecting to benefit from some more targeted marketing tactics that we're in the process of developing and implementing. I'm also particularly excited about several upcoming product launches that will once again demonstrate our leadership and innovation in the industry. I believe they will further strengthen both our brand and our reputation for delivering the best video experience in America.</p>
          <p>For instance, just a couple of weeks ago, we became the first video provider to offer national high definition distribution of Univision and TeleFutura. This is particularly important when you think about the World Cup which begins next month. And it also marked the beginning of DIRECTV's expansion to more than 160 high definition channels over the coming weeks. Next week, we officially roll out Multi-Room Viewing services, and then in June, we begin broadcasting in 3D.</p>
          <p>Now, much like with high definition a few years ago, we at DIRECTV intend to take a leadership position in 3D. Initially, we'll offer three dedicated 3D channels including ESPN 3D and our own channel named N3D. DIRECTV customers who have 3D televisions and equipment will be able to watch top-rated 3D movies as well as exciting sporting events such as the World Cup and Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In fact, just yesterday, you saw that we announced that DIRECTV will present the first-ever Major League Baseball telecast in 3D on July 10 and 11 when the New York Yankees take on the Seattle Mariners. And later in the summer, we'll introduce our enhanced DIRECTV Cinema service which will greatly expand the number of on-demand and pay per view movies we offer our customers. So as you can see, we'll be introducing a host of new products and services that we believe could potentially bolster both subscriber and ARPU growth as well as reduce churn.</p>
          <p>Now, I would point out that we don't expect the rate of growth that we experienced in the first quarter necessarily to continue for the balance of the year, due in part to a couple of one-time items that Pat will cover later on.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the cost side of the ledger. I think we've really done an excellent job managing our cost as you saw in the nearly 5 percentage point increase in our OPDA margin. You can look at practically every line on our income statement and see the specific actions that our teams have taken across DIRECTV to contain costs and in most cases grow margins. Upgrade and retention costs, which were down about 20% on a cash basis from prior year, is a good example where we struck a favorable economic balance between lower cost and slightly higher churn. The reduction in upgrade costs for existing customers is also related to the increased equipment investment that we're making at all of our new customers. About 70% of new subscribers in the first quarter signed up for HD and/or DVR services, which compares to about 60% a year ago. We believe that this strategy will not only help reduce churn in the long run but will reduce the likelihood of a customer calling us to upgrade one or two years down the road.</p>
          <p>Another area that's operating more efficiently are our call centers, where we've attained the highest service levels in years, yet when viewed on a per-subscriber basis, our costs &#x2013; our call center costs in the first quarter were down about 5%.</p>
          <p>Subscriber acquisition cost, SAC, was the one area that was slightly higher than we would have liked due to a conscious decision we made to respond to the challenging competitive conditions in the quarter. But also due to the aforementioned strategy of increasing our upfront investment in advanced equipment for new subscribers.</p>
          <p>Turning to DIRECTV Latin America, we had another great quarter across the board, and most notably I would say in the area of subscriber growth. As many of you will recall, unlike the United States, pay TV penetration in Latin America is quite low. I was just down to Brazil with Bruce Churchill and the team last week, and I was very excited with what I saw. I'd like to remind people that in Brazil, which is our fastest-growing market, less than 15% of households have pay television. Add to that a relatively stable macroeconomic environment plus the region's best TV experience, and you can understand why we're seeing unprecedented subscriber growth in Latin America.</p>
          <p>The growth is diversified from both an economic and geographic perspective. Economically, we're getting the best subscribers at the higher income levels through our superior HD and DVR offerings, and we're also doing well attacking the middle market segments with our popular prepaid and lower-priced post-paid packages we launched earlier this year. DIRECTV Latin America's growth is also geographically diversified through our pan-regional presence and from the fact that we're growing in both young and more mature markets. For instance, it might surprise you to hear that some of our best-performing countries in the quarter were Ecuador and Colombia, which is quite a turnaround from a year ago where we were uncompetitive in those markets. And as good as our results were in the first quarter, I'm looking for even better numbers in the second quarter when we begin our unparalleled coverage of the World Cup. In a few minutes, Bruce will provide you with more details about Latin America, so let me just wrap up my update on a couple of important other items.</p>
          <p>First, as we mentioned on our last earnings call, one of our top priorities is developing a strategy for returning capital to shareholders. We've made a lot of good progress with that strategy and Pat's going to provide you with some more details in a few minutes. Also on the last call, I said that we'd begin a company-wide strategic review in the spring. We're making great progress in that area. We plan to present our recommendations to our board of directors in the summer, and after that we'll host an Investor Day in the fall to provide you with a much more detailed view of both our businesses and our outlook.</p>
          <p>Earlier I also shared with you some of the products we'll be launching over the coming months. Discussions with our board have been more long-term focused and with a particular emphasis on the steps we're taking to achieve our goal of delivering DIRECTV whenever and wherever our customers want it. And we'll have more to say about that this fall as well.</p>
          <p>In summary, now that we've completed the first full quarter since becoming DIRECTV's CEO, I can honestly say that our assets, our balance sheet, and most importantly, the talented people all across DIRECTV, are even better and stronger than I'd anticipated. More importantly, I think, so are our opportunities for continued future growth. I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months as we continue to share our strategies for increasing shareholder value.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Bruce Churchill to review our DIRECTV Latin America first quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Mike. On the last earnings call, talked a lot about our record-setting subscriber growth throughout the regions. I'm happy to say that I'm able to reuse much of the speech I gave last quarter, as our subscriber results in Q1 were even better. When I spoke with all of you about Q4, I spoke about an all-time record of 460,000 gross additions. Well in Q1 of this year, gross additions were up 34% versus last year <mark type="inaudible" /> and the reasons behind the success are very similar to those I shared with you a few months ago.</p>
          <p>Higher end of the market, growth continued to be driven by increasing sales of our industry-leading HD and DVR services. About 30% of our new customers signed up for advanced services in the quarter. That's about three times the level of a year ago and up 5 percentage points from the <mark type="inaudible" /> rates in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year growth is split fairly evenly between HD and DVR service.</p>
          <p>HD growth remains strong in Brazil where we offer three times as many HD channels as anyone else, and HD has picked up steam in Pan Americana as well where we have been expanding our offering. Increase in DVR sales has been particularly strong in countries such as Argentina and Colombia. And as I discussed in my response to a question last quarter, I would just like to reiterate that the success we're having in both HD and DVR is a testament to the competitive advantage we've created in Latin America by leveraging the set-top box technology developed by DIRECTV U.S. It enables us to get to market with better products sooner at a lower cost.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing strong growth from our strategy to aggressively go after the middle market segment. It has much lower penetration rates for pay TV services in Latin America than the upper segment. Core of this strategy focuses on three main marketing tactics: prepaid packages, lower priced post-paid packages, and the bundling of our service where possible with the local telco. In terms of prepaid services, we've had the greatest success in the countries such as Venezuela and more recently Colombia, Chile, and Ecuador. Venezuela represents a country where we've offered prepaid services for the longest period of time, and as such, prepaid penetration has reached over 30% of total subscribers in that country. From a DTVLA consolidated perspective, prepaid subscribers as a percent of total gross adds have been running in the 20-plus percent range. We expect that level to continue for the balance of the year. In addition, lower priced post-paid packages have been extremely popular in Brazil, and we've had some early success bundling DIRECTV with local telcos in Colombia and Argentina.</p>
          <p>Turning now to churn. Our monthly rate is modestly higher than a year ago, but that increase is almost entirely due to the initial instability surrounding the currency devaluation in Venezuela. In particular, the instability impacted prepaid churn the most. However, we remain cautiously optimistic that the atmosphere of uncertainty created by the devaluation in Venezuela will diminish with the passage of time and that more normal market conditions will prevail for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Excluding prepaid churn, our consolidated post-paid churn in the region is extremely strong. It declined about 10 basis points from the prior year, 1.56%. I attribute most of this improvement to the increased sales of HD and DVR services as well as our more focused upgrades and retention package.</p>
          <p>Even with the challenges in Venezuela, our financial results were quite strong in the quarter. 30% increase at the top line was mostly due to subscriber growth, where we also saw some favorable pricing trends in the quarter. About three-quarters of our 9.5% ARPU growth was related to price increases and higher sales from advanced services. The remaining portion of ARPU growth was foreign exchange related, and the benefits gained in Brazil were only partially offset by the devaluation in Venezuela. OPDA was also very solid, as it more than doubled over last year's results. The majority of the growth was due to the gross profit and the incremental revenues as well as lower charges related to the timing of repatriating cash from Venezuela.</p>
          <p>In terms of our full-year outlook, it's too early in the year to revise our financial guidance. However, we feel that our first quarter performance is a good piece of evidence that supports our bullish outlook for the balance of the year. As Mike mentioned, certainly the second quarter should be another strong quarter. <mark type="inaudible" /> the World Cup kicks off in South Africa on June 11. We expect to take advantage of the excitement around this event and deliver our record number of gross and net adds for the quarter, which should be the high watermark for the year. The challenge will be to hold onto these subscribers during the balance of the year, particularly in the prepaid segment. However, this issue is already on our radar screen, and we've been through this before, so I'm confident the vast majority of those subscribers will choose to stay with DIRECTV even after the excitement of the World Cup subsides.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to bring your attention to two additional points: Those of you who were on the call with Televisa last week will know that our affiliate SKY Mexico had a tenfold increase in net additions, to about 240,000 subscribers in the first quarter, largely on the back of their recently launched prepaid product DTV.</p>
          <p>Including these results, our Latin America platform now exceeds 7 million subscribers. I would just like to add that we crossed the 1 million subscriber mark in both Argentina and Venezuela this quarter. So it's quite clear that growth remains strong throughout the entire region. Secondly, I would just like to note that our company SKY Brazil was just awarded the Brazilian equivalent of the J.D. Power award for best service provider in the communications industry. This is the eighth year in the row that SKY Brazil has won this award. I highlight this award to make a point that even with our growth, we still remain very much focused on providing the best customer experience in the business.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll conclude my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bruce. From a financial perspective, I thought that our Q1 results were as good as any quarter in our history. Our revenue growth was solid, but I thought our management of cost and margins were even stronger. And the free cash flow growth speaks for itself.</p>
          <p>Looking first at the top line for DIRECTV U.S., industry-leading revenue growth of $0.11 &#x2013; 11% was solid and was mostly driven by ARPU, which at 85.47 was a touch higher than our internal target. As Mike mentioned, we're seeing much better results in premiums, Pay Per View, and video on demand movies as well as in Pay Per View events. As we've shared with you in the past, the buy rates for many of these revenue categories have been declining for years, and our goal has been to reverse this trend or to at least slow the rate of decline. I believe we are doing just that, and our team has done a terrific job getting these important revenue categories back on the right track.</p>
          <p>Also contributing to ARPU growth was our annual price increase which we accelerated by one month this year, higher NFL SUNDAY TICKET revenues due to the January game, increased revenues from HD and DVR services, as well as greater advertising revenues.</p>
          <p>Net subscriber additions of 100,000 were generally in line with our expectations, as both gross additions and churn were consistent with internal projections. On our last earnings call, we mentioned that gross additions this year would probably be lower than last year. We expect this year-over-year decline to be most pronounced in the first quarter due mainly to the one-time benefit gained last year from the digital transition.</p>
          <p>Many of the stricter credit measures we've implemented over the past several quarters continue to yield positive results. The overall credit quality of new subscribers remains high, and our customers continue to purchase advanced services at an industry-leading rate. As a point of reference, our penetration of HD and DVR services is now north of 60% of total subscribers, or about 50% higher than the largest cable company's penetration of about 40%.</p>
          <p>Another trend worth noting is the lower contribution from our telco partners. Last year, the telcos reached as high as 25% of total gross additions, and during this past quarter, their share dipped below 20%. This decline is related to several factors, including the continued rollout of FiOS and U-verse, as well as the rapid decline in their land lines which results in fewer incoming calls and sales opportunities at their call centers.</p>
          <p>Looking briefly at churn, the year-over-year increase in the first quarter was a bit higher than the previous two quarters. However, we're quite pleased with this level for a couple of reasons. First, although the competitive environment last quarter was comparable to the fourth quarter, it was much more challenging than a year ago. Second, we've done a good job managing the tradeoff between modestly higher churn and lower upgrade and retention costs. We continue to prioritize our best offer to our best customers, and as a result, we believe that most of the increase in churn is related to lower quality subscribers who have a greater propensity to shop around for the best deal. The bottom line is that this level of churn is consistent with our target range for the full year of between 1.5 and 1.6% per month.</p>
          <p>Turning now to cost. As I mentioned, this was clearly one of our greatest strengths in the quarter, as the nearly 5 point increase in OPDA margin was the largest year-over-year improvement since we implemented the lease model for set-top boxes in early 2006. A portion of the margin growth was due to the decline in gross additions. However, with the exception of SAC, every other line item on our income statement came in better than our internal targets.</p>
          <p>The largest contributor to our increase in pre-SAC margin was upgrade and retention marketing, which from a cash perspective, declined 79 million or 20% to the lowest level in two years. This rather significant reduction, particularly considering our larger subscriber base, is primarily due to the increased investment in SAC for new customers, increased usage of refurbished boxes, and lower manufacturing costs for new equipment.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing solid results in subscriber services. The performance in our call centers and installation network is particularly rewarding because of the compounding benefit. That is, we're achieving higher service levels at a relatively lower cost, but more importantly, the customer experience is greatly enhanced which should drive lower churn in the future.</p>
          <p>In addition, we did a good job managing programming cost, as our first quarter margin was relatively flat versus a year ago despite the increase in premium and Pay Per View revenues which generally have lower margins. Also in the quarter, we saw a decline in capital expenditures related to set-top boxes, which, combined with double digit revenue growth and expanding margins, drove substantial free cash flow growth in the quarter. The nearly 1 billion of free cash flow was not only a record for DIRECTV U.S., but was almost double last year's result.</p>
          <p>I'd like to wrap up my opening remarks with a few comments about our outlook and strategy for returning capital to shareholders. Our strong first quarter results provide us with greater confidence that we will meet or exceed the full-year guidance provided on our last earnings call. It's worth noting, however, that the revenue and OPDA growth profile this year is in many ways the opposite of last year's results. In other words, DIRECTV's first quarter 2009 revenue and OPDA growth were the lowest of the year and generally improved throughout the year. Obviously that profile impacts our growth rates this year. Also keep in mind that we benefited from a few one-time items in the first quarter, including revenue for the additional NFL game, lower charges for repatriating cash out of Venezuela, and the gain related to the unwinding of the Bank of America collar.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash flow, as you saw in our release, tax payments in the first quarter were quite modest. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect free cash flow growth to be impacted by higher tax payments, compared to both the prior quarter and prior year, primarily due to the increase in our pre-tax earnings. Our goal, however, is to manage DIRECTV's cash tax rate at roughly the same level as last year, despite the unfavorable impact due to the reversal of benefits gained from the previous two economic stimulus packages.</p>
          <p>In terms of DIRECTV's strategy for returning capital, I'd like to first point out that our top priority for creating shareholder value remains to reinvest in our core businesses. Our second priority is to return excess free cash flow and liquidity to shareholders in a timely manner. In that regard, our board approved our plan to reach a leverage target of 2.5 times total debt to DIRECTV U.S. OPDA by the end of next year. Reaching this leverage target within the next year and a half will obviously be impacted by market conditions and our ability to tap the debt markets at reasonable rates. In addition to executing on our plan to reach 2.5 times leverage, we'll also evaluate ways to further increase liquidity by utilizing DIRECTV Latin America's rapidly growing OPDA.</p>
          <p>In terms of returning capital, at this time we prefer repurchasing shares over other means based on a variety of factors including our stock price, the favorable spread between our after-tax cost of debt and free cash flow yield, and other tax considerations. Through yesterday, we had repurchased just over 1 billion of stock so far this year, leaving about 2.5 billion on our current $3.5 billion authorization. We have not ruled out other options for returning capital and we will continue to assess and review the merits of these with our board on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>So at this time, I'm going to turn the call back to Jon so that we can begin our Q&amp;A session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pat. And before moving on to Q&amp;A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in a listen-only mode. I'd like to remind the media that they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call either directly or in substance other than the representatives of DIRECTV. In addition, we're webcasting this call live on the Internet and an archived copy will be kept on our Web site.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, we're ready for the first question.</p>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>-- afternoon. Actually this is Todd Chanko standing in for Doug. In terms of interactive advertising, you recently announced a deal with &#x2013; or rather an agreement with DISH to launch an interactive advertising platform. Some questions about that. How is it going? What are your expectations? And also could you tell us a bit more about subscriber use and uptake of the DIRECT ACTIVE platform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first touch on the &#x2013; we're real pleased with this interactive advertising venture. The cable guys have had something with Canoe that they've been working. It's fairly early days, so I probably would say it's a bit premature to comment on how it's going.</p>
          <p>Suffice it to say we are looking at a number of different strategies, of which that's only one, to strengthen our advertising platform. Clearly I think we're looking at addressable ads, we're looking at other ways to get ads through the set-top box and the satellite, as well as the interactive ad venture that we've got with DISH, and we're excited about being able to bring to advertisers over 30 million subscribers between the two of us. We think it will be a terrific opportunity for advertisers, and in a strengthening advertising market which we've seen across the board, I think it's going to be a terrific addition for us this year. But I would say it's a bit premature, and frankly I don't think -- one way or the other, it wouldn't impact our guidance.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'm probably going to embarrass myself by asking this question, but I'll ask it anyway. Regarding your leverage, the 2.5 times, is that a net target, or is that on gross debt? And then -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jason, that's on gross debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. And then just from a practical standpoint, if you guys do decide to buy back stock with the lion's share of the capital that you're going to raise, what's the practical limit in terms of how many shares you think you can buy back, based on sort of prevailing trading volumes and all of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think &#x2013; if you kind of look at our expected profile, both cash generation and liquidity from the issuance of debt, I don't &#x2013; we don't feel like there's any issue. I mean, our restrictions are probably somewhere around 2 million shares a day...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; that we could repurchase. I mean, we haven't been anywhere up in that range, but even at half of that, at a million shares a day, you can kind of see it equates into a very substantial dollar amount of repurchases over that period.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from Barclays Capital, James Ratfield.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>James Ratcliffe. Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. When you talk about return of capital, clearly buybacks are your focus. But could you also talk through the both appeal and feasibility of tenders and one-time or regular dividends?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if you could talk a little bit about how the &#x2013; if at all, the mix of both disconnects and acquisitions has shifted the last few quarters among cable, DISH, and telco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jason; it's Mike. Let me start on the first one, then Pat can &#x2013; James; sorry &#x2013; Pat can chime in as well. As we've looked at it &#x2013; again, this is a bit of a work in process in terms of our strategy review with our board of directors. What became very clear to us, though, in the work that we were doing is that our very first priority should be to get our balance sheet to the appropriate leverage level, if you will, for being an investment-grade company. And that &#x2013; hence that is the focus of what we were talking about today, and we felt it would be helpful to communicate a clear date by which we plan to be there.</p>
          <p>Now as we look at that, as is Pat said, first of all, frankly given just the tax constraints we're under, we've got plenty of room to accomplish that on share buyback kind of just open market purchases. We are clearly and will continue to look at a number of other ways that we could get there and evaluate what's in the company and the shareholders' best interest, in terms of whether you do tenders or that kind of thing. It's not really needed to get to where we want to get to, but we're looking at all the &#x2013; any kind of financial instruments that would make sense we'll obviously be assessing. But we can get there with open market purchases.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the question of dividends, frankly, first and foremost I think is &#x2013; our priority should be to get our balance sheet set properly. We can then have a conversation about whether we are 100% share buyback or some mix of dividends and buyback at that time, I'm sure we've all looked at dividend practices before, and in my view at least, it's going to be heavily influenced by what the federal government does with tax rates on dividends, as at least one important consideration for some of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>But we haven't made a decision on that one way or the other. I think it's a little premature. But certainly as we work through our strategy this summer, we'll probably have more to say on it either later this year or early next year. Certainly we'll talk about more specifics about our share repurchase, but for right now, I would say our focus is on continuing our open market purchase program.</p>
          <p>Pat, anything you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I think, James, what &#x2013; when we look at this analysis internally, we feel very comfortable that there's a lot of value to be returned to the shareholders by continuing an aggressive share repurchase program. We got a lot of bandwidth left on &#x2013; before we would even run into a question of, is there a better way to return capital to the shareholders. But like Mike said, we're going to continue to look at all of the facts as we move along, kind of how are we going to raise debt, how much, and what position does that put us in, and does our share repurchase strategy still make sense under changing circumstances. But right now we feel very, very comfortable that there's a lot of value to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question, James, that you touched on, which is kind of the mix of our subscriber acquisition/disconnect and what trends in the marketplace. Clearly it continues to be very competitive out there. I don't think I would single out one competitor or another. As Pat highlighted, we have seen a bit elevated churn levels in territories where FiOS and U-verse are being rolled out. I would say our churn levels were pretty close to in line, maybe a tad higher, than what we would have liked in the first quarter, but frankly, the trends we've seen since the end of the first quarter are very encouraging. And I have to &#x2013; hasten to add that some of the strategies that we've put in place to manage churn, which is to encourage more loyalty, really weren't getting fully put into place until the end of the first quarter. So some of the benefits of that should kick in in the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>I would say the key thing for us -- there's no Nielsen out there like I'm used to looking at from my consumer products days, to look at share trends in that level of detail. But we're very pleased. We're right in line with our expectations on both gross and net adds. And as I look at the balance of the year, also the quality of the adds, as Pat said, 70% are taking advanced services. So we're continuing to see very, very positive trends in terms of the quality of the subscribers we're bringing on, and I think as we roll out our World Cup in Latin America and some of our new products like our relaunch of Cinema, our Multi-Room Viewing, and connected home initiatives in the balance of the year, we're going to have a lot of good innovation to talk to customers about.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Since you're using the Internet for your VOD product, how does reclassification, if it happens to Title II, impact you? I assume you're not immune to this. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Then secondly, with ARPU up 6.4%, how do we think about this going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Marci. Let me take the first one. Pat, you might want to comment on the ARPU for the balance of the year, because there are some one-time items there in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>But Marci, the &#x2013; this whole announcement of the FCC's new approach was really kind of just yesterday, and frankly, the devil will be in the details. I haven't seen the specifics of the proposal yet. I think what's clear to us is that I don't think it would impact our DIRECTV strategy. We're continuing to focus on making sure that we can enable all of our customers to connect their television to the Internet, which does enable us to offer more variety for our video on demand as well as some exciting TV apps that we'll be talking about later on this year.</p>
          <p>So from our standpoint, I think we probably don't have a dog in that hunt, but I'll turn the &#x2013; on the ARPU thing, I'll turn that to you, Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you look at the first quarter ARPU, the one additional January NFL game was probably &#x2013; it was about a full percentage point of ARPU growth. And then I think as we mentioned, we moved up our annual price increase with &#x2013; about a month which was kind of another point.</p>
          <p>But having said that, we were very pleased with our ARPU growth in the first quarter. As we mentioned, there were a lot of categories that were kind of dragging us down last year that are now positive. The guidance that we gave for the year is we clearly expected ARPU to be up in 2010, versus the about 2% ARPU growth that we had last year. We now feel obviously even more confident about a year-over-year growth in that, but wouldn't want to get into any other specific percentages.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Hi. Sorry. Just a couple of questions. One related to satellite replacement. Could you just update us on what we should be thinking about over the course of the next few years in terms of satellite that you plan to launch for business and any replacements that are going to be needed, and kind of how much of an issue that could be?</p>
          <p>And then two, just to follow up on the net versus gross question that was asked earlier. You're obviously going to generate a ton of cash over the course of the next few years. You're talking about a gross debt leverage, but it seems like 50 to 60% of the debt that you would layer on to get to that target, you're actually going to net down with cash generated, and just curious why you're focusing on the gross debt versus the net debt as you think about the &#x2013; kind of the target? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, on -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you, Pat, you can talk about our CapEx levels on satellite placement, Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so on the satellite replacement, in our board meeting recently, they did approve us moving forward to procure another satellite, DIRECTV 14. I mean, we view that as kind of &#x2013; we're very happy with our fleet, and if you look at the average life of our fleet, but because the procurement period and build period is so long for a satellite, we felt it was prudent to start to begin thinking about replacement/back-up.</p>
          <p>Having said that, just because the payments on satellites are spread over the construction period, we still feel comfortable that that fits into the kind of 5 to 600 million of kind of non-set-top box CapEx that we've talked about before. Like I said, I think we'll probably &#x2013; once the D 14 gets done or close to done, we may be thinking about another one. So we may be on a cycle where we've kind of got a satellite being built all the time. But again, the payments would not be material in the big scheme of things of our CapEx.</p>
          <p>On the net and gross, Rich, so what &#x2013; the way we look at it, I mean when we get to kind of the equilibrium that we're looking for, ideally we would like to be at some minimum cash balance for our business, and let's &#x2013; we characterize that probably somewhere between 500 million and a billion dollars of cash on hand. So we don't really &#x2013; when we look at &#x2013; when you talk about gross and net, from our standpoint, they will squeeze down to a very small number over time, because our goal would be to redistribute or return all of the excess cash, which would include cash generated from the business, cash generated from these financings, down to kind of a minimum cash on hand that we would keep on the balance sheet. So I don't &#x2013; I mean, we really look at it at gross, because again, our goal is to work ourselves down to an appropriate minimum cash balance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, as Pat pointed out in his remarks, look, this is a work in process and our cash flow is a work in process. Obviously as cash flows grow, that'll &#x2013; that's one area that we'd look at, and second, as Pat said, Latin America has cash that's not included. But we need to look at our tax strategies there. So we're looking at all these things, but we simply felt it was prudent at this time to be clear that this &#x2013; that our intent was to get to that leverage target by the end of next year through share buyback. What we do beyond that, I'm just saying, is premature for us to come forward with. We'll be continuing to look at that and discuss that with our board this summer.</p>

Forgive me if I can't concentrate with this meltdown we're seeing here in the market, but the &#x2013; I guess the &#x2013; my question is &#x2013; I guess it's less and less relevant, but the &#x2013; with the Frontier Verizon deal and the CenturyTel Quest deals pending, you're losing or could potentially could lose a portion of your wholesale distribution with those &#x2013; with the sellers. Are there any &#x2013; first of all, I guess this is a two-part question. First of all, are there any protections in your current contracts that sort of extend your relationships with the sellers beyond the date of a transaction?</p>
          <p>And then two, do you get a chance to potentially form a new relationship with the buyers? Is there any discussions going on that could potentially allow you to actually extend the relationships in your wholesale distribution? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Good morning if you're out west. I wanted to ask Mike, last quarter we talked about balancing growth and profitability and how you sort of thought about those two. And at least this quarter, if I look at your numbers, it seems to me you skewed maybe a little bit more towards profitability. You clearly showed the pricing power of DIRECTV's product, but you also managed the costs aggressively, and as you acknowledged earlier, churn may have been a little higher than expected. Could you just sort of update us on how you're thinking about those tradeoffs, now that you're a few more months into the game? And then I have a follow-up for Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I &#x2013; well I mean it's a real-time kind of thing you look at, and actually we look at it on a weekly basis, in terms of have we got the right balance. And I think that, as I said earlier, there are a number of initiatives that we've put in place to improve our retention, some of which didn't hit until either the end of the first quarter or even the beginning of the second quarter. But I think it's a balancing act. We're quite comfortable that we have done the prudent thing financially in terms of our pricing decision, that we still have a great value for consumers, and again, we still had 925,000 gross adds in the first quarter. That's a lot of gross adds, even if it's a little bit below prior year in an absolute sense.</p>
          <p>So to be honest with you, I actually was quite happy with the gross adds. I think we're working &#x2013; continuing to work on the churn, and as I said, the good news on the churn is, some of those initiatives that we put in late in the quarter are already taking effect, and we have seen some improvement in the second quarter already on our churn number. So I think &#x2013; I feel pretty good about the balance. I still feel that our most important priority is to continue to retain our great subscribers that have been loyal over the years and then continue to bring the service to others as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And just Pat, going back to the balance sheet, I have one question about the 3.5 billion buyback plans you announced last quarter. Is that the limit you can do this year? Are you still planning to do that this year? Any update there?</p>
          <p>And then you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that you might be able to extract more cash or put some leverage at DLA? I just wanted to know if you could sort of size that up or help us think about how you're looking at that opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yeah, so on the 3.5 billion, I think we've talked before about just trying to make sure we keep kind of down the middle of the fairway on some of the tax rules. I think we clearly are, but we also think if we finish the 3.5 billion before the end of the year, that we could add on to it and continue to do a little bit more share repurchase before the end of the year in addition to the 3.5.</p>
          <p>In thinking about Latin America, we've talked to the rating agencies. Again, we've got kind of a lot of work ahead of us on just getting the U.S. leverage up to 2.5 times. But we're just kind of looking at, as Latin America again continues to grow, continues to grow EBITDA, free cash flow, today they're not generating that much because they're in a heavy growth mode, but we think by kind of the time we get to the end of '011, that DIRECTV Latin America would be another asset that would allow us to either put it into a combined credit or look at other options to also leverage up that EBITDA at 2.5 times, to kind of continue to be able to return cash to the shareholders.</p>
          <p>So a lot of work left on that, but we certainly have done a fair amount of exploring and talking to the rating agencies as well about our options.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Just had a question, I guess, as you look at second quarter. If my math is correct, it appears we could see negative net adds in the second quarter, and that's assuming a smaller year-over-year increase in churn as compared to the first quarter and kind of a similar sequential change in gross adds as we've seen historically in the second quarter. I guess what I wanted ask is that the right way to think about it, that &#x2013; or do you think that the improvement that you're seeing in churn in the second quarter so far is going to be enough to keep net adds positive into the second quarter? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well certainly I'll start and then Pat, you can chime in. Let me be clear, Bryan, we're not expecting a negative quarter in the second quarter on net adds. You can always have something happen in the economy or the competitive environment or even the market, I guess, as is happening as we speak that could change that, but that is certainly not our expectation, first of all. And second of all, as I mentioned, one of the key elements, which is churn, is already &#x2013; appears to be improving over the first quarter a bit. So certainly from my standpoint, that is not my expectation. I still expect we'll see a positive quarter.</p>
          <p>Anything, Pat?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. Two questions. Since the exit of Dr. Malone, have the credit agencies changed their tone on what's a reasonable target leverage for you guys? And is there any realistic reason why your target leverage level shouldn't be close to something, say, like a Time Warner Cable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, first of all, we haven't had a discussion with the credit agencies since then. I'm sure they'll continue to evolve their assessment of us. But I think that's a judgment for the credit agencies to make, but it isn't lost on us that one could look at it at a slightly higher EBITDA leverage target down the road. Again, first things first. Let's get our balance sheet at least to where we've been approved by the credit agencies at 2.5. I think we then take a look at the entire external environment and decide where we ought to go from there. But we're certainly aware of where TWC is, and for right now, I would say our focus is just get our balance sheet appropriately leveraged so then we can kind of proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one on DISH. One of the reasons they've been doing better is they've got great success among the independent dealers. What are you guys doing to try to reverse that trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we had a terrific convention called Revolution with our dealers in Dallas that I spoke at a couple weeks ago. We showed them a lot of new products, a lot of innovation, and a lot of new programs that we're quite excited about. And so I mean, the dealers are a very important part of our network and ecosystem here. We value what they do. I had a chance to meet with a number of them, both individually and collectively, in Dallas, and they all seem very enthusiastic about the new services that we were talking about, Multi-Room Viewing, the DVR scheduler app that we have on the iPhone, as well as the training materials that we were providing them and kind of the deals that we have with them. So I'm actually quite optimistic about how our dealer network will perform balance of year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, as part of the reason why you had that targeted marketing program, is that specifically focused on the dealer network? Or is that something beyond that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we're looking at each of our channels, and I'll leave it at that for right now.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Todd Rethemeier from Hudson Square Research.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one quick question. I noticed the G&amp;A cost dropped almost 20% sequentially on a consolidated basis. Just wondering what was going on there, and if &#x2013; what's a good run rate to use for the rest of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't pay any of the management. No. Sorry. Pat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think if you're looking at a consolidated basis, we had the effects of the &#x2013; of in Venezuela, of the transaction losses of repatriating cash out of Venezuela. I think kind of from an overall perspective, as we look at G&amp;A outside of one-time items, we certainly are &#x2013; our goal is that G&amp;A grows at a rate that's slower than the revenue growth, that ideally we'd like it to be a lot slower than the revenue growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll now go back to Tom Eagan from Collins Stewart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thank you. Just to revisit the question on competition. Where do you see your voluntary churn subscribers going? Are they going again to DISH? Are they going to cable, or to telco? I noticed that DISH has rolled out a pretty aggressive promotion over the past month, and if you've seen it, any impact on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't seen any impact from that promotion, Tom, and frankly when you look at where they're going, it's pretty equal across the board. It's not one versus another. As I said, you see somewhat higher churn rates in areas where there's a kind of a major rollout going on from either FiOS or from U-verse, although the FiOS territories are kind of now settling down. So I don't think I could kind of point to one specific competitor or another. I think it's very clear, there's lots of competitors in our video space. We all compete hard for the customer, and the best way we can compete is to continue to innovate with new products and services and provide a great value for our subscribers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just lastly, if you could talk about where you are in your discussions with TiVo about rolling out any new service? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, we've had an ongoing series of meetings with Tom Rogers and the TiVo team earlier this year. We're in the process of working with them. We've provided them specs for our box, and I think we expect them to have a box for us, an updated box, maybe the end of this year or maybe early next year. I probably don't know the specific date that Tom's got targeted, but we're working closely with them, and certainly expecting to see a new box out of them that would work on DIRECTV sometime in the not-too-distant future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any thoughts on how the service or the features would differ from what the TiVo is rolling out now with RCN?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be honest with you, we're all working on a lot of the same things. I mean, we've got demos that we've looked at internally that include television apps that would enable you to look at YouTube on the television, that would enable you to do things with movies and photos, that do video on demand. So a lot of the same, what I'll call, the connected experience across your screens, we believe, is quite strategic, and it's something that we'll talk about as we kind of complete our strategy later this year. But the good news is we've been working on this area over the last year or two, both with our Home Media Center and our Multi-Room Viewing, and you'll see more of that later this year.</p>
          <p>But to be honest with you, I didn't see anything in the functions and features, and we did see a demo of it, that was materially different in functions and features than the kinds of functions and features we've been looking to build into our Home Media Center and our connected lifestyle initiative.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Our next question come will come from Matt Harrigan from Wunderlich Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Down $0.03 stock performance ever, firstly. Hey, you made a passing comment, I think being a little bit coy, about the targeted marketing initiatives fairly shortly. Would that be relating to the MDU side as you've crafted more of a marketing and a tech strategy for that?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I think Mike alluded to taking a disciplined approach perhaps to looking at some new international markets even beyond Latin America if the opportunity really presented itself as part of your strategic review. With everything going on right now and you being on such firm footing relative to some other players, would you selectively look at some international markets, or do you think it's just too crazy in this world we're in right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, on your first question, and I think I just said generally that we're looking at channels or some targeted holistic strategies, and certainly areas like commercial and MDU are certainly among those areas that we're working on for those kinds of things. So I wouldn't say it's only that. But suffice it to say, what we &#x2013; we think it's really important that we retain our good subscribers, first and foremost, so retention strategies is first on the priority list. And then second, they're looking for selected channels and strategies where we might grow our business, and MDU is a good example of that. But I think it's a bit premature for me to go into any more specifics on &#x2013; than that at this time.</p>
          <p>On the international question, we did do some work. Bruce Churchill and his team did it, kind of a bit of a scan around the world, and we've done some preliminary thinking and discussing about the findings of that were. To be honest with you, one of the first observations I guess after we got done with the review that I had, was, boy, Latin America's even better than I thought. I mean, both because of the opportunities that we have to invest down there, and second, because in so many other countries, there are significant restrictions on foreign ownership.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In a number of cases, you can't have any. And so I think frankly our conclusion was, after a look-see, that there may be opportunities down the road in emerging markets that will pop up and we will continue to look at them outside of Latin America, but I didn't see anything imminent or of a focus that we would chase immediately. As I said, if anything, I think both Bruce's and my conclusion was, boy, let's double-down in Latin America. We got a great opportunity there and we have a reasonably favorable regulatory environment for pay TV, and still tremendous penetration growth potential, and also new products and services potential: bundling, Internet, content, all kinds of ways that we can play.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At the bell. All right, guys. Just a quick question on your thoughts on gross adds. Obviously second quarter potentially, at least on a year-over-year basis, pressure by the DTV last year, but what should we be thinking about in third and fourth quarter of the year on gross add basis when compared to last year?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean again, we haven't given out any specific gross add targets for the year. I mean like I said, I think that we expect gross adds to be down year-over-year as we go through the year. I think as I said in my notes, I think the first quarter was kind of the toughest year-over-year comparison with not only digital transition, but we had kind of a blowout first quarter in Q1 of '09 when the competition was a little bit on their backs and we took advantage of that. So we're out &#x2013; and haven't given out any specific guidance, but down year-over-year, but again, not on a percentage basis as much as the first.</p>
