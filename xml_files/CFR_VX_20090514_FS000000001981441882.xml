          <p>Good morning everybody, welcome to Geneva. Thank you for coming this morning. I appreciate your time. We have the Richemont financial year, 31st March 2009 results presentation. I'd like to introduce to you, this morning, Mr. Johann Rupert, our Executive Chairman; Mr. Norbert Platt, Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Lepeu, Chief Financial Officer who will be presenting to you on the results.</p>
          <p>I could just use &#x2013; make the usual comment about mobile phones. If you could make sure they're switched off, so that they don't interfere with the microphones and the Internet broadcast.</p>
          <p>So welcome everyone. I hand you over now to Mr. Rupert, Mr. Platt and Mr. Lepeu.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. You don't have to worry about your mobile phones, because there is no signal down here in any case. Alan, in case you haven't noticed. I see there are very few people here. I gather it's LVMH's general meeting today at the same time. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Internet broadcast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Internet broadcast. Well, what we feared over the past few years and communicated with you has clearly occurred. We do have a major economic contraction, a slowdown, a credit crunch, or as a friend of mine's blonde wife said we have a credit card crunch, which I thought was quite a beautiful description.</p>
          <p>Now the bad news is it's real. Anybody who knows when it's got an end has got a line to the almighty that I do not have an extension too. Because I can assure you, we don't see any green shoots of recovery. And I'm talking across the world in all industries, people that I speak to, whether they be in the luxury automobile industry, whether they be &#x2013; whether it be Sotheby's, Christie's, the wining people who sell on premier wines. And I think it's going to be with us for a while.</p>
          <p>The good news is that we started quite a while to prepare Richemont for this eventuality, and as a result, due to the good work, Norbert, Richard and Gary Saage and all of our colleagues, we've got a very clean balance sheet and we have liquidity, both inside Richemont, and if I dare say, at the family company above Richemont, so that you will see in our dividends that even though Richemont's share over the year ago would have had &#x2013; even despite the decline of sterling versus the euro, and translated into Swiss francs, if Richemont shareholder had kept the shares, he or she would have had a small increase in dividends even during these tough times.</p>
          <p>And despite that small increase, you will notice that our dividend cover is still our normal prudent cover, which leads to the obvious conclusion that as in the past we're putting more money into the company to support the Maisons, where by the way you will see this little R, because we have actually registered our Maisons, because when Alain Perrin came with DNA and everybody started using <mark type="inaudible" />. So, we actually &#x2013; Frederick Mostert did register Maisons for us.</p>
          <p>But this should give you confidence that we here, for the medium to long term, we're supporting the Maisons. The brand equity is supporting our colleagues. And during this period, however long it might take, we intend also looking on our service to our clients.</p>
          <p>I think it's best summarized &#x2013; one of our colleagues who runs Van Cleef, when Norbert and I asked him a while ago, over a year ago, to start looking at what happened during the Great Depression, they actually went a bit further and they looked at Van Cleef, and as he modestly said they're one of the younger Maisons in the Group, because they're only slightly over 100 years old. He said it seems that any 20 &#x2013; every 25 years they have a crisis. So they had a crisis in the First World War, and our Founder, the Founder of Van Cleef went into &#x2013; Van Cleef &amp; Arpels went into the trenches. In line next to him in the trench was a gentleman, asked him what he is doing, he said I'm a jeweler. So they agreed that if they both survived the First World War that his new comrade would join him. Well, he joined, his son later on joined, his grandson joined and the great granddaughter is still with Van Cleef.</p>
          <p>Then came the depression, obviously, less work. Well, they took their time and they perfected and &#x2013; designed and perfected the famous Mystery Setting, which Van Cleef is still well renowned for. That was done at the height of the depression. Then the Second World War looming, they did another bright move and they moved to New York, and in 1959 they opened on 5th Avenue.</p>
          <p>In the 4th, which most of the people in the room are too young to remember, but May '68 in Paris it was war. <mark type="inaudible" /> surround the capital city with tanks. And as you can imagine being a jeweler on Place Vend&#xF4;me it was a crisis. So they used that crisis and they designed the Alhambra branch, which today is still one of the best sellers. To me that's a light motif for our Group.</p>
          <p>We will use the resources &#x2013; our human resources. We will enhance the quality of the product. We will further improve our relationships with our customers, and when this recession ends, hopefully, we would have improved our competitive position. So to reiterate, we are in a recession that we expected. I have no idea when it's going to end.</p>
          <p>Luckily, we prepared for a very strong balance sheet, and as, I repeat, as a family we're liquid, so we do not have to rely upon dividends to service debt above the holding company, above Richemont, which is critical. We can therefore afford to leave the money in the company. Despite that we're fortunate enough that we could give our shareholders an improvement in their dividends.</p>
          <p>And I thank all of my colleagues for their work, dedication. One additional comment, I was perturbed to read that Cartier was not doing well and that we're laying people off in Switzerland. Cartier had a record year and Cartier didn't fire anybody in Switzerland. A number of our Maisons are using the partial work system, which I actually admire, which by the way we paid for in the good years. So, yes, we will use this system that's at our disposal to balance supply and demand. But these people were not fired. They're still employed. And we have a partial system that you're all very aware of and familiar with.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there were some scurrilous attacks on J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Lambert of Jaeger-LeCoultre totally and utterly devoid of the truth, not only with the inflammatory, but they were based upon total lies. There were no supposed meetings between me and Norbert. We weren't even in the same time zone. We took the very unusual step of actually suing the Internet journalist. It's not a decision taken lightly, but when you have a colleague who has done exemplary work, who has built the Maison brilliantly, whose watch I'm proud to wear, and his kids have to hear lies at school, we will defend our colleagues. I don't know will &#x2013; next year is going to be better. If you put $3 trillion into a society, into a system, it's bound to be abound somewhere. Hopefully in a year's time, you'll say that I was overly cautious, I doubt it, I think we're here for quite a while.</p>
          <p>I'd like to hand it over to Norbert who will present the first section of the results. And then afterwards Richard and then afterwards we will be open for questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, here and on the web. I think actually my Chairman said everything, so we all can go home, unless of course you are analysts, you need to look at the figures, so let's look at the figures.</p>
          <p>Well, this is a good result and it's a bit like &#x2013; not interesting, because you will know &#x2013; want to know, will it remain that good? Having said this, we have seen a very negative November-December. The decline somewhat slowed down to almost flat at the end of the last quarter. And therefore we are 2% higher than the year before, &#x20AC;5.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Region-wise, again, not a surprise, contrasting too, not specifically big news, I guess. Asia-Pacific outperformed through the year. Americas showed the weakest and the United States is close to being dead right now.</p>
          <p>Decline in operating profit resulted from the slowdown, but I think was reasonably contained at &#x20AC;982 million. In times like this, and the Chairman said it already, focus is on cash flow. And I think we have managed well to show a strong cash flow of &#x20AC;819 million with net cash ending at 822.</p>
          <p>And let me tell you something. I mean last year when we met you around this time, we talked already about initial measures. We talked about the anticipation that things might change. We introduced at least in Japan and America measures to be careful to no more hire people early in the year last year. Quite frankly our colleagues start disguising the ivory tower are totally bananas, because we are still very optimistic.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, since October even our younger colleagues know that we were unfortunately right. This is shown again in this little chart here. Up till September the world seemed to be okay and a lot of people who have not come to live in business for 40 years like me, thought it's never ending. Half-year sales ended 10% up in euro terms. Since October, of course, and I don't want to bore you with the details, because we all know that financial markets went where they went and all feel-good factor therefore just disappeared like water on our plate. Feel-good factor is the key for our business.</p>
          <p>Traveling is the key for our business, by the way. And quite frankly when things started in Mexico, I thought, oh my God, please no. And a week before, I saw a very interesting &#x2013; I heard a very interesting philosopher talking about how you can force luck. And I thought, please not. So let's all touchwood that this crisis of the swine flu or the Mexico flu is contained as it looks right now.</p>
          <p>We had obviously a poor Christmas season, which reported sales down 7% in September. As I said before, the last quarter ended somewhat less negative, down minus 1%. As a result, second quarter, as you can see there, ended down 5%.</p>
          <p>Let me talk a bit about currencies. We have often said this, the Chairman said it here in various occasions before. Volatility of currencies, of course, is important for our global business. The last year was very interesting, because of course a stronger yen &#x2013; a stronger euro means normal local price increases, higher purchases from non-residents in Europe and higher translation of results. The yen strengthened, it has strengthened since its weakest point, almost 20%, as I don't need to tell you, which is good for us. But then we saw a very weak dollar, all your colleagues expected it to go to two, and by the time you were absolutely sure it changed around again and has become stronger, which of course is difficult for the business to manage. It's impossible to manage. These are the things we cannot manage.</p>
          <p>Prices for gemstones and precious metals had a similar curve. Last year it was almost impossible to buy stones. The price of gold, I don't need to talk about, because it went to the biggest peak ever. Meanwhile it went &#x2013; every commodity, every materials went down to the very bottom. And it's on a upswing that as you know the price of oil yesterday touched again US$60, which again, is good for our business, because the Middle East is still one of the growth regions and we hope that this continues.</p>
          <p>Again, this is a mixed environment. My Chairman has said everything what is there to be said. Richemont managed to deliver a strong set of results, we believe, and we are pretty confident we can weather this storm.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Norbert, and good morning to you all. So let's start with sales. Sales in Europe, which includes the Middle East, remains our biggest region with 44% of Group sales. Sales rose by 5% at constant rates, with a decline of 8% in the last semester.</p>
          <p>These results mask the strong performance in the Middle East, where sales grew by 49% at constant rates. Even in second half, sales continued to grow at similar levels. The Middle East contributes 6% of Group sales.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, sales declined by 1%. Sales with locals decreased, but increased with third-party nationals from Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia. We estimate that above 50% of sales in this region are now made with this clientele.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific is our second region. Its weight has increased to 27% of Group sales. Sales rose by 14% at constant rates, the fourth year of double-digit growth. The growth rate, however, slowed down to 1% in the second half of the year. The performance was uneven among main markets.</p>
          <p>Sales in Taiwan and Singapore were down, while in Hong Kong sales grew by 12% at constant rates, despite a challenging plus 39% achieved the previous year. In Korea, sales were even stronger, thanks to a return of Japanese consumers due to the appreciation of the yen.</p>
          <p>In Mainland China, sales rose by 30% after plus 54 last year, confirming China as our number two market in Asia-Pacific after Hong Kong. In the last semester, sales grew by 11%. Mainland China has increased its contribution to Group sales to 6% and now ranks number five compared to seven a year ago. The yuan strength versus the euro, plus 13% over the period, has further boosted tourism of Mainland Chinese aboard.</p>
          <p>Overall, we estimate Chinese from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to account for more than 20% of Richemont sales. We view this clientele and region as strategic and the ones to outperform the rest of the world in the future.</p>
          <p>The Americas region contributes 16% of Group sales and for the U.S. only 12% of Group sales. After seven years of double-digit rate growth at constant rates, sales momentum in the U.S. slowed in August, then negative in September. The trend worsened such that half-year sales ended March '09 down 30% at constant rates. For the year as a whole, U.S. sales declined by 12% at constant rates.</p>
          <p>The only piece of good news was the appreciation of the U.S. dollar from August to March, which softened the decline of sales expressed in euro and stock price increases. Given the difficult environment and the cautiousness of our watch retailers, we maintain a negative view on this market. We have restructured the region by making people redundant and also looking at closing down 13 boutique in fiscal '10 out of a total of 90 internal boutique in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Japan's contribution to Richemont sales only represents 13% of sales, but remains our biggest single country. Sales declined by 12% in yen, but only by 1% in euro, given the 11% appreciation of the yen over the period. Since its lows in July '08 the yen has risen by 28%, given the structural issues of Japan again, no CapEx and a streaming down of expenses will take place, certain boutique will be closed out of a network of 169. With the yen appreciation, we started seeing Japanese tourist returning to Korea, Hawaii and France. Overall, we estimate the contribution of the Japanese to worldwide sales in the order of 15%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the constant currency sales by product line. We note that watch sales were flat, masking a notable performance from IWC, Vacheron Constantin and Jaeger-LeCoultre. The inflection in sales momentum has prompted us to reduce the Group's manufacturing output to limit a buildup of inventory at trade level.</p>
          <p>Jewelry enjoyed the best performance, contributing &#x20AC;120 million in sales increase. The 9% constant currency growth rate reflects success at Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, particularly in high jewelry sales.</p>
          <p>Leather sales were down five, despite positive developments at Montblanc. The reduction in sales of writing instruments reflects a difficult market, and sales in ready-to-wear and other went up by 9% as a result of the integration of Donz&#xE9;-Baume, manufacturing company of watch cases.</p>
          <p>Retail sales represents sales to our directly operated stores, they do not include sales to our franchise stores. The weight of retail is pretty much stable at 43% of Group sales. Its performance, plus 3% at constant exchange rate, was above wholesale. It's largely attributable to high jewelry sales and the impact of new stores. The wholesale performance reflects mostly the cautiousness of the watch retailers.</p>
          <p>Here is our P&amp;L. Sales grew at 2% in euro terms and at 1% at constant currencies. The IFRS operating profit decreased by 12% to &#x20AC;982 million. The decline was contained, thanks to a controlled growth in operating expenses and despite high non-recurrent charges that I shall detail in the next slide.</p>
          <p>For the sake of clarity, here is a reconciliation of our operating profit. Starting with our reported IFRS EBIT of 982, I would like to remind you that it does not include the &#x20AC;30 million negative contribution of our discontinued businesses, namely the Montegrappa Maison and a small jewelry workshop.</p>
          <p>If you want to obtain an underlying operating profit from continuing operation, you should add back the &#x20AC;79 million of non-recurrent charges. These charges consist of one-off cost of &#x20AC;40 million, such as the second SIHH and the reclassification of point-of-sales material in application of the new accounting principle IAS 38, as well as &#x20AC;39 million of restructuring charges consisting mainly of provisions for closing stores and social plans.</p>
          <p>I also want to remind you, that we are benefited from more favorable exchange rates, which on the other hand have generated financial losses, realized and unrealized, which are reported under finance costs.</p>
          <p>Gross margin &#x2013; the gross margin rose to &#x20AC;3.4 billion, in percentage terms it lost 130 basis points to represent 63.3% of sales. This decline is a result of stronger Swiss franc, our precious material prices and the negative impact of lower production volume on manufacturing fixed cost, only partially offset by price increases.</p>
          <p>As I explained earlier, we also benefited from favorable exchange rates, especially on the yen and the U.S. and Hong Kong dollars, which have somewhat compensated the appreciation of the Swiss francs. In this global negative context, Cartier and Baume &amp; Mercier still managed to increase our gross margin percentage.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses grew by 7%, that was a 2% growth in sales. Excluding one-off expenses of &#x20AC;79 million, they grew by 3%. Selling and distribution costs, 50% of total OpEx, rose by 5%. The rise reflects primarily additional staff, leases and depreciation associated with the retail and wholesale network.</p>
          <p>Communications costs were well controlled, taking into consideration the dramatic decline of sales during the Christmas season and the two watch Salon. As a result, the ratio was maintained at 11.9% of Group sales and for fiscal '10 we anticipate this ratio to remain broadly in line.</p>
          <p>Administration cost increased by 4%, reflecting higher inflation rates around the world. Other income includes higher royalties from Chlo&#xE9; and a portion of the non-recurrent charges mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>The jewelry Maisons and the specialist watchmakers generated a contribution margin above 20%. The contribution of our jewelry Maisons and specialist watchmakers reached a high of 95% of Group EBIT before corporate expenses. This performance was partially offset by lower reserves as well, especially at Montblanc.</p>
          <p>The jewelry Maisons sales grew by 4% at constant and reported rates, a notable performance given the environment and the very strong comparatives.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that sales grew at plus 16% at constant rates last year. The jewelry Maisons saw their contribution rise to &#x20AC;777 million, leading nevertheless to a 28% contribution margin.</p>
          <p>Cartier posted a record year both in term of sales and profitability. This achievement underlines the resilience of its business, a balanced product offer and geographic coverage, including a successful penetration of emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Van Cleef &amp; Arpels profitability has continued to improve. Return on assets has declined due to higher inventories, but remains at a strong high level. Sales rose by 3% at constant rates for the segment of specialist watchmakers and by 4% in euros initially impacted by components shortages and lighter &#x2013; and later by the softening of the watch market after years of extraordinary growth.</p>
          <p>The specialist watchmakers saw their operating contribution decline to &#x20AC;287 million. The contribution margin went down to 20% of sales affected by slower sales, the strongest Swiss francs, the integration of Roger Dubuis, as well as the second SIHH.</p>
          <p>With the exception of Roger Dubuis, all Maisons are profitable and generated a double-digit contribution margin, except for Baume &amp; Mercier. IWC particularly stood out followed by Vacheron Constantin and then Jaeger-LeCoultre. Those three Maisons generated profits broadly in line with last year. The rise in net assets reflects our increased production integration, as well as a buildup in inventories and the acquisition of Roger Dubuis.</p>
          <p>Following the decision to discontinue the operations of Montegrappa, these slides only relates to Montblanc both for fiscal '08 and fiscal '09. As expected, Montblanc price positioning and high exposure to an aspirational clientele made it more sensitive to economic slowdowns. The ongoing downsizing of this wholesale distribution network has put more pressure on its pens and wholesale businesses.</p>
          <p>Despite a positive performance &#x2013; plus America, more exposed to America &#x2013; net of its exposure in Japan &#x2013; despite a positive performance of its watch and leather business and on the phase of two years of strong double-digit growth at constant rates, sales declined by 7% at constant rates and by 6% in euros.</p>
          <p>The evolution of the business model entailed higher working capital and investments in production and distribution. A review of the retail network was undertaken and led to the decision to close 11 underperforming stores in fiscal '09 and 23 in fiscal '10, mostly in the Americas and Japan. &#x20AC;7 million of restructuring charges have been allocated in this financial year.</p>
          <p>Alfred Dunhill losses amounted to &#x20AC;2 million after a small profit last year. Dunhill has planned to close nine stores, including four in Japan. Restructuring charges in the current year amounted to &#x20AC;1 million. Lancel reported sales -</p>

          <p>Sorry in Shanghai and in London and the club operates in London. And it's having the desired effect, but obviously there's a lead lag in terms of new concept, because they did make money. I think I went to Christopher Colfer, they made money before, there's nearly &#xA3;2 million charge that &#x2013; &#x20AC;2 million charge that fell between the two homes.</p>

          <p>Lancel reported sales down 8%, therefore despite a higher gross margin percentage Lancel generated a loss of &#x20AC;8 million, up &#x20AC;4 million on last year. Lancel, we closed six stores, including four in Europe, incurring a &#x20AC;1 million restructuring charge.</p>
          <p>Other businesses consist of fashion brands, primarily Chlo&#xE9;, as well as some non-branded components and manufacturing activities and other ventures. Sales rose by 3% at constant rates and by 6% in euro. Lower sales at Chlo&#xE9; were more than compensated for by the impact of the acquisition of Donz&#xE9;-Baume. Losses include &#x20AC;6 million of restructuring charges, mostly due to our component manufacturing businesses, Chlo&#xE9; remaining profitable.</p>
          <p>Net finance cost amounted to &#x20AC;101 million, primarily due to the mark-to-market accounting of our hedging program. It's obvious, as I mentioned, that we are benefiting directly in our gross margin of the favorable evolution of exchange rates. But because we maintain our policy of hedging, we have as a counterpart losses of hedging programs.</p>
          <p>The lower reported tax rate of 15.7% reflects lower earnings and lower statutory tax rates in various jurisdictions. Net profit from parent and subsidiaries decreased by 23% to &#x20AC;748 million, representing 13.8% of Group sales.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations reached over &#x20AC;800 million despite the sharp reversals in sales trend. Working capital increased by &#x20AC;361 million, primarily due to the increase in inventory. Inventory rose by &#x20AC;346 million due to lower sales, the acquisition of Roger Dubuis, network expansion and a stronger Swiss franc. The rise was mostly in finished goods. The stock rotation rate on gross inventory has gone from 16.4 months in March last year to 18.7 months this March. Inventory is monitored strictly and Norbert will give you more details later.</p>
          <p>The collection of debtor balances is being tightly monitored and is slightly above last year relating to increased sales in the Middle East and China. The average recovery rates have not been impacted. Other items decreased as the funding of certain retirement benefits obligation did not recur in 2009 and charges on long-term incentive scheme declined.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow from subsidiaries declined to &#x20AC;213 million due to higher CapEx and the acquisition of Donz&#xE9;-Baume, a manufacturer of iron watch cases and the 60% of Roger Dubuis and other ventures.</p>
          <p>We'll deal with CapEx in the next slide. The increase in tax payments reflects primarily payments accrued in the previous year. Richemont received for the last time a dividend from BAT amounting to &#x20AC;343 million, which was left with Reinet on the 20th of October 2008.</p>
          <p>Gross fixed assets rose from 271 million to &#x20AC;305 million, accounting for 5.6% of sales. They were essentially targeted at growth markets, China and the Middle East, and the watch manufacturing needs.</p>
          <p>Net fixed assets amounted to &#x20AC;293 million compared with a depreciation level of &#x20AC;175 million. For the year to come, we anticipate gross fixed assets to be around &#x20AC;165 million, which is more or less in line with the level of depreciation.</p>
          <p>We will continue to invest in SAP, a new boutique in China primarily for Cartier with limited refurbishment as well and we'll continue to invest in two major manufacturing projects, Jaeger-LeCoultre extensions, which is nearing completion and Val Fleurier, the strategic watch components facility to mitigate potential supplies and risk rate of 2011 and address the increased demand for high-end in-house movements.</p>
          <p>By segment, around 30% of the investments were made by the jewelry Maison and around 20% by the specialist watchmakers. By geography as planned, apart from the investment in manufacturing in Europe, most of the assets were made in Asia-Pacific and in the Middle East.</p>
          <p>By nature, over 50% of our investment related to retail. The most notable retail investment during this year were Cartier boutique in Beijing Park Life, Seoul Cheonho-dong and Dubai Mall. Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Montblanc and Jaeger new stores in Dubai Mall and the Dunhill and Vacheron Constantin flagship in Shanghai. The majority of other relates to investment in our service platform and IT hardware. In manufacturing, over 30% of our investments, the most important investments, were the extension of the manufacturing facilities at Val Fleurier that I mentioned of Jaeger-LeCoultre and Cartier <mark type="inaudible" />. It does not include the intangibles relating to R&amp;D for watches.</p>
          <p>Even after the cash payment of &#x20AC;438 million in ordinary dividend at the end of September '08 and the transfer of &#x20AC;351 million to Reinet of the 20 of October, Richemont's balance sheet remains very healthy. Inventory at &#x20AC;2.4 billion is our biggest asset, representing 33% of our total assets followed by cash 26% and fixed assets 21%. Our gross cash position amounts to &#x20AC;2 billion and our net cash position to 822. Equity represents 65% of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Since 2007, the Group has adopted a very conservative stance for its cash resources by investing in funds of the highest-rated European government bonds, preferring safety to higher yields. At the end of March, close to &#x20AC;850 million were invested in such trends.</p>
          <p>Operating cash is invested in the most highly-rated banks, while structural operational debt is primarily maintained in non-euro-denominated currencies. As explained earlier, the net profit contribution from parent and subsidiaries declined due to lower operating profit and a significant decrease in net financial income only partly compensated by lower taxes.</p>
          <p>In this slide you can see the impact of the Group's restructuring, profit from BAT has been equity accounted until the 20th of October.</p>
          <p>The 2009 dividend of CHF0.30 per share to be proposed to shareholders in September reflects the absence of any BAT dividend inflows. However, when taking into account the dividends to be received directly from BAT, a unique holder who has kept its BAT shares after distribution of Reinet would receive at least the same dividend as last year. The dividend will be fully paid in Swiss francs for the first time and will be subject to the 35% withholding tax.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I now hand you to Norbert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, besides the analysis of figures I gave you a little bit of an overview of how we handle this unprecedented crisis. I want to talk about these issues you see there in detail. Specifically, I think cash generation is one of our big focus for the period to come, however long that period might be.</p>
          <p>We have quite early stopped overtime, because it's very obvious that any kind of excess in production leads finally to inventory levels, which are unhealthy even if you have some discipline in your own companies. We do not want to produce products particularly, watches which we cannot sell and even more important we don't want to overly push sales to watch retailers. As you all know that this has undesired and unintended consequences, the gray market being one of them.</p>
          <p>As you have thought before, until September, the close of which has resulted that in most of our Richemont internal and external component manufacturers, we could not get enough product. We were unable to meet demand nothing particularly exciting for you to hear because last year that was the topic, what are you doing &#x2013; topic from you, what are you doing to meet demand? How can you expand production? Which new factories are you building overnight?</p>
          <p>Well, as we all know this demand stopped almost overnight and we introduced in October hiring freeze for all players. And I tell you, I live in a French environment, right and I love that French environment. However, when you stop hiring people, and even more, you tell that every hiring is now personally endorsed by the CEO himself. Some of my colleagues <mark type="inaudible" />. Why do we do this? We want discipline. We want people to think twice before they replace or re-hire.</p>
          <p>And of course, strategic positions we will re-hire, but not necessary everybody just by routine and impulse. So it's a disciplinary exercise who my HR Director saw this most, because he is the first guy who gets all the requests and he has to field the hunt; there was a time when I just chased him out of the office because I knew it would get worse.</p>
          <p>We have maximized in-sourcing and minimized outsourcing. Unfortunately, our competitors do the same thing. You know that we are not only having brands, we have a number of factories which produce components for us and for other companies, including, of course, our competitors, one of the historical structures of Swiss watchmaking.</p>
          <p>In dial manufacturer like Stern or Donz&#xE9;-Baume, as I said before we worked overtime until December and today we have a workload below 50%. That workload of course, is also partially caused by external customers, including the Swatch Group &#x2013; including the Swatch Group who has also reduced their demands of supply drastically to do what we are doing to manage inventories.</p>
          <p>However, painful that is, we had to downsize some of these operations because we think this demand will not at first be covered. However, when we do this, we look very much at not losing the people who have the specific know-how, Stern for instance is a company which makes extremely sophisticated dials, it's the company in the industry and we have to be very careful to balance adjustments, to capacity, and at the same time not losing know-how, which we will need badly, when &#x2013; and I say when, not if, when the upswing comes.</p>
          <p>And therefore, and the Chairman mentioned it before <mark type="inaudible" /> working time, which we have prophylactically in place for all our Maisons, not yet executed for all our Maisons, but prophylactically in place is a great tool to do that. This concept, as you probably already know also works in Germany and that's also in place for Montblanc and we will call month-to-month to look at the development and decide the appropriate measures.</p>
          <p>That might lead to extended summer holidays here in Switzerland. As you know, I have never understood this as a German, why we need to close factories for three, four weeks, but in Switzerland that's a history you cannot work against. Now, it's an opportunity to extend this and if we need to do that. It's not decided yet, but we will do it if we have to. And again why because over supply is the worst what can happen in a luxury business. Besides all the consequences for your own cash flow, for our stock risks, and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>Of course, last year, we had still, very vibrant discussions to build all these factories, you wanted us to build, of course, we have stopped all these projects for the time being, for the time being. In October, we froze instantly all non- strategic CapEx, of course, that does not change our few and long potential of the industry. For the time being, we will limit our investments, Richard mentioned it already to two strategic projects; SAP, and selective boutique openings mostly in Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>We opened in the year 59 stores and invested &#x20AC;60 million in Asia-Pacific and Middle-East; 40 million were invested mainly in China and Richard again mentioned that I think we have today a meaningful presence in China specifically with <mark type="inaudible" /> in excess of 60 stores in China, Montblanc in excess of 40, and Cartier in excess of 30.</p>
          <p>But that shouldn't &#x2013; we will limit CapEx to R&amp;D. But of course, we will continue R&amp;D. R&amp;D is future engineers and people whose creative ideas are the future of the company. It would be almost like shooting yourself in the foot and trying to run 100 meters below 10 seconds to save even $0.01 in that area. We will have to finish the manufacturing extension of Jaeger-LeCoultre, which had been started in the good times and that's ongoing.</p>
          <p>I talked about hiring fees. If you look at our fixed cost, 50% of the fixed cost is related to people so hiring fees is a useful exercise not loved by my colleagues, now more accepted. Meanwhile more accepted by my colleagues. As a result of this freeze, we did not hire 1,700 people who were originally budgeted. So we have therefore reduced significantly head count against budget and we hedge to adjust unfortunately although by some layoffs our staff in the U.S. and in &#x2013; selectively in Japan.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned before specifically in our component manufacturing entities, which work for the firms, but also for competitors as I mentioned, we had to adjust production capacities and that cost layoffs in the order of 300 people. We have decided that there will be no salary raise for non-union staffs this year, in other words only legally entitled contracted people who are entitled to this will have salary increase, everybody else not.</p>
          <p>We have decided that the option program this year will not be rewarded to management, it will however rewarded to executives, I mean, these guys after all do the work not the big engines right and when you are freezing salaries, when previous options are underwater at least the people in the trenches who do the work need to be seeing that the company is interested in their long future and that's why we continue this program but not for top management.</p>
          <p>As Richard already mentioned in excess of 60 stores will be closed throughout last year and this year and again we will look as the business develops whether it has to stay that way or whether we have to take further measures depending on the future sales.</p>
          <p>Communication expenses have been properly monitored. You have seen that communication increased, but that is out to the second SIHH mainly, which we had to have in this one year where we move the SIHH to Geneva here followed by three months to January.</p>
          <p>Finally, and that is a very, very interesting exercise. We are renegotiating all fee-related contracts. That includes contracts for offices. In some countries that is not possible, my people tell me. Totally not true, it's all always possible to renegotiate and we have some considerable first successes in doing that and we will continue to do that.</p>
          <p>Here you see in some more detail the plant closure of stores. This is more or less evenly split among the regions however as a percentage of existing stores of course, they are comparatively more stores closed in the United States for obvious reason.</p>
          <p>In a business, which makes a margin in excess of 60% as we all know. You can cut cost but at the end of the day, we have to stabilize, improve sales and therefore we &#x2013; of course, we know that the business will suffer this year. But we are encouraging our Maisons to continue to be creative, to be continued to spend money if opportunities arise, but includes by the way opening boutiques.</p>
          <p>There are some streets in the world where it was virtually impossible to get a boutique, because since 10 years you cannot get a space. If these opportunities come, ladies and gentlemen, we will invest even if this was not unbudgeted, because we believe we will be around in 50 or 100 years.</p>
          <p>So it's not all about cost. Even in these challenging times, we believe that customers will continue to buy after all as Mr. Rupert always says we are in the business of love. A little bit also in providing NVA as I secretly told you, but love foremost and love never ends. That's the beauty of our business. This is a beautiful business to be in ladies and gentlemen even in crisis.</p>
          <p>Of course, we will monitor gross margins and costs and look at even more at platform synergies and again you see Montblanc historically has been very much standalone company that comes within element of pride always.</p>
          <p>Most of you know that I've been in this &#x2013; the head of this company long time now, I'm telling them you are going on the platforms because we look for synergies more than before. Do they like this? Not really, but at the end of the day they will be better off, because they will have improved services and improved communications with their peers.</p>
          <p>So synergies is an issue which we are looking at, which we make strong recommendations to our colleagues that always love too much, but it is not a contradiction even though we want to still foster the entrepreneurship of our independent brands, the COOs, the staff of the brands has to be totally in love with their brand, nobody else, to the extent not even <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So we will go for &#x2013; we believe that our customers in times like this will go for creativity. They will go for like <mark type="inaudible" /> and they will go for secure iconic creations, secure investment if you want so. And I think Richemont has a wonderful stable of friends to offer exactly that. Simple conjure out new products, of course we'll also not do it and depend on innovation but enough for future success.</p>
          <p>Our clients specifically in the rest of the world could look much more at the investment value of products than they ever did before. Even if it is only excuse it will last from my side. It will last from my daughter, it will even last forever. We have a lot of friends, which provide exactly this. So we are &#x2013; we know it will be difficult but we also know that we have the right brands to walk through sustain in these times.</p>
          <p>Over the recent years, we have looked very much at trading up, the whole industry has been going trading up. We are now encouraging even more again friends to enrich their collections with accessible products. If you have a frequency drop in the states, in boutiques of 50% there are many measures of course to increase frequency. One is to have products which are costing less is very simple. Costing less and still of the highest quality and highest creativity, that's the trick of course.</p>
          <p>Now of course, I will tell you everything what will happen in 2010, the problem is we all don't know and as we all don't know cash conservation and preservation is key, our managers are focused on this. Our focus to look at inventory decrease, which I told you that we increased our inventories this year, because in our business you cannot switch-off production overnight but our people are very focused and they have understood this and I think the last month have already seen a dramatic reaction to good inventory management. We have good people, they understand the rules of this period.</p>
          <p>We're focusing as I said before on creativity, on quality and on service. The Chairman said it before and of course, when I am talking about hiring freeze it doesn't apply to any point that a customer is in touch with us &#x2013; to any point that a customer is in touch with us, because he should feel service, dedication, love, and not frustrated sales people who cannot handle customers or frustrated after sales people.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to invest in after sales service, which will be a non-survival issue for a lot of small competitors. After sales service is complicate are up to organize around the world and some friends don't really have such a good service concept.</p>
          <p>Now customers are even more demanding, they don't want to wait anymore for six weeks or even six months to get their watch back. We are just starting our own watchmaking school in China, because it's not good enough what we are doing yet and we have grown a lot as Richard told you.</p>
          <p>And so looking at costs is balanced by looking at the future. And of course, strong points at the end of the day, we'll be able to gain market share, our dealers, our partners has been partners for decades and they know that they can trust us and they want to sell the best and the things which in these times turn better than maybe as several. We will come out stronger and better positioned and we will have gained market share already this thing turns.</p>
          <p>I think you will trust us that we can manage costs and that we have strong cost control in place. We will look of course throughout the year how we allocate resource cash, especially with the underperforming trends April.</p>
          <p>April was not the good month. It was as expected, sales declined by 19% in euro, reflecting that difficult environment and of course very strong comparative figures in April 2008, which was the record April ever in the company.</p>
          <p>Therefore, these trends, which we have seen flat first quarter is not &#x2013; is not seen in April, but then we should not quite frankly overestimate April. April is the first year of the first months of Richemont year, and when you have a very good year before, our brands tend to slowdown supplies in March and push some to April. You know that, I did it myself when I was in Montblanc. So April is not &#x2013; we did it last year, yes. I'll tell you how we did it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So they may have moved it across the year in line in 2008. I think that's what -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I'm trying to say. It's very normal and you have -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>When they hit their budgets and they take their eyes, like all governments, they hide, they stick away or they spend otherwise next year they don't get the same allocation and when he was at Montblanc, he told me, he never did it, when he came to head office.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, everybody has to have a few tricks left I think. Okay, so yes, yes. There is not &#x2013; these are not pretty figures, they were expected. We expected these figures. There is some silver lining that retail declined only by 8% where wholesale declined by 26, which is the effect, of course, we were left over to have thousand odd questions how we can gauge the sellout versus sell-in and that would be an interesting discussion I'm sure.</p>
          <p>We think that the first quarter will be significantly below the levels last year. And in few of lack of visibility I said it a few times, we believe that we in the wake of recession and uncertainties about currencies we look negatively at the full year.</p>
          <p>We are working around stabilization &#x2013; the assumption of stabilization of consumer confidence of course and like everybody does. But remember that until September last year our comparative pace was extremely challenging at constant currencies with plus 14 and rather 24%. So, in the second half, the comparative figures will be less, second half of this year. And therefore this will be a very interesting year but we will with confidence manage this.</p>
          <p>Conclusion, as I said at the very beginning, one year ago in this room, we all worried about capacities, you as well as we. I think we worried a bit less, because we started already in the very beginning of the year to reduce &#x2013; to freeze CapEx in Japan and the U.S., and to stop hiring in these countries.</p>
          <p>As I explained to you since then, we have further cut CapEx and expenses and I have delivered already on the measures of shorter working times and a limited amount of redundancies. We will not rule out further redundancies, but it is the ultima rights here, which we will have to gauge very much against the long-term future.</p>
          <p>We are, I said it before, not positive for this year, we acknowledge that our view is not shared by all of the industry, and again we hope to be proven wrong, would be wonderful if we are proven wrong, and the others are right.</p>
          <p>We are well aware that most of our costs are fixed, and that to cut costs, costs money, so we will continue with prudent management, a wonderful mixture, but Johann calls Germanic and French, it's a wonderful caption I can tell you and we are not forgetting to invest in the future, I think I made this point, even so maybe more selectively than in the past.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is strong and most importantly our Maisons has been around, most of them for more than 100 years, they're run by dedicated, motivated good people and what else can you ask for than dedicated good people.</p>
          <p>So Sophie asked me, what if they ask you or Mr. Rupert, can you sleep well at night? So I will preempt this question, because it's a very beautiful question, yeah, no she wanted, it's a very beautiful question and I'm sure my Chairman will share my view. Ladies and gentlemen -</p>

So what I was telling, well, last night was I sleep like a baby, we have a lot of cash in the bank, there are opportunities and most important ladies and gentlemen we have very good people in the Maisons who run this like entrepreneurs and now they can show really, if they are that good as they believe they are and as we believe they are.

          <p>Just one quick one Norbert spoke about a watch keeping school in China, it's Hong Kong and it's not that we ever intend making watches there, but it's for after sales service.

          <p>Yes, yes. I know what you mean. I was a bit worried when you said, you slept like a baby because if I remember when we had, when our kids were babies, when you slept like a baby, it meant you wake up crying every three hours. But Sophie, I don't understand this Q&amp;A stuff that you prep people for? Norbert, as you have seen in the press announcement this morning has chosen not to extend his contract beyond the end of the year. It's nearly five years, it will be five years in November.</p>
          <p>I want to obviously thank him, but I'll thank him in November and at the next AGM. He gave me an early warning, he and I said it this morning, he has developed diabetes over the period and I don't think it's fair, you believe me he's going to live a very, very long time, but for those of you please don't see the bucket list and his quality time left in life.</p>
          <p>I have a friend who built an investment bank, a very famous individual in the United States, who post-retirement built another private boutique investment bank, flies his own citation 10, self-made man and he was really looking forward to spending more time with his wife and she developed Parkinson's disease two years ago, so they never travel alone.</p>
          <p>And as he said to me, one, retrospectively why the hell did I spend my time from 63, 64 onwards flying around the world. I had enough money already. And now that he thought he was going to retire late 60s, early 70s, he and his wife they're married 60-odd years and they can't travel. So I respect his wishes, I have a hell of a nice time, which I intended to do. We all thought about having more quality time left. The company is in great shape. The markets are not in great shape. But we've been there before. I mean some of us been quite a while.</p>
          <p>We are going to have to manage expectations of colleagues because sometimes we tend to have this confusion between luck and genius. And are you as lucky, are you really lucky having been in the right business or were you a total genius? I always ask the question for those of you follow Golf, did Tiger &#x2013; sorry, did Nick Faldo make his coach David Leadbetter or did David Leadbetter make Nick Faldo. Leadbetter become famous after Faldo practiced 10, 12 hours a day.</p>
          <p>We've been in an extraordinary business but it's been an extraordinary business, not for decades but for a very, very long time. What I really like about this business is that I can go to sleep at night knowing that there is not a single opponent in the world that can wreck your clients business, our business, our shareholders' business, not an opponent. Not even the economy, if you manage your company prudently.</p>
          <p>However, we can wreck it ourselves. We can wreck it by picking low-hanging fruit, that Gucci before, Dawn Mello got there and Maurizio Gucci and Dawn Mello and before they cleaned it up, was on the road to ruin, picking a low-hanging fruit. So we have the SPCC and it works well where we will always think medium to long-term and not wreck the brand equity of our Maisons, because ultimately the brand equity determines whether you have any pricing power in your Maisons and if you do not have pricing power, in the end your margins will disappear and your brands will disappear.</p>
          <p>Now three, four, five years ago even in our company people told me Dunhill, Dunhill, we never made money, kill Dunhill. Well, as it so happened Dunhill is brilliantly positioned in China. And if you look at India, it's brilliantly positioned. Masculine markets and if you do compounding and you say that these people have worked out, they're smart, they're safe, they'll have more disposable income, then you going to be trend surfing into a very valuable asset.</p>
          <p>I cannot tell you what is going to be like this year, or next year, but rest assured, I sleep very, very well, until I hear stupid questions like that Sophie you can sleep very, very well and I sleep very, very well.</p>
          <p>We open to questions and but please don't ask again and again so what do you think the fourth quarter is going to be like. I said this morning and I repeat it, anybody who knows what Christmas this year or Christmas next year is going to be like, he's got a direct extension to the Almighty, because he's got the line that I do not have an extension to. We are open to questions.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Jon Cox with Kepler. I have a couple of questions. Maybe the first one operationally, you probably did a lot better than I expected and many people in this room perhaps in terms of the profitability in H2, but obviously you're saying that April was maybe even worse than Q1 rather January to March periods. I'm just wondering given the April figures, which you anticipate that the actual margin would further decline in H1 versus H2 and maybe you can just put some color on why you think Q1 &#x2013; January to March was so strong or relatively strong and April was so weak, I'm wondering about the phasing of Easter. Is there anything are we missing there? The second question really is on your replacement, Norbert, I'm just wondering any ideas where a replacement may come from? Is that within the organization are you thinking, are you looking outside the organization and then on the actual handover, will Johann Rupert perhaps take day-to-day control for a period in between in your replacement or just on the whole thing there? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Norbert wanted to announce that in November. I said him, Norbert, I don't care how much sugarcoating I've put around it. If you announce this in November, we all know this six months that we're in is going to be bad in comparison to last six years &#x2013; last year six months. We know it. I mean there's nothing that's going to change it. And I don't care how much I tell the truth. You're going to have some slight idiot somewhere in some newspapers say, Norbert Platt was fired, which of course is total and utter nonsense.</p>
          <p>The point being he is CEO until November. I'm not even going to start speculating, I did tell all the people the risk that we both assume is that, The King is dead. Long lives the King. I did explain to people the King is very much alive and any pretender will be decapitated. So I'm not &#x2013; we are not very democratic when it comes to this kind of speculation and we will answer it in due course. But it's a good question. But I did it for Norbert. I wanted to make sure that everybody understood. That is the end of a five-year contract and yes, we took the risk. The biggest risk of course is people jocking for positions. What I did &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; what I did say to my colleagues before knowing about Norbert's diabetes, and that was a year ago and 18 months ago and two year &#x2013; three years ago. In 2000-2001, I changed the business model of this Group to verticalization and I think we've got a step back, when we bought LMH.</p>
          <p>I believe that you don't buy Ferrari with a Fiat engine, that our clients are too sophisticated. If they want to buy a Jaeger-LeCoultre, they want to buy Catier watch, they want to buy Montblanc watch. They want to be able to go to the factory. They want to see that this is a bespoke item for that &#x2013; they're buying &#x2013; our clients are not buying brands. That's why this brand issue, they're buying products. I hate the term luxury. Luxury is not necessarily expensive. Luxury is a great book and no mobile phones, so we've got to go back to the artisanal, the value, the true craftsmanship. So that luxury has a real meaning -- for that you need artisans, you need crafts, you need the people who actually went and did the Mystery Setting at the height of the Great Depression.</p>
          <p>Because art lines are not few, our consumer is intelligent. So we then went to verticalization instead of having one factory making for everybody. I wouldn't buy a watch for five or eight or &#x20AC;10,000, if I didn't know where it was made, if I couldn't go on to a website, if I couldn't visit it, I mean why. What are you doing in buying a label. You've got to buy something that you love, so we went and verticalized.</p>
          <p>It created average; it's far easier to make one watch and stick another label on, but we created a vertical structure. So that is product integrity. We had on the other hand to get certain synergies in terms of distribution. If it doesn't make sense for everybody in the Vall&#xE9;e de Joux and in Geneva, etcetera, to have separate factories, separate design teams, separate CEOs, Finance Directors, but then to send the watches to the same dealers through separate warehouses. Because remember whether it's Jaeger or Vacheron or Cartier we sell to, let's say, Durnell in New York, so we took our shipping and distribution system. And we had regional warehouses, so we don't duplicate everything. But we will maintain product and design integrity on the one hand, that's the one side, and the other side the salesman. A salesman shouldn't say well, do you like Vacheron, well, if you haven't got a Vacheron, I've got a Montblanc for you, then they have Montblanc, I've got &#x2013; nonsense. Salesperson serves one God &#x2013; one product, one Maisons, but in between the salesperson and the factory, there's a whole back office. We were not very good and I like to say the whole industry at &#x2013; the whole supply chain management. And Norbert brought a group of people and it's been hell on earth introducing SAP. And even post-retirement he's promised <mark type="inaudible" />. So more and more of the Maisons can share a common platform.</p>
          <p>In terms of SAPs that we can actually know what is where at what time, what is sold, when, so that we can manage from the smallest history through &#x2013; that's the back office, that's the cost structure that you don't see. I happened to believe Tesco in the United Kingdom is unbeatable.</p>
          <p>And it was because of a business model that I saw years ago. Tesco only buys what it sells. It doesn't sell what it buys. And they're so far ahead of the competition that by the time the competitors try to catch up they're already five years ahead. I'm also in the farming business, which I very much love. That's called an extranet. I'm an approved supplier. I wondered &#x2013; I can check on the extranet if I &#x2013; if they want to <mark type="inaudible" /> it's a business model that I don't know how you beat. Now if we have the tradition, the creativity, the people, the brand equity and combined with a very good business model then we build what Mr. Buffet would call a moat. I intend having moats around our businesses, we're not fully there yet. We've got a couple of building blocks to put into place.</p>
          <p>But ultimately eight years ago our companies didn't have separate balance sheets. So how could Norbert and I say to somebody what's your return on net assets? I don't have net assets. Everything was in Richemont. And when the <mark type="inaudible" /> a little bit of excess stock, we'd say what's going on. No, no. You'd say to my cousin <mark type="inaudible" /> that's your stock, excuse me. If it's not your stock whose stock is it? This is was seven, eight years ago. Because if you'd look at the car industry. Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, BMW they don't make their own spark plugs or tires. They buy Continental or Michelin, certain assembly business, the watch business is the same. And I don't care who you are, you assemble a fair percentage of other manufacturers' components, including our components that are used by our competitors.</p>
          <p>Most of our competitors have to come to buy dials from Stern. However, if we have too many tires lying around or too many spark plugs lying out, who is accountable for that? Is it fair to <mark type="inaudible" /> whomever and now of course what do you do. You just keep too many in case because nobody wants to run out. So nobody in fact knows that you've got five years worth of spark plugs lying at the center and when you say what's going on, it's not mine. So hypothetically we had &#x2013; we didn't know who was in charge of what. That has been rectified. If we speak to Georges Kern of IWC, he's got his factory, he's got his sales team, he's got his Chief Operating Officer, he's got the whole structure.</p>
          <p>In fact he doesn't really need us for too many things anymore. Yes the SPCC. Yes we will help in certain. We helped in terms of distribution in terms of Richemont Asia &#x2013; or should I say Richemont North America distribution centers, etcetera, etcetera. But we don't interfere in his daily life. Cartier doesn't really need a super structure above it; it's a major company. So we have been preparing over years and I've been saying to these people that once your Maisons have got a proper control of your assets, you understand free cash flow we will win you off. So Richemont will go more to in the direction of a financial holding company than that of a combination of a financial holding company and an operating company.</p>
          <p>And with some Maisons be there, with others they still need to put a nurturing. So I'm not sure that we will again have the need of somebody to bust his backside to put him interpret all the systems that he did. So I think whoever takes over will have a different role description. Is that a &#x2013; and I think it is terrible to say, but Norbert and I've looked at it and we think that one should give the Maisons a little bit more freedom, there's going to be quite lot of central admin that they may choose not to do with Arpels. So they may not want some of the services that we think they need.</p>
          <p>But frankly Cartier is a huge company. If our interaction with them is nearly the SPCC and helping them when they need with intellectual property obviously. Yeah, central reserves in money management, I think it evolves, and I think, Jon, the question is very good. We didn't think it was going to be needed now. I've said to Norbert for your answer, in any case, it's going to start as I say &#x2013; as I &#x2013; continued to help with a whole lot of SAP, obviously his wife is really looking for to going back to Hamburg, is that euphemistically put.</p>

It's &#x2013; I don't know how to put at this, I just thought I ought to do it for his sales sake that people understand this, nothing funny going on. That's the reason why we announced it now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We just disagree on it. I said don't go there, these guys with Sophie and everybody, they write us, compared to &#x2013; quarter four, quarter three compared to. I learnt many years ago, thing &#x2013; from the day you born until you ride the horse, things were never so bad that they can't get worse, and this would &#x2013; I'm trying to say things, we might think quarter three financial quarter four last year was bad, it may get worse. It &#x2013; what is &#x2013; please look at the comparables. The first six months, great, so purely arithmetically and financially, you're looking at a different comparable. But I think what Norbert also &#x2013; he was going to say that it got a bit long.</p>
          <p>No, no, with all those bloody bumps that they prepare that he's got to read. We're talking about this is 15% down, my God, how terrible, 30% down, unbelievable disaster. 2006, we thought we're hell of a year in 2006. Let's put things in perspective. So we have a bad year this year. That's the equivalent of two years ago. We have the terrible years, the equivalent of three years ago. We've got to get out costs back in line to three years ago. We're not going to go under.</p>
          <p>It's relative. I had a long session with my son last summer before Lehman Brothers <mark type="inaudible" />. I said we're going to have real issues, this thing hasn't started. So I said to him, and he said but dad, why do you say everybody's lost money. I said until you sold in the first place you never had the money. So if your share price goes down by 30%, you never had the money. The money, yes, it was stated, but until you realized you never had the money. Do you have to sell, I said I don't have to sell, I said you don't owe any money, I said no. So I said so relax, you never had it, so you never lost it. And as for now is the time to like what you've got.</p>
          <p>You loved the house before, what if it's worth 30% less, you loved it before, keep on loving it, so I told yeah it's not bad. Then I said him the big problem is my generation. I've got a lot of friends that work very hard, that saved a lot, not everybody as fortunate to people in this room. People were in the Navy with me, people that I went to university with, school with who were good solid folks, are good solid folks.</p>
          <p>We trusted the savings institutions and South Africa is very well off in comparison to rest of the world, these people should be put in jail. For the lack of maintenance or purchasing power in the pensions and in the retirement funds that they manage. But I see, you know what I'm talking if this thing carries on my generation will have to work until they're 75, people are simply not going to have the retirement funds at their disposals. He asked me how long it's going to last, I said I don't know, it could be six years, it could be eight years and think of my generation, think of when I mentioned a few names <mark type="inaudible" /> and that shocked him. But the next day and you &#x2013; should I say the non-Britisher wouldn't know what I'm talking about? But at least the Europeans know football World Cups, Americans don't understand they have a World Series they play every year, but the rest of world play one another every four years.</p>
          <p>So we have cycles of World Cups, whether it be cricket or rugby or football. When he came back the next morning and he said to me, do you remember at Edgbaston when Lance Klusener and Allan Donald ran each other out in that stupid match in the World Cup against Australia. He said of course I remember and South Africa basically lost the World Cup. That was eight years ago. So you're right, he said don't think of this in terms of quarters or years, think it in terms of World Cups. I feel totally happy and it is, everybody remember two soccer World Cups ago. Everybody remembers Italy winning, Germany losing, but let's think of it in terms of World Cups, let's think of it in a four-year or an eight-year cycle. Is that's what we really ought to do? We'll survive and we'll be better off then. That's all that we can do as management.</p>
          <p>I read, I must tell you, I've always admired <mark type="inaudible" /> I call him the cat, I'm the mouse, don't play cat and mouse games. If he is the cat, I'm the mouse. I admire him, but I've grown to envy them now, because we are &#x2013; they're clearly in a far better space than we are. I don't know how, but we are going to have some tough times. When I think Patek and they announced that, Fossil that they've got issues, Rolex announced, I spoke to two of the three top motor car manufacturers' marketing directors in the last two to three weeks, had meetings with them, they're down 30%; Sotheby's, Christie's, everybody is down and live with it, get used to it. You like to ask before, love it because you ain't going to sell it at what you sold it for a year ago or two years ago, so we may as well sit back, company owes nobody &#x2013; we've got cash, there is no pressure on the company and this is critical.</p>
          <p>As the controlling shareholder crudely put, I don't have the cash needs, that's why we covered, what have we covered now -- six times? So we leave the cash in the company, hopefully we'll continue to generate free cash, with that we'll build brand equity. When the inevitable happens and the economy returns we'll be better off. It's all we can really do. That sounds crazy, it sounds like a platitude, but it's the only thing you can do. And do slightly better than your competitors. We have more flexibility. I'm sorry that, I can't give you quarter-by-quarter except that is mathematical.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to probably not ask you an easy one, but a simple one and if we take a one to two to three year view this time around and we look back at the profound changes in consumer psychology that are ongoing some structural, some cyclical, we know that the business is not about price points as you explained before. Lower price points do not necessarily equate to lower margins in this business. We know polarization of spending can be a fantastic opportunity for the Group. How do you look at price? And how do you look at mix in the coming two to three years? I mean Richard explained that some of the negative impact from currency and production on the gross margin were offset by price mix. How do you look at price and mix going forward as opposed to the past two to three years in &#x2013; for Richemont? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very, very, very &#x2013; it's certainly not a simple question. It's a very tough question. I think firstly one of the issues we've got to look at, Sophie is going to hate it because it's certainly not a selling point. We've got to look at consumer behavior and think do people wish to show wealth when nobody else has any money. So we've started a while ago changing our products to far more discrete. I've taken a bit white gold and platinum will start returning in certain products above yellow gold. Is those people with money would prefer not to show that they still have it when their friends have lost, or their children's friends have lost, children's friends' parents have lost jobs, or your wife's best friend's husband, or your wife's best friend's lady or something is an executive, so it &#x2013; I think the flamboyance is going to be gone for a while. Or one's got to live with it, that's why I asked my colleagues to have a very good look at what sold in the '30s.</p>
          <p>It wasn't fiesta, gala party time. It was discrete design, that's why we started looking at these things a long time ago. Now we touched upon the savings of nations and of societies. This is a very turbulent situation, it could --- it could flat out turn into a big inflation, if it's not managed properly over the next two to three years.</p>
          <p>I think all of the excess leverage insists in the system, is being assumed by governments in some way of &#x2013; or other. Some of it is by the private sector, but not enough and governments are assuming as an &#x2013; they think an interim measure through central banks, this leverage. They're going to have to de-lever some time. Now either, they're going to have to find the capital in the markets, which will crowd out the private sector, or they're going to have to tax a living hell out of the consumers. All inflate their liabilities into oblivion. There are not too many other options.</p>
          <p>My first concern when I spoke to you over the last few years was what's going to happen when the economy changes, then I started worrying about trade wars, luckily touchwood, it's not gone as badly as I thought, touchwood up till now is that would be a second depression.</p>
          <p>It is a bit of reality. My real concern is what's going to happen to the socioeconomic fabric, when the savers find out how they've been treated. Because sooner or later the saver is going to start rebelling. Savers, conservative people are being forced into equities right now, while the total destruction you can't get any interest on any savings. I'm not even talking about your plans, I'm not talking about institution, I'm talking about the men and women, who &#x2013; they don't retire, they don't have the potential to increase their earnings over the next 10 to 15 years, and I think we're going to have some structural problems in society.</p>
          <p>And you too young to remember also, but regard and bother mind of in para 68, May '68, that thing's going to get volatile very quickly, I don't think Spain can sustain this unemployment rate for three, four, five years, I just don't think so. So when you look at two, three, four, five years, I'm just very thankful that we've managed to keep our brand equity strong enough, that we have pricing power, because that's always been focusing on the last five to eight years with all the SPCCs.</p>
          <p>Now, what gives me hope? The increases in productivity of those countries liberated post the fall of the Berlin Wall, BRIC, the famous BRIC countries, and I think that will more than compensate for the declines that we're going to experience in our "traditional markets." But luckily, we have spent enough time and money, and energy in what we today call developing markets. I don't think we should call China a developing market. I mean it's a millennia-old society, there's a little hiccup for 80 years. It's one of the most scattered societies on earth.</p>
          <p>India, these are major economies. And I think the slack, we're going to have to learn that some of our traditional markets will become less important to us. And we're going to have to focus more and more time and attention in markets where we do have the pricing power. And it's a constant chess game, luckily we have the brand equity that it still can translate into pricing power, but you hit up on the very, very key. It's &#x2013; that determines our margins in the long run.</p>
          <p>However, we must question whether even people can afford or want to show. Some people have no choice, they have to be true, but other people will try to appear to be true. If you think about it, nobody's going to want to show when his neighbor lost his job, pulled into the drive away with a new Lamborghini. Luckily it's not yet a societal issue in most of the development &#x2013; in most of the developing world, but unfortunately overall this is going to be a problem.</p>

          <p>Luca Solca from Sanford Bernstein. It seems to be that one of ways that government may think of addressing the issue of having all this leverage is to increase taxes on the higher income segments of the population. Do you think that this could be particularly negative for brands and products that appear to be focused at the very high-end and do you expect the high-end or the aspirational price points to be fairing better in the years to come?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I fully suspect that the governments are going to start looking for other &#x2013; or should I say, they are going to increase, but you know, today intellectual property is much more mobile than these bureaucrats understand. In the past you own a factory in Sheffield, so that's a living day lodge out of UK you got to stay in Sheffield, today you say sayonara, gone. By the way, when I go, my intellectual property goes, <mark type="inaudible" /> somewhere else and you cannot tax bits, ones and zeros like you can tax Athens.</p>
          <p>Intellectual property is harder to tax. So if a government goes overboard, the people will move and there is other people that are going to accumulate a bigger proportion of the creation of wealth over the next decade or two. By the way, in the developing world, they are sick and tired of governments who overtax and communism etcetera, etcetera.</p>
          <p>They've had their dose of communism, they don't want it again. They are super private enterprise oriented, but I agree, you're going to see in some of old Europe tax, UK for instance, but you know already as Norbert said, Europe is doing very well, majority of our sales inside Europe today are to non-Europeans, non-traditional Europeans.

          <p>Three, 4% of our sales, traveling Chinese. I'm talking total, global, global. These are people with taste, with culture and they're going to travel. And when we look at traveling Japanese a decade ago, forget it, the number, traveling Indians. India has a got very high luxury goods tax.</p>
          <p>For those of you who know something about cricket that the bombings in India, in Mumbai, and then they bombed the Sir Lankan team, so the whole IPL, this 20-20 stuff moved to South Africa, and I met these people, billionaires that I've never heard off in my life, the team owners, that I come with my private plane, so I think what he's flying, well, a little Airbus, we've never heard of these people. Do they love Cartier? Yeah, the long tradition history, they're not going to buy in India, are they going stop buying, no. They love luxury, they've just started buying luxury watches. They love it. They'd buy in Dubai, they'll buy in London, or buy globally.</p>
          <p>It's the old Coco Chanel story, money is money is money, it's only the pockets that change. We are selling very well in the Middle East at the moment, very, very well. There is no destruction of money. They're just in other pockets. Now we've got to find the pockets before the taxman does, it's &#x2013; okay, don't laugh.</p>
          <p>I have a friend, you've heard of SABMiller, I've got this friend, Meyer Khan, who really booked the business and we're in the wine business and he wiped us out in all the townships of South Africa with a very simple thing, every night, these illegal bars and so forth who take their cash, he just made sure that the beer truck got to the bar before we did. He took the cash first. By the time our guys got there in their suits, nice, I would sorry, but I've already bought my beer, but don't you want to buy some Vodka, stuff, sorry I bought and he taught me get to the cash first.</p>
          <p>If you get to the shebeen at 1 o'clock at night, service, service, service, service, so Brazil does well, it's &#x2013; there will always be places where people will have money and if you have unique items plus you look after the Maisons, this is what I alluded to earlier on with Gucci. I mean, Gucci in the '70s and early '80s became cheap and nasty. Then Maurizio Gucci saw &#x2013; got Dawn Mello and they cleaned the line up. They had the guts to do that. They put the pricing power and the escalation back to the brand. And this is why we are the SPCCs, to stop my colleagues from picking low-hanging fruit.</p>
          <p>And believe me when Norbert was at Montblanc <mark type="inaudible" />. When he got to the head office, he understood why he loved it, with Cartier, <mark type="inaudible" /> I had dinner with him on Tuesday night, he said we love it. We absolutely love it because if they want to do something -I'll give you an idea, I drive in, outside New York <mark type="inaudible" /> billboard with a Cartier watch on. Took a picture with his iPhone, sent it to me, I call Bernard, went berserk, Bernard didn't know about it, he called the person in New York, he went berserk, the guy in New York didn't know that &#x2013; what's the billboard company this big, big, big...</p>

          <p>No, no. I think of somebody. I know that empty space they thought, they do a Cartier a favorite and put the balloon blown, a billboard on a turnpike in New Jersey, that's what I love about the SPCC and instantaneous communication. That billboard was gone two days later. It's &#x2013; friend of mine walks up the stairs in Dubai, at the airport and he sees IWC on the steps. He takes a picture, emails me, I e-mail George, I say, I'm going to Dubai in a weeks' time, those stairs have still got IWC on, you <mark type="inaudible" />. It's gone.</p>
          <p>That straphangers in Hong Kong shaped like a watch. Another mate of mine, because all my friends and all the colleagues, a day ago, hey, what's going on? <mark type="inaudible" /> I get it, Norbert gets it, it's just forward question mark. And we have things called the career limiting move, which is the first time you see a billboard, a career limiting move is when Alain Perrin or Norbert, or I get them installed there.</p>
          <p>Now, it sounds stupid. It's the little things that in the end. So that's why Norbert also said it's easier for us to keep our volumes down and not force feed or have a push policy. Some of our competitors are still going ahead with the push policy. Our clients are not stupid, the retailers. If they can't sell it, it moves through the gray market like this, and it pops up in an another place at a discount.</p>
          <p>So what happens, I go and I buy a car in South Africa and Mercedes-Benz, sold the car to me at a good price because <mark type="inaudible" /> give it to my wife for her 50th year birthday, she is happy. Then the rand stops appreciating against the euro. It goes from 12 to seven. Mercedes now has a little bit of a problem because their margins are going through the roof. Do they drop their price, or do they make more money? They drop their price. A year of <mark type="inaudible" /> 20%, I'm going to kill them. They've just wrecked the residual value of my investment, because when you buy an SL, it's an investment, you know what I'm saying.</p>
          <p>When they did it, it's we &#x2013; wife still drives it, what's it's 10 years later, but luckily the rand has now weakened again, so unkind of imbalance, but what you do if you're Mercedes-Benz, because they dropped it. I luckily have got it to the proper price because I was directed, but a friend of mine actually didn't. And six months after he bought it his new car cost 15% less than what he paid, so it's not easy with currencies, when you are selling precious goods, investment items, don't flood the market.</p>
          <p>I mean, imagine you are buying a watch for &#x20AC;20,000 and your son is a little bit more in the Web than you, you buy it for your wife, and he says dad, dad, dad, I hope you got it on XYZ site for 11,000. So what are you talking about? Let me go and have a look. How can you charge me this if I can buy and pay for that. And of course, 90% of this stuff you see on web are not &#x2013; those products are not available, but the image is there that it's available.</p>
          <p>So in order to make sure that the pipeline is clean, you're going to take remedial actions in the beginning and you have a slow down in your factory. Okay. And some people say blah, blah, blah but very interestingly the fact that our retail is up by more than wholesale. If you really think logically it means, where is Gary, Gary Saage, Gary, it means our pipeline is clean.</p>
          <p>That's the logical deduction that I have learnt over 25 years. It means they still is stuck in the pipeline somewhere because there's always a lead lag, ladies and gentlemen between wholesale and retail always. We've seen it for 30 years that I have been in the business now and with Cartier to meet a perfect lead indicator because we have a lot of wholesale of watches <mark type="inaudible" /> and a lot of retail.</p>
          <p>We can see when the guys have ordered too much and Cartier last year took what &#x20AC;70 million worth of sales over the 18 months out that they could have sold. They could have sold more, but Bernard said, I believe that there's going to be a crisis, I want my pipeline clean. So he actually restricted, he did not deliver upon order, <mark type="inaudible" />. So therefore the pipeline is cleaner internally and it's, we can go on for six days with a little nuances. I have been in it for 50 years, Richard, I've got &#x2013; we've nearly got 100 years amongst the three of us and the things are not always obvious, I don't know your business.</p>
          <p>I'm petrified that I now, having gone into this Reinet thing because it's actually easier to make money than it is to manage money. I don't know how to advise people what to do because you know nuances that I hadn't even thought off. But in our business it's all about nuances.</p>
          <p>There's certain indicators that you know, that you check, clean stop being not only that your balance sheet is clean, but because of that critical question that you ask, which is pricing power. If you push, it pops somewhere else and it wrecks your brand and it wrecks the aspirational aspect of it and the investment aspect. The good news is, if you look at Sotheby's and Christie's, you look at the percentage of jewel sales, it's Cartier and it's Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, and go and have look at it's &#x2013; what 90% of their sales.</p>

          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Zurcher Kantonalbank. I have three questions, firstly, coming back to regarding Middle East. It really surprised me that it's still doing very well there, I mean some competitors have more problems and all, for example, Dubai a little bit. I mean, yet, there is real estate crisis, less tourists from Russia, and you're still growing there, what's really behind it? What's your view about Middle East, let's say, for the next one to three years?</p>
          <p>And secondly, to more financial questions for Richard, firstly regarding financial result, if the currencies would stay at current levels, what would you expect from the hedging side for the current year? And secondly, I know it's always very difficult but just as a best guess estimate for the tax rate for the current year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, Dubai as you know is a desert. I have this friend <mark type="inaudible" /> 1,400-bedroom hotel. I'm surprised there were 50 paying guests a night, that's one sector of the economy. Our high jewelry sales are doing very, very well, it's totally a different sector of society. I would say that traffic in Dubai would be down for the time being. But yes, we are doing very, very well with unique pieces and high jewelry sales in the region. Saudi, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and in Dubai.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The question for the finance cost, you will have seen the appendix addressed for 2008 and of course, if exchange rates remain and deliver prevailing today we will continue to have good margin for us to benefit in our gross margin of current exchange rate. When will...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, if we knew that the currency is going to stay exactly the same we could save a fortune or the hedging cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, <mark type="inaudible" /> hedging is less and <mark type="inaudible" /> losses on hedging <mark type="inaudible" /> but I remember that it's a good news to have losses on hedging program because it just means that you are gaining more, you are just hedging 70% of the net exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is important, when you go through all this, you will see our hedging costs were 172, 73 million, it's a hell of a lot of money, but we only hedged 70%, which means we gained more in margin over the period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we believe -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, it's very important again for universal pricing to keep brand equity so you don't suddenly have products lying all over the world. So it's a cost of doing business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the tax rate, we believe that 18% tax rate is sustainable as long as tax rate prevailing today in the country in which we operate and remain stable that we can predict, for the foreseeable future, which for me is very sure, it's sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Governments are in a bit of buying tax wise, let me just make <mark type="inaudible" /> and that you got to think about in your broader lines. The only way the world is going to get out of this mess is through economic growth. You only grow your sales out of debt. Societies can only grow themselves out of debt.</p>
          <p>The United States and Europe cannot get out of this mess without economic growth, because there is a debt to GDP ratio, which is a medium to very long-term ratio is only so much that that is sustainable to GDP. And if these two get out of line they revert to the north but if, currently the debt to GDP ratio is moving back into life but if the GDP drops, that ratio gets out of line again and I think certainly the friends in United States and belatedly our friends here at European Central Bank are <mark type="inaudible" /> to that factor.</p>
          <p>Europe and the United States and Asia the major economic zones cannot tax and save itself others disaster, it can not only be through economic growth. So when they start over taxing, it's going to stop economic growth. So even if Gordon Brown wants to tax a 103%, it ain't going to happen, they are going to have to behave, they are going to have cut government expenditure drastically.</p>
          <p>They cannot just tax and spend anymore because that &#x2013; when net ratio goes forget the 1930s we're going to be there from very long time at least they have learnt that and I think you will see in the United States, they realize it and I think in Europe, they realize it which is good for us. It's the one thing that I can guarantee you, we're not going to get out of this without the economic growth.</p>
          <p>You cannot save yourself and tax yourself into solvency, it doesn't work that way. You have to get economic growth, we got to get economic growth back &#x2013; it's going to also mean a lot more trade, you'll have to get more trade going, which basically means this quantitative easing's going to have to carry on for a while.</p>
          <p>By the way I heard a wonderful story the other day, some of you may have heard it, this Russian gentleman checks in to this lovely little hotel in Saint-Gobain, but he hasn't seen the room, it's way up on a little hill, so he &#x2013; the hotel owner says to him, okay, well, it's a &#x20AC;1,000 deposit, gentlemen says fine, here's the &#x20AC;1,000, he quickly runs to butcher, the hotel owner repays him the &#x20AC;1,000. The butcher gets up and he says I owe the farmer a &#x20AC;1,000, he runs to farmer, he gives the farmer a &#x20AC;1,000. The farmer owns &#x2013; owes the local prostitute &#x20AC;1,000, so he runs to her and gives the &#x20AC;1000. The prostitute didn't pay for the room at the hotel, so she runs back quickly and gives the hotel owner the &#x20AC;1,000. So they have all wiped out the debt. The Russian comes back and he says, the bloody hotel room is too small, give my money back, takes the money back, he goes out <mark type="inaudible" />. Get the money to move.</p>
          <p>The diamond business is in a disaster, because there are certain banks that are not lending. Once it starts moving, once things start easing <mark type="inaudible" /> will start picking up, hopefully we will not have any inflation, but I'm not overly concerned about governments being enticed into over taxation because that will stop growth, which means it's going to exacerbate the problem.</p>
          <p>I hope that's a crazy answer but it's a bird's eye view answer. But you can go to bed knowing we're not going to get out of this without economic growth as societies. So the &#x2013; and even the left wing governments understand that, those who tend, although you've got bit of a lunatic in Germany.</p>

          <p>I anyway wanted only, more or less to repeat what the Chairman said. We have to drive to get the cost back to the relevant year depending on the way sales move and we are working on that. We had a list of <mark type="inaudible" /> which my Chairman asked me to put aside for the time being because we believe that for the time being what we have done is encapsulating our vision on the short-term, if the vision is right because there is no vision as we said at times</p>

Obviously, you're not going to stop cutting muscle. So we have the models in place. I asked every head of every Maisons to present 15% down and emergency 30% down. We've already met with a few of them; we're meeting with every single one of them over these two weeks and they fully on top of ramifications because we do now have the tools at the center.

          <p>Look, all things being equal, it's not going to be &#x2013; you can relax about it. Okay. There is enough cash. Our budget is very cash flow positive including all the provisions. I asked my colleagues what happens if our sales drop by 30% and we change nothing in our cost structure, we're still cash flow positive. Those for the models that Gary helped us with, we went line item by line item and said what happens if our sales over the full year drop by 30%, we're still cash flow positive.</p>
          <p>That assumes we make no changes and we keep the same amount of rand support and obviously we keep a fixed ratio of marketing and selling, communication to sales. So obviously we'll drop that by 30% so it's, really not a logical answer. However, I wanted to as to make our dear Sophie happy that I can sleep at night, I asked 30% down what happens, we're cash flow positive. Is that a &#x2013; because obviously we have similar concepts.</p>

          <p>How did you in that scenario model your working capital evolution? Can you give us bit of clarity on that?</p>

          <p>Well. Have you got three days? It took me a week for them to go, it's series of models but it's leads and lags. If we see it goes down, we take more steps at the factory level. So it's very, very difficult except to say we have addressed. Please believe me, we have addressed.</p>

          <p>I'll give you one final statement. It's very ironical that the current Chairman of BAT is a very close friend, Jan du Plessis, his wife is a medical doctor, was always against tobacco. Now he is non-smoking Chairman of BAT, really good friend. For years, everybody said be a pure luxury goods company, and I said no. Once, I knew that Norbert, Richard, Gary, had this business sorted out, I said &#x2013; and it was a conscious decision. Demerge, but I'm not going to opine on whether we should sell, because everybody and I'll give you a list of investment banks, who said sell, here's your whack versus debt and go and buy XYZ, luxury goods companies for cash. Had we done it, we would have looked like Rio Tinto today.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> how he did that I don't know, but, anybody who bought in a number of segments for cash and borrowed in the last three years have got balance sheet and cash flow problems, serious balance sheet and cash flow problems and this is with a traditionally low interest rate, historically low interest rate as we speak. How all of these people are going to get out of it, I don't know. And I pull my legs if I'm a reformed prostitute as I said because I used to be investment banker, but I call all my friends and I say of course you're going to make money because all the people you got into trouble <mark type="inaudible" /> out of trouble. So it's another department in your investment bank that's blossoming.</p>
          <p>From <mark type="inaudible" /> it's now restructuring department. But please do not and I know there are one or two of you that are questioning the timing of the demerger and questioning us addressing cost. You can do either, but do not do both. Because Norbert Platt had hell on earth aided and abetted by Richard and especially Gary, getting our Maisons cost structures down.</p>
          <p>Had we still had BAT in &#x2013; forget it folks, it would have been impossible to drive the costs to where they should be. That security blanket of that free cash flow would have made it very tough for Norbert, Richard, and Gary to drive the costs down to where they should be. And I'm very happy, we did it because there is a cost consciousness that still upped this group now, which was very, very tough to start implementing in the first quarter of last year when people saw what was happening with their sales, which lead to the first six months here.</p>
          <p>Remember, all of our colleagues saw the sell-in, and the sales &#x2013; records sales and when we started telling look things are going to change, you better tighten up now, they were very, very reluctant. Now they'll believe us, but now it actually gets to a stage where I think we've beaten up a little bit too much, where in fact we need to explain to them the Van Cleef &amp; Arpels story about how as Marty says never waste a good recession. Don't waste good recessions.</p>
          <p>Creativity, usual downtime, there is one Maisons, that I'm particularly fond of because I brought it into the Group, Panerai, and I sat with Angelo, now he's got the cleanest of balance sheets. Things are going very well, so I said Angelo, there are one or two little things with amongst us, there are still some designs with one or two of this, perhaps I'm not happy with, it's not perfect yet. So use your time to fix it.</p>
          <p>People are not complaining but it's not perfect. So we will use this time to increase our quality of our products bit-by-bit. At the same time, focusing on client service, because frankly it's not &#x2013; we're now doing mystery shopping throughout the group and one of our brands came to us and said he was absolutely shocked, it was what 65 &#x2013; what was it Marty &#x2013; 65, what did they say on Monday 65% and that's not good enough. They want to get it to 90%.</p>
          <p>So now, you can use the time to plan your stock. There is another huge advantage, you don't have any normal stock turnover, where every salesperson comes to you and say hey, hey, hey, give me 20% more otherwise I will go across the road. Well, across the road owes a ton of money now, across the road has got about a bit of slick, across the roads margins have evaporated, and across the roads saying well, hang on, maybe we'd overstock, and so we fully intent to use this recession for the benefit of the customers and for the benefit of the shareholders and we will support our colleagues during the process.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
