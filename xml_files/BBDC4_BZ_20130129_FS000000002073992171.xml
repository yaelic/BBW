      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter of 2012 was marked by recovery of the global economy. We think this is very moderate and between July and September we saw the lowest level in terms of growth. Global economic risks remained unevenly negative but they are manageable and are currently noted as lower than those seen during 2012.</p>
          <p>With this scenario, the global economy outlook towards Brazilian economy is positive from the commercial view point and also considering the lack of inflationary pressures or abrupt reduction of international liquidity over the next months. The recovery of Brazil's economy also continues moderate, but it is certain that the second half of 2012 was better than the first half.</p>
          <p>In 2013, the normalization of supply in trade in manufacturing is going to recover industrial production under our scenario where household consumption continues growing at solid pace, supported by employment and income growth. It is also worth mentioning that excellent outlook for domestic agri business as well as its positive effects on the economies of small and medium sized cities. Brazil continues moving forward in institutional terms and most recently, policies concerning the central issues have been adopted such as infrastructure and production costing phases.</p>
          <p>Concerning the financial industry, specifically 2012 revealed a very challenging scenario. It is important to evaluate the changes in the system in view of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:30) that this industry has undergone over the past years. Therefore, financial institutions have been taking a very close look at the flow of operations and at the same time, they have improved the scope of general sales offered to their clients. It is within this microeconomic context that this fourth quarter results were affected.</p>
          <p>Slides 2 and 3 show our period highlights. I would particularly like to draw your attention to the Slide 2 showing our adjusted net income for 2012 which reached R$11.523 billion in 2012 2.9% up on 2011. Total assets came to more than R$879 billion, 15.4% up in the year while our expanded loan portfolio increased by 11.5% in the same period totaling R$385 billion.</p>
          <p>On Slide 3, it's worth noting our assets under management, which ended the year at R$1.225 trillion, a 20% increase over December 2011. It is also worth mentioning the improvement in our efficiency ratio, which closed the fourth quarter at 41.5%, its lowest level for the past 10 quarters.</p>
          <p>On Slide 4, we show the reconciliation between our book net income and adjusted net income. This quarter, the main non-recurring items were the recording of tax credits and the full goodwill amortization, both from BERJ totaling R$1,389 million and R$1,156 million respectively. And again, of the R$793 million from the sale of Serasa shares and the recognition of impairment losses amounting to R$1,470 million, R$527 million of which resulting from the return revaluation of rights to provide banking services and R$890 million relating to investments in shares classified as available for sale due to the adjustment of the book value to their realization value.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for these items, our fourth quarter adjusted net income changed to R$2,918 million and our annual adjusted net income came to R$11,523 million. You can see on this slide that our return on average equity came to 19.2%.</p>
          <p>Slide 5 shows our historical shares of our quarterly net income. Income growth in the fourth quarter was mainly due to the higher volume of operations and financial transactions and the expanded offer of products and service, both having a positive effect on fee income and the net interest income growth from both non-interest and interest earning operations and the reduction in the cost of the delinquency. In the annual comparison, adjusted net income increased by R$325 million or 2.9% thanks to the upturn in net interest income, net of provision for loan loss, the increase in fee income due to a higher volume of transactions as a result of the investments in organic growth and the increased revenues from insurance fee operations.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 6, I would especially like to draw your attention to our 12 months efficiency ratio, the red line which improved for the fourth consecutive quarter, falling by 60 basis points and closing the fourth quarter at 41.5% its lowest level for the last same quarters. This important performance was due to our continuous rough efforts to control expenses including the initiatives of our efficiency committee and the maturation of our investment in organic growth and the investment in information technology which had a positive effect on the net interest income and fee income. The fourth quarter ratio improved by 206 basis points over the same period last year. The blue line shows the efficiency ratio adjusted to the risk which improved by 40 basis points over the previous quarter due to the same aspects mentioned above.</p>
          <p>On Slide 7 as we have already seen, total assets came to R$879 billion, R$118 billion or 15% up from December 2011. The return on average assets remained at 1.4% while the adjusted return on average assets stood at 19.2%. The Basel ratio closed the quarter at 16.1% and the slight variation was due to the increase in market rich assets partially offset by the increasing our Tier II capital which comprises super net debts. We highlight that this is the first and only Brazilian bank offered by the Central Bank to use its own internally developed market risk maintenance models to calculate regulatory capital as of January 2013.</p>
          <p>Slide 8 shows the relative share of our main operations in net incomes. In both the quarter and annual comparisons, the highlight was increasing the relative share of insurance activity mainly due to strong revenue growth in the Life Insurance and Pension Plan segments. The annual reduction in the share of loans was essentially due to the <mark type="ph" /> huge increase (12:10) in delinquency as well as the pressure on average spreads and the change in the portfolio mix.</p>
          <p>Let's look at Slide 9. Unrealized gains totaled R$24.9 billion in the fourth quarter, R$3.8 billion up on the quarter before, basically due to mark-to-market adjustments in our fixed income securities. These figures do not include the potential goodwill from our own properties in the total amount of R$3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>On Slide 10 we show the evolution of our net interest income from both non-interest and interest earning operations. The quarterly increase in total net interest income was basically due to the upturn in the interest earning portion, especially in relation to the insurance and loan operation lines and the non-interest portion reflecting higher arbitrage trading gains.</p>
          <p>The annual comparison it is worth noting the 12th upturn in the &#x2013; 12% upturn in the interest earning portion which was mainly due to the higher average business volumes, especially in regard to loans and securities operations.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 11, this quarter, the interest earning portion of net interest income increased by 0.7%. This is due to the upturn in business volumes and the higher insurance margin partially offset by the pressure on average spreads and the impact of the change in the loan portfolio mix. As we expected, the annualized net interest margin narrowed by 10 basis points to 7.3% in the period. We continue to expect nominal growth for the interest earning portion of the net interest income, but accompanied by a gradual decrease in the margin in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 gives a breakdown of the interest earning portion of the net interest income. In the quarter, it is worth noting the evolution in loans whose volume of operations helped offset the reduction of the effects produced by the change in the portfolio mix and the decline in the interest rates and insurance, as we mentioned previously, due to the reduction in the interest earning which resulted in lower expense from adjustment for inflation of the sum of the technical provisions in the period. These factors were offset by the lower gains from the securities margins. The annual highlights were the loans and securities margins, thanks to the increased business volume. The reductions in the funding and insurance margins were due to the declining in the SELIC and the upturn in the interest earnings respectively.</p>
          <p>On Slide 12 (sic) [Slide 13] (15:35) we can see that this quarter, the gross credit margin, the grey area, totaled R$7.527 billion sustained by the upturn in business volumes, although impacted by the pressure on average spreads and the change in the portfolio mix as I have already mentioned. The red area shows the provision for loan loss which fell over the third quarter as expected, helping push up the fourth quarter net credit margin. In the annual comparison, the net margin remained flat.</p>
          <p>Look at Slide 14, we see that our expanded loan portfolio totaled R$385 billion in December 2012, 3.7% up in the quarter and 11.5% up in the annual comparison. These increases were mainly due to an increase in the loans to large corporates, which moved up by 4.6% in the quarter and 15% in the 12 months and two SMEs which went up by 3.7% in the quarter and 10.6% in the year. In relation to the <mark type="ph" /> annual portfolio group (17:01), if we exclude the acquired loan portfolio plus the <mark type="ph" /> Bacen (17:08) portfolios, they remain the lowest growth by around 15%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 15, this quarter I would like to emphasize the reduction in our delinquency ratio in both in large corporate and SME segments. In the individual segment, the ratio remains flat. In the coming quarters we expect a gradual decreasing the delinquency in light of its short term behavior and the expected economic scenario for 2013.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows our delinquency ratio for loans overdue by between 61 and 90 days, which presented a reduction this quarter confirming our expectations and the trend of gradual decrease.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows that our provisioning ratios remained strong, so much so that our provisions exceed the Central Bank requirement by R$4 billion. Assuming the maintenance of the 12 months gross and net loss ratios, as from December 2011, we have booked provisions of R$7.6 billion above expected gross loss in the next 12 months, is the dotted part of the blue line, or even R$11.1 billion in relation to losses net of recoveries, the dotted part of the purple line, also for the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>On Slide 18, underlining what we mention in regard to the previous slides, we showed a coverage ratio of the allowance for loan loss in relation to credits overdue by more than 90 and 60 days which have remained at very comfortable levels. It is worth noting that the increasing the coverage ratio for loans overdue by more than 60 days reflecting the reduction in the short term delinquents.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 19, we see that the best chance in organic growth is from the second half of 2011 such as increasing the number of branch and the served point. That's one extension of our customer base in credit card portfolio which increases by almost 2 million cards in the period, in turn leading to a continuous upturn in transaction volumes as a result in fee income.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter fee income totaled R$4.675 billion, 5.3% up on the previous quarter mainly due to higher income from cards, underwriting, and financial advisor services and checking accounts. In the annual comparison, fee income increased by 15% led by underwriting and financial advisory services which grew by 73.5%, credit cards which moved up by 18.2% due to the formation expansion of the credit card base and the higher revenue strong cards and the income from checking accounts due to the expanded customer base.</p>
          <p>Let's now look to the Slide 20. The growth in our operating expense was below 10%. In fact, it reached 7.7% for the year which is below the lowest end of the guidance range 8%. Once again underlining our strong cost controls, with active improvement of our internal efficiency committee's fourth quarter operating expense increases by 3.2% over the previous three months, mainly due to the higher business volumes and the seasonal occurring margin expense.</p>
          <p>The 7.5% annual increase was due to the impact of investments made in the period, offset by our strong cost control according to our search for higher efficiency. The upturns in personnel expense were mainly caused by salary increases in line with the 2011 and 2012 collective bargaining agreement and the expansion of workforce in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking at the slide 21, we can see that the 5.3% increase in fourth quarter administrative expense was basically due to advertising expense and a higher volume of fees and sales partially offset by reduced expenses with third-party services. The 5.6% increase in the annual comparison was mainly due to the higher expenses from the upturn in fees and service volumes, the expansion of our distribution network and the contractor adjustments. It is worth noting that in the last 12 months the IPCA and the IGP-M recorded valuations of 5.8% and 13.8% respectively.</p>
          <p>The Slide 22 shows revenues from our insurance, pension plan and capitalization bond activities, which increased by 31% this quarter primarily due to the strong upturn in the pension plan segment boosted by the higher concentration of pension plan contributions in the period. In the annual comparison, there was a 17.7% increase.</p>
          <p>Our segments did well, once again recording double-digit growth. Fourth quarter net income moved up by 15.2%, mainly due to higher revenues, the improved financial results, our claim ratio and control and a greater at-risk achieved efficiency. The 12.1% annual upturn was basically due to the 17.7% increase in revenues, in turn, caused by a stricter control over claims and the reductions in the general and administrative expense.</p>
          <p>The slide 23 shows some of main figures of our insurance activities. The combined ratio came to 86.6% in the fourth quarter, nearly flat in comparison with the previous three months. Financial assets totaled R$142 billion while technical provisions stood at R$124 billion, R$108 billion of which from Life Insurance and Pension Plans products.</p>
          <p>The slide 24 shows our economic department GDP, interest rate, inflation and exchange rate estimates for 2013 throughout 2015. We believe these stimuli introduced through various economic product channels and instruments which led to the recovery in Brazil's growth even through few modest and concentrate in the second half of 2012. We will become more apparent in the coming quarters resulting in higher and more stable economic growth in the years ahead, with a strict control over inflation and the maintenance of interest rates.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows our guidance for 2013. In 2013, we believe the loan portfolio will continue to expanding, growing by between 13% and 17%, mainly versus by loans to individuals and the SMEs. We expect to see a slowdown in our operating expenses given our substantial investments, especially in information technology and our cost cutting initiatives under our continued search for improved efficiency.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we believe our results in 2012 were satisfactory. Given the modest pace of account activity throughout the year, not to mention the internal and external challenges we had to face. The effect of our investments over the last few years in infrastructure, technology and new products and services enable to increase the volume of transactions, helping us offset to pressure on margins.</p>
          <p>The constant improving our efficiency ratio reflected the tighter control over the expansions and we also had the significant contribution of the insurance group to the annual results. It is worth noting that these results came from the correct positioning of our organic growth strategy and the strong synergy between the banking and our insurance activities.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are fully aware that business opportunities are likely to become more challenging in an increasingly demanding and competitive marketing. However, while there is commitment of supporting the country development, Bradesco is prepared to face this scenario leveraging its banking and insurance activities which are responsible and sustainable approach.</p>
          <p>Thank you all very much for your attention. And we are now available to answer any questions that you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut, Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Luiz Carlos, couple of questions. One, if I look at your overall loan loss provisions, last year they ended up amounting to about R$13 billion. That was a sharp increase compared to 2011 when you provisioned about R$10 billion. My question is given that you said that you think that the NPL ratio will continue to gradually improve over the next several quarters as indicated by the trend that you're seeing in asset qualities, do you see room for this large level of provision that you did for 2012 to come down and I'm asking if you can give us some parameters even though you are not providing guidance for loan loss provisions, I want to get a sense if there is a room for that to become another driver of earnings next year lower provisions and some of your companies have been guiding that way?</p>
          <p>And question number two is on fee income, you are guiding 9% to 13% even that you grew 15% this year in challenging conditions and in an economy that was growing very little. Would you say that 9% to 13% is rather conservative type of guidance or for a year in which you expect the economic growth to do much better than last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for your questions, Daniel. About the loan provisions, we expect that the delinquency ratio will continue declining for this 2013. It will be nice &#x2013; movement, not decrease, but if we consider the scenario that we have for 2013 and the lower interest rate. we expect that our delinquency ratio will decline during 2013. The expense with loan provision facing the second quarter or the second quarter was our peak in 2012 and in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we continued decreasing our expense. We normally don't give guidance, but we understand that it is the total expense that we will have in 2013 not to exceed the number that we have in 2012. And we understand that's probably will be very similar number will be that delinquency considering that the decrease that we're expecting in delinquency ratio. About the fee income our guidance is 9% to 13% it was not a conservative guidance but we understand that that in 2012 we had 15%. The number of transactions is growing very fast. We are working the same way for continuous improving our clients' days, improving the number of cards, working for our clients to use more the alternative channels for do transactions and we are very optimistic with our guidance increase, but now is what we understand that is possible, could be during the year if you understand that we can have, I mean previously then we will change the guidance but now is that what we understand that is possible to have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if I can clarify the question, was there anything unique in 2012 was it challenging year for Brazil overall that you were able to grow 15% fees and you think is going to be below that next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you compare one year with the other, the number that we have the base is we &#x2013; the number increase, then continues to a 15% year after year. This is difficult &#x2013; we understand that the guidance that we gave, 9% to 13%, is what is possible considering the targets that we have for the year. We expect &#x2013; we want that to grow more now number that we gave in the guidance, but what is reasonable what you'll have for this year is the guidance is 9% to 13%. About 2012 what we had is that the effects of the investments in the organic growth 1,000 new branches we had in improving the base, the client's base, the number of credit cards improved and the country started to use more to do more transactions during the year. This goal that we are having to expect that the investment that we did in improving our client base and the number of products that we offer for our clients.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Carlos Macedo with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions. I have a couple of questions both related to your margins. The first is related to your guidance. I was just trying to gauge how much confidence you have on the guidance you provided with 7% to 11% growth in net interest income from market sources &#x2013; not market sources, sorry, from interest. The credit if you look at your numbers, the average rate on your &#x2013; average yield on your loans, a decline from 11.1% in the fourth quarter last year to 10.6% in the fourth quarter this year. But most of the decline was in the third and the fourth quarter, especially in the fourth quarter once the new rates on credit card loans and et cetera were put in place. How, given the amount of loan growth that you expect for next year, do you think this is realistic 7% to 11% particularly with the pressure the government has been putting on pricing and on rates and on the competitive pressure that publicly held banks are putting. Do you think 7% to 11%? Is it going to be more towards the lower end of that or the higher end? And then I have a second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our guidance for margins is 11 to &#x2013; 7% to 11%. We are very confident with our guidance. This guidance is basing our internal discussions and is basing in our budgets and we are very confident with the guidance changing now &#x2013; not only in the net interest income, but in the other lines. We consider &#x2013; in the company that we have in the net interest income, we expect to grow to have a good growth in the credit margin, and the insurance margin will be better than the margin that we had in 2012, we expect to have growth and the margin bond and credits we expect to have streamline securities in order the lines we expect to have a stable growth &#x2013; or to grow a little more in this line, but in the total, we expect to grow at 7% to 11% according to our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but most of the growth, I mean in the credit margin do you think there will be a decline in the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be a decline in the credit margin, yes. We will expect that lines that we expect to grow more considering our guidance that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just a follow up, on the credit yields that are now at 10.6% and closed the year 2012 at 10.4%, do you expect that to contribute to this growth? Or are the credit yields continuing to contract as they have throughout 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The credit growth that we expect is 13% to 17%. We expect too to have the main contribution for the growing the margin to come from the credit line. And the &#x2013; we expected that in our &#x2013; consider only the credit margin that we have that we have in &#x2013; we expect that probably this sector to have during 2012. We will lose something in our operations with credit card that we change our rates but in the other line as we expect to improve our, we expect to maintain our spreads, we will work hard to maintain our spreads. We understand that we will have the high competition during 2011. But we will expect to have the compensation improve, we will have some compensation with more volume in the transaction. Then we will have some pressures in the spreads during the year but we expect to have compensation with more volume in transactions.</p>
          <p>And talk about the means that we have, we finished the year with 7.3% so we expect too that will continue to climb something in the mean for 2013. Probably during the year, we will finish the year with growth of 2012 with 13.3%. We expect to finish in 2013 which are up 7% considering the effect that we knew we will have during the year. Then we understand that the main contribution will come from spreads and we expect to maintain our guidance to reaching our guidance that is 7% to 11%.</p>

          <p>Okay, thanks. The second question is also related to the spreads and it's more related to the fourth quarter. The spread on interest for insurance operations increased by 60 basis points, which is a quite sizable jump. I was just wondering what the reason behind that increase was and if there is any &#x2013; it says here that it was a decline in inflation in IGP-M that benefited reserves. If you could give us some color here as to what to expect going forward for yields in insurance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main effect is that &#x2013; is because in the third quarter, the last quarter was because IGP-M, that was small and the effect on provisions we have a large <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:52) due to the adjusted inflation in this provision. The main effect that provide on increasing the insurance in the last quarter came from the IGP-M effect.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. I also wanted to follow up on the questions on your net interest income guidance, and more &#x2013; and I guess I will be even more specific, the securities and other line, you mentioned your expectation for securities and others will be more or less stable in 2013 versus 2012 and that is what is constituted or embedded in your guidance. The securities and other line rose 75% in 2012 versus 2011, and my understanding of that, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that there was a benefit from the lower interest rates on your prefixed portfolio, your fixed rate portfolio. If rates are to remain stable, I'm having a hard time understanding why that benefit from declining rates will continue to be there in 2012. Can you give us a little bit more color on why you're expecting that line item, securities and others, to remain stable in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In these lines, okay, we have &#x2013; thanks for your questions. In this line we have this effect of prefixed portfolio but we have the effect from other assets, some assets that is which is credit risk and we considering in this line. During this year, we will continue to having the effects from the prefixed portfolio in this line. In another very similar, or a little similar, that we had a year before in 2012. And we're having the effects of other assets there in this line, that is some assets that has credit risk <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:20) bank <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:22) and the other assets. This is why we understand that for this year we will have a stable effect in this line and choose what &#x2013; this is what to expect for designing securities and other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so in 2012 &#x2013; and sorry, these are somewhat technical questions, but in 2012, are these benefits valuation gains on these prefixed portfolios or are they actual gains in these spreads that you're making on that portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The increase that we have is not only because it prefixed portfolio, it is because there are other assets that we are increasing in these other assets our portfolio. Then one part of that this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:15) that we have in 2012 came from the prefixed portfolio. But we have the other asset that provided this growth during 2012, then not only with the prefixed portfolio effect that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe we can go over it off-line as well. The second question is related to your overall guidance. You mentioned on an earlier question that you think loan loss provisions will be at worst flat versus 2012. And if I look at your other guidance line, 7% to 11% net interest income, low double digit fees, operating efficiency improving, insurance 12% to 15% and you plug that into your model, you're getting to very &#x2013; pretty healthy earnings growth of sort of in the low teen to high teen range. Are you &#x2013; I know you don't give guidance for earnings and for ROEs, but is it fair to say that you're optimistic that earnings growth in 2013 is going to rebound versus what amounted to a fairly challenging 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are working hard for to improve our efficiency, improve our growing in operations. Then we had a guidance, the normal guidance that we have for ROEs is 18% to 20%. That's a <mark type="ph" /> works for two month thing (45:52), and we understand that's reasonable at this level for considering the scenario that we have now for the economy. We are working different fronts for to maintain the ROE in the efficiency that where we are having a panel committee of key efficiencies, where we look for opportunities for reduced costs or improved revenues, then is something that we &#x2013; is helping us to improve our efficiency. We have strong &#x2013; we did strong investments in IT and we expect to collect some benefits in &#x2013; during 2013 and 2014 with the investments in the IT, that is &#x2013; will reduce our costs and will improve &#x2013; will help us to improve some gains with the new system that we expect that we start to running during this year.</p>
          <p>And for efficiency, we have a target that is to reaching 39% in 2014, at the end of 2014. But we have other fronts. We have the &#x2013; our insurance business that represents around one-third of our profits, that is risk diversification. Then the insurance business, the ROE, the average ROE is around 24% or 25%, and this appears that will help us to improve our profitability for the next years.</p>
          <p>We expect that the delinquency ratio will continue declining, because considering the lower interest rates that we have, we understand that the delinquency ratio probably will adjusted in our model &#x2013; will be adjusting in our model at a lower level.</p>
          <p>And we are working hard for improve the volume of transactions, offer more products for our clients considering now the client base that we have, improving the profitability with these clients considering the investment that we did in the segmentation. The opportunities that we have with the synergy between the insurance and the financial business.</p>
          <p>Then we are working different fronts to improve our profitability. And the fees is another important revenue that we understand that will have some compensation &#x2013; will help us to have some compensation for the pressures in the margins. Then we have the &#x2013; we understand that is the more reasonable ROE that we have for the next years is 18% to 20%.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Let me ask you also a couple of questions. The first one is related to your loan growth guidance of 13% to 17%. I was interested in hearing what is your expectation for market growth, because in 2012 we saw your loan book expand about 8% but state-owned banks grow their loan books more than 20%. So I was wondering if you believe that the state-owned banks will be more rational or less aggressive in 2013, and then you expect to grow in line with the markets, or you still expect to continue to lose market share.</p>
          <p>And also related to that question, I think some of your margin pressure that we saw in 2012 was related to this aggressive competition from the state-owned banks. Do you think that we could also see a more rational pricing environment in 2013 as the state-owned banks become less aggressive? And finally, there's two and a half questions then, the &#x2013; if you could provide us with any guidance with regards to your sensitivity of net interest margins to movements in the SELIC rate. You do expect the SELIC rates to remain relatively stable going forward, but can you provide us any guidance, what would happen to your net interest margins if the SELIC were to increase 100 basis points in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mario, thank you for your questions. About the loan growth guidance here, for the system, we expect &#x2013; for the total system we expect to grow our around 15%. Then in our guidance 15% to 17%, the center of the guidance is 15%, then we expect to grow according to match, to maintain our market share. Then we work normally for increasing our participation in the operation but we expect to, quoting our guidance here, maintain our market share.</p>
          <p>Talk about the margin questions about the competition, we had a competitive during 2012 in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:37) in two product, in credit cards and overdraft accounts. Then for 2013, we did adjustments in these two products. And for the considering the growth that we expect for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:00) for 2013 and we understand that the quality of the borrowers are in excess of more investments during the year and its under the quality of the borrowers we will be better and we will help to improve the volume of transactions.</p>
          <p>And we expect to grow considering our guidance to grow with quality maintain our Web policy and you see that you have strong competition but we have capacity to compete in equal situation, we have a strong structure, we have scale and we can do operations very fast considering our structure and we understand that we have to compete in the maintain a good margin in the operation. And the guidance is, the next question is about the effect of which we have decreased in 100 basis points in our SELIC rates, these are around the, 1% or 100 points basis that is within our R$400 million before tax then if we have an increase or go down, is around R$400 million is the effect, but we expect that the SELIC rate to be stable during 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then so summarize what you said or to make sure that I understood is that you do expect then the state-owned banks to be more rational in 2013 for you to grow in line with the market rather than losing market share? And then we have already seen a significant impact of a lower interest rate environment already impacted your results in 2012 because the SELIC rate fell by almost 500 basis points during the year, is that right? So you already felt a big negative impact from the dropping SELIC rates in your results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for 2013 we expect that SELIC rate to be stable. There now we don't expect to have this manifest, but if you have an increase or want to increase around 100 basis points, the effect will be around R$400 million before tax is what, is the effect the average of this tax, but we doesn't expect modification SELIC rates for the year.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Good morning, everyone. Can you, just wanted a bit more specific on your expectation for NPLs. You did mention that you expect NPLs to go down, they're at 4.1% now. Do you have a specific number that you think they can reach by year-end 2013? That's my first question. And then the second question is, if you can provide us a little bit more color on exactly what you're doing on the cost side? I do understand that you have new IT system that is going to allow you to operate with better cost but what does that mean? I mean, does the IT system allow you to fire people? I mean how does it provide better cost? If I look at your expenses at your employees, your employee base is basically the same since the start of the last year I think, it's probably down 1%. Some of your peers here, actually your main competitor on the private side is their expenses are down; their employees are down around 10%. So how do you really modify your cost structure, which is obviously what you need to do as you're moving into a lower rate environment and margins are going to come under significant pressure, without really changing your employee base? So if you can just give us a little bit more color on how you're going to get to that efficiency levels? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jorge for your questions. About the increased ratio, we finished the year with 4.1%. We expect that we'll continue to have a decrease with a delinquency ratio during 2013. On our guidance, specific guidance is over and to the end of the year, we'll have at the lower level in the delinquency ratio. Looking what we have during 2011, the best moment that we have you was the delinquency ratio was around 3.6, 3.7. Could <mark type="ph" /> be too (57:30) that until the end of the year we were reaching some on our levels similar of that, but we don't have a specific guidance for the total delinquency. We understand that the decrease will be in a &#x2013; not to be <mark type="ph" /> fair to be in a more so (57:51) movement but it well be continued until the end of the year. We understand that we'll have the best moments with a more lower level in the delinquency ratio.</p>
          <p>About the cost sizing, we had many fronts inside our company. One of that is the Efficiency Committee that is we have our Group of Directors between Vice President and Directors that is, we discuss for reduce costs in our line in third-party services, communication, data processing, transport then we are revising different process inside the bank. This committee we have for all the three years, then we have main process that will help us to get some benefit in the next few periods. Then we have some actions that or have started and we accept to collect the benefits &#x2013; during this year and during the next year. It's our process that we have internally that we discussed at our process and we, our department inside to make are involvement in this process. And another front is about our investments in IT that is we are now in the last phase of our IT utilization plan and we are now rewriting our systems and we expect to collect some benefits. And this year probably we will finish it to rewrite the system and during 2014 we will finish the best. Then probably some systems that we have now will help us to reduce the cost. Some examples that we have: these are some systems that start to work in the banks that the employees will, the cashier will need less time for attend the clients.</p>
          <p>Probably we will have how to improve the number of clients that we attend in the branch. And the cashier will now have how to offer some products. The time that will reduce in this process will be around 25%. The costs that will have &#x2013; the maintenance of the systems will reduce in around 10% considering the new structure that we will have in the system. These are some examples that we have, that will intend that it will help us to reduce the costs. Another thing is that we are working for to offer more channels for our clients' use and not used only the branches. We offer the Internet and the mobile phone and we have the Bradesco Expresso's structure and these structures help us to reduce the cost with the transactions. And the &#x2013; we are having an increasing in the number of transactions that our clients are using in these alternative channels. These actions that we are doing, we understand that you will help us to reaching the targets that are in the guidance that we gave for 2013 about the operating expense. But the end of the line is a process that we look for addition this is a continued process and that we are doing main investments in technology part, help us to reduce the operational costs.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. My first question is related to expense, actually I like a lot the administrative and personnel expenses, but our bottom line, the bottom line came slightly lower estimates because of other operating expenses that came higher than our estimates. But we read that the bank improved the methodology for amortization of prepaid expenses. If you could give more color what was this change and how much this change impacted the other operating expense in the fourth quarter? I mean had you not changed this methodology, how much less expense you would have in the quarter? And if you could provide a guidance for this line even if not official for 2013, I mean is it going to be more correlated with NII growth or with inflation or could expect even lower figure considering that you have already made some impairments of intangible assets which I understand that the amortization of these intangible assets go through these other operating expense line? And then I have a second question. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This modification that we did in the &#x2013; amortization in the process is an accounting &#x2013; is an improvement in our accounting process, is &#x2013; but the fact is &#x2013; the fact that we did it &#x2013; we consider a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:04:15) that is not reflecting in the &#x2013; because the modification that we did is not reflecting the results that we have in the last quarter. But it's a small number and the fact that we expect for 2013 and in the next year is not significant, it's a small effect. It's only an improvement in the accounting for it that we did.</p>

          <p>Okay fantastic and my second question is related to Basel III. So we saw in newspaper articles commenting on possible measures that the government could take to reduce the impact of Basel III implementation in Brazil. I would like to know if you support these measures and when do you expect to see them implemented? And I mean do you believe I'm mentioning related to that sort of a government warranty for deferred tax assets. Do you think this will be related to all deferred tax assets from timing business or only the ones related to loan loss provisions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Regina. We don't have the final. We have some discussions, but considered the rules that we know that according to the, that our Central Bank published we have how to implement Basel III until 2018. Without this, we will have to do the implementation, but if we have now some modification that we will and one part of the tax part will be upset because it our government gives the guarantee we will reduce the effects of the Basel III implementation it will be favorable for the banks, but we don't have the final guidance or the final rules, what the discussion that we have is about is the portion related to the provisions for loan loss spreads that is the tax statute that relates to this part of the provisions could have a guarantee and after will be to divested for the future in the Basel III calculation. Then, but we don't have the final rule, we don't know how to do the implementation, but considering the worst scenario, we will have how to do the implementation, if we will have some improvement in the rules will be better, but we don't have the final order or the final rules.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. Yes, couple of questions here, just follow up if you'll allow me on the margin side. I am just looking here at the loan margin and the growth of that loan margin, so if you look at the 4Q interest income from loans and look at the annualized rate, that only grew at 5.1% and you look at the average loan balance that grew at 9.5%. Now is it not clear that there's going to be a lot of margin pressure coming through in 2013 on the one hand from the fact that you've got the impact of the SELIC and the loans re pricing with the delay and we're just beginning to see that in Q4 and also the fact that you still have a lot of competition coming through from the public banks and in particular from Banco do Brasil in areas like credit cards and overdrafts and also increasingly in the SME space. So I'm just trying to square the circle and I just, my sense is that that 7% to 11% plus Saul's earlier comment on the securities portfolio gives me some impression that that 7% to 11% loan growth, sorry net interest income growth with the loan growth that you have seen quite aggressive. I know you talked about this ad nauseam on this call, but it's for me it's the gorilla in the room and it won't go away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Victor, about the margin, the guidance that we gave you, you'll find that is related to credit to loans. We understand that is from 2013 the portion that where we expect to grow more is in individuals and SMEs and these kind of operations has better margins or better spreads. We understand that will improve the mix of the portfolio in improving these operations and we expect to have a better growth in these lines if you compare with 2012. But we have other lines where we expect to have a positive growth that is in the insurance margins we expect to have a better growth compared with 2012. We understand that we will have to reaching this margin, this net margin guidance that we gave. Considering that our strategy for 2013 and the portfolio that we have in our, that we have now, that we finish 2012, we understand that will be possible to reach in this level because with this guidance considering our structure that we have now and the our strategy for 2013.</p>

          <p>Okay, okay. Just one quick follow-up, renegotiated credits, they had been pretty stable at around 3.5% of the portfolio for the first three quarters of this year, picked up a bit to 3.6%. Is there anything we should worry about there or not really?</p>

          <p>The growth that we are having this renegotiated portfolio is stable. We don't &#x2013; these are similar behavior that we have for the total loan portfolio. Then, probably during this year, 2013, probably the growth will be similar that we're having in the total portfolio. We don't expect to &#x2013; that we will have something different. We have it here one slide in the together in the presentation that number is 36.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>For the renegotiated portfolio, we have the delinquency ratio stable around the 28%, max 30%. Is there what we expect that will continue happening during 2013, then we don't expect our modification &#x2013; any significant <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:44) modification for this portfolio during 2013. Probably the delinquency ratio will maintain stable in this level and probably the growth that we will have in this portfolio will be similar that we will have in the loan portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. I had a question regarding the growth in the capital gains that you showed in the quarter, was around R$1.9 billion after tax in your available for sale portfolio. Could you give us some color regarding whether this was driven by fixed income or by equity portfolios? I mean, was this in the bank portfolio or in the insurance portfolio? And where will you be next year given that rates are going to be flat? This is going to be something that might not perform as well. Was there any reclassification of securities from portfolios that means something occurred in the recent past on this front that you might help us?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The question was if you could provide some color for the R$1.9 billion after-tax improvement in unrealized capital gains in your available for sale portfolio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the question was a little bit to see whether it comes from the banking portfolio or whether it was in the insurance portfolio, was it related to fixed income or have you increased your exposures <mark type="ph" /> drivers (1:15:22) in the fourth quarter and that was pretty good for equities? A little bit of color just to help us understand this movement; it was pretty large.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You have this slide in page 9 where we have these unrealized gains, the R$12.9 billion that we have is in the securities. The majority is classified in available for sale and it's related to our insurance portfolio. And if you &#x2013; in our equity, we have reserved around R$5 billion, R$6 billion, that is related to this security. Then probably this revenue, this potential revenues will be registered in the future according the accrual, the maturity of the operation or the security. Then we are having, growing this portfolio because the evaluation according the market volume that we're having in the last few quarters, and our average balance for every quarter we do the evaluation according to the market value and the fact that we have been registered in the available for sale with increasing our equity, or we registering the equity. Then for the future, probably these revenues, these potential revenues will be registered in our <mark type="ph" /> proxy (1:17:23) according the maturity of these bonds or these securities. Some of these bonds have 10 years or 20 years because it is related as a guarantee that we have <mark type="ph" /> for distributions (1:17:40) in our insurance business.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, excellent. And the other question was regarding Basel III and this news that came out a couple of weeks ago. It would appear that the guarantee for deferred tax assets would be activated once the bank becomes insolvent. So do you have an indication? It would appear that this improvement in the capital ratio should classify as Tier 2 capital and not as Tier 1 given that the guarantee is not activated as a going concern but once the bank is insolvent, so the shareholders aren't going to see anything. So do you have an indication from the Central Bank whether this is going to be Tier 1 or Tier 2? Basically we'd like to see if this reform follows the spirit or Basel III or if it's going to be a little bit different in Brazil than elsewhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It is a discussion that we are having about to do some adjustments in the Basel III calculation and about the tax credit. Considering the rules that we have now, we need to <mark type="ph" /> diversify (1:18:46) the tax credit from the Tier 1 capital. If we have some modification in these calculations where one part of this tax credit will be acceptable not to be considered in the discount, the fact it will be in the Tier 1 capital. In our case <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:19:11), the portion related to provisions for credit is around 50% of our total tax credit, then the number that we have here is something around R$12 billion or R$13 billion is the number that we have. But we don't have the final rules or we don't have the how did the calculation or how &#x2013; what will be considering in this rule if you &#x2013; we have this modification. But...</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Maclovio Pina with Morningstar Equity Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. And thank you for taking my call. I have actually two questions. And the number one is, I know you don't give specific numbers for credit quality in any of your particular business lines, but can you comment just on the improvement on NPLs for corporate and SMEs both in 90 plus days and early delinquencies? Is there any particular industry that's showing more strength that's driving the improvement or is it just broad based?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The improvement in the first we &#x2013; the quality for corporate and the SMEs, we had a declining delinquency ratio in the 90 days space. And for the in the short-term space and the delinquency ratio that 61 and 90 days, we had a decrease in the same way. We expect that the delinquency ratio, the total delinquency ratio will continue declining. We don't have a specific sector of the economy where we had a better performance. But in the total portfolio, in the corporate side, we are having a decline. For individuals, we &#x2013; the last quarter was more stable, the delinquency ratio, but during 2013 we expect that we'll have a decline in &#x2013; for individuals too. Then in the total portfolio, we expect that during 2013 we will have a decline in the delinquency ratio. We don't have the specific sectors or operations that where we understand that we are having a decline specific. In the total portfolio, we are having an improvement in the quality of the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with regards to individual mortgages, do you expect that the rate that they're outgrowing the rest of the individual portfolio will continue into 2013 and '14? And can you just give us a sense of do you have any comment on the credit quality of these new mortgages that are coming online? And if you have any visibility and especially how are you thinking about provisioning for these mortgages and in terms of coverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect to continue growing in the large portfolio in the individuals and in the corporate side as our one important product. The delinquency ratio for this product is very, very small in our first portfolio. Then &#x2013; and there is then an important product where you have a long-term relation with the client and you can offer other products during this, the period of the transaction. Then again, we expect to continue to grow in this specific product. The benefits ratio is very small and the products that we have in our portfolio is very good and we expect to continue to grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and so it's just to recap, it's fair to say that you do expect it to keep outpacing the broad loan expansion at the rate it's been doing so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for this product we expect to continue having the growth similar we have &#x2013; we are having the <mark type="ph" /> less SKUs (1:24:15). These are important products, and in Brazil we have &#x2013; we expect that the mortgage will be, will continue growing very fast for the next year and for others are important products for the future.</p>
