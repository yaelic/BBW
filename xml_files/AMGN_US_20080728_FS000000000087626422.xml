          <p>My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Second Quarter 2008 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dennis, and good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter results conference call. A lot happened during the second quarter, but perhaps the most notable event being the availability of important new data on denosumab.</p>
          <p>Our Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer, will lead off the discussion today with both a strategic and operational review of our business. Our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Bradway, will then provide some additional details on our performance in the second quarter, with a particular focus on how the trends observed through the first half translate into expectations for the rest of the year. George Morrow, our Head of Commercial Operations, will then discuss our product performance in the US and international markets, both in the context of the second quarter and expectations for the remainder of the year. Roger Perlmutter, who as you know is our Head of Research and Development, will then provide a description of the recently disclosed data on denosumab together with a brief review of our emerging products pipeline.</p>
          <p>We will be using slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I would like to remind you that through the course of our presentation today, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. And of course, actual results can vary materially.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Arvind, good afternoon. We have much to report and discuss with you today with undoubtedly and understandably a major focus on our denosumab program. I will comment today on the dmab program after our report and before your questions but not now.</p>
          <p>I would first like to thank all Amgen staff for their hard work, creativity, and dedication in dealing with a very significant set of challenges these past 15 months. We are not totally through this phase, but the worst is clearly behind us and the future looks very bright.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out a number of things I see as particularly significant. First, our overall financial performance is stronger than we expected, and our new revenue and earnings guidance range suggests a strong possibility we will actually grow this year compared to 2007, a remarkable accomplishment in the face of the ESA situation, and one neither we nor observers would have deemed possible a year ago.</p>
          <p>Second, we are in discussions with the FDA regarding a new label for Aranesp and the outcome will almost certainly be within our expectation range and is taken into consideration in our new 2008 guidance. We expect to enter 2009 at a new steady-state ESA level that while lower than current levels, we can handle, and leaves Amgen positioned for good future overall top line growth.</p>
          <p>Three, our non-ESA top line growth is notable, particularly our very strong performance in Europe in the increasingly competitive biosimilars market.</p>
          <p>Fourth, the peg-EPO patent victory, settling the J&amp;J lawsuit, and recent ESRD legislation largely remove a number of major overhangs and makes the future clear.</p>
          <p>Fifth, we can effectively manage cost while still investing aggressively for the future, and believe we have more cost management opportunity over coming years as we continue to seek improvement across the board, particularly in our manufacturing network.</p>
          <p>Finally, our pipeline continues to advance and grow. We will have invested about $17 billion in research and development over the past eight years, with 11 billion in the past four alone. As our Nplate and denosumab programs both illustrate, bringing a product through Phase 3 trials from inception can take as long as 15 years. In fact, 10 years would be very, very short for this work, so I am very pleased with our R&amp;D progress in developing a large pipeline, bringing multiple medicines through Phase 3, and growing the top line by over $11 billion or almost a factor of four in six years. This gives me confidence in the future.</p>
          <p>I would like to now turn the call over to my colleagues to discuss the quarterly results, and I'll be back just before question time with some thoughts on the denosumab and Nplate programs. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Kevin. If I can direct your attention to page 5, I'll walk you through the adjusted income statement for the quarter. As you can see, revenues in the second quarter increased 1% from $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. And I'd highlight in terms of product sales that while our anemia franchise was down 8% during the quarter, the rest of our products increased by 11% during the same period.</p>
          <p>Wholesaler inventories of our major products ended at or below the low end of the normal ranges with the exception of ENBREL, which ended in the middle of our expected range. George will have more detail for you in a moment on our products.</p>
          <p>If we look at geographic sales, in the US, sales totaled $2.8 billion for the quarter, which represents a decrease of 1% versus last year. Internationally, our sales were $849 million in the quarter, which represents an increase of 17% versus last year. These sales were positively impacted by $93 million from foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding those foreign exchange fluctuations, international product sales increased 4% during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to operating expenses, which are presented on an as-adjusted basis, let me start with cost of sales. Cost of sales for the quarter decreased by 6%. This decrease was primarily driven by lower cost ENBREL and lower inventory reserves. If I start with inventory reserves, just recall for a moment that in the second quarter last year, we had an increase in inventory reserves, due to expiry risk associated with declining demand and excess inventory for certain of our products. By comparison, our reserves were lower this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now as regards the cost of ENBREL in the quarter, let me just also point out that ENBREL is manufactured at three different sites, and each has a slightly different efficiency and cost structure. So there is fluctuation in the cost of ENBREL, depending on the mix of supply from each site. This quarter benefits from a very favorable mix. The result is that ENBREL has an improved gross margin, and this has an impact on the Wyeth profit share, which I'll discuss in a moment.</p>
          <p>Turning to research and development, R&amp;D expenses were relatively unchanged year over year, primarily due to the benefits derived from our out-licensing deals in Japan with Daiichi Sankyo and Takeda, as well as lower aggregate clinical trial costs and lower staff related costs resulting from the 2007 restructuring program. This favorability was offset by the $100 million upfront payment associated with our licensing agreement with Kyowa Hakko, a collaboration which we referred to in our last conference call.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expenses increased 6% over last year. Excluding the Wyeth profit share, SG&amp;A expenses increased 4% year over year. I'll give you a bit more detail on the next slide. Total operating expenses increased 1% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to our tax rate, you can see our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.2%, which is an increase from the 19.5% that we had in the prior year. The increase from Q2 '07 to Q2 '08 is primarily driven by the expiration of the federal R&amp;D credit in 2008 and the impact of the favorable tax settlement that we benefited from in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.14, up 2% over last year. Second quarter 2008 adjusted earnings per share including stock option expenses were $1.13 a share, which is an increase of 4% compared to the $1.09 that we reported in second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 6, as I mentioned earlier, SG&amp;A expenses were up 6% year over year. Wyeth profit share is the largest portion of the year-over-year increase and is up substantially as a direct result of the additional ENBREL sales and the lower cost of those sales in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me say a few words about the Wyeth profit share. The calculation of our profit share is based primarily on ENBREL gross margin, and to a much lesser extent the settlement of other partnership obligations. So while ENBREL sales were up 2% year over year, Wyeth profit share expenses increased 13% to $283 million in the second quarter of 2008 versus $250 million in the second quarter of 2007. This difference is due to the improvement in ENBREL gross margin, driven by lower ENBREL cost of sales. Wyeth profit share expenses for the first half of the year 2008 were $589 million.</p>
          <p>Now as I said earlier, SG&amp;A expense excluding the Wyeth profit share was up 4% year over year. We're seeing some year-over-year increase as planned in our IS costs, costs as a result of higher depreciation and other expenses related to placing our Enterprise-wide Resource System or ERP program into service this quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to sales, marketing and corporate expenses, as you can see our sales and marketing expenses were up slightly year over year. And to round out the SG&amp;A picture, our corporate functions are showing a slight cost decrease in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 7, I'll give you some highlights from our balance sheet and cash flows. Cash in the second quarter of 2008 &#x2013; global cash balance was $8.5 billion as you can see. Debt at the end of the second quarter was $11.2 billion, essentially flat with where we were this time last year.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at our cash flow, you'll note that we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, which is up year over year to $1.6 million. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $165 million and were lower year over year, primarily due to cancelled or postponed projects related to our 2007 restructuring. As you may recall, in August last year we told you that we would lower our CapEx in response to our restructuring efforts; and in turn, we would be increasing cash flow and you can see some of that improvement here. Our free cash flow in the quarter is up $500 million versus last year to $1.5 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of share repurchases, we repurchased 33 million shares during the second quarter of 2008 for a total cost of $1.5 billion. We currently have $4.9 billion remaining under our Board-authorized stock buyback program.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 8, we have raised both revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2008. With respect to revenue, we now expect 2008 revenue to be in the range of 14.6 to $14.9 billion, up from the previously reported range of 14.2 to $14.6 billion. Similarly, earnings per share, we have raised our earnings per share expectations. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.45 excluding stock option and certain other expenses, and that's up from the prior range of $4.00 to $4.30. This increase is based on our sales momentum as well as lower operating expenses due to continued efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Finally if you turn to page 9, let me just highlight two aspects of our P&amp;L which has changed since we last provided you guidance, in particular cost of sales. We're now expecting cost of sales to decrease slightly as a percentage of sales versus where we were in 2007. And also let me touch on SG&amp;A. Excluding the Wyeth profit share, we now expect our SG&amp;A expense excluding Wyeth to be slightly higher versus 2007. Those are the highlights from the changes to our key assumptions.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to George, who will walk us through the product highlights.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay; thanks, Bob. Let's go right to the commercial highlights shown on slide 11. Product sales increased 2% year over year, with the US declining 1% and international growing 17%. Netting out foreign exchange gains, global sales were flat and international grew 4%. The US Aranesp decline of 26% was largely offset by gains from the rest of US portfolio, which grew 5% year over year. Internationally, our Europe segment continues to compete exceptionally well against biosimilar competition, growing their business even excluding the effects of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>The next slide graphically illustrates the components of year-over-year growth in the second quarter. As you can see, US Aranesp was the only major component of our product portfolio to decline and was offset by good growth in several products.</p>
          <p>Next, I'll discuss each of these product results in more detail, starting with Aranesp. Worldwide Aranesp sales declined 13% in the second quarter versus last year. In the US, Aranesp sales declined 26% overall, driven by a 29% decline of the ESA oncology segment. Overall, Aranesp segment share has been relatively stable for the past year.</p>
          <p>Internationally, Aranesp sales grew 7% overall, with a 5% decline excluding foreign exchange gains. While the oncology and nephrology segments have both declined primarily due to pricing pressures, oncology segment share remains flat versus last year and nephrology share grew slightly, reflecting the fact that biosimilars and peg-EPO had little impact on patient share.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I'll update you on the trend in utilization of Aranesp in the US market. This slide displays actual weekly US Aranesp sales going back to fourth quarter 2006. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs are largely a result of inventory buildups and depletions, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. The red trend lines show average weekly sales for the past three quarters. They exclude returns and Medicaid discount accrual true-ups as well as the effect of inventory fluctuations, which serve to distort the quarter comparisons shown on the previous slide.</p>
          <p>So as shown with the red trend lines, we have maintained roughly the same sales run rate for the last three quarters. The new risk/benefit information on ESA appears to have been incorporated into clinical practice patterns, resulting in fairly stable weekly sales.</p>
          <p>Next slide, EPOGEN was flat in the second quarter of 2008 versus the second quarter of 2007, driven by a modest downward dose decline versus the prior year, and that's due to label and EMP changes, offset by annual patient growth. Quarter on quarter, EPOGEN sales growth was driven by a modest dose rebound, driven by physician efforts to achieve and maintain hemoglobin between 10 and 12 as expected, a small favorable quarter-on-quarter change in inventories, and favorable dialysis spillover adjustments in quarter two compared to unfavorable adjustments in quarter one. We expect nephrologists to continue to refine their treatment practices in order to maintain patients in the hemoglobin range of 10 to 12.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN combined grew 15% second quarter '08 versus second quarter '07. In the US, sales increased by 12% driven by demand, primarily price, and to a lesser extent units. Internationally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew 24% year on year, 10% excluding foreign exchange effects. In the US, year-over-year second quarter unit growth for Neulasta was 5%, some of which we believe is attributable to customers buying in at the end of the quarter ahead of a price increase.</p>
          <p>Our new promotional platform, rolled out in February, continues to be well received in the marketplace. This platform focuses on the consequences of febrile neutropenia, which impacts patient care and optimal chemotherapy delivery.</p>
          <p>In the international setting, Neulasta continued solid growth. This was reflected by a second quarter Neulasta share of 55% in Europe, up 4 percentage points year over year, as well as a conversion from NEUPOGEN of 68%, up 5 percentage points year over year. I'll talk about the outlook regarding potential new biosimilar entrants in a moment in the international section.</p>
          <p>ENBREL is next on Slide 17. In the second quarter of 2008, we experienced growth of 2% versus the second quarter of 2007.  4% was due to continued demand growth, which was partially offset by a 2% unfavorable change in wholesaler inventory levels. You'll recall ENBREL grew 30% last quarter as compared to 2% this quarter. Roughly 20 of the 28% decline is due to the wholesaler inventory load in the first quarter and subsequent pullback in the second quarter. The remainder of the decline is due to share impact from new competition as well as the timing of price increases.</p>
          <p>On the rheumatology side, ENBREL maintains its position as the biologic of choice for rheumatologists and continues to lead the class in segment share. In addition, the publication of data from the COMET trial was recently announced, which demonstrated that half of the patients treated with the combination of ENBREL and methotrexate achieved clinical remission, and nearly all had no progression of joint damage. These findings were published online on July 15 by The Lancet.</p>
          <p>In the dermatology segment, ENBREL continues to get the majority of first-line biological use for psoriasis and maintains a strong position in the segment, holding approximately 70% dollar share during the quarter. Finally, in July the FDA Advisory Committee recommended to approve ENBREL for the treatment of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents. If approved by the FDA, this expanded indication for ENBREL would address the unmet medical need in this small, underserved pediatric psoriasis patient population.</p>
          <p>On to Sensipar and slide 18, for the second quarter, worldwide Sensipar sales grew 39% versus the second quarter of 2007. Demand continues to be the key growth driver in the US with the field organization delivering a solid 34% year-over-year sales performance, and the first 100 million quarter of sales. International sales grew 50%, and that's 34% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Additional primary hyperparathyroidism marketing authorization was granted in the EU on June 24.</p>
          <p>Turning to Vectibix on slide 19, as you may recall from the last quarter, I mentioned that the potential of the KRAS biomarker data to redefine the risk/benefit profile of the class by identifying metastatic colorectal cancer patients who are more or less likely to respond to treatment. Additional confirmatory KRAS biomarker data was released at ASCO in June.</p>
          <p>Also at ASCO, negative results from Erbitux's CAIRO2 study confirmed the earlier findings from our PACCE study which were disclosed in June 2007, and that is that dual biologics plus chemo do not add benefit, incremental benefit, beyond the current standard of care. Future growth is highly dependent upon label expansion into second and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer incorporating our new information on KRAS.</p>
          <p>Internationally, Vectibix has launched in 10 countries with solid initial uptake, and Roger will have more to say on KRAS and CAIRO in a few moments.</p>
          <p>Next slide, internationally, while Aranesp was down 5% overall excluding foreign exchange, growth across the rest of the portfolio contributed to a record quarter from our international team. This performance reflects steady segment share for Aranesp and increased share for Neulasta. The next slide looks specifically at new competition in Europe in these segments.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this slide, most ESA competitors in biosimilars have launched in Europe in some major countries, and the other country launches are in the horizon throughout the remainder of 2008. For G-CSF biosimilars, the first launches are expected in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>I'll finish up with a look at the international segment share for Aranesp in nephrology on the last slide. As you can see, biosimilars to date have taken share from EPO Alpha and EPO Beta but not Aranesp. It appears that physicians recognize the value of our second generation product Aranesp and that we have actually expanded Aranesp share in nephrology while the share in oncology has held steady.</p>
          <p>Although there has been some pricing erosion, roughly 10 to 15% in nephrology and about 5% in oncology, we have maintained a price premium on the order of 15 to 30% to the first generation EPOs. In May, peg-EPO had a 2% segment share across Europe, mainly coming from Germany, and overall Roche lost two share points since the Mircera launch. Our view is that customers are willing to pay a premium for Aranesp due to the combination of dosing efficiency and flexibility.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, George. Slide 24 provides an overview of the topics that I will cover this afternoon. First, we are in the midst of productive discussions with the FDA with respect to ESA labeling. We and the agency share the goal of ensuring that ESAs are used appropriately, and wish to make certain that both physicians and patients are well informed about the risks and benefits of ESA therapy, especially in the chemotherapy induced anemia setting. Along these lines, in Europe we expect that the EMEA will ratify new labeling language for the ESA class by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>We have also interacted productively with the FDA with respect to the use of ENBREL in the setting of moderate to severe psoriasis in pediatric patients. The agency has requested additional information about our risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, so-called REMS, for ENBREL in pediatric psoriasis, which we expect to be able to provide to them in the very near future. As has been discussed in many trade publications, the establishment of such REMS programs is becoming increasingly important in our interactions with the FDA.</p>
          <p>Along the same lines, we're continuing to work with the FDA to assist in the completion of the review of romiplostim or Nplate for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Here too the assessment of our risk evaluation and mitigation strategy had been a special focus of our interactions with the agency, and I am optimistic that we have reached good alignment.</p>
          <p>From the development perspective, we've made substantial strides in our therapeutic oncology program, many of which we reviewed at the American Society for Clinical Oncology [ASCO] meeting in June.  At that meeting, the importance of the KRAS biomarker as a means of identifying patients who could benefit from Vectibix treatment was again highlighted.</p>
          <p>Also in June, we presented data from our Phase 2 STEPP study in which we evaluated for the first time the use of preemptive treatments to mitigate the skin toxicity associated with potent blockers of EGF receptor signaling. In this study, preemptive treatments with a combination of skin moisturizers, sunscreen, topical steroids, and oral doxycycline reduced the incidence of grade 2 or greater skin toxicity by more than 50%. We are adjusting our therapeutic programs to make better use of this pre-treatment regimen going forward.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we also completed several important studies in the denosumab program as shown on slide 25. As you know, we have pursued a broad set of clinical trials designed to demonstrate the efficacy of denosumab in blocking bone resorption in different clinical settings. Slide 25 shows that we have completed enrollment of virtually all of our first wave of pivotal studies for denosumab save for the enrollment of our study designed to explore the effect of denosumab on skeletal pathology in patients with prostate cancer that has metastasized to bone. A related study designed to test whether denosumab can prevent the appearance of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer who are at high risk for such events completed enrollment during the second quarter and hence is boxed in red on slide 25.</p>
          <p>During the past two weeks, we announced the results of two pivotal studies designed to test whether denosumab reduces the risk of fracture in patients made more susceptible as a result of excess bone resorption. Slide 26 highlights the results of our pivotal Phase 3 study in women with post-menopausal osteoporosis. The study was a large international trial that compared the efficacy and safety of denosumab administered subcutaneously once every six months with that observed using placebo injections. In all, nearly 8,000 women participated in this study.  As noted on the slide, denosumab treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures as compared with placebo treatment. Moreover, non-vertebral fractures and more specifically hip fractures were also reduced in frequency, and these reductions were statistically significant.</p>
          <p>This study was so large and occupied fully three years of treatment, we had had the opportunity to review a really comprehensive safety data set. It was extremely gratifying to see that adverse events in general and serious adverse events in particular were well balanced between the denosumab and placebo groups.</p>
          <p>Since our announcement of these results last Friday, I have received many questions regarding the relative efficacy of denosumab as compared to existing antiresorptive agents, especially the bisphosphenates. To provide a context for this discussion, let me be clear that it is inappropriate to compare results across studies. I will cite here the conclusion from Catherine MacLean's systematic review that was published recently in the Annals of Internal Medicine. She said, "Although good evidence suggests that many agents are effective in preventing osteoporotic fractures, the data are insufficient to determine the relative efficacy or safety of these agents."</p>
          <p>Clearly, without head-to-head study, it is impossible to compare denosumab with other treatments, which themselves cannot be compared with one another. This said, we have previously reported the results of a head-to-head study of twice yearly denosumab treatment as compared with weekly treatment with alendronate at the labeled dose. Here we show that denosumab was superior to alendronate with respect to its ability to increase bone marrow density. Indeed, denosumab is the most potent antiresorptive agent that has ever been introduced into clinical practice.</p>
          <p>What was unclear previously was whether these increases in bone mineral density, which are associated with improved bone strength in preclinical studies, would translate into reductions in osteoporotic fractures in people. We now know the answer.</p>
          <p>I have to say that I am extremely excited about the results of this study, which frankly exceeded my expectations. The complete data set will be presented in about six weeks at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, which will give a broad group of experienced bone experts the opportunity to place these results in an appropriate clinical and scientific context.</p>
          <p>During this month, we also announced the results of the 138 study in men undergoing androgen deprivation treatment for prostate cancer. You can think of this as a companion study for the post-menopausal osteoporosis study, in this case in men with hormone depletion. Here too, as noted on slide 27, denosumab therapy in addition to increasing bone mineral density was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral fractures.</p>
          <p>In every case, we have found that the effects of denosumab are rapid and sustained. For example, as noted on slide 27, a review of the long-term extension of our Phase 2 study demonstrated sustained increases in bone mineral density over a five-year treatment interval. And a pilot Phase 2 study shows that denosumab stimulates increases in cortical thickness of the radius and tibia as compared to either placebo or alendronate treatment.</p>
          <p>We do expect additional results from important clinical studies in 2008 as shown on slide 28, including our Phase 2 study of AMG 317, our antibody which blocks the activity of both interleukin-4 [IL-4] and interleukin-13 [IL-13] in the treatment of asthma.</p>
          <p>Looking forward still further, we will examine the efficacy of a number of new approaches to cancer therapy in 2009, including of course the ability of denosumab to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic bone disease. I look forward to updating this chart at our business meeting review later this year.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Roger. We just shared a detailed review of the quarter. Now let me comment on both Nplate and denosumab. While neither of these potential medicines are yet approved and one is not yet filed, I think it appropriate to pause and reflect. We have much hard work ahead to secure appropriate regulatory approvals. We well understand and embrace the regulatory review process we will and should face. But, I do want to give you a sense of the enthusiasm that we hold for both Nplate and denosumab, but especially denosumab and its innovative characteristics, and the new hope we believe it offers for patients.</p>
          <p>Our mission is to serve patients. And to do that, we focus on elucidating novel biology and using those insights to target disease mechanisms that will result in innovative medicines to dramatically improve the lives of patients with grievous illness and few or no good treatment alternatives. This is demanding, time consuming, risky, and expensive work. Nplate and denosumab, denosumab in both bone cancer and osteoporosis, have the potential to be approved and bring the promise of biotechnology to patients in real need.</p>
          <p>I'm enormously proud of the innovation, perseverance, appetite for risk, creativity, and just plain hard work that got us where way are today. There are many questions and challenges ahead for both of these potential medicines, but I am confident that we will make the right choices to benefit patients and shareholders in ways that will make staff proud.</p>

          <p>So congratulations on the quarter and the denosumab data. I've got a question just on Aranesp labeling. I'm just wondering if you've reached any agreement with FDA on what the definition of a curative patient would be in the oncology setting, and if with that definition you could maybe quantify what could be at risk with the upcoming label amendment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim, it's Roger. We're still engaged in discussions with the agency. We've had a lot of productive interactions, trying to better understand the appropriate patient population. So we'll have to wait and see what the actual final labeling language is with respect to that issue and other issues, but I think we're moving along pretty well.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so what we've said before is that approximately 20% of CIA [Chemotherapy-Induced Anemia] patients are treated with the ESAs are breast cancer patients. Approximately 60% of ESA patients have tumors classified as stage four metastatic, and approximately 40% of patients are defined as having stage one, two, three tumors, and within this group are patients receiving either neo-adjuvant or adjuvant. So some fraction of this would be curative.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Roger. Now that you've seen the data of 216 and also some of the other studies, how are you thinking about the probability of success for denosumab in the upcoming trials for skeletal related events?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May-Kin, we previously presented Phase 2 data in the skeletal related event setting in patients with breast cancer and also in patients with other metastatic disease, in which we have demonstrated that as compared with zoledronate, we see improvements in outcomes both with respect to shutting off the excessive bone turnover that's characteristic of patients who have metastatic disease in bone, and as well certainly the hint in the combined study more than that that denosumab is more effective at blocking these kinds of skeletal related events.</p>
          <p>So the fact that we now have data from our post-menopausal osteoporosis study, from our study in men with androgen deprivation, showing that that increase in bone mineral density is associated with a reduction in fracture propensity just makes me more confident than ever that we'll see an effect that is at least non-inferior to zoledronic acid in these studies of skeletal related events. Now keep in mind these are very large studies involving between 1,500 and 2,000 patients in every case and looking at a number of different tumor settings. It's going to be a really exciting data set. I'm really looking forward to seeing it. I'm pretty optimistic about what we're going to get.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. I'd just like to extend my congratulations to the management team, well done dmab. Roger, I was intrigued by your comments that you stated today and I think you were also quoted in the New York Times as saying that the dmab data "exceeded your expectations."  The last time I heard a company say that I think was Genentech's AVASTIN data. What were your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you go into a large study like this, Mark, you're certainly hopeful that you'll meet all your primarily and secondary endpoints. But you know of course that chance always plays a role, and particularly that's true when you speak about hip fractures in the post-menopausal osteoporosis population, as an example. You know that not every bisphosphonate has been able to demonstrate efficacy in hip fracture, and that even for alendronate, it was not a uniform demonstration there. So, there's always concern about that. I've often talked about it, and the fact that we saw statistically significant reductions across all primary and secondary endpoints was really very impressive.</p>
          <p>And I also say that when you look at the safety database, and again you have nearly 24,000 patient years of experience here, so it is far greater than anything else that we had to look at. The fact that the safety profile was so balanced as compared to placebo was extremely encouraging, just extremely encouraging.</p>

          <p>We get lots of questions about denosumab and osteoporosis. We certainly will assess our options here. This data certainly makes us more confident in our ability to launch ourselves, but it certainly doesn't preclude the necessary work we will do to see what our options are, and I'm confident that we'll make the right choice and surface the right options. But certainly in a directional sense, this, as Roger has said, is a very positive step for us.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi; thanks for taking my question. I just wanted maybe to follow Eric's question, maybe for both Kevin and George. Can you give us a sense if you were to launch the product yourself in the U.S. for PMO, how big of a sales force would you need? And conversely, if you decided to partner it, what would &#x2013; give us a little bit of sense as to what the &#x2013; I don't know if you can discuss some of the costs or how big of a sales force you would need under a partnering arrangement.

          <p>I know these are important questions and they bear on the financial performance of the company, the amount of risk we take, and I'd rather not get into hypothetical speculation. I'm just going to say that our view is that we've got really strong data here. We're going to have to take this data, look at it carefully, see what physicians think, but I just want to assure our shareholders that we're going to make a full and complete analysis and surface the right set of options, and I'm confident we'll pick the right one. It's just premature right now to try to get into highly, highly speculative conversations. But certainly, we see this medicine with its high science component as being something that will take the kind of high science and medicine approach that we've historically taken. So we do not see this as a &#x2013; if you will, normal general practitioner sales product that you just throw in the bag.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Let me add my congratulations. I wanted to follow up on a comment Kevin made about managing cost going &#x2013; the ability to continue to manage costs and on a comment you made last quarter about Amgen striving to maintain R&amp;D spending at industry leading levels. Some would argue that R&amp;D spending shouldn't be a goal and perhaps there's a law  of diminishing return. Can you talk about whether when you talk about managing costs, R&amp;D is going to be a part of that or is it just cost of goods and SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's a trade-off. We don't spend to a certain percent of R&amp;D independent of anything else. It just turns out that when we look at our opportunity set and our pipeline, we see many opportunities to invest, and that's a good sign. The other thing that clearly is going to put pressure on the R&amp;D line is the new environment post-approval for safety monitoring, post-approval trial that's certainly going to increase the expense in the R&amp;D line absolutely. R&amp;D is the most judgmental of all of the cost lines, but I just think there's no substitute for putting significant investment against good biology. We could all debate whether one number or a couple of percent less is the right number, but we have to balance R&amp;D with delivering good, strong earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>When I commented on expense opportunities, I meant across the board. There are certainly opportunities in R&amp;D to do things more efficiently so that the dollars we spend have a bigger impact. And I think in a normal company, you have to have a constant tension on costs. Our industry has not, compared to other industries, been particularly well known for that over time, and I think the experience we just had in this restructuring tells us that we can manage costs effectively here and I think we've got a ways to go. So that's a long winded answer but I think it's a complicated and important question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats again on stabilizing the business and of course the data. Question for you, Roger, just to clarify, did you say that in the 216 trial, you met all primary and secondary endpoints? And then to add to that, you referenced the Phase 2 head-to-head study versus alendronate. In that study, there were numerically more fractures in the denosumab arm than the alendronate arm, or obviously it didn't have anything like the power. So could you comment on if you were to make that same comparison across trials that you alluded to, whether your efficacy against the primary endpoint was better, equivalent to, or less than you would have seen with alendronate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, this is Roger. Again, I think it's inappropriate to try and make comparisons between one antiresorptive agent and another unless you do an adequately powered head-to-head study for fractures. And we've only done a study that looked at bone mineral density. And there, as you know, denosumab is much, much more effective at increasing bone mineral density. I don't think you learn much from looking at the individual handful of fractures in one arm versus another in that small one-year study, comparatively small one-year study that we did that was head-to-head on bone mineral density. And again, the 216 study, we met all primary and secondary endpoints and the results are statistically significant across all fracture endpoints, namely at vertebral, non-vertebral, and specifically at hip. So yes, we did meet all those endpoints, thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I also wanted to offer my congratulations on dmab and the results of the quarter. Question for you on dmab, with the patent challenge just launching on Reclast, how do you guys view the PMO opportunity after Friday but also potentially with two generics on the market when you launch the drug? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First thing, let me just address something asked earlier about our ability to launch commercially. One of the things that I'm really proud of is the Commercial team we've assembled. Most of the people on the senior team have at least a decade, if not more, of pharma experience where they've been marketing to primary care physicians as well as six to eight years of biotech, and that's a pretty unique combination. So these people know how to do what we have to do. Whether or not we choose a partner, that will be considered in that context, but we have a very experienced team.</p>
          <p>So let me go to your question, Jeff. First, PMO is a large and underserved market. There are 60 million women globally who suffer progressive bone loss. There are about 20 million people &#x2013; women who are globally treated. So there are a lot of people who should be treated that are not being treated. One in two women over 50 will suffer a fracture in their lifetime, so a huge unmet need there.</p>
          <p>The following piece of data is from our market research, but I know a number of you have been doing some polling as well and you find pretty much the same thing, and that is 80% of physicians feel a need for a new therapy in this area, and you might ask why. I think there are a few reasons. First of all, more than 50% of osteo patients discontinue their oral bisphosphonates within a year. And obviously, if they're not taking their medicine, they're not getting helped. So doctors are looking for more control that will lead to better outcomes, certainly. PMO patients are asymptomatic before fracturing, so anything that affects them from a tolerability or safety standpoint is a problem in terms of compliance. So, docs want minimal safety and tolerability issues.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, 14% of fractures occur at the hip, 27% at the spine, and 60% at other largely cortical sites. So doctors want broad skeletal protection in the agents they're using. So I think three really good reasons, and I think when you look at the current opportunities and it consists of under treatment and some competitive weaknesses, and so I think that's a pretty ripe situation to go into.</p>
          <p>As far as dmab is concerned, it was designed to be both potent and precise in its mode of action. The clinical program was structured to provide physicians and payors high quality, relevant data upon which to make treatment and reimbursement decisions. So we look forward to sharing the results of those trials beginning at ASBMR [American Society of Bone and Mineral Research].</p>
          <p>We've also studied patients' response to the dmab profile in terms of preference and satisfaction and we'll share that with you at ASBMR as well, so you can make your own judgments about the uniqueness of this potential treatment. I do want to underscore that many physicians these days basically give the patients the option. They will describe the product and ask which one they would prefer, and we're feeling increasingly confident that that's going to bode well for denosumab.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just one question. Is this data in your opinion enough for denosumab to be used first line? And if not, what additional data do you think would be required?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Thomas (sic) [Ian], a lot of people talk about first line/second line as if it were binary; it's either going to be this or that. And the reality is I think this emerging profile, we have to see what happens with the FDA. Clearly, many doctors are going to view this as the best way to treat individual patients, and so it will be first line in that respect. A lot of patients by the way have failed bisphosphonates or can't comply. Those first line or second line &#x2013; I guess we would call them second line, but right now they're not being treated in the marketplace. So I think doctors treat individual patients based on the individual needs and I think my sense is that if this profile continues to emerge the way it has been that a lot of doctors will choose to use it first line. That's not to say that given that there's a cheap generic available, there are managed care organizations that won't try to position it in second line, but I seriously doubt that that will be universal.</p>

          <p>Shiv, thanks for the question. We love AMG 785. It's a completely novel mechanism. It opens the anabolic window, so it increases bone mass. It looks terrific, as you saw from that presentation. Still a long ways to go to understand exactly how best to use it, in what setting, get a lot of additional exposure, but so far so good and we're doing additional studies to better characterize its parameters and to see how to move forward with that agent. I guess I'd say the only program I see as a really competitive backup to denosumab is AMG 785. It just looks terrific.</p>

          <p>Thanks. There have been a lot of questions about the cross trial comparisons for dmab and PMO and I assume we shouldn't read too much into the body language. I just wanted to hear your thoughts about whether your research has shown that clinicians will assess the relative efficacy of the PMO agents when selecting which agent to use.</p>

          <p>Yes, absolutely. They'll look at the data. They'll look at the different patient population studies, then they'll make some judgments. I think they'll turn to the key opinion leaders, who will really study this data intensely, again beginning at ASBMR, and I think primary care physicians will be guided very much so by the key opinion leaders' points of view on these.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. I had a question on the revenue guidance and Kevin, your opening comments. Did I hear you correctly that Aranesp sales trend line would enter '09 at a run rate lower than current levels, meaning the guidance factors in lower Aranesp sales in the second half?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it does. As I said in my comments, we expect to have a new Aranesp label sometime this year and we'll exit this year at a lower rate with Aranesp in oncology and therefore overall than we have now. But yes, that is factored into our comments and our guidance.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking the question; George, just a question for you on ENBREL. I know that you've talked previously about the growth really coming from the derm market. It looks like the most recent quarter things held in pretty well. How do you think about 1275 once it comes to the market just in terms of would it be familiarity with ENBREL that would keep the drug hopefully as one of the preferred agents?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. I think the thing you need to recognize about dermatology is that they probably place safety over efficacy when selecting a product for a lot of reasons. And so I think 1275 has got a long way to prove itself from a safety perspective in comparison to ENBREL, which has been on the market for a long time. It's a known entity and we think has probably the best combination of safety and efficacy in the business.</p>
