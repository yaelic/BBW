        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everybody. Welcome to this presentation of our 2008 results. You're all very welcome. We've heard that there's been some disruption in the City, at one of the tube stations, so a number of people may be joining us late. So we will see.</p>
          <p>Anyway, I'm sure that all of you will have seen the open letter, which John Varley and I wrote, and sent out a couple of weeks ago. And in that letter, we've talked amongst other things, about the fact that we were changing the date of this presentation. So I'm very grateful to all of you for managing to accommodate the change in the schedule.</p>
          <p>Now this morning, we're going to have three presentations, two as usual are going to be by Chris Lucas and by John Varley, but the third is, the third presenter -- third presentation is new, and it's going to be by Robert Le Blanc, who is well-known to some, but not to all of you. Robert is our Group Risk Director and he's going to cover the field of risk management and our risk portfolios. And in doing so, he is going to draw on a number of the key disclosures that we have made in our results this morning.</p>
          <p>The consequence of all this is that, the running time for the presentations will be a little longer than usual. But there will be a plenty of time at the end for questions in the normal way. And of course as well as the three presenters, there will also be Bob Diamond and Frits Seegers available to answer questions too.</p>
          <p>Just to help you not to scribble down everything that we put, and say as it comes out, I should say that all of the presentations and the accompanying slides will be released in full, on our website as soon as John has finished his presentation.</p>
          <p>So with no more ado, can I please ask you as usual to switch-off your mobiles phones and your Blackberries. And let's get on with the first presentation, which is Chris.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you, Marcus. We've delivered profit before tax of just over &#xA3;6 billion in 2008; this includes gains from acquisitions of &#xA3;2.4 billion, profits from non-core disposals of &#xA3;0.6 billion, and gross credit market losses of &#xA3;8.1 billion, which were partially offset by gains on owned credit of &#xA3;1.7 billion. As you all know, 2008 was an extremely challenging year, but despite that, we've taken opportunities to progress our strategy.</p>
          <p>In Retail and Commercial Banking, we've continued to expand the business profitability. In Investment Banking, we've taken a significant step with the acquisition of Lehman Brothers in North America. And we've also raised over &#xA3;13.6 billion of new Tier-1 capital for the Group.</p>
          <p>Turning to Group performance in more detail, the income increased slightly despite absorbing significant credit market losses. Cost increased 9% to &#xA3;14.4 billion and impairment almost doubled. Our effective tax rate was 13% in 2008, this compares to 28% in '07 and the reduction results from offsetting the Lehman's acquisition gain, against Barclays' historical tax losses in the U.S. All this has generated earnings per share of 59 pence and a return on equity of 16.5%.</p>
          <p>I know you are all interested in the balance sheet and our capital position, and I'll talk about these later. But before I do that, I'm going to run through in performance by division, starting with Global Retail and Commercial Banking, where profits were up 6% to &#xA3;4.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Profits in UK Retail Banking were up 7% to &#xA3;1.4 billion. The income grew 4%, benefiting from a strong performance the mortgages and the current accounts. We've continued to be substantial providers in the mortgage market. Our balances increased 18% to just over &#xA3;82 billion, and our market share of net new lending was 36%.</p>
          <p>Our risk profile remained conservative. Even after market falls, the average loan to value of our total mortgage book, including buy-to-let was 40% in '08 compared to 34% in '07. On new lending, the average loan to value was 47%. This business was written at good spreads and the overall asset margin increased slightly.</p>
          <p>On the deposit side, balances increased 3% to &#xA3;90 billion and the liabilities margin declined slightly to just over 2%, showing the first impact as sharp reductions in base rates towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Cost in UK Retail Banking increased 2% as we reinvested efficiency gains back into the business. We've launched a range of new products during the year, both in current accounts and savings. And over the last three years, we've completed over 670 branch refurbishments, which is about 40% of the network.</p>
          <p>The cost income ratio improved one percentage point to 56% and impairment grew 8% to &#xA3;600 million, and mortgage impairment within that remained low at &#xA3;24 million. In Barclays Commercial Bank, profits declined 7% to just under &#xA3;1.3 billion. Income grew 7%, driven by increased sales of treasury products including foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives.</p>
          <p>Loans and advances grew 14% to over &#xA3;80 billion with strong growth in term loans. Customer accounts and deposit margins were broadly stable. Cost growth of 14% included lower gains on the sale of property, increased investments in payments infrastructure and growth in the operating lease business.</p>
          <p>Impairment charges increased 42% to &#xA3;414 million. The biggest single charge we took in Commercial Banking was &#xA3;40 million and we've benefited from our cautious stance on leveraged finance, property and construction lending. Robert Le Blanc will talk more about this later.</p>
          <p>At Barclaycard profits grew 31% to just under &#xA3;800 million, as a result of strong growth in international cards, and a &#xA3;40 million contribution from the acquisition of Goldfish. Barclaycard International profits grew by over 70% to &#xA3;260 million, which is about one-third of the total Barclaycard profits. The largest international business is Barclaycard US, where profits of $249 million were well above our acquisition plan for '08 of $150 million.</p>
          <p>Income increased 27%, broadly in line with the rate of cost growth both were driven by Barclaycard International and the first time contribution of Goldfish. A gain of &#xA3;80 million from the sale of shares in Visa and MasterCard also contributed to income growth. We wrote-off &#xA3;37 million in goodwill related to FirstPlus, which we closed to new business in August.</p>
          <p>Impairment charges increased 33% driven mainly by Barclaycard US, where we saw book growth and increasing delinquency rates. 68 million resulted from the inclusion of Goldfish, which was partially offset by lower impairment in the other UK businesses. This reduction is a result of actions we've taken to the book in recent years.</p>
          <p>Moving to Western Europe, profits grew 31% to &#xA3;260 million. This included &#xA3;82 million of gains from Visa or MasterCard and a &#xA3;52 million gain from the acquisition of an Italian mortgage business. We used these gains to continue to expand our European business. And costs increased 38%, and we added almost 350 new distribution points in France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal bringing the total number to 1,150.</p>
          <p>The pace of business growth has contributed to income growth of 53% with customer assets and liabilities are up more than 50% as a result of both customer inflows and changes in the sterling/euro exchange rates.</p>
          <p>There was a steep increase in impairment charges to &#xA3;300 million, most of which arose from a deteriorating credit conditions and rising delinquencies in Spain. This included &#xA3;82 million in the Spanish property sector and &#xA3;66 million in Spanish cards. The impairment charges increased from a low base. And we are now at about 55 basis points at a percentage of loans and advances.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets grew profits by 34% to &#xA3;134 million, this included &#xA3;82 million from Visa or MasterCard. Once again, we've used these &#x2013; the gains to expand the business. We've done this both in the existing markets including Africa, the UAE and India and in new markets with the acquisition of Expobank in Russia, Bank Akita in Indonesia and a banking license in Pakistan. The number of distribution points increased by almost 300 to 840.</p>
          <p>Income grew more than costs at 80%, driven by very strong growth in customer assets and liabilities. Impairment charges grew sharply to &#xA3;166 million as a result of the rapid pace of book growth, a maturing portfolio and increased delinquencies.</p>
          <p>Absa Group Limited announced profit growth of 8% in rand this morning, against a backdrop of weakening economic growth, rising interest rates, and a consumer downturn in South Africa. GRCB Absa, which excludes Absa Capital and Absa Cards, reported sterling profits of just over &#xA3;550 million, which is down 8% year-on-year, reflecting a 7% average devaluation of the rand. Income growth of 10%, which included &#xA3;47 million from the Visa IPO, was driven by higher assets and liability balances.</p>
          <p>Costs grew 3%, well below the rate of inflation in South Africa. We've increased the number of distribution points by 180 to about 1,200 and the cost income ratio improved four percentage points to 59%.</p>
          <p>There was a steep increase in impairment charges to almost &#xA3;350 million in a difficult environment for customers. This was largely the result of increased delinquencies in the mortgage book, the overall impairment charges as a percentage of loans and advances was just over 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Investment Banking and Investment Management, I'll start with Barclays Capital where we recorded a profit of &#xA3;1.3 billion, including a gain from the acquisition of Lehman Brothers of 2.3 billion, gains on owned credit of &#xA3;1.7 billion and gross credit market losses of &#xA3;8.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The acquisition gain was larger than we originally indicated, because IFRS requires us to recognize intangible assets, such as intellectual property and the value of the franchise. This amounted to &#xA3;900 million. And in addition, we've incurred integration and investment costs through the P&amp;L of about &#xA3;200 million. The integration was completed successfully in January, and we've &#x2013; and it has contributed to a very strong net income growth in the United States.</p>
          <p>Excluding credit market writedowns, total income of Barclays Capital increased 6%. We've continued to benefit from diversification, with good income contributions from interest rates, currency products, emerging markets, prime services and commodities.</p>
          <p>Costs fell a net 5%. Bear in mind that this includes &#xA3;200 million of acquisition cost, three months of Lehman's run rate cost, and the impact of sterling weakness. These were more than offset by reductions in performance-related pay, discretionary investment and the use of short-term contractors. Headcount increased by nearly 7,000 to just over 23,000 driven by the Lehman's acquisition.</p>
          <p>We've given substantial additional disclosure on our credit market exposures this morning, and as you'd expect, these numbers have been subject to scrutiny by independent auditors. We incurred gross credit market losses of &#xA3;8.1 billion, partly offset by gains on owned credits of &#xA3;1.7 billion and hedging of net attributable income of &#xA3;1.4 billion. Net credit market losses were &#xA3;5 billion.</p>
          <p>We've accounted for and valued our exposures consistently throughout the year. And these now include &#xA3;1.1 billion of securities acquired from Lehman's. Reported values reflect the substantial fall in sterling versus the dollar, as well as decreases in the fair value of assets wrapped by monolines. Net sales and pay-downs have reduced these balances by &#xA3;9.4 billion during the year. Where we sold assets, we've done so at prices consistent with our marks.</p>
          <p>At Barclays Global Investors, profits decreased 19% to &#xA3;595 million, as we provided &#xA3;260 million of support for selective liquidity products. Income declined 4% to 1.8 million -- sorry -- &#xA3;1.8 billion, as incentive and management fees were impacted by declining asset values. Reduced asset values also impacted assets under management, which went down to $1.5 trillion. Market forces were partially offset by net new asset inflows of $99 billion, largely in the iShares business.</p>
          <p>In Sterling, assets under management were stable as net new assets and exchange rates offset adverse market movements. Excluding support for liquidity funds, costs of BGI were down 11%. At Barclays Wealth, profits of &#xA3;670 million included a gain on the disposal of the closed life business of &#xA3;330 million. Excluding that gain, profits rose 12%. Income grew 3%, driven by a strong growth in customer deposits and lending, which were both up over 20%.</p>
          <p>Total client assets increased 10% to &#xA3;145 billion, reflecting net new asset inflows and the acquisition of Lehman's Private Investment Management business. The growth was partially offset by the impact of market movements and the sale of the closed life business.</p>
          <p>This slide gives a breakdown of costs, which grew 9%, or &#xA3;1.2 billion, during the year. The major movements can be broken down into three groups. Firstly, there are increases over &#xA3;500 million on '07, which include &#xA3;165 million in head office costs, arising from our contribution to the UK Financial Services compensation scheme and a review of compliance with U.S. sanctions, as well as &#xA3;220 million of incremental non-cash charges from writing off goodwill and from higher amortization of intangible assets. This also includes gains on property sales, which were &#xA3;120 million lower than 2007.</p>
          <p>Secondly, strategic investment in the business accounted for over &#xA3;1 billion, including &#xA3;600 million deployed in Western Europe and emerging markets to expand our distribution network, &#xA3;180 million of additional support from liquidity funds in BGI, and &#xA3;285 million, including the restructuring and investment costs from all acquisitions, including Lehman's.</p>
          <p>Finally, set against these increases, we've made a significant reduction in variable costs across the Group, and in particular in Investment Banking and Investment Management. Headcount across the Group increased 16%, while total staff costs were down 7%.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Group balance sheet. Our assets and liability totals have grown significantly during the year. Changes in currency rates have been an important contributor, with sterling down 31% against the euro, and 37% and against the dollar. In Barclays Capital alone, this increased asset values by over &#xA3;140 billion.</p>
          <p>When we look at the balance sheet, we distinguish changes from the -- that alter the consumption of cash, capital, and risk from those that don't. This slide sets out the nominal growth in our balance sheet of &#xA3;830 billion year-on-year. Of this, almost &#xA3;740 billion arises from increased derivatives balances.</p>
          <p>Loans and advances grew by &#xA3;124 billion and other balance sheet assets went down by &#xA3;35 billion. The last two categories include &#xA3;36 billion of new assets from acquisitions, as well as the impact of substantial foreign exchange movements.</p>
          <p>The increase in derivatives balances is driven by a higher volatility in indices, interest rates and other valuation parameters. Most of these balances represent receivables and payables with the same counterparties. They are subject to enforceable netting agreements recognized by U.S. GAAP; and under U.S. GAAP, the balance sheet is &#xA3;900 billion smaller.</p>
          <p>If we consider tangible balance sheet leverage, excluding accounting impacts on derivatives, assets under management, and settlement balances, adjusted gross leverage has improved from 33 times Tier-1 capital at the end of '07 to 28 times at the end of '08. This reflects the issuance of capital and an increase in retained earnings over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>We expect gross leverage to improve to about 24 times on an adjusted basis of Tier-1 capital, as more of our mandatory convertible notes and reserve capital instruments qualify as Tier-1 capital. Over time, we'd expect that 24 times to reduce further.</p>
          <p>We significantly increased our capital during the year, as you know. Shareholders equity increased from &#xA3;23 billion at the end of '07 to &#xA3;37 billion at the end of '08. We've raised &#xA3;5 billion in ordinary equity and more than &#xA3;4 billion through the issue of mandatory convertible notes and warrants.</p>
          <p>Attributable profit was &#xA3;4.4 billion, and we've paid dividends of &#xA3;2.3 billion. Risk weighted assets increased &#xA3;80 billion to over &#xA3;430 billion, 60 billion of this was driven by exchange rate movements, and the balance represents the additional pro-cyclical effect of Basel II. Our capital ratios on a pro forma basis at the end of the year were 6.7% for equity -- sorry-- 9.7% for Tier-1 and 6.7% for equity Tier-1.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we expect 2009 to be another challenging year. Low interest rates are likely to continue and this will reflect the liability margin. So, we'll also receive some benefit from our structural interest rate hedge. We expect RWA growth in single digits and capital ratios well in excess of the minimum levels set by the FSA.</p>
          <p>So to conclude, it's been an extremely challenging year and a busy one. We've raised over &#xA3;13 billion of new Tier-1 capital for the Group. We took a very significant step with the acquisition of Lehman's in North America. And we've continued to expand our retail and Commercial Banking business profitably.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much. I'm now going to handover to Robert, to talk about the impairment trends in 2008, and our expectations for 2009.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I want to cover a lot of territory looking across these topics. I'll start with an update on credit market exposures for Barclays Capital, including the valuation process we use and a brief look at each of our different credit books.</p>
          <p>Then a review of how we've managed our major credit portfolios in Global, Retail and Commercial Banking, covering the UK Retail portfolio, our UK and U.S. Cards business, The UK Commercial Bank; and then Absa, Spain and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And after that, I'll look at market risk. I'll do all this to give you a clear view of how the current portfolios developed, but the important part of our job is to look forward. So I'll end by covering the wider economic environment and our impairment outlook for 2009.</p>
          <p>Before I cover the credit market exposures, let me explain our governance fair valuations and impairment calculations. Starting with the valuation process, the very important point is that most of our credit market exposures use fair values taken directly from the market.</p>
          <p>During 2008, we disposed of more than &#xA3;9 billion of assets through sales and paydowns. These sales were at or near our valuations and they included for example, disposals of whole loans, commercial property loans and Alt-A securities.</p>
          <p>Risk management is an independent function in Barclays and I'm responsible for signing-off our impairment charges. They're brought to our Board Audit Committee for review before the Board signs off our results, and they are of course reviewed by our external auditors. We use a model to calculate impairment for our ABS CDOs, which is the correct approach.</p>
          <p>Let me explain how we do that, so you can understand the process and see why a read across from bank-to-bank normally won't work. This graph shows the delinquency trend for subprime assets originated in 2004. As a first step, we use industry data up to the present and this is recent data from S&amp;P for illustration.</p>
          <p>As a second step, we apply a loss severity, which tells us how much we would lose in the event of a default. This two-step approach produces a loss rate, which in this case, is half the default rate. Then we look forward to forecast the loss rate in the future. We use this process for other years to produce loss rates for different vintages, and we've extrapolated the S&amp;P data to illustrate this.</p>
          <p>The later vintages of '06 and '07 have higher delinquency rates leading to a higher loss rates. And this is important because almost three quarters of our ABS CDO assets are from 2005 or earlier, which is why they have lower loss rates. That's basically how it works. Although, we look at many other factors such as regional differences, cash flow timing, repayment rates and others.</p>
          <p>In summary then, our valuation process has four key features. First, most assets use fair values taken from the market. Second, the impairment model we have is widely used in the industry, and the inputs are from the market. They are not just our assumptions.</p>
          <p>Third, the models are forward-looking. And fourth, they clearly differentiate between assets, in this example by vintage. Putting all these factors together explains how we come to appropriate impairment reserves.</p>
          <p>Now let me get into our credit market exposures. During 2008, our exposures in ABS CDOs fell by about half in dollar terms, from liquidations, and from &#xA3;1.5 billion of losses on that book. We took some important actions that drove exposures down when we triggered unwind clauses and liquidated two-thirds of our remaining structures. Those assets were then moved at fair value to our trading books.</p>
          <p>As I explained a minute ago, valuations in the CDO book are influenced by vintage, and almost three quarters of the assets were originated in '05 or earlier. We have no CDO squared and following those liquidations we have no remaining mezzanine or synthetic CDO structures. Any second lien assets were already written-down to zero in 2007.</p>
          <p>For the remaining RMBS assets, half of them are still AAA and AA, and about a quarter of the rest are investment grade. Other sub-prime exposures also declined by about half in dollar terms and Alt-A exposures were down by about a third. Of this, sub-prime whole loans fell by about half, and the remaining book is almost completely assets originated by EquiFirst.</p>
          <p>In April, we qualified as an originator under the Federal Housing Administration program in the U.S. And that means, we can take suitable assets from our portfolios and submit them to the FHA for a guarantee. As a result, about half the remaining sub-prime whole loans are being submitted to the FHA for guarantees and we're selling them more easily and at the best prices.</p>
          <p>Moving on to commercial mortgages, this includes loans and CMBS securities. Let me give you the breakdown. The LTVs at origination are shown here. Just over half of the loan portfolios in the U.S., about 20% in Germany, 7% is in the UK and the remainder is widely spread with only 1% in Spain.</p>
          <p>In Dollar terms, the U.S. book reduced by almost 20% last year. Two large facilities in the U.S. make up about 40% of the book. They are based on a wide pool of properties and they paid down &#xA3;800 million last year. These are fair value books and the average mark across the U.S. assets was 88%. The rest of the book is well-spread across about 75 names.</p>
          <p>The loan book in Europe is well-diversified. And for almost all the book, we have the right to test the loans against covenant and LTV levels, and that allows us to renegotiate better terms and conditions.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to review our monoline exposure. When I think about this, I focus on three factors. First, the underlying assets. Collateralized loan obligations are about two-thirds of the notional assets with monoline guarantees. These CLOs are made up of a pool of loans from about 2,000 U.S. and 600 European corporate borrowers.</p>
          <p>Virtually, all of our CLO positions remain AAA or AA. And they have the huge benefit of a lot of junior debt beneath them in the capital structure. That's really important. Because it would take a corporate default rate of more than 20% across the whole loan book for many years before the cash flow to our CLO positions would be reduced.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, for our assets, there have been no defaults and no missed payment on any to-date. For our other monoline assets, CMBS make up about 15%, and all of them are rated AAA of AA.</p>
          <p>And finally, 10% of the assets are U.S. RMBS, where most of the ratings are sub-investment grade, but where all the payments to our assets are still being made. And this is where I look at the second factor and that's the guarantee provided by the monolines.</p>
          <p>For the RMBS assets, virtually all of the cover is provided by monolines that remain investment grade. And remember, this cover is not to replace market value, it's insurance to replace any missing cash flow payments that might occur in the future. And that leads to the third factor, which is the methodology we use to calculate our reserves.</p>
          <p>Given that exposure has arisen, two of the most important factors that drive these valuations are default probabilities and loss severities. Our default probabilities are forward-looking and much higher than their historic levels. Looking across the range, they are at or higher than the default probabilities we believe are implied by the current agency ratings.</p>
          <p>For 60% of our monoline exposure, we further stress our probabilities beyond the current agency rating and our loss severity assumptions range from 45 to 100% depending on the monoline. So taking into account, our assets the nature of the monoline guarantees and the credit position of the monolines themselves, our total reserve for monoline exposure is &#xA3;1.7 billion. We believe, other large international banks use a similar reserving methodology and from what we've have seen their results calibrate to our reserve levels.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to leveraged finance. Sponsored leveraged finance balances were reduced by &#xA3;3.1 billion last month following the full repayment of Alltel exposure at par. These are drawn loans and therefore they are held in our banking book, which is the accounting treatment we've used for many years, and which is now being used more by other banks. Under this accounting treatment, an identified impairment charges taken only when a specific impairment event has occurred. So that's the accounting. Now let's look at the credit risk.</p>
          <p>We have very few remaining undrawn facilities. And the portfolio performance continues to be satisfactory. Since the Alltel paydown, the U.S. book is small. The European portfolio is well spread by industry and region, however, 47% of the overall portfolio now relates to Alliance Boots &amp; AA Saga.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we have more of these loans than we had intended, but the credit performance of those companies continues on their original business plans. And I believe that the better banking decision is to retain these loans rather than force a sale into an unwilling market.</p>
          <p>I've discussed some of loans in our portfolio; there have been a number of publicly known situations where loans are now in difficulty. We had the opportunity for a lead role on some of these which we declined.</p>
          <p>I'm going to talk now about the performance of our major credit portfolios. And how we use and adjust risk appetite. A lot of banking is about risk management and we try to plan for the best by protect against the worst. So an important part of our job is to look forward to anticipate the dangers or the downside.</p>
          <p>At the end of '07, when we were planning for '08 and '09, the market was still forecasting steady GDP &#x2013; GDP -- pardon me, across the major economies, including the UK. After many years of growth these economies have several things in common; increasing residential and commercial property prices, high personal and corporate leverage and low unemployment. In particular, the unwinding of leverage led us to the view that we should prepare for a much weaker scenario going forward.</p>
          <p>So our Executive Committee launched a formal program to give greater protection across all our credit portfolios in the UK, the U.S., Spain and South Africa. These included more than 300 immediate actions that had clear benefits and were fast to implement such as changes to lending criteria, to limits, and to collections.</p>
          <p>We also decided to take more than 100 strategic actions. These were bigger decisions, such as giving up market share to get a better risk return balance, increasing hedging at a significant cost and being the first bank in South Africa to tighten our terms for mortgage lending.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of last year, we extended our program to emerging markets. The position of our books at the end of '07 was defensive, and the moves we've made last year help protect further against the continuing tough conditions.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the portfolios, this slide shows the loss rates on loans and advances to customers. In the UK Retail Banking and UK Card portfolios these were either stable or slightly improved. The loan loss rate in Barclays Commercial Bank went up in '08 and that reflected an increase in impairment of &#xA3;122 million. The increase in the BarCap impairment charge includes the 1.5 billion of impairment that I mentioned on the CDOs.</p>
          <p>The remaining BarCap impairment charge of about &#xA3;900 million was spread across a wide range of counterparties. And this includes any losses from corporates, financials, and the hedge fund unwinding that took place last year. The largest charge on any single loan in BarCap into 2008 was less than &#xA3;50 million. I will now move into more detail on these books.</p>
          <p>Looking at our individual portfolios, I will start with our UK Retail Bank mortgages. Chris said earlier, that the portfolio average loan-to-value is 40%. Importantly, only 10% of the book has an LTV above 85%. And we have not offered self-certified mortgages. We continue to support our customers, and for those in financial difficulty, we offer various options to help them including switching to interest only, term extensions, and arrangements to clear arrears.</p>
          <p>Of our 725,000 residential mortgages, only about 6,000 are more than 90 days delinquent. We had less than 1% of the repossessions in the UK last year and less than 170 of our mortgages are currently in repossession. Our average LTV and buy-to-let is 56% and we have good income cover. And of our 50,000 buy-to-let mortgages, less than 500 are more than 90 days delinquent and only nine are in repossession.</p>
          <p>Turning to UK Consumer Loans, balances have been steady during '08 and the book has shown a slightly reducing delinquency trend and a declining charge-off rate year-on-year. We've raised scorecard cutoff points, tightened affordability criteria, and scaled back the amount of available top-up lending.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, more than 90% of our loan book is with existing Barclays customers. So we've been able to make lending decisions based on their previous track record. When I look at this portfolio, despite the good performance in '08, I expect the environment to move against these trends as we've recently seen.</p>
          <p>Moving on to look at UK Cards, let's start by looking at the book in a different way. Each year, we measure the delinquency of new assets for that year three months after they come on the book. This delinquency rate for new vintages has been trending lower, showing that the credit quality of new lending has improved, which comes out in a way the book has been performing.</p>
          <p>You'll remember that we reduced our book during '05 and '06. Since then, we've rebuilt balances mostly from the Goldfish acquisition, while applying tighter scorecard cut-offs, more selective balance growth, and more line decreases where appropriate.</p>
          <p>Our approval rate for new cards remains at about 50%. Looking at charge-off rates, the industry rate has fluctuated. At the same time, our charge-off rate has declined, as a result of the improvement in our credit quality. Again although, we're not immune from current conditions, these portfolio characteristics give us some confidence that our UK card book is relatively well-positioned.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to our card business in the U.S. That was about 30% of overall impairment in Barclaycard last year. Our business in the U.S. is largely based on a partnership model, which provides us with good quality customers. For example, in 2008 we took over the loyalty credit card programs for U.S. Air and L.L. Bean.</p>
          <p>In response, to the tougher consumer credit environment, we tightened qualification criteria and credit limits on new cards. We changed our score card models to reflect a stress, where unemployment could reach 10%. We removed $7 billion of limits through credit line decreases, and we stopped non-partnership open market acquisition.</p>
          <p>Our delinquency rates were very low in 2006 because it was a new book. They've been increasing as the portfolio has matured, but remain below the industry average. I expect impairment to increase in '09, but the steps we've taken and the benefit of our partnership model should help mitigate against the current market conditions.</p>
          <p>Turning to Barclays Commercial Bank, let me give you some context at how we look at risk here. For many years, our UK team has tracked the level of gearing across UK companies, because we have learned that when company gearing increases, corporate insolvency levels follow about two years later. When we removed the time lag like this, it's clear that they are very closely related.</p>
          <p>During 2006, we saw that gearing was on the rise, as I'm showing you in the circle. So we took steps to protect our book. We tightened limits on lending to any one single borrower. We reduced limits or changed credit policy in those sectors we felt were most risky, such as commercial property and sponsored leverage lending. And we shifted the portfolio more towards secured lending.</p>
          <p>From 2006, company gearing has increased and as predicted corporate insolvency has followed. This gave us an early view of the effects of increasing company gearing, and the changes we made from 2006 have helped to keep our losses at the low-end of the scale.</p>
          <p>Let me explain how some of those measures have worked in practice. Chris mentioned that in 2008 the largest impairment charge against a single name in the Commercial Bank was &#xA3;40 million. Because of the controls on single name exposure, the average of the next 10 losses was about &#xA3;15 million.</p>
          <p>In commercial property, we have only about &#xA3;5 billion of investment and development lending. And the sector was about 5% of our limits. We have virtually no speculative development. We've done no equity underwriting and we have only &#xA3;5 million of mezzanine debt. On balance, although overall impairment will increase, I don't expect commercial property lending to be an issue in 2009 for The Commercial Bank.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, the sponsored leveraged book will be under pressure this year. However, the average exposure is below &#xA3;20 million. We have about a &#xA3;100 million of mezzanine lending. And we would not expect any significant single loss. So although total limits were higher in '08, we've held to our sector limits.</p>
          <p>I want to mention the other portfolios that we're watching carefully. First of all, Absa. There has been significant pressure on loan loss rates across retail portfolios driven by high interest rates on the back of persistent inflation and high customer leverage.</p>
          <p>From June '06 to June '08, interest rates have risen by 500 basis points in South Africa. That would have made a monthly mortgage payment increase by about a third. As a consequence, mortgage loan loss rates increased from a low level of 30 basis points to a 100 basis points during the year. And delinquencies have risen in the consumer and vehicle finance portfolios.</p>
          <p>The current LTV of the mortgage book has increased modestly from 38 to 41% during last year. During 2008, we took several important steps. We opened another collections call center, increasing collections staff from 850 to 1,400 and we reduced our LTVs for new mortgage business.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead this year, asset growth will slow, house prices will fall and we expect average LTVs to rise from 41 to 45%. Retail impairment will continue to increase, although we've now seen 150 basis points of interest rate reductions since December and we may see a further 100 basis points cut in April, which will help customers.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Western Europe. Our portfolio is mostly in Spain, and the deterioration in the Spanish property and construction sector during 2008 impacted our wholesale portfolios. We have property exposure in our medium and large business areas, but in lower proportions than the overall market.</p>
          <p>We tightened our LTV criteria in 2007 and our policy during 2008 is to avoid new lending except where we could improve our overall position; for example, by obtaining security over a previously unsecured position.</p>
          <p>We've also avoided participating in most of the large failed syndications and subsequent defaults in Spain that you will have read about in the press. Our largest single impairment in Spain in 2008 was just under &#xA3;20 million.</p>
          <p>Turning now to emerging markets. Our portfolios are growing quickly as we diversify and grow our earnings. The loan loss rate has risen and this has been driven by balance growth in the retail portfolios, particularly in India where we launched in 2007. Last year, we reduced our growth rate as we applied tighter lending criteria, and as we look ahead this year, we will keep a tight risk appetite in this area.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at credit risk loans, which are those assets where we've taken identified impairment charges. They include all our retail and commercial non-performing loans, as well as assets like the ABS CDOs in BarCap, where we have taken impairment, even though no payments had been missed.</p>
          <p>So when I look at this, our credit risk loans increased a lot in each of the four categories of loans. And in 2009, we expect that trend to continue, except in ABS CDOs, which have already been taken into the CRLs. So what's important is that although CRLs are much higher, we have maintained our overall coverage ratio through the higher impairment charges we have taken.</p>
          <p>In summary, we've recognized the tougher environment. We have booked more CRLs. We've taken higher impairment charges across our book. And we've added almost &#xA3;3 billion of impairment reserves to our balance sheet, which has maintained our coverage ratios.</p>
          <p>I also want to comment briefly on market risk developments. Volatility rose substantially across many markets later in 2008. The VIX is a well-known index that shows volatility in U.S. equities. And in the third quarter last year, there was a spike prompted by the Lehman bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>Similar volatility moves occurred across many other key markets at the time. This rise in volatility caused daily value at risk, a measure of our trading risk, to also rise as more extreme market moves came into the DVaR calculations. These were mostly from interest rate and credit spread markets.</p>
          <p>The VIX has begun to drop back down towards more normal levels. However, our DVaR will keep this higher volatility in its calculation time series for the next two years. So DVaR will stay higher for some time.</p>
          <p>We rely on stress loss measures as an important market risk management tool. We've not increased our stress loss limits since early 2008, and we're keeping most of our limits for 2009. The main change accommodates our new cash equities business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>I've gone over the portfolios I wanted to cover, so now, let's look at how the economy comes into our forward thinking. Our business plans reflect the views captured in these consensus forecasts. They are very similar -- there are very similar trends in both the UK and the U.S.</p>
          <p>The general view is that tougher conditions for small business and corporates will result in more unemployment. House prices will continue to decline and GDP will fall. With low inflation and weak consumer and corporate confidence, interest rates will also remain low.</p>
          <p>Also importantly, the recent falls in energy and commodity prices will readjust the dynamics across our credit portfolios. These issues will affect many other countries and the global downturn has been a major factor in our forward planning.</p>
          <p>I'll finish with our impairment outlook for 2009. We participate in many markets around the world, and we do our best to take current conditions into account and apply them carefully to all our portfolios. When I look at impairment in 2008, our loan loss rate was 95 basis points. That's based on &#xA3;4.9 billion of impairments charge on loans and advances to customers and banks, against &#xA3;516 billion of those loans and advances.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we expect credit market losses to be down and more general impairment to be up. So the overall should be higher. For the purposes of our planning assumptions, we've used a range of 130 to 150 basis points of loan loss rate.</p>
          <p>This range is based on a loan book of the same size, no major changes to foreign currency levels and the economic conditions we built into our plan. And our best information tells us that 2010 looks very much the same. Although that's of course, even more difficult to estimate, because there are so many changing factors.</p>
          <p>You've received a lot of information from us. We wanted to update you on our credit market exposures, why our valuations are appropriate, and how our positions have moved. And I wanted to explain more about how we look at risk management and what we've done to position ourselves for this environment.</p>
          <p>Thanks you. And I will now hand over to John.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you again for being with us. So Chris has taken you through the details of our balance sheet and profit and loss account, and you've heard from Robert on the subject of risk.  My main purpose this morning is to look forward rather than to look back. I will make some remarks about 2008, but as context for 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Mostly what I want to talk about to you today is our framework for moving the strategy forward, including commitments that we're making now and expectations that you should have of Barclays for the future. So let me start with 2008 as context for 2009. Conditions during the last two years have been extraordinarily difficult. Its rise in such an environment that we manage our portfolio of businesses to protect and bolster financial performance.</p>
          <p>Our performance in 2008 benefited from various individually significant and one-off items. Chris has walked you through these and you have a slide in your pack that lists them. Well, we had the opportunity to make non-recurring profit, such as with the Lehman's transaction and from selling non-core components of the portfolio, such as a Closed Life Fund and our stakes in Visa. We've done so, because these moves generate capital and benefit our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With or without the one-offs, Barclays was solidly profitable during the year and our performance mainly reflects operating profit generation. In seeking to extend the opportunity to increase activity levels with customer and clients, we've invested heavily over the last years, including in 2008, in diversifying our income.</p>
          <p>The impact of prior year investments is visible across the business. In the expanded number of distribution points, in our Retail and Commercial Banking businesses outside the United Kingdom, in the asset-class diversification in Barclays Capital and the product diversification in Barclays Global Investors.</p>
          <p>This diversification has enabled us to generate record income of over &#xA3;23 billion in 2008 and a stated growth of trading writedowns the top line figure would be higher still. Record income enabled us to moderate the impact both of the increased writedowns and impairment and a lower volumes in some areas that results from the credit crunch.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, our funding and liquidity position has remained strong and we've continued to benefit from a steady inflow of customer liabilities. During the year, we've been able to extend a term of unsecured liabilities and reduce reliance on unsecured funding. Our objective through 2008 were to stay close to customers and clients, to manage our risk, and to maintain strategic momentum. And that describes minutely, our approach to 2009, as well.</p>
          <p>In the area of staying close to customers and clients, the needs and the opportunities remain significant. The dislocation of the credit crunch has opened up the competitive field in an unusual way. In 2008, we increased our lending activities in mortgages where we had the highest market share of net lending and with SME clients in the UK and we grew customer numbers significantly in GRCB. Remember that when Frits arrived in 2006, we had 34 million customers and today we have over 48 million.</p>
          <p>In the midst of the market disruption and significant volatility, we sharply increased activity levels in Barclays Capital in rates, currencies, commodities, emerging markets and prime services. These all represent areas where our customers and clients have significant needs and demands and where we can continue to respond even in the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>That's what lies behind the income performance of 2008, and we will be seeking to do the same in 2009. Indeed, we believe that the collective impact of strategic steps taken in 2008 will continue to provide quite significant income opportunities this year and beyond. Here I'm referring to Goldfish, Expobank, Akita Bank, India, Pakistan and the Lehman acquisition as it benefits both our Barclays Capital and Barclays Wealth businesses.</p>
          <p>Managing our risks, well, we've given you a lot of detail this morning in Robert's presentation, with a view to showing you more of what we do and how we do it in the area of risk management. We are intensely focused on the exposures that we have in our balance sheet and on the impairment and volume risks created by a severe downturn. Understanding those risks and managing them actively was central to our strategy in 2008 and it remains so in 2009.</p>
          <p>So what assumptions do we make about doing business in 2009, what are our performance priorities and what is our framework for moving the strategy forward? We make the planning assumption for 2009 that impairment costs will remain high. Robert and Chris have given you some guidance on this.</p>
          <p>The low interest rate environment will help impairment over time as will other measures taken by governments in the big economies where we do business. But the collective impact of those measures is unlikely to redefine prospect for 2009, is more likely that the world will begin to see their composite benefit in 2010.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, of course, very low interest rates have a significant impact on our liabilities margins. We started to see that at the end of 2008, and we will certainly see more of it in 2009. What will the performance priorities be for Barclays this year? We intend to make the right tradeoff between growth and risk. To be clear, we intend to take advantage of the changed landscape and to drive hard the opportunities that we've created over the last couple of years, but in doing so in 2009, we will focus on returns before growth.</p>
          <p>We're interested, therefore, in the quantity of weighted-risk assets and the returns they generate, the size of our balance sheet and the scale of leverage, growing customer liabilities inline with growth in customer assets, the relationship between income and cost because recurring core profitability is central to our ability to pay dividends and maintaining capital ratios that are well in excess of the FSA's minimum levels. These things rank ahead of growth in 2009.</p>
          <p>I'm going to talk now about the framework for moving the strategy forward. Lots of commentators say that the financial services industry is at an inflection point. And it's clear that many things in the future will be different. As markets and regulation continue to evolve, so will our strategy. There are many parts of the strategy though, which remain appropriate for the new environment. I'll start by describing those elements of our strategic framework that remained unchanged, and then I'll talk about what we're changing.</p>
          <p>Responsible corporate citizenship, we must behave constructively to help our customers and clients as they cope with the economic slowdown, and help governments and supervisors too, as they deal with the effects of the financial crisis in each case in a way that is consistent with our obligations to shareholders.</p>
          <p>We believe in the universal banking model, our goal remains to be one of the leading universal banks of the world. And that ambition has certainly been helped by the extraordinary shift in the competitive landscape over the last 18 months. The crunch has demonstrated that risk concentration in certain business models is unsupportable, hence the collapse of the wholesale funded mortgage banks and many of the bulge-bracket investment banks.</p>
          <p>If well executed the diversification provided by universal banking, facilitates profit resilience and optionality, as well as capital efficiency. And I believe that we can see that in our relative performance in 2007 and 2008. The mix of business within the model will need to take account of the current economic climate and of the regulatory environment. Diversification has helped us mitigate the severe impacts of the dislocation and remains a strategic priority for us.</p>
          <p>To create good returns through time, we believe we need to preserve strategic and operational maneuverability. We need flexibility in how we manage the portfolio and that lies at the heart of our recapitalization decision last year. Our UK business is and always will be very important to us. We are committed to helping the UK economy. But Barclays is not just a UK bank. We now employ more people outside the United Kingdom than in it. We serve more customers outside the UK than in it. And we need to be in a position where the alignment between the company and in its shareholders is as close as can be.</p>
          <p>To be precise, that alignment must be based on a common set of commercial objectives, governing resource allocation, capital utilization, and risk management. Our objective through time is to ensure that the P&amp;L cost all the capital we raised in November is covered many times over by the benefits of pursuing an independent strategy. Our financial performance has to be reliable such that we maintain solid profitability even in the savage economic downturn that the world is currently experiencing.</p>
          <p>Profitability will facilitate dividend payments on which subject, more in a moment. So where does our strategic framework need to change given the events of the last two years? So, just a few points I want to highlight this morning. First of all, in the area of capital, we're now running and managing too much higher capital ratios than we have historically. We have to spell out clearly our dividend policy and we intend to do this at the Annual General Meeting. As you know, we're committed to recommencing dividend payments in the second half of this year, and to be clear what that means is paying a dividend before the end of 2009, which relates to the current year.</p>
          <p>The compensation environment has changed. We understand that. And we're responding three points here. We have for a long time had a pay for performance philosophy that reflects the performance of individual units and the group overall. That system includes divesting of variable revolves over multiple years, and a balance between cash and share-based remuneration, is designed to be sensitive to movements in our profit performance. So when profit falls, you should expect variable compensation to fall.</p>
          <p>Variable pay has fallen sharply, by which I mean almost 50% across the Group in 2008. The effects of this are of course more pronounced in Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors, where the variable proportion of total cost is higher. In Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors, variable compensation has fallen by over 50%. For 2009 and beyond, we're reviewing our compensation policies and practices to ensure that they evolve appropriately. Our objective is to maximize alignment with the interest of shareholders, as well as to ensure that we're moving with the times in a progressive development of the right compensation policies for the coming years.</p>
          <p>Regulators want there to be less leverage in the banking system and more capital. We will take account of that fact in distributing capital within the Group, and as we manage our composite returns. We must also focus on the aggregate size of the balance sheet. As you heard from Chris, we're working on reducing leverage. We expect and intend that over time, the aggregate balance sheet will fall. And as we report during 2009, we'll give you line of sight into progress and into the impact of currency and pro-cyclicality on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The effect of these initiatives will be to help us hold our ratios well above the regulatory minima, protecting the loss absorption buffer that is such an important ingredient of prudent banking in an unpredictable world. Meanwhile, we have to pay attention to the distribution of our capital and to the mix in our profit and loss account. The economic environment and the change regulatory and funding scene must influence our allocation of resources.</p>
          <p>It's clear that returns on equity in the industry are not going back to where they were. And it's clear also that the higher-capital lower-leverage stance of global regulators is directed particularly at capital markets businesses. So, we expect to see balance sheet utilization by Barclays Capital fall over time, which will help us to deliver strengthening returns. We have been developing the mix of earnings in Barclays Capital to take account of these changes.</p>
          <p>Our Lehman's acquisition, and the market share opportunities created by the upheaval in the investment banking sector have enabled us to increase substantially the scale of the flow business within the new Barclays Capital. As to the mix of profit contribution, I'm often asked what we see as the optimal shape of Barclays in the context of the distribution of earnings by business. As it happens, in 2009, we expect writedowns in Barclays Capital to be lower, and the benefit of the Lehman's businesses to contribute in full both of which will be supportive of our investment banking profits.</p>
          <p>And in GRCB, the economic slowdown in 2009 will produce lower liability margins and higher impairment levels, as Chris and Robert have indicated. But over time, I would expect to see about two-thirds of the Group's profits coming from our retail and commercial banking businesses, and from the substantially fee-driven investment management and wealth businesses, and about a third coming from Barclays Capita, a few final comments on the year ahead. We try on these occasions to signal in advance our coming seminars. So, let me say here that we will have a seminar on Barclays Capital during the first half of the year; and a seminar on our GRCB businesses during the second half.</p>
          <p>I've already commented on the direction of our balance sheet size and leverage and I've talked about dividends. But I should address also our existing external goals. Last year you will remember, we announced economic profit goals for the period 2008 to 2011. Those goals were based, among other things, on an assumption about our cost of equity, and the regulatory capital requirements of the business. The cost of equity has increased over the past 12 months, and the regulatory capital requirements were reset by the UK Financial Services Authority in October of last year.</p>
          <p>So it's right for us to revisit our goals, and to ensure that we have determined the performance drivers that are appropriately aligned with the return and balance sheet objectives that I've just talked about, and specifically, of course, with the interests of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We're reviewing this subject at the moment, and our intention is to publish new goals, including reviewing the length of the goal period later this year. We know that the new goals that we set must be tough. Before I finish, a word on current trading. Whilst 2009 is only a month old, customer and client activity levels have been high, and we have had a good start to the year. In particular, the operating performance of Barclays Capital, benefiting as it is from the now complete integration of the Lehman business, has been extremely strong. The trends that lie behind the strong operating profit in GRCB in 2008 are again observable in its performance in January.</p>
          <p>So while we are realistic about just how difficult the environment is, and will remain, we are committed to delivering on the objectives that we've described this morning, which include the objective that 2009 will be another year of solid profitability.</p>
          <p>I am going to stop now that we can take your questions. I should say that Frits and Bob anticipate questions on respectively UK lending levels and the Lehman acquisition. So they will talk a little bit longer in response to questions on that than they might habitually aided by a slide or two. Could you in the usual way, as you ask a question, give us your name and the organization that you represent? And we've got about half an hour for questions. Thank you. Yes, microphone coming.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, sorry. Good morning. It's Simon Samuels from Citigroup. Couple of questions, if I can, on credit quality. The sort of a real economy bit, not the structure credit. First of all, I just wanted to have a look at page 72 of your release, and the question is to do with coverage ratios. Obviously, we saw the slide showing that your coverage ratio is essentially flat line slightly improved during the course of the year. But as you see -- if you look towards a bottom-right of the table on page 72, you can obviously see by category, I mean, clearly the story is a significant increase in coverage in the CDO portfolio, but essentially flat in mortgages down and unsecured, down quite noticeably in the corporate business. And the absolute numbers seem pretty low as well. And so really my question is why -- what clearly is a weak part of the economic cycle, you're running those ratios down quite aggressively. And there is a second unrelated question?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think that the coverage ratios at this point in the cycle are going to be driven by the different delinquency trends for corporate as compared to for retail. And when early cycle delinquency happens for retail assets, they carry a lot less impairment. That's just a mathematical calculation of how that's done. We move assets on the corporate side onto watch lists and then into our non-performing loans or CRLs as soon as they are more than 90 days past due. So at that point, the uncertainty around the eventual impairment in those assets means that the impairment charges are lower than they would be at the time of a write off, let's say. Also keep in mind that corporate loans generally have lower severity rates or lower losses in the region of 40 to 50% and those losses are much higher on retail. So it's a combination of a mix of the assets and the stage in the cycle that we are in, the amount of impairment we take is largely driven by the accounting rules and so it reflects stage of cycle of mix of assets.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, no, no -- I mean, is your hint there that if it wasn't for IFRS accounting, if you had UK GAAP, it wouldn't have run down in the way it has. I mean I am focusing actually particularly in the corporate portfolio, because presumably that number, that coverage ratio is not just &#x2013; is going to -- keep on going down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't intend it to be really a reflection of different accounting treatment. I intended it to say that when you bring a lot of corporate assets onto your watch list, by definition, they will have lower impairment this stage in the cycle. We bought a lot more corporates on. If you look at our PPLs, our Potential Problem Loans, those are very heavily corporate. And those are potential problem loans. And I think it's correct that they don't carry a lot of impairments at this point.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you. The second question is really to do with the Group guidance. So, it may be for John or for Chris. The -- so your outlook 130 to 150 bps for '09, I can't actually recall the last time your bank's been so in the UK anyway so explicit about giving a number. So -- and you are obviously talking about flat lining for 2010 or that kind of there or there about level. Can you -- first of all, to give us some sense of the robustness of that number, can you give us any idea of how that number internally has changed as in last two or three months? I mean, will it be the case that your April AGM that number is going to move a lot more from where it currently is?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has changed rapidly. And it has been changing particularly in the last two or three months. And we see that best, if we look at the planning assumptions that we started with in terms of the medium term plan that we do in that sort of late summer, through to the short-term plan, which we do at the end of the year. And we've updated that even since then. And the prime driver of that has been the increase of that 130 to 150. And it has gone up and it could continue to do it, but it's our best view at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the 2010 -- I mean, if you go back to the early 90s credit cycle, as I'm sure you'll recall, it was a sort of three year significant increase year-after-year. And you are suggesting to a level, that is, a) nothing like as high as the early 90s; and b) flat lined to that elevated level for a couple of years, which would make it a very different shape credit cycle. And it just -- that sort of feels very optimistic from where we're sitting today. And I know that portfolio's changed et cetera. But is that -- I mean, is there anything you can tell us as to why you think, this is going to be just that sort of very unusual one-year big lift up and then flat lining at an elevated level?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Do the math, it will be -- you'll see, it's quite a very significant level of increase. I think within that we see some mixtures. We see some growing increases in the -- what you call the real economy offset by a potential reductions in the level of reserving against the credit market assets, which have been on the books and you've seen this provide over two years. 2010 for us is less clear. But it was just to give you a flavor of direction that we don't seek any better.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Robert Law of Nomura. I've got a number of questions on your approach to managing the balance sheet, which you've given as a priority for this year. The pro-cyclicality increase of about 20 billion in risk assets, is that an indication of the kind of pace that we get this year? And what are the factors behind it? And secondly, in terms of the derivatives movement that you've seen in the six months, I think it's up about 900 billion. Is it in the six months or some kind of figure like that? Could you comment on why it's suddenly lapped like that in terms of the second half of the year? And finally, in terms of managing down the balance sheet, which you've given as a priority, what kind of environment are you planning to be able to do that in? And what sort of conditions would meet against you being able to take that kind of action this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Chris to answer. Bob may want to add to the final -- your third question, Robert. But let's go to Chris first of all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trying to do them in the order. In terms of pro-cyclicality, most of the pro-cyclicality we've seen to-date has been in terms counterparty risk and market risk within the risk-weighed assets calculation. If we look forwards, and we'll try to give you some inductions of where we look to grow risk-weighed assets in total. We see a shift into pro-cyclicality of the credit risk-weighed assets. And if I look at the sort of level we've given you, which is in the single-digit level, I think about half of that looks like it will be pro-cyclicality from our best estimate at the moment. And the other half over the year will be volume related. But that of course is dependent on a number of assumptions, for example, the usage or otherwise of the asset protection scheme, and at the moment we're assuming, we're not using it. And for the purpose of these calculations, and the second is the level of pro-cyclicality relief that may come through Basel II and the initiatives that the FSA has started. So that's how we get pro-cyclicality in terms of derivatives. Most of the derivatives gross-up occurred in the last four or five months of the year, and that really reflects the increased volatility in the underlying rates of interest rates, equities and other valuation parameters that we use within our valuation of derivatives calculations. In terms of managing down the balance sheet, I think, if you see the trends that we've seen in the last half, or I should start by saying the first half the balance sheet was managed flat in risk weighted asset terms. In the second half, what you've seen is growth in loans and advances to customers broadly offset by reductions in trading balances, as we've really focused on the return we get on risk weighted assets. And I think it's that mechanism that we will continue to use as we go forward.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Robert, it's a good question, it's tricky. I think, you saw on the Deutsche Bank results last week, some of same factors around derivatives. It's not necessarily an increase in derivatives, as Chris said the volatility or the currency impact particularly post the Lehman bankruptcy affected positions, which under IFRS we all gross up. But let's be very specific, these are non-cash risk adjusted. There is not a risk to them. They are offset with counterparties that are specific with legal agreements between them. Under U.S. GAAP, those would be excluded from the balance sheet. So, if you look at the BarCap balance sheet in 2008, which is important, because it's a big portion of the Barclays balance sheet. Adjusting during constant currency, so adjusting further decline in sterling, where a lot of our businesses another currencies and adjusting for the derivatives gross-up.</p>
          <p>In other words, reporting the same way a U.S. firm would, the balance sheet was down 15%. And I think that's the important thing, we did take down leverage, as Chris said, &#xA3;9.3 billion in legacy assets sold into the market and a 15% decline, if we use the extra derivatives gross up on a constant currency basis in the balance sheet. So, we do understand as we've talked about before that the business today is going to require more equity and less leverage and we expect to continue in this way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>One at a time, sure. The first is on actual capital within Barclays Capital, but on the trading book and how the regulators look at this. If there's one thing, I guess, that's coming out of this crisis, is the thing that's in the hair sights of the regulators. Is the way that capital is calculated in the trading books? And John, I think you alluded to it -- in your comments, John, the capital, the trading book, risk assets went from 40 to about 65 billion, which I assume from the way that Robert Le Blanc was talking is, the derivatives volatility coming out Lehman's. I was wondering, if you can comment on what the sort of likelihood of that number changing whether you've been in debate with the regulators. How much flexibility do you think there is around -- market risk number? Because clearly they seem to be talking as if a thing, that could be a multiple of where we have been historically?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes indeed. And you're absolutely right, the biggest growth in percentage terms in risk-weighted assets, how was the market risk and the numbers you've quoted. That is driven-off, as you know, the market risk DVaR numbers that we calculate. And Robert, exactly as you said, has have given a -- indication that the DVaR will stay because of the level of volatility in the time series calculation.</p>
          <p>We've heard the regulators as you have, say that they will be looking to alter via weightings and the area they are looking at is traded credit. So I think it flows to my mind that the level of risk-weighted assets in part of the trading book may increase. But in part of the trading book may actually remain relatively flat. And that's particularly the high volume, relatively liquid, easy to buy and sell assets. And it's no surprise that if you look at the asset categories that BarCap has been growing, it is in those, what I call flow businesses, which are much easier to manage and have a lower capital costs than some of the other asset categories.</p>

          <p>Well, it was a significant cost, and I think, the way I think of it and I think the way we think of it is we stood behind our clients. And I think what we feel terrific about is that as the markets recover clearly that stabilizes, and we would hope to get some of that back. But more importantly our competitive positioning in those businesses is stronger. And I think our clients recognize that a number of our competitors were a bit back and forth on this. And we're very consistent from the beginning. So it was a cost of business. I think the fact that notwithstanding that BGI produced just short of &#xA3;600 million in PBT shows the strength of the franchise, and we feel good about the decision.</p>

          <p>The last one is mainly for Frits. Just looking at the UK Commercial Bank business, it looks like lending was pretty flat over the second half, I mean pretty flat over the course of the year. I guess it's a very political hot potato about supporting the UK economy right now. And I just wonder if you'd comment on what you do in the cold phase where in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I will give you perhaps more than you asked for John-Paul. I know that the commitment of the UK banks to their customers has been subject. That has attracted plenty of comment in last few months. So it's great to have a chance to give you few hard facts. We actually increased lending in all areas of our UK businesses, in our UK Retail Bank, our Commercial Bank and in Barclaycard. In fact, our net asset growth was &#xA3;24 billion. We've supported both our personal and our corporate customers. And importantly, we have done this by extending credit and terms that are attractive both to them as well as to our bottom line.</p>
          <p>There has been no change to our conservative approach to risk. So let me do an overview of our UK Retail business. In 2008, Barclays loans to the UK consumer grew by more than 16% or &#xA3;15 billion. Key to this was an 18% growth in year-on-year mortgage balances. We were number one in mortgages with a 36% share of net lending. We've grown our book by more than &#xA3;12 billion and added 65,000 more mortgage customers. We had a 7% market share of total mortgages, at the end of December, only 156 properties and repossession including only nine buy-to-let.</p>
          <p>In Barclaycard, we continue to invest in the United Kingdom with an acquisition as well as successful integration of the Goldfish portfolio. As a result, Barclaycard's customer base has grown by 16% and 1.6 million UK customers hold the Barclaycard today than a year ago. And you can see that across Barclaycard, we're now reaping the benefits of our focus on credit quality. We've seen similar trends in the rest of our UK unsecured lending. So our consumer and risk profile remains healthy and well-positioned for 2009.</p>
          <p>Now going to Commercial business and I think John summarized the best, when he said, we've stayed close to our clients. We've to grow the lower risk, high quality portfolios &#x2013; or portions of our book. As a result, we've seen strong growth in net customer assets, which grew by nearly &#xA3;10 billion or 14%. The growth in our book is well spread. We've increased lending to social housing projects by over &#xA3;2 billion and extended support to businesses and turnaround. We increased lending to SME by further &#xA3;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look into 2009 and beyond, we believe that we're relatively well prepared for a time of sustained stress across the UK economy. We recognized we are not immune from it. We'll continue to invest in our businesses. And last month as part of our network refurbishment, we opened an all new state-of-the-art retail branch, Piccadilly Circus. We've built similar branches in other parts of the world, each designed to help our customers facilitate international transactions. I would urge all of you to go down to Piccadilly to understand our scale of ambition in this particular area.</p>
          <p>We'll continue obviously to lend prudently and provide our customers with support as well as new solutions in these, what I would characterize as, very difficult times. As an example, we have recently offered all of our UK retail customers a cost effective personal reserve buffer on top of existing overdraft limits. We've just announced that we'll reduce the rate of borrowing for 3 million UK cardholders and we introduced a broad range of other initiatives to help our customers.</p>
          <p>In the last year, our financial planners have helped our customers to provide a financial health check to over 250,000 customers. And we have committed to lend an additional 1.5 billion in '09 to our SME customers. We expect to increase our mortgage book again this year.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we have been, and will continue to be, a cautious and responsible lender. There will be no change to that approach. We will support our customers and increase lending where it is responsible to do so. So I hope I have answered your question.</p>

          <p>Firstly, I think you said that the Tier 1 leverage ratio you expect to fall to about 24 times on the convert. Clearly, as you've talked about, there is a lot of uncertainty around trading portfolios in terms of capital management and measurement. I was just wondering if you could give us some sort of target leverage ratio where you think Barclays would have to run in future. And also on capital, clearly, people are still questioning the adequacy of your capital position. To say, that you come &#x2013; going to come out and pay a dividend, I think is very punchy. Can you give us some idea about what metrics you are going to be looking at? I think you referred to core profitability in your presentation, John. And if you could give us any sort of ballparks there in terms of materiality of the dividend? That's the capital bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, with apologies, I'm not going to be very helpful on &#x2013; I can't be very helpful on either of these points really. On the leverage ratio, we're trying to give you a sense of &#x2013; the direction of travel. You can see that we've been working hard to bring the adjusted ratio down during the course of 2008, and it has come down. And what Chris said was that we expect it to fall further. We expect it to move to 24, 25 times, and that our intention through time is that it should fall lower still. So we are not actually creating an explicit target, we're telling you where we're headed.</p>
          <p>On the dividend, I mean I know that you want to understand the detail of it. What I've said is that we will talk about the detail of it at the Annual General Meeting. At the time we raised capital in the back end of last year, we did make a clear statement of commitment, which we would resume dividend payments during the course of 2009. Not paying the final dividend for 2008 was a big decision -something that hurt shareholders. And we have to be &#x2013; we have to acknowledge that fact and be very conscious of our obligation as a result of the performance in 2009, contrast to the obligation to recommence during the second half of the year. I assure you that at the AGM, we will give the appropriate detail.</p>

We pointed out they're on the liability side, you can see the sort of start of the impact on the liability margins, particularly in the base-linked book, which is predominantly in the retail side. What we can tell you is when we look at hedges and we have very significant product and strategic hedges against it, we reckon that we can mitigate about two-thirds of the overall impact over the next two, three years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. That's useful. And just the final point is that &#x2013; point of detail, I was wondering if you could let us know what the revenue and cost contribution of Lehman Brothers were in the BarCap for this year?</p>

          <p>So, you ask me how the integration was going. Let me give you a full answer. I am going to take a couple of minutes and I'll get as close to that as I can. If you can throw up the first of a couple of slides, 2008 was a year of seismic change. We saw at least three big buckets of change. Consolidation, we saw the disappearance of a number of standalone titans from Merrill Lynch to Bear Stearns to Lehman to here HBOS. There was significant restructuring in the financial services industry. And I think that restructuring was around the disappearance of the bulge bracket model. It was around the introduction of large government holdings.</p>
          <p>And I think importantly, we also saw retrenchment. And the retrenchment was particularly a number of very large financial institutions that pulled back from their commitment in investment banking and particularly, those large financial institutions that had large government shareholding. I think for us, the acquisition with Lehman Brothers stood out around three things. One, it was strategic. It was one of the four pillars that John has said, which is to continue to grow our global businesses. But it was also across border. And if you look at the list of transactions here or others because there are others, this is the only across border transaction. And this is also the only transaction that didn't have any government intervention to help a troubled institution. So it was really done privately and without government intervention.</p>
          <p>If we can look at what that means, it means that the transactions was unique, it was priced correctly in a very, very difficult market. It was aligned with our strategy. And the integration is now complete. And by doing that, we've dramatically changed the position of our investment banking and investment management businesses. It's not a small change, it's dramatic.</p>
          <p>If you can just flip the slide, what I have here on the slide is the six major asset classes that investment banks work in. This is really the extent of it, if you look at the top three of these asset classes in fixed income, in commodities, in currencies, then as we sit here today, we are in the top three players on a global basis in every region across all areas of those three businesses, that's a very strong position to be in.</p>
          <p>If you look at equities and prime services and M&amp;A, we have a credible plan to get there and that plan is now credible because of the combination of legacy Lehman and legacy BarCap, where we've taken different strengths from the organizations and put ourselves in a position, we can really be in the top Tier. But here is the rub and here is the question. I often talk about the opportunities we have in the business and people keep asking me tell me &#x2013; give me more specifics about why you can grow revenues, given how difficult the markets are as we look out. So I'm going to give you two examples of that within fixed income, but I'll also say that Jerry del Missier is here, Rich Ricci is here. The three of us will spend time with anyone after this to go through all of these asset classes.</p>
          <p>But let me give you an example. If we are going to grow revenues, then we have to make some comment about volumes in the market, our market share and spreads in the market. So within fixed income, think about government bonds, sovereigns, municipals, kind of a government sovereign area of that market. Well it's absolutely clear that volumes are going to grow substantially with the pressure on finances for government, sovereigns, and municipals.</p>
          <p>It's also clear that we've doubled our market share over the last 12 to 18 months in BarCap, partly because of the acquisition, partly it was happening anyway. We're number one in Germany, not number one foreign firm, number one in Germany. We're number two in of the seven of the 11 categories around governments and agencies in the US now, which is a big change. We're number two in France. We're number one right here in the UK. So if you look at this business, volumes are growing. Our market share has doubled and bid offer spreads are at least twice what they were historically.</p>
          <p>Think about Investment Grade Debt. Investment Grade Debt were number one in the world in bond issuance. In fact we're the only bank in the world that's top three in bond issuance in all major currencies. No other bank is even in the top five in all major currencies.</p>
          <p>We got from Lehman Brothers a world class secondary trading corporate bond business. And as we look at that business, volumes are growing. January was the strongest month in issuance since May 2008. Our market share is growing. We're involved in over 50% as a lead manager of the non-government issues in January &#x2013; in the stronger January. And the bid offer spreads are three to four times what we've ever seen in bid offer spreads for investment grade debt, not just primary but I'm talking about importantly, in the secondary market. And all of these businesses are using less balance sheet. They're being driven much more in a volume margin basis. So higher volumes in the market, better market share for BarCap, bigger bid offer spreads, less on the balance sheet; that's why I'm more confident, than I think many of my peers looking toward 2009.</p>
          <p>The poster child for this is Pfizer. We did a deal for Pfizer in January, which was the biggest deal of the year. There is no way that legacy BarCap would have been positioned on the advisory side, and not being on the advisory side might have impacted our ability to get the financing and risk management. And there's no way Lehman would have gotten the financing and risk management, they may have been on the advisory side, but the combined group was involved across the piece.</p>
          <p>You can just flip the slide just to very quickly &#x2013; in the turmoil of the markets of 2008, that's the market share. That's the client volume increase, full year '08 versus full year '07, in fixed income, in equities, which is the most substantive, but clearly a lower base, and in our currency businesses.</p>
          <p>If you look at the first quarter of 2007, the vintage quarter, there was never a better quarter in investment banking than Q1 '07 and compare it to Q4 '08, we're not going to tell you there was never a worse quarter in the history of investment banking. Our market share in interest rates and currencies doubled between Q1 '07 to Q4 '08. That's the client traction. That's staying close to your clients that we think is so important.</p>
          <p>So the deal was priced correctly, and I think, particularly given the market, the integration is complete. You wouldn't know the difference between Lehman and Barclays, if you walked into any of our offices in the United States, it's all operating as one group. We're in a stronger competitive position than we've been in. Our volumes up, our shares are up, our margins are up, balance sheet usage isn't this important. And John talked about the very strong January. It's getting harder and harder to identify what's Lehman legacy versus what's BarCap legacy, but we can still get pretty good line of sight. About a third of the revenues in a very strong January came from the legacy Lehman business.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The first one just on foreign exchange risk, because clearly the weakness in sterling affected your capital ratio by boosting RWAs, and I think also had an effect on the nominal balance sheet by the derivative gross-up. So, I just wondered if you could comment on what you are doing to hedge against any further significant weakness in sterling, and if you are, what that might actually cost on the P&amp;L basis?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We hedge at a number of different levels. The one that's most relevant to your question is the hedge that we have on capital ratios. And you can see we've set out what we hedge against dollars, euros and sterling and rand. And we do that at the capital ratio level rather than the risk-weighted asset level, because we do it by reference to the currency content of the investments and subsidiaries versus the risk-weighted assets. And we have about 60 or 70% dollars, 50% euros, 100% rand is the sort of level we've got. We are limited by how much more we can do it by the currency content to the investments we have. So we are at roughly the maximum we can hedge.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, when I look at the ratios and we pro forma-ed them from 6.5 to 6.7, where we came out and 9.5 to 9.7, the increase in those ratios was predominantly because of the hedging and the impact on the capital currency translation reserve. I think we've probably gone as far as we can.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to, I mean, I didn't really ask for the length of some of the answers, so I'd actually really like to ask both, if that's okay? I'll ask them quickly.</p>

          <p>I come here to be able to ask the questions I want to ask, and I waited half an hour to ask.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, we're very keen to help, I assure you and &#x2013; but there are a lot of other people in the room. And I think we should try and finish at 11.15.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The question I'll ask, and the one I won't ask about the derivative netting. The question I'll ask is about, whether you actually take part in the government's asset protection scheme going forward, which I think you have indicated you are fairly happy to do. What that will mean for you in terms of any constraints on your business, would you expect similar constraints that maybe Lloyds and RBS are going to face to be applied to you as a result of using the government scheme rather than taking capital directly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think what they've signaled as you know is two things. They have indicated that those who participate in the scheme will be required to make some explicit commitments about lending activity in the United Kingdom. Quite how that is calibrated to be determined, but the statement of requirement is clear. And the second point has been made is that there will be a &#x2013; they will have a standing &#x2013; a locus standi in decisions about compensation going forward. So those are the two explicit areas of conditionality that have been signaled without either being at the moment precisely identifiable.</p>
          <p>Our position as I think you know from what we've said in public up to this point is that we will continue the dialog that we have going with them at the moment. And we will form a judgment over the course to coming weeks as to whether it makes economic sense for us to be using the insurance scheme. I use the word economic sense advisedly, because it will be an economic decision. That's how it should be.</p>
          <p>You'll remember that when they published the stated intent on the 19th of January, what they said at that time was that, it would take them until the end of February to have concluded all the terms and conditions. And it seems to me that that was a realistic assessment of likely outturn. So, just to summarize, we are in dialog at the moment. We've not made our mind up. Of course, when we come to make our mind up, we need to take account of all the various terms and conditions that they would apply, most particularly of importance to us is the pricing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well the &#x2013; I was going to say, can we pretend that I asked a question that Chris Lucas desperately wants to answer. It's kind of a half question. And then as the second part of the other question, the &#x2013; Robert, you had mentioned the underlying assumptions on a lot of the provisioning, forecast expectations that you have, what's the assumption in terms of CPI or general inflation environment? And the reason I'm asking that is really if we do approach the nine, 10% unemployment levels in the US and the UK, and the combined say deflationary risk in several of the major economies, would that cause you to revise expectations in terms of impairments upwards?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, generally if we saw and you'll remember and you may have noted some of the assumptions we made about the '09 economies. If we saw those change dramatically, I think more particularly around unemployment, probably is the biggest area of vulnerability, then our planning assumptions. What we gave you is -- was our planning assumptions rather than a forecast as you know. Then of course they would change. CPI would play a factor in that, but more directly, I think, it's going to be around the rates of &#x2013; the rate of de-leveraging we see in the market. Some asset price declines, but the unemployment as the bigger variable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Peter Toeman from HSBC. Just coming back to the question of interest rates and how that might impact on the liability margins. I mean the retail bank and the commercial bank have 150 billion of deposits. If I seemed 1% decline in rates below a sort of particular flow that will suggest 1% movement impacts revenues by 1.5 billion. And you're telling us that you can offset two-thirds of that and therefore the net cost to you is about 500 million, 1% movement in rates. Is that sort of flawed thinking or does that get somewhere near the right answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what we've tried to do is to give you both a sense of direction and also an aggregate view of the impact of the hedge. I know what you're wanting to do is to take that down to the next level of detail and ask us to comment on, and I think then we start getting into the area of forecasting what our liability income is going to look like during the course of 2009. And for reasons you'll understand we are reluctant to do that. I'll just ask Chris whether there's anything he wants to add to what he said earlier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. It's Leigh Goodwin, Fox-Pitt Kelton. I'll just ask the one question then. I just wanted to understand the movements in capital. On slide 13, it's just that there's 4.4 billion increase shown against the convertibles and warrants. My understanding was that you're saying just over four billion of convertibles. Does this mean that &#x2013; is it just to do with exchange rate movements or is it &#x2013; has there been some take-off of the warrants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's been, because of the accounting we use for the warrants, you take those in at fair value at the time that you issue them and that's the balance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, the floor is yours, because there is no other hand in the air.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I knew you wanted me to ask. The second question was just on the sort of the counterparty netting, I mean Bob in his answer, I think, gave very much the sort of statement that that part of it that's netted wouldn't even be on the balance sheet. Therefore, I imagine there is a zero percent risk-weighting attached, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I was going to ask, when I look at the net position, is actually quite a big increase as well from about 49 billion to 122, is there anything we should be thinking about there? Why has the net position gone up so much?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, net of what you call counterparty netting, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'll find that there is just a growing level of revaluation, and even when you net down and you take accounts of collateral, that the overall balances are still increasing and you're absolutely right. The key thing from our perspective is to make sure that we have proper right of off-set and good collateral management because that's how we manage the risk.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have time for one last question if there is one. Sandy, did you want to ask your second question. Here comes the microphone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually yes, well it's a choice, okay.</p>

          <p>Would you mind just giving us one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. Relating to the &#x2013; actually following on Tom's point actually, in terms of the netting, there was also a significant increase in the collateral part of that. Is there any double counting involved in that? And what's the structure of the actual counterparty netting calculation? Is that done at a group level? And the reason, I'm asking that is really to get a sense of &#x2013; if there is another major counterparty failure, could that have an effect on -- in effect moving out from the netting position into that into the gross positions on the derivatives exposures?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is theoretically they could be, if you do not have well-executed netting agreements with the right counterparties, and importantly, if you do not get the collateral, so if I think back of the history of the last six months, what has really been important is to be able to deliver that collateral and make sure you get it. The increase in collateral balances is representing the level of collateral we take from the growing mark-to-market gains and losses we have on both sides.</p>

      </speaker>
