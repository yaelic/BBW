          <p>Okay. I think we can start. So, good afternoon to all of you. Thank you for coming to AXA's Presentation of Half-Year 2010 Earnings. Presenting today will be Henri de Castries, Chairman and CEO; Denis Duverne, Deputy CEO; and G&#xE9;rald Harlin, Group Chief Financial Officer. A Q&amp;A session will then follow the presentation.</p>
          <p>Henri, I'll leave you the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mattieu, for this long introduction. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'll try to be brief too.</p>
          <p>What can we say about this half-year earnings? I would say solid earnings, disciplined management actions, strong balance sheet. You will see that revenues are modestly up, but that this is reflecting very different evolutions reflecting management actions. Earnings, underlying earnings are stable. Adjusted earnings are up nearly 30%. Net income is down when, compared with the first half last year, but after the 1.5 billion impact of the U.K. transaction, if you take that out, it will have been up very, very significantly. As far as the balance sheet is concerned, the solvency is a strong one and is back to the levels we had before the crisis.</p>
          <p>So if I go into slightly more details before Denis goes into much more details, why did I say disciplined growth? Well, the fact that the revenues are growing by approximately 1% doesn't mean that it's growing by approximately 1% everywhere. It's a contrasted picture. They are up 1.5% in Life. The margins are up 2 points. And when you look at the next slide, you will see that they are decreasing in the U.S. and in France, increasing strongly in Southeast Asia and in some countries like Italy because of the Bancassurance agreement we have.</p>
          <p>This does not mean that we are unsuccessful in the U.S. The new variable annuity product Retirement Cornerstone is developing well, but by comparison with last year it's slower. In France the revenues are lower because the growth is more disciplined; we do not underwrite large contracts which have too low margins.</p>
          <p>If you look at P&amp;C, revenues are up 0.4%. There too there is a contrast between the retail lines where the revenues are up 4% and the commercial lines where the revenues are down because we are more selective. More interestingly, it's a disciplined growth because we have been doing what we told you we would do. The current year combined ratio is improving by 1.5 points despite a significant level of natural events. This is a reflection of the pricing actions we've been taking in the different markets.</p>
          <p>So this slide is very much reflecting what I said on personal lines versus commercial lines and on U.S./French life market versus the Asian markets. So, this, I would say, limited growth for the revenues is the reflection of very strong management actions to look for growth in the areas where you have significant margins and be more disciplined in other places.</p>
          <p>The earnings, underlying earnings are pretty stable. Adjusted earnings are up 30% because we have less impairment, you will see that later, and we are coming back to more normalized levels in terms of capital gains.</p>
          <p>Net income, I've already mentioned that. It's down when, compared with the first half last year, but it's down because of the 1.5 hit we have taken due to the U.K. transaction, which is a good transaction because it's creating flexibility for us and it's enabling us to leave a segment of the market which we were seeing as non-strategic, to reposition ourselves in something which we see as having good growth prospects. It means that the group is having an active capital management, which is I think what we need to have in this environment. When the multiples are low, the multiples at which you are traded are low, the best way to grow the group is of course, to try to do as much as you can organically, but it's also to redeploy capital, to redeploy existing capital, taking it out from the places where the profitability is sub-par to realign, reposition it in places where you have more growth and more margins. This is what we are doing. Of course, this does not mean that we have been leaving the U.K. market. On the contrary. I think that thanks to the work which has been done in the past years we are now very well-positioned on the wealth management side.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet. Solvency is up to pre-crisis level if you measure it with Solvency I. If you look at the debt gearing, it's up when, compared to the first half last year, but largely because of foreign exchange impact, and the 29% is before the impact of the U.K. transaction &#x2013; Denis will come back to the detail of the numbers, but it's a level we are comfortable with.</p>
          <p>So this is where we are in a nutshell. I will leave Denis go into the detail of the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I will share this presentation with G&#xE9;rald Harlin and first start with the first theme that Henri articulated on disciplined growth. As you must have seen, our growth has been modest in the first half. Asset management grew by 10% because of the recovery in the markets plus the dollar effect, but for the rest, our revenues were flat on the comparable basis and at 3% on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>When you look at the Life &amp; Savings side, you see that our APE was also just up 1%, NBV up 21% with a margin which reached 19.1%. And, again, this is a contrasted picture with U.S. down, but sequentially up quarter-on-quarter by about 10%. We see &#x2013; and I will comment further on the U.S., France down for reasons I will elaborate upon a bit later. And also, Japan, which is here mixed in the Asia-Pacific number, Japan down because the withdrawal of a cancer product, which was coming from Vita II 7:24 and was not profitable.</p>
          <p>We see a quite strong growth in Mediterranean, Latin American region, essentially because of the growth of the AXA-MPS JV, which was up 64% in APE terms. And we also had high growth in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>We'd like to go a little bit deeper into our Life &amp; Savings business, and we'll spend more time on that at our autumn seminar hopefully. When you look at the APE, you see that the APE is made of investment and savings for 55%. When you look at NBV, NBV is dominated by Protection and Health; Protection and Health represent 68% of our new business value and this is reflected at the bottom of the slide with NBV margins, which is around 40% for Protection and Health versus 10% for Investment &amp; Savings. So, clearly, we have strong profitability in Protection and Health and much lower profitability in Investment &amp; Savings, which is not a surprise in a low interest rate environment, but also a topic that we must address going forward.</p>
          <p>Going back to the U.S., you see that we've had a quarter-on-quarter since Q3 2009 a 9% compound growth. We believe that our market share is slightly up in Q2, and more importantly, the product that we launched in January in our proprietary networks and March, April in our third-party networks, the Retirement Cornerstone, which is a product, which is higher in terms of new business value margin and lower in terms of capital intensity, is progressing. Retirement Cornerstone represented 16% of our first year premiums in Q1 and 42% of our first year premiums in Q2.</p>
          <p>We launched another annuity product, Protected Capital Strategies, in &#x2013; we are launching in the second half of this year which will also be a higher margin, lower capital consumption product. So, we are continuing to innovate on a product front to protect our margins and hopefully stabilize or slightly improve our market share.</p>
          <p>In France, which is also a country where our margins on Life, especially on the savings side, are low. We have decided to stop competing in the low margin Family Office business where we have high guaranteed rates. The regulation will be helping us later this year; as at the start of this month we have a maximum &#x2013; in the regulation maximum interest rate guarantees for the first two years of the contracts.</p>
          <p>But if you take out those large premium individual life business, we see a progression and we also see a progression of the proportion of unit-linked business, which you can see on the right side of the slide. We have 16% of unit-linked in our business versus 13% for the market at the end of Q2, and this translated to a 12% new business value margin for individual lines in France. Again, focus on profitability rather than volumes.</p>
          <p>P&amp;C, same story. We had to increase our prices and be more selective in terms of our renewals in P&amp;C. On personal lines we have been successful in translating those price increases into volume increases because we are relying more on our proprietary networks and the strength of our brands. And all in all, you see that we have been able to have 3.6% volume growth on the back of 3% price increase, and this is also more than 700,000 net new contracts, additional net new contracts on the personal line side.</p>
          <p>Commercial lines, we have passed on price increases, 1.6%, but this has led to a revenue decline of 3.6% because we are relying more on brokers. Also because with the recession, the exposures have declined. But we are better this way, and because we have been selective on the underwriting by not renewing certain commercial business in certain countries where we were not profitable. But we are happy to have this pattern because this is good for our future profitability.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the earnings &#x2013; sorry, maybe one step back. On this slide you see that the two countries where the price increases are not happening are Switzerland and to some extent Germany. In Switzerland we have a combined ratio of 88.7%, so it's not too worrying. Germany, our combined ratio is at 101, so this is little bit worrying and this is something that we will be considering to monitor.</p>
          <p>Moving to the earnings picture, underlying earnings down 3% on a comparable basis. Again, a contrasted picture between Life &amp; Savings up 6%, P&amp;C down 9.</p>
          <p>Maybe a word on International Insurance which went up 17%. We had a good performance of AXA Corporate Solutions, our largest business, which ended the half year with a combined ratio of 96.6%. So, this is good in a current pricing environment. And I will now move to commence the Life &amp; Savings side.</p>
          <p>On the Life &amp; Savings side where earnings were up 6%, we have, again, a contrast between investment margins that are up 21% and fees and revenues up 9%, but technical margin down 54%. I will comment each of those individually. I'm on page 22.</p>
          <p>On the investment margin side, we have seen a recovery of our investment margin to 77 basis points. If I take a slightly longer time horizon, in 2008 for the full year our investment margin was 80 basis points, 2009 for the full year it was 68 basis points. It's now back at 77. We believe that we are capable of maintaining an investment margin at that level in this type of environment.</p>
          <p>As we have told you, our investment income was down 10 basis points versus last year because we are reinvested at a slightly lower rate, but we were able to also slightly reduce our crediting rates. On the right-hand of the slide we give you an illustration of the current situation and trying to project it for the rest of the decade.</p>
          <p>Today we are earning 4%. The guaranteed rate on our portfolio is 2.5. We are effectively paying more than this because we have, as I just said, 77 basis points of margin. If we were to reinvest at 3.5% for the next 10 years, our earned rate will be 3.5%. At that point in time, because the new business has lower guarantees or no guarantees, our average guaranteed rate will be 1.9%. So, the spread between the two is roughly a constant. So, we are relatively optimistic that we will be able to maintain our investment margin even in a relatively low interest rate environment. This is &#x2013; I mean, you can make your own determination of whether 3.5% is conservative or not, but taking this as an assumption we believe is a realistic assumption at this stage.</p>
          <p>Technical margin was the bad news of this first half. There are two elements in this decline of 54%. First, we had a one-off gain last year on the restructuring of our annuity portfolio in the U.K. And we had high level of surrenders with surrender penalties in Japan. That's the first half of the story. Second half of the story is hedging of VAs in the U.S. Last year we had one-off positive on interest rate hedging. This year we have suffered in the first half from high volatility and high credit spreads which meant that we had a loss on our hedging program in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Moving to P&amp;C. Our P&amp;C earnings were down 9%. There is good news and bad news here. The good news is that we have improved our current year combined ratio by 1.5 points. This was slightly more than offset by lower prior year reserve development which moved from 8.2% to 6.5%, translating into a combined ratio, which is slightly higher.</p>
          <p>Our expense ratio was stable. We had significantly lower investment income which explains substantial part of the decline in earnings.</p>
          <p>We tried to give you a 10 year perspective on the prior year reserve developments, and you can see that we've passed the peak of positive developments on prior year, which is normal and we had told you that this would be the case in the current phase of the cycle. We have passed the trough of the cycle, we believe, and we are now in a rising pricing environment, so we would expect the prior year reserve development levels to continue to come down.</p>
          <p>You can also see on the bottom of the slide that we have been able to maintain our reserving ratio, as measured by technical reserve divided by earned premiums, around between 190 and 200% throughout the period, and we have not weakened our reserving position in the recent period.</p>
          <p>Asset Management, earnings were down, but when you analyze those earnings, the reality is that pre-tax those earnings were significantly up with revenues up 10% and expenses up only 5%. We had a one-off tax positive at AllianceBernstein last year, which was not repeated, hence, the decline of the earnings.</p>
          <p>If we focus on what happened on the outflows in our asset managers, first on the left side at AllianceBernstein we had decreasing net outflows from 33 billion in the first half of '09 to &#x20AC;8 billion in the first half of '010 with Retail turning positive, Private Clients breakeven, and Institutional still with net outflows. We have, I would say, a good momentum at AllianceBernstein in terms of gross inflows, as illustrated in the release that AllianceBernstein made just a few days ago.</p>
          <p>At AXA I'm, we had significant outflows of 17 billion in the first half. More than the totality of the outflows of AXA IM were coming from AXA Rosenberg with 15 billion just in the second quarter. We have changed management, and the organization at AXA Rosenberg. We took in the holding segment a 64 million net provision related to potential losses arising from the coding error that was discovered in the first half of this year. This was booked at the parent company level. We have taken our best estimates of the net cost for the company. We are continuing to analyze the impact on the client accounts, and we hope that we will able to put this story behind us in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings for the half year went up 29%. This is both because of a decline in the impairments, and an increase in the capital gains. Net, our capital gains were &#x20AC;200 million, which is in line with our medium-term &#x2013; I would say medium-term guidance. We have said that we would be able generate between 300 million and &#x20AC;500 million of capital gains per year. We generated 200 million in the first half. We had a much lower level of impairments, both on equities and on the fixed income securities.</p>
          <p>Net income was down 28%, or up 81% excluding the U.K. loss. We had a slight benefit from alternative assets from the improvements of the situation of the alternative assets, a negative impact from the spread widening, a positive impact from the equity derivatives program in the U.S., and a big negative from the loss of the sale of part of our legacy Life operations to Resolution.</p>
          <p>I will hand over now to G&#xE9;rald for the balance sheet. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Let's now move to the balance sheet and starting with the Solvency I ratio. You can notice that during the first half it improved from 171 to 188 with two main components; first, the underlying earnings contribution, and second, the market effects with two big components. The first one being the positive impact from interest rates net of the equity decline, and net of the widening of the spreads, representing plus 18 points and at minus 10 corresponding to the FX effect.</p>
          <p>Next, the shareholders' equity. The shareholders' equity over the period increased by 2.4 billion. And the main elements are presented on the right-hand side starting with the net income for the period, 0.9. The variation of unrealized capital gains, and you can see on the left-hand side, bottom left the balance sheet net unrealized capital gains, and you will notice that the equities went down by &#x2013; equity realized gain went down by 0.4, whereas interest rates increased by 0.16, net 1.2.</p>
          <p>So ForEx movement net of hedging, it's 2.1, and then you have the depreciable debt that correspond to the interest for the period on the perpetual debt, 0.2 billion. Then the pension deficit coming mostly from the declining interest rates in the U.K., as well as in the U.S., it's minus 0.5. And the dividend that was paid, minus 1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Last, you can see just on the left-hand side on the bottom of the slide the off-balance sheet net unrealized gain, which went up slightly from 2.6 to 2.9, and we have a slight appreciation of our real estate assets.</p>
          <p>Next the interest &#x2013; the debt. During the period, the debt went up from 13.5 to 16.1. So, the 2.6 increase impact has two components, the first one corresponding to the FX, to the effect of the decline of the euro; as you know, we have debts denominated in foreign currencies, and that the impact 1.3. The second part corresponding to the Tier 2 sub debt that we raised here in April and which have been used in order to pay the collateral on FX derivatives.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side you can notice that the debt ratio improved; that's a positive effect on the 29% improvement of our adjusted earnings, the interest cover moving up from 7.9 times to 9.3. The debt gearing's at 29%, but if we include the &#x20AC;1.7 of expected cash from the U.K. transaction, Life transaction, then we will move down to 27. And if we update this level at the present level of the foreign exchange rates, it would be down to 26.</p>
          <p>The general account invested assets, you notice that the assets moved up from 403 to &#x20AC;446 billion. This 43 billion increase is due to the foreign exchange for plus 15, the market effect plus seven, and the other elements being the operating cash flow, as well as the investment income.</p>
          <p>You can notice that the fixed income percent, the assets invested in fixed income remain at 81% with govies representing 40 and corporate bonds 35. We slightly increased the investment in net down active investment, that's the private equity and hedge funds. You can notice that the estimated government bonds exposure for the Southern European countries didn't move since our last update.</p>
          <p>Then we wanted to make a presentation based on the reported EV, so what's the Life &amp; Savings normalized underlying capital generation. It's a normalized presentation and you can see that starting first with Life, we can expect in the first half of '010 to have a fee surplus, a Life fee surplus between 0.4 and 0.5. It doesn't take into account the positive effect of the U.K. business that has been disposed because it was a capital-intense business. And this compares to the previous year between 0.8 billion and 1 billion.</p>
          <p>When adding the other business lines, first P&amp;C. P&amp;C, it's a contribution of 1.1, including the international business, and then we have the asset management at 0.1 and the change in local solvency requirement for P&amp;C and the asset management are quite small, below 0.1. So, as a whole it's for the first half between 0.5 and 0.6 of the free cash flow, which with the holding underlying earnings at minus 0.4 and the interest charge on perpetual debt at minus 0.2, which makes between 1 and 1.1, compared with 2 in '09 and in '08 a 3.2.</p>
          <p>So that's the first approach. Again, I mentioned that it was a normalized underlying cash generation. And there will be more to come at the next IR day in November and we will present you how we intend to improve our cash generation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rald. So, as a conclusion, I think the model is simple. Once more, for this first half the business model has proven its resilience. You've seen that in the earnings. What do we intend to do going forward? More of the same. If you look at that, we have tried to characterize what we want to do, it's try to redeploy capital and accelerate growth on Life &amp; Savings side and on Property &amp; Casualty on the segments, which are generating significant margins and volume growth, which means if you look at Life &amp; Savings, Protection and Health, Unit-linked, more than general account and savings products. By geography, high growth markets, not only Asia, but also the Med region, Central and Eastern Europe, possibly Latin America, less the more major countries like France or the U.S.</p>
          <p>On the Property &amp; Casualty side, margin enhancement on the retail lines and on commercial lines, knowing that it's going to be easier to grow the volumes on individual because there the strengths of the brand is really attractive and we have been able, as you've seen, during the first half to increase the portfolios by approximately 700,000 clients despite the price increases. In commercial lines, you know it's now difficult.</p>
          <p>So that's where we are. And we are now ready to take you questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes? Yeah, I think there is a mic, which is on its way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. I've got a question on slide 22 on the investment margins. I'm slightly confused by that slide because my understanding was that a large proportion of your investment margin comes from a percentage participation in profits. So, if yields are going down, then by definition the percentage share of your profit must go down unless you actually change that ratio of participation. So, could you just explain that?</p>
          <p>And then second related question is when you show the sort of guaranteed rates &#x2013; when you show guaranteed rates going down, how much of that is active reduction and how much of it is just the portfolio effect of new business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On your first question relative to the investment margin, in fact, the investment margin are increasing in two countries, compared with the first half; it's first France and second, Switzerland. As far as France is concerned, yes, we have a participation rate, but last year we didn't get the full effect of our margin, so that means that last year roughly speaking in France we had an 18 basis points margin where we can get 100 basis points margin. So, on the income side in France we decreased only slightly by even less than 10 basis points of investment return, and at the same time, due to our disciplined distribution and crediting rate, we can take and we consider that this rate this year we will benefit from the full margin. In Switzerland it's the same case.</p>
          <p>On the second part of your question, which is the guaranteed rates, so this, the right part of this slide number 22 takes into account the guaranteed rates that we have in different countries and it's the run-off of the existing guaranteed rates plus the new business. And as you know, over the last years we have been very active in limiting the guaranteed rates, so that means that the significant part of the new general account business that we are selling don't have any guaranteed rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a pure portfolio effect. And this is &#x2013; I mean, the bottom part of this slide we've been probably showing since 2005. At that time we were at 3% and we had said it would move gradually to 2.5 and to 2 and we are just reproducing this. We are in line with our plan. Our new business is mostly without guarantees or with a 0% guarantee, therefore, it's a pure portfolio effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear on part 1 of your answer, you were basically effectively paying out a larger participation than your statutory ratio. Let's say, you have to &#x2013; let's say in a country you have to 80% of your profit, and now you paid 85 and now you've reduced that back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are you now at the limit? Are you now close to...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick Holmes at Nomura. I had a couple of questions. First one is a strategic question. Looking at the way that you're changing the shape of the group, I wondered can you give us a sort of indication of what geographic mix you would ideally like to have, say, in three years' time? I mean, it's a difficult question, I know, to answer. And the areas that you're looking to expand in are obviously the growth markets, but what is the sort of percentage of growth versus, say, the more mature markets that you would look to have, say, in three years' time?</p>
          <p>And as a follow-on to that question, where are the areas that look to you to be perhaps a little more susceptible to potential disposal? I mean, the U.K., Australia are areas that you are or have disposal, and just wondered if you could share your views on that.</p>
          <p>Then second question is perhaps a little bit more simple and is for Kevin, which is how sustainable do you think the recovery in the variable annuity sales is that we've seen in Q2. And in ranking terms, I mean, your ranking in VA slipped to number 6 I think in 09, and I wondered if you could sort of share thoughts about what kind of level of ranking you might be targeting this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first part of the question, Nick, we are pragmatic people, so there is no magic number in terms of spread of the business mix geographically. But the trends are clear. It's not that we don't want to grow in developed countries. I mean, if you look at the world going forward, 80% of the new growth or new value is going to be in developed countries.</p>
          <p>So we still have to be there, but the pace at which it's going and emerging is faster. So, we want to accelerate in emerging. We want also to accelerate some product lines even in developed, and this was the very last slide I showed you. We think we have a significant room for growth in Protection, in Health, possibly in long-term care if the reforms are structured the way we want to see them structured. And if you look at the numbers for the first half, you will see that Protection has been growing at approximately between 8 and 10% overall, which is the strong growth number with very good margins and we think that this is something we should do more of even in developed countries.</p>
          <p>As far as the emerging countries are concerned, it's Asia, it's Central and Eastern Europe, it's some countries in the Med region and possibly South America, or Latin America. There, in terms of business mix, there is a difference, depending on if you look at the existing business, so if you look at the new business, look at the new business value, a very significant proportion of the new business value in Life is already coming from emerging countries, or from new countries. But we will live for a number of years with the legacy portfolios of the developed ones.</p>
          <p>Where are the places where we would be ready to do less and how can we do less? You can do less not only by selling. You can do less by reducing the amount of business you write. Look at what we've been doing as an example in France for the first half. The fact that we did not underwrite large policies which had low margins has an impact on the growth of revenues in the French market. But it's a way to redeploy capital because you don't have to, by definition, to immobilize the capital you would have had to put in front of these policies. It's freeing up capital which we can redeploy in other markets. So, you do not necessarily need to sell, you just can stop underwriting in certain places and put the focus on other business lines or other geographies.</p>
          <p>So the tendency should be more growth in retail lines, in Protection, in Health and in emerging countries, less growth in saturated markets and pragmatic disposals or reductions in underwriting where needed. To give you very precise splits between the various business lines, I wouldn't go there, because I think it's something where we have to stay very flexible. Is this...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's great. You haven't mentioned variable annuities in Europe or Asia. I wonder if that is a core product for you still.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It remains a very interesting product for the long run. I think what we all have in mind is the fact that the savings component of the Life business is in a difficult spot these days because you have low long-term interest rates, high volatility and equity markets going nowhere, so this is making the savings component of the Life business difficult. It's probably not going to last forever even if it can last for some time. We think that long term, the variable annuities have not lost their attraction, you just have to structure them differently. And from that standpoint, if you look at what has been done with the Retirement Cornerstone, we think it's pretty successful. So, the sales are growing.</p>
          <p>If you look at the proprietary network, which we are controlling well, and Kevin will elaborate on that, but Cornerstone is representing a growing proportion of the sales, is well accepted and is profitable. So, don't throw the baby out with the bath. Variable annuities have shown weaknesses in the turmoil because of the tail risks and because of the volatility, doesn't mean that the product is a bad product for the future, could be a very good product if repriced and in slightly different economic circumstances.</p>
          <p>Kevin, do you want to answer on -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you'll see from us in the second quarter, as Denis said, we will not pick up tremendous amount of market share; we do expect we're picking up some market share. And we do expect to continue sort of this steady growth. We're not looking to be number one or number two or number three. Our products are well priced when we're looking at delivering on the margins as opposed to being the most aggressive product in the markets. So, the Retirement Cornerstone is rolling out pretty much as expected. And remember, we just introduced it in the wholesale or third-party channel in the second quarter and the sales are &#x2013; the introduction into those channels is occurring and gaining momentum.</p>
          <p>So we're pleased with where we are, but don't expect that we're going to slide to a number one, two or three in the next quarters.</p>

          <p>It's a very mixed market in the VA world. You'll have some companies that have gained a lot of market share over the last year and have pretty much locked onto the top three positions or so. And then you have other companies who have decided to either not play in the market or at a significant reduction. We ended up the first quarter and the end of last year in about five or sixth place in the market, which is let's say comfortable, and I think we will remain in that space because I don't see us overtaking the top three any time soon.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Henri. A question on slide 33 about your debt and leverage please maybe for G&#xE9;rald. If my back-of-the-envelope calculations are right, your debt gearing goes from 29 to 27 then you complete the U.K. transaction, then you use the proceeds of the new lower Tier 2 to pay down the 1.3 and then presumably we get close to 25% just sort of round numbers. Now, the question then really is are you happy in the future for that to go back up to 35, and considering you've probably been the most proactive in terms of issuing debt you assume will work under Solvency II, where do you see the future range of the debt gearing once Solvency II eventually comes into play, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What I told you is that we were presently in fact, at 29, right? Taking into account the 1.6 billion, we would be back to 27. What I said is that taking into account today's FX rate, since a significant part of our debt is denominated in foreign currency, we would back to 26. But at the same time, we can consider that being at a level, which is below 30 or around 30 is the right level.</p>

          <p>Oliver Steel at Deutsche Bank. Just one question on the acquisition expenses on the Life side which seem to have fallen back quite sharply and against the trend of new business. So, I'm just wondering what's happening there. Is that something to do with the more selective new business targeting that you've got, and is it a sustainable number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The acquisition expenses went down quite significantly due to the stack. It means that as you noticed and as explained by Denis, the technical margin in the U.S. went down quite significantly and some of the &#x2013; and mostly coming from the U.S. from the GMxB margin, and one part of it is offset by deferred acquisition cost. So, we have a negative impact &#x2013; so a positive impact in terms of positive contribution to earnings coming from the GMxB.</p>

          <p>Marc Thiele, UBS. One question on this Australia situation. Can you provide us with a timeframe how long you wait for NAB to sort this out with the regulator before you move on elsewhere or think about alternatives?</p>
          <p>The second question is how much of the U.K. business that you are about to dispose, how much earnings have been contributed into these underlying earnings numbers, so we can adjust our model for that?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, I think in the past you mentioned a normal tax rate of 25 to 26%. Is that still a good number to work with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first question. The Australian deal, we are like the Catholic Church. We are ready to endure a lot of pain to go to paradise and we have the eternity for us. No, seriously. As you know, it's a discussion between the ACCC and NAB to see if NAB can satisfy some of the &#x2013; or deal with some of the objections which have been put forward by the ACCC. They've been discussing now for weeks. We have the feeling that it's getting close to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>If the ACCC finds that the undertakings made by NAB are acceptable, they will consult the market before making their final decision. There is no precise timetable at this stage. We hope to see some evolution in the coming weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add one point. Since this is the deal that has been recommended by the independent Directors of AXA APH, as long as we are in that position, this is our best way forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in the interest of the shareholders and in our interest to at this stage see this thing going on. And as I told you before, I think if you look &#x2013; I mean, of course, it's frustrating, but if you look at the numbers you will see that the Southeast Asian operations have been performing well in the first half, which is to a certain extent the justification of the strategic choice we've made. It's worse to be patient if at the end of the day you can come to the conclusion you want to see.</p>
          <p>G&#xE9;rald, do you want to take the question on the &#x2013; G&#xE9;rald on the U.K., the contribution to the earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the U.K., the total contribution of U.K. to the earnings as you can see in the MD&amp;A is &#x20AC;119 million in the first half and the retained business is a loss of 48 and the sold business is a profit of 167. For sure as far as the NBV is concerned it's exactly the reverse in terms of proportion, because out of 56 NBV for the period, the retained business represents 41%, so a significant &#x2013; a vast majority of this NBV. In million, million. Yes, million euros.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, tax rates. Yes, it's a good question, because, in reality, we are using &#x2013; we have always published our figures on a post-tax basis and this is how we show a 3% decline in our underlying earnings. In reality, on a pre-tax basis both on underlying and on net income we have a growth in half year '010 versus '09, which means that the totality of our deterioration of performance between '09 and '010 is due to an increased tax rate. We had large one-offs last year. We have much lower one-offs positives this year, but I still believe that 25 to 26 is a good guidance medium-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Andrew maybe and then Bob, or Bob and Andrew, as you like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob Yeats at Macquarie. Two questions, one on the savings side. You've demonstrated I think that you think you can maintain margins on an IFRS basis on the overall life book in current conditions. Can you improve new business margins on your savings product globally from the 10% that you're showing? And what does the 10% correspond to roughly in terms of IRR? That's one question.</p>
          <p>The second is, on the reserve run-off in P&amp;C it's been over a wide range over the years, but what are you pricing for and reserving for and what do you think it will decline to and settle at in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On savings you are touching a sore point, a very good point. We are not happy with our margins on the savings side and we are not happy with our internal rate of return on the savings side. This is largely because we are &#x2013; I mean, we have not been used to such a low interest rate environment and we are closer to the guaranteed levels, therefore, we definitely need to rethink the way we write savings products going forwards.</p>
          <p>We believe that a part of the answer, as Henri said before, is variable annuities. We had negative surprises in '08 on our VAs, but we have repriced our VAs in a way such that we believe that it is possible to write profitable variable annuities in the current interest rate environment, and we have an acceptable margin and acceptable IR overall on our VA portfolio right now.</p>
          <p>We believe another part of the answer is an increasing proportion of unit-linked business. And in France, as we indicated, we have done two things. We have differentiated our commission ratios to our distributors, increasing commissions for a higher unit-linked proportion and we have started also to differentiate crediting rates for customers that take a part of their &#x2013; I mean, that subscribe to products that have a higher proportion of unit-linked business, because on pure general accounts savings business we believe that we cannot in a current interest rate environment have an acceptable internal rate of return and the new business value margin. So, those are two of the key elements for this savings solution. G&#xE9;rald, any other thoughts on savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked about the level of the internal rate of return. Just refer to the EV report at the end of last year and you will notice that in France, for example, where a significant part of this products are savings products, the average internal rate of return is 9%. So, we can expect that for &#x2013; as Denis said, for general account products we are, let's say, between 5 and 10, and for protection products we are more at 15.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is very much cycle dependent on P&amp;C. We believe that &#x2013; I mean, in the way we look at it right now, an average rate should be of the order of 4%, but we expect to talk to you more about this at our autumn seminar in November. But 4% would be probably a good number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you look at this chart, I think it's interesting because you will see that the reserving ratio has remained stable, which is a very clear illustration of the fact that we have impoverished the company by releasing too much. I mean, the reserving remains a very strong one. We are benefiting from the fact that we have been very, very cautious in the good years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now we have &#x2013; I mean, in '010 we have not weakened our reserving position, that's absolutely clear. Are we happy with the current level of prices and our current level of combined ratio? Clearly not. We show you a current year combined ratio, which is pessimistic of 104.6 because we are reserving conservatively in this 104.6. But if we look at our economic combined ratio, it's still above 100%, which means that we are making an underwriting loss on new business, and we are not happy with that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's Andrew Crean at Autonomous Research. Three questions. Firstly, will you be publishing QIS5 numbers when you've got them, as you did with QIS4, to give us some view of economic capital going forward?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you tend &#x2013; from your new capital generation disclosure, you tend to reinvest around about three-quarters of your back book cash flows in new business on what are relatively modest IRRs, particularly on the Savings side. Do you have an intention to try and limit the amount of new business that you write and be more disciplined about the IRRs you get so that more of the cash from the back books leaks down to the shareholders?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, could you talk a little bit about guaranteed annuity options? I know guarantees scare people, but it's the annuity options where it's more difficult for you to analyze how to hedge them. Could you talk about where you have annuity options, how you hedge them and if you have policyholder behavior wrong, how significant could that be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On QIS5 we will see what the industry position is going to be on that. I mean, we had discussions at the Pan-European Insurance Forum to see what we will do and we will follow the industry. I mean, we have our own view. We have the feeling that &#x2013; I mean, just to speak, it's not about the disclosure, but about the substance. We have the feeling that the QIS5 is an improvement when, compared to what some of the expectations about QIS5 were, but we still think that there are areas where the requirements are largely excessive, the calibrations are wrong, the requirements are largely excessive. To take a very simple example and one thing among many, why should the requirements on property casualty risks increase following the financial crisis? I mean, to what extent is the frequency of car accident increased by a financial crisis. So far, I have had problem making the connection between these two elements.</p>

          <p>Maybe. No, but they are &#x2013; this just to say that we have the feeling that some things are still wrong. Interestingly, on the calibration of the financial risk the view of the industry, CFO, CRO forum and Pan-European Insurance Forum is pretty close to the view of the regulators. The point where we disagree still very strongly are mostly on non-financial risks, which is a paradox and which gives us the feeling that there is still an exercise of trying to, I would say, buy comfort by asking for excessive requirements. The way we put it very, very simply when we are faced to people who are not familiar with issues to say what the parliament has been voting for is a 99.5 probability of default with the one year horizon.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, 0.5, sorry, yes. 99.5 certitude of survival. So, 0.5% of default with the one year horizon. Since you have 5,000 insurance companies in Europe, this should allow for 25 defaults a year. Cumulative in the last five years you had 16 defaults. So, this is demonstrating that the industry is sufficiently capitalized. You could add that most of these defaults where very tiny companies, I mean, not noticeable. So, we do not see why there should be any increase globally in the capital requirements. And <mark type="inaudible" /> has stated that, that he was not expecting the exercise to end with more capital than what is already the case. You can have more capital in some business lines. You also should have less in others. This is not what we are seeing at this stage. So, if we are not satisfied with QIS5 we will say that we are not satisfied and we will push forward.</p>

          <p>On new business strain, I'd like to so say a word, but then leave the rest of the question to G&#xE9;rald. The transaction that we are doing in the U.K. is part of the answer. When we sell to Resolution our traditional portfolio, we remove a large part of the new business strain of our U.K. Life business because in what we are keeping, the wealth management business, it's RDR-ready and we have very little strain. So, new business strain in large part is commissions, and these commissions are a function of market practices to a large extent. If we move upmarket, we reduce this new business strain. And so it's really trying to move to a different way of operating in the markets, and we are trying to do some of that, but it will be dependent on each market, and it's not something that is easy to do. G&#xE9;rald, any additional thought on that?</p>

          <p>No. To answer the last part of question, which was the about the guaranteed annuity options, like all options, we have examples with the GMAB, for example, in the U.S. It's managed like an option; that means the customer behavior is planned, depending on the interest rate. So, when interest rates are going down, which is presently the case, we are assuming, and there is a formula which explains by how much as a percentage of policyholders that will take an annuity will increase. What I can tell you, so we outline it, and that's where we are on a day-to-day basis managing our options. What I can tell you is that up to now, we didn't notice any different behavior from policyholders than the one we had anticipated.</p>

          <p>Apart from the U.S. in many, many &#x2013; in many of our markets where we have guaranteed annuity options, we have anticipated customer behaviors which were 100% annuitization, because this has been the practice of the market, this is a practice of the market in France for annuities, it's the practice of the market in Germany and for the most part in Japan.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Blair Stewart, BofA-Merrill. Two questions. The first &#x2013; actually, they're both on the U.S. Could you just talk a little bit more about the new product, downside protection with upside potential, it sounds like an indexed annuity. Can you talk a bit about that and the profitability expectations?</p>
          <p>And a more general point in the U.S., are you finding yourselves at a competitive disadvantage against some of the U.S. players who are perhaps not pricing on an economic/Solvency II basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the second part before Kevin takes the first one. Depends on the way you can position it. Yes, to a certain extent you can say that if you have competitors who are not managing against the same benchmarks as your benchmarks, you are at a disadvantage, but that's life. We are not going to endanger the company just because other people are managing against different standards. I think at this stage, it leaves us a sufficient room to compete, and do what we have to do. If the divergence were to become much, much, much larger, then maybe we would have a question, but I don't think it's the case today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the new product we have coming out in the fall hopefully or early winter, it is similar to an index annuity, but it's a very &#x2013; if you look at our product set in the U.S. for variable annuities, we have more complex variable annuities like Accumulator, we have Retirement Cornerstones now that is gaining momentum. And this new product, Protected Strategies, will be a way for people who are looking for shorter term tax-advantage investing. And so it will offer downside protection with limited upside. And so in this market where people are concerned about down markets, it will fill that need. So, we're looking to sort of complete our product set to from shorter duration investors, all the way through to those people who are planning full into retirement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, a couple of things, Blair, on that. One is it's a shorter term product, one, three or five years. It's priced sort of at the market when it becomes available. So, we're targeting profitability as we would for all annuities with appropriate new business values in line that we have when we introduced Retirement Cornerstone.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may go back to the first question, Blair. We do not intend to compete in all segments of all markets. So, in the U.S., we never competed in the whole life market, which is a market dedicated to mutual, which have a lower hurdle rate. Since 2002, we have stopped competing in the fixed annuity market because we were pricing to, I would say, European embedded value market-consistent pricing. And we were happy not to compete in that market, and we took much less asset risk in our competitors by not being in the fixed annuity market. It's true now that in the VA market, we are probably not competing in the totality of the market because we have a more stringent risk management, I would say, constraints, but we still believe that there is an addressable market that is big enough for us to be successful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Francois Tremblay, RBS. I have a question regarding the outlook for the non-Life business. So, you recorded a 3% average rate increase in the first half of the year. How would you describe your pricing strategy in the second half considering the prolonged economic weakness? How are you approaching the French market, for instance? Are you confident you could replicate similar rate of increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More of the same. And we think that &#x2013; I mean, it's contrasted from one market to the other, but we think we can continue to push. One illustration of that is the fact that we've been pushing significant price increases in different countries, and despite that, we've been growing the number of policies for the group as a whole by 700,000, which means that the attractiveness of the brand and the quality of the service is enough for us to maintain acceptable, I would say, growth rates in the portfolios, despite the fact that prices are increasing. And I think this is one of the strengths of the proprietary networks.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have a couple had a couple of questions. First of all, looking at latest QIS5 calibration, would you recognize under this latest framework some excess of reserves, as you want to push the idea that you are a highly reserved, especially in P&amp;C and hoping that the next framework also from the ISB will match what CEIOPS is proposing? So that's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is, using a constant equity market, what further impairments on assets could be booked on H2 and going forward?</p>
          <p>And I have a third question on AXA Rosenberg. I'm just wondering if the 64 million reserves that you've put on the side for restructuring and, potentially, compensation are realistic. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. G&#xE9;rald, you want to take the first part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned &#x2013; first I will start with the constant &#x2013; with the equity. You asked in case the equity market will stay where it is today, what will be the impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly speaking, the impact would be around 100 million net. But what we said, remember, at the end that was in February, we said that we should build a capacity to realize some capital gains on the net basis net of impairment between 300 and 500. You notice that in the first half, we did 200. So, there is no way for us not to comply with what we said at the beginning of the year between 300 million and 500 million.</p>
          <p>On QIS5, I believe it's far too early today to give any indication on what it will mean. You know that the QIS5 exercise will be between joining &#x2013; starting this month up to November. And anyway, the problem of the P&amp;C &#x2013; your specific problem about the P&amp;C reserving, it's balanced, so that means that if you have an excess of reserves, and it goes to the shareholders' equity, and it will be accounted as available financial resources. So, that's the way I would answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on Rosenberg, if we have put this level of reserve, it's that we feel it's sufficient.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. William Elderkin from Citi. Just two questions on your GA book, please. In terms of the investment margin, which was 77 bps, could you talk about what role ALM plays, and how you've changed your matching position, because obviously that will drive your reinvestment rate in a low interest rate environment? So that's question one.</p>
          <p>The second one was the forecast over the next 10 years or nine years, is there any assumption of a changing portfolio, asset portfolio in that built in at all, or is it just using the same portfolio? I see you've changed a little bit your asset portfolio with a higher rate to alternative assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Your first question about ALM, for sure, ALM plays a role in this improvement in the margin. And where does it come from? Mostly, it comes from the fact that as much as possible we are matching assets with liabilities; that means that we had up to now we have an average duration for life of seven years, for P&amp;C six years roughly. So, that explains why we didn't suffer from a decreasing interest rates; that means that when interest rates, when govies went down by 60, 70 basis points, the impact on our portfolio is pretty low. So, the main reason is this one. The second one is ALM means also the best way to align liabilities with assets in Life is to maximize the percentage of fixed income, and as presented to you, we are above 80%, and in fact, we were right.</p>
          <p>As far as the second part of your question for guaranteed rates, yes, we assumed that the asset allocation would stay exactly the same. So, that means that we are assuming that we would renew at today's low rates, so that's everything equal.</p>

          <p>Just a quick follow-up question on P&amp;C. I wondered, given that your level of reserve ratio and reserve releases is considerably higher than most of your peer group and this I understand is due to the longer tail nature of some of your business, like the construction -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Well, yes, I was hesitating to ask you about that, but you would actually say that publicly would you, right?</p>
          <p>[Laughter]</p>
          <p>My question was actually whether the tail is growing over the last few years, whether the liable &#x2013; I think you said six years average liability profile. Is that something that has grown over the last four years, would you say, as the mix of your business been to...?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the proportion of commercial versus retail has probably &#x2013; the retail part has probably slightly increased. In the commercial book, we have probably moved a little bit more towards liability and construction, so within the commercial, we've probably slightly increased the tail, but we have also increased the individual more than the commercial, and it's probably &#x2013; the two phenomena offset each other.</p>

I gave you the duration, so assuming a duration between 5 and 6, you can do your own calculation. And for the remaining, it's more the capacity for us to realize some capital gains. And so on the remaining 30% we can expect to similar rate plus 150 points, something around this.</p>
