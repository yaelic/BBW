        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick. Thank you everyone for attending this afternoon's conference call. 2008 was an unusual and challenging year. The global economic meltdown has had a significant impact on commodity prices, supply of credit and financial resources. In 2008, Husky still achieved a good financial performance. While the fourth quarter results were not in keeping of the first three quarters, Husky's consistent focus on financial discipline and project execution has positioned the company to perform well.</p>
          <p>For the year, sales and operating revenues were 24.7 billion, up 59% compared with 15.5 billion in 2007. Cash flow from operations increased 10% to 6 billion or $7.03 per share. Earnings were 3.8 billion or $4.42 per share, up 17% from 3.2 billion or $3.79 per share in 2007.</p>
          <p>Financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2008 was affected by the falling commodity prices and challenging North American economic conditions. Upstream financial performance was affected by lower realized prices and U.S. Downstream was weak due to refining crack spreads and reductions in inventory values.</p>
          <p>Sales and operating revenues in the fourth quarter were 4.7 billion compared with 4.8 billion in the same quarter of 2007. Cash flow from operations was 339 million or $0.40 per share in the quarter, compared to 1.4 billion or $1.68 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Earnings were 232 million or $0.27 per share in the fourth quarter, compared to 1.1 billion or $1.26 per share in the same quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased by 382 million due to US downstream inventory write-downs, while 2007 fourth quarter earnings included a tax benefit of 365 million due to federal tax changes. Adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter amounted to 614 million or $0.72 per share diluted, compared with 709 million or $0.84 per share diluted in the same quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, Husky's production averaged 358,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is in line with the guidance we provided in July. Total crude oil and natural gas liquids production was 263,000 barrels of oil per day in the quarter, while natural gas production averaged 571 million cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was 1.9 billion, down from 2.81 billion at the end of 2007. This debt was partially offset by cash and cash equivalents on hand of 913 million resulting in a net debt position of approximately 1 billion.</p>
          <p>Husky currently has unused committed credit facilities of 1.5 billion. Husky's average long-term debt to maturity is 12.5 years with the next maturity payment of US$400 million due in 2012. Debt to cash flow for the year fell to 0.3 times compared with 0.5 times in 2007.</p>
          <p>Husky's strong financial performance in 2008 enabled the company to fund its capital program, redeem its debt and accumulate cash to take advantage of further investment opportunities.</p>
          <p>Husky's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. Given the prevailing economic environment, the Board considers that this quarterly dividend continues to provide shareholders with one of the leading yields in the industry, while allowing the company to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, Husky made significant progress on some of its major projects. Husky and its partner remain committed to the development of the Sunrise Oil Sands project. These projects will proceed with a three phase development, the first stage at 60,000 barrels per day, with total production of 200,000 barrels per day by the year 2015 to 2020.</p>
          <p>Sunrise has entered into an optimization stage to simplify the project's scope and to take advantage of the recent downturn in the demand for goods and services. Subject to a regulatory and government amendment approval, the partners will consider the project sanction decision in 2009 for final approval in mid 2010.</p>
          <p>We have consolidated our Oil Sands and thermal heavy oil operations to take advantage of synergies between the two groups. At the Tucker project, production has ramped up to approximately 4,800 barrels per day at the end of the year and work continues on reservoir optimization. Additional drilling will most likely be delayed until market conditions improve.</p>
          <p>Offshore, the East Coast of Canada, delineation wells were drilled on the North Amethyst and. West White Rose satellite fields. The North Amethyst satellite tie-back development remains on schedule for a late 2009 or early 2010 start up</p>
          <p>The tie-in work for the field will require a shutdown of the White Rose Floating Production and Storage Loading unit for approximately one month. The impact of the tie-back has been incorporated in our 2009 production guidance. The exploration with Statoil Hydro in the Mizzen well, located on Flemish Pass Basin spudded in December and is expected to reach total depth in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>In South East Asia, the West Hercules deep water drilling rig commenced drilling the first appraisal well on the Liwan field in the South China Sea in November of 2008. This rig is currently preparing to test this well, and once complete, will drill another appraisal well before moving on to drill further exploration wells in the area. Front-end engineering and design work for the Liwan development is being prepared for tender and is expected to commence development work once results are obtained for the first two appraisal wells.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, the government approved the Madura plan of development in the second quarter of 2008. Husky and its partners are currently awaiting approval for the Madura Production Sharing Contract, the PSC extension at which time engineering work will commence for Madura BD field development.</p>
          <p>Husky has contracted the Transocean Adriatic XI shallow water rig to drill two exploration wells on the East Bawean II block. In October, Husky was awarded the North Sumbawa II PSC from the government of Indonesia and plans are being developed for further exploration.</p>
          <p>In 2008, Husky acquired exploration acreages in the Columbia River basin in Washington and Oregon in the United States, blocks offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, and also offshore Indonesia and China. The year 2009 exploration program is progressing with drilling in the U.S. Columbian river basin, in offshore Newfoundland and Labrador and in China.</p>
          <p>Terrance will update to you with the Midstream and Downstream divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Declining commodity and product prices impacted our Downstream and Midstream divisions in the fourth quarter. Upgrader earnings for the fourth quarter were $44 million, down from 2007. Lower volume throughput due to unplanned maintenance and unit margins that were 35% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2007 were responsible.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure and marketing earnings were also lower in the fourth quarter, down to 28 million, compared to 81 million in 2007. The reduction was mainly due to lower commodity trading margins on crude and natural gas, lower gas storage spreads and the tax rate adjustment in 2007.</p>
          <p>Weak crack spreads, combined with inventory valuation write-downs resulting from the rapid decline in commodity prices produced a $534 million shortfall in the U.S. Downstream segment in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The decline in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar also negatively reduced the results in Canadian dollar terms. The fundamentals and operating performance of these refineries remain strong and we will proceed with the strategic repositioning investments, aligned with Husky's oil sands development plans once market conditions improve.</p>
          <p>Our Canadian Refined Products division contributed $16 million of net earnings in the fourth quarter, down from the same period in 2007, which benefited from a future income tax recovery of $24 million. Ethanol production was up 90% due to the contribution of the Minnedosa Ethanol Plant. Asphalt margins were up 59% in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the decline in costs for crude oil feedstock.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call back to John for his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Terrance. The year 2008 demonstrate Husky's vision and strategy in a volatile commodity market environment. We have already reduced our capital program and trimmed our operating expenses in line with our cash flow and commodity price projections. Our balance sheet and financial position remain strong. The year 2009 will be a challenging year for our industry. Husky has taken steps to contain costs and optimize operations. Back to you, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. That concludes the formal part of the call. And we would be pleased to answer any questions that you may have. And I'll now turn the call back to the conference operator.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Questions. The first question is related to the dividend cut. What oil price has Husky assumed in making the cuts? And the second question is more on macro regarding China and South East Asia. We've noticed offshore netbacks have been particularly attractive in the past couple of quarters, specifically in the East Coast. Given this and a number of development activities which you highlighted in your earnings, can we infer there is significant strategic shift for Husky to focus in China and Southeast Asia, and likely away from the oil sand business, at least short-term until commodity prices recover. Is that basically the next significant value creation shareholders should look for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is John here. Thank you for the questions. To address your first question about the dividend, and dividend -- actually dividend from what I understand from the Board -- I'm not talking on behalf of members. They are carefully looking at our market price of Husky's share and nothing to do with the commodity price. Of course the commodity price will directly affect the decision because it relates to earning and cash flow. So we consider Husky in a very strong position, while our share price actually has been dropped from the peak of 48 to $50 to 30. So we have to adjust it accordingly, in line with the current common unit shareholders. So this cut is really also looking at financial position, we want to preserve our flexibility and we are ready to look at opportunities to expand or to push more money into the Southeast Asia market.</p>
          <p>To answer your second question about Southeast Asia, that relates completely to our discovery success in the Liwan. As we announced, Liwan is about four to six trillion of potential resource base. We already hired the West Hercules to drill about six wells in this year. The commitment of cost is quite significant, but <mark type="inaudible" /> and not many rigs for deep water are available. We are looking at Southeast Asia is far more than China. We're looking at Southeast Asia and we're looking at Indonesia and we are looking at other Australasia areas. This is a potential area for Husky to look at, as the Husky Asia. We position ourselves with seven exploration blocks in China and in particular, focus fully upon the South China Sea and looking at a trend to go up to East China Sea.</p>
          <p>If you look at the development of this new win, which we'll announce very soon in this coming few weeks, about delineation well drilling, would put us in place in a competitional position, in the future position for Husky spin off or expansion. And we focus on the operating costs, are much lower when you compare with Canada. And the <mark type="inaudible" /> because they are all based on international basis.</p>
          <p>We estimate that the development would be announced as soon as we <mark type="inaudible" /> engineering base on these operational wells. So we are confident that Northeast would be one of the sterling path for the company. And Husky's policy, if you noticed for the past few years, we have completely shifted our focus from on-land to offshore, especially by using our technology and our knowledge and experience from East Coast, <mark type="inaudible" /> to the South China Sea, Indonesia and also Labrador and now Pennsylvania. If you look at the whole world, the whole world has one-fifth of land component, four-fifth of water. So we are comfortable with our policy by focus on deep water drilling, are very encouraging. If you look at the whole <mark type="inaudible" /> offshore deep water exploration.</p>
          <p>So I hope I can give a very high level of South China Sea, our future strategy planning, but pending on these delineation well result come up, definitely we'll announce by the end of third quarter, hopefully can be earlier. Then we will announce also our strategy, going forward. Okay.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, thanks. I noticed in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter you repurchased some of your outstanding debt. I was just wondering if that's something that's on the table and something you're still evaluating in 2009 as a result of your spreads still being relatively wide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a one of the new position. We actually are cash rich. We are quite flexible. We are looking at financial size and the terms. If we can find -- get some of the debt with a discount we would do so. We will continue to look at opportunities.</p>
          <p>Regarding the spreads, I would invite Alister to address through the spread and the future position of our loan position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks John. As you stated, the purchase was attractive with a discount on our debt that's outstanding. As John said, we are in a strong financial position on the balance sheet with cash on hand. We will continue to look at opportunities as it is presented to us, both for repurchase or use of any cash that we may have. We wanted -- one key thing is that we are focused on price discipline and are maintaining a strong balance sheet and the flexibility that that gives us. And so moving forward we will look at the opportunities and make the evaluation in that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Andrew Fairbanks of Merrill Lynch. Please carry on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Andrew, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. How are you, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Just two questions; you mentioned a subsea operational issue with White Rose during the quarter and I was just curious if you could elaborate on that. And then the second question, I didn't know if you wanted to hazard a guess on what the refining earnings or findings would look like either under a CTS basis or as if you were on LIFO still instead of FIFO. It's always a challenge to get through the downstream earnings details on your FIFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I will ask Rob to give the answer on the White Rose and regarding the financial side, you asked a very difficult question, LIFO and FIFO, but I will address to Alister or Terrance to address that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks John. It's Rob Peabody. Yeah, on the White Rose vessel there is no single large material issues or anything. There were a few operational issues going through the last quarter. Late in the quarter we had one issue that caused us to shut down one subsea well with a gas leak, a small gas leak on the well head. So we shut the well down to stop that gas leak, and we're just going through the process right now of finding the best way to repair that leak going forward. But this is something that has affected production to the tune of about 6,000 barrels a day to Husky.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to your question on restatements on LIFO versus FIFO, Husky complies with Canadian GAAP, which of course is on a FIFO basis and that's also consistent going forward with IFRS. And so we have no intention at this juncture of restating anything in a LIFO basis, and on a going forward basis what we can say is that we saw some pretty unprecedented declines. The price decline that we saw averaged just under $100 a barrel WTI in 2008 and averaged at $58 and change in Q4 is something that is mathematically difficult to appreciate. But certainly on a going forward basis, we can't see that this extraordinary event is going to be repeated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, but no intention of doing like a CTS adjusted downstream number as the European companies do or Petro-Canada?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we are already <mark type="inaudible" /> acceptable basis, because the other companies need to convert to our acceptable basis. So I don't anticipate to any change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Terry Peters of Canaccord Adams. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Just two questions. The first on your oil sands partnership and the second on taxes. So on the oil sands, given that the joint venture with BP will equalize the upstream assets with their downstream assets, and if there is a delay in the upstream assets, is there going to be any change in the sharing arrangement with their downstream earnings, I think that the original transaction envisioned you sharing 50% of the product earnings. And if the upstream is for whatever reason delayed or -- is that subject to renegotiation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer you oil sands question. Firstly, our joint venture is very specific. And we are having a 50% of the Toledo Refinery. The share of revenue impacting on completion of the transaction was at 1st April to last year. For the Sunrise, we share 50% of the Sunrise. We are the appraiser. So far we continue to work on both projects and there is no delay or change of mind for oil sands projects.</p>
          <p>We are entering the engineering and we contemplate the whole Sunrise development. So <mark type="inaudible" /> and there should be no difference. The way we are looking at today, because the equipment and also labor costs are coming down. We feel we can survive time and the cost cannot be announced at the moment. But the costs are actually 40% better than the original budget.</p>
          <p>So we will be quite encouraging. As soon as we receive that government approval or regular approval on the minor amendment, then the whole company will look at the extension and look at the <mark type="inaudible" /> preparation. So far, BP and Husky are both committed to this project.</p>
          <p>You read -- the Toledo refinery <mark type="inaudible" /> we will continue to share half, <mark type="inaudible" />. If Sunrise for several reasons later than <mark type="inaudible" /> for the first 60,000 barrels a day. We will continue to share that because they will continue to share BP and also will continue to purchase the crude. So there is no separation, we still base on 50-50 basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if things change in the future you might negotiate, but right now doesn't look like it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then second question is, quickly just on taxes. About 60% of your cash taxes are from the upstream business switch. You like others have a tax partnership and I'm just wondering that usually creates a lag. Can we infer that your cash taxes in your upstream are going to be going up in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be -- it's Alister here. That would be the correct assumption. Obviously the partnership structure does give us a one year deferral and therefore cash taxes for the upstream will be higher in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any estimate as to how high your guidance on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can probably gauge that from the results.</p>
        </plist>
