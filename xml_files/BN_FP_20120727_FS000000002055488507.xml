        <plist>
          <p>Okay. [Foreign Language] (00:20) Just trying to confirm that the connection is on. Yeah, okay, fine, great. Well, so we'll start. Good morning to you all. This is Pierre-Andr&#xE9; Terisse speaking from &#x2013; Danone's CFO. I'm here with Antoine Guttinger, Investor Relation, and Lambert Deloche de Noyelle. We're very glad to be in London today for this meeting.</p>
          <p>A year ago, at the same event <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:48) or host the event in Paris, given the proximity of the Olympic Games, sorry. We finally got of the opinion that it was important to come and see you here. We accepted the invitation from Nomura, and they should be thanked for that and for hosting the call. I want to thank you, the people in this room, personally for having made the effort to come today. I know, again, given the Olympic Games, it's not so easy to come. And I want to welcome as well the people who are on the line.</p>
          <p>Now, this word of introduction being made, I'd like to say that I'm very glad to report a solid set of results for the first half, which are in line with our objective for H1 and Q2 despite a combination of factors, more or less predictable, from high comps in Water to the carryover effects of the inflation of the first half of last year from the poor weather conditions in Europe in the second quarter to the worsening consumption trends in Southern Europe in April. Over the first half, there's been a number of takeaways for us, the management of the group, and I would like to share two or three of them with you.</p>
          <p>First, I think we should not forget that we have a very good set of brands and business all over the world which account for two-thirds of the group and grow more than 10% in average. These are: Mizone, Dumex, Aqua, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:32), Danone-Unimilk, Oikos, Danone Japan, South Africa, Brazil, Al Safi Danone in Saudi Arabia, Bonafont <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:44) and actually all of our operations outside Western Europe.</p>
          <p>They do deliver profitable growth quarters-after-quarters in dairy, in waters, in baby and in medical nutrition. These are the engines of the group, and all we need to do is to keep shooting them and growing them again and again. And their potential is I believe huge, probably one of the best potential in this industry, in the food industry, outside Europe.</p>
          <p>In front of that, we have obviously one-third of all sales in Western Europe, North and South. This part of the business has progressively started growing. Consumption trends in Southern Europe have even it embodied in negative to treaties since the beginning of the year. This is something we have even brought it in negative territory since the beginning of the year. This is something we have to manage and handle proactively by addressing our portfolio and pricing terms, by addressing it as well in terms of offer, by adjusting our costs; not using either of these levers but using them all at the same time. We are now three months after the end of April. We know that in Southern Europe it's not going to be easy. We know it will take time and we think it will be definitely the right decision to adjust sooner targets for the year.</p>
          <p>About Europe, we feel like we felt three years ago about waters. We feel <mark type="ph" /> this determined (4:00) and pressure that will get stronger out of this situation. So this is a group, a combination of a very strong non-European business with a huge potential for growth and, again, probably without equivalents in the industry. And, at the same time, a European business which sells to consumers under pressure and which we need to manage. We feel ready to handle those successfully and this is what I wanted to tell you as an introduction.</p>
          <p>Now, after these remarks, let me run you through the first half results in more detail. So, I'll go through the highlights of the first half to start with, starting with page four. Sales growth from the first half has been 5.9% with a strong Q1 at 6.9%, and logically a softer Q2 at 5% on a high comparison basis.</p>
          <p>Trading operating margin has stood at 13.85%, down by 61 basis points like-for-like on Southern Europe and pressure of raw material. Free cash flow at last has reached &#x20AC;890 million, reflecting a strong cash flow generation, but also a different CapEx phasing from last year, with &#x20AC;90 million more CapEx this first half than there was a year ago.</p>
          <p>If I look at our environment, and you know this slide which we've been using now for the past few quarters., we've seen basically three things throughout the first half. A, an inflation which has been a little bit higher than what we expected, notably on some specific raw material which has been the whey and the milk proteins, and we have tried in front of that to generate more productivity to increase our level of productivity.</p>
          <p>On the consumer side, we've seen in Southern Europe, which has been deteriorating steeply in the second quarter. I'll come back on that, requiring adjustments and also specific <mark type="ph" /> report (6:23). In the rest of the world and in emerging markets, on the contrary, we have seen a demand which has continued to stay strong, and we've seen our business keeping growing shares and keeping &#x2013; sorry, keeping growing sales and profitability and keeping doing what they're supposed to do which is to build and develop their category in these markets.</p>
          <p>So these dual trends are basically moving the group or keep moving the group. As you can see on the chart, with sales and margins up, growth markets now represent about two-thirds of our sales, and they've increased their relative size by 3 points, while Western Europe has, on the contrary, decreased by 3 points versus the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>About Western Europe, a word on Spain. What we have seen in the first part of the second quarter has basically been confirmed by what we have seen in the rest of the quarter. Consumer confidence which had dropped in the first &#x2013; at the beginning of Q2, has basically remained at about the same level, which means 50%, as you can see on the chart. And with respect to sales, we have seen a negative mid-single digit evolution of our sales in April. We have seen that continuing throughout the quarter, and we do not expect that the situation is going to improve in any shape or form over the rest of the year. So this is what we assume when we look at the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>We've already started managing the situation, as you can imagine, using different levers. I'm not going to come back into a lot of details on that. I just would like to mention two things. One is Yolado, which for the moment is a real small innovation, but which looks very promising. Yolado is a yogurt which you put in your freezer at home and which you eat frozen. This is a very good one &#x2013; sorry, a very good product. We have completely saturated the line almost immediately. We are now looking at building additional capacity. But this can be, among other things, a solution and innovation which can be useful to Spain.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I will mention that we have finalized throughout the quarter the work we have started at the beginning, which consists in <mark type="ph" /> moving old (9:00) price points. We have in our portfolio to understand where the elasticity stands. We have this work which is being done and we'll now be ready to be more efficient in the way we use the pricing tool to meet consumer demand.</p>
          <p>Last, we are pushing on productivity and, in particular, through a new project called <mark type="ph" /> Cost Or Valuing(9:26), which is going to be throughout the organization consisting in trying to find value for &#x2013; more value for the consumer or decreased costs. These are examples of the levers are going to be implemented. They are progressively being activated, and they will be activated pragmatically to manage the situation.</p>
          <p>Outside Western Europe, as I said, we're talking of double-digit growth as an average. And in total I would just like on this call to mention the performance of few of our brands. Prostokvashino, growth of 11%. Oikos, and we'll see that later on, has doubled its sales versus last year. Mizone is still going at a pace north of 40%. Dumex is going at a pace which is north of 15%. So brands which keep adding attraction, which is absolutely strong and helping the development of our sales and of our categories in all these markets.</p>
          <p>This is the situation today. We keep expanding and trying to address new geographies. I will mention two. Just as a reminder, you know &#x2013; you remember that we have announced this half that we've acquired 38% of Centrale Laiti&#xE8;re au Maroc, which, on top of the existing stake we had in it, is going to give us a majority now as to consolidate and get the management directly of this operation from presumably the beginning of next year of the end of this year. That's going to add &#x20AC;600 million sales to our portfolio with a fairly good level of EBIT margin and potential improvement which are significant. Strong brand platform which we think we have the ability to keep developing further and which, by the way, is going to be useful in thinking about our African strategy.</p>
          <p>Second, India. It took us a bit of time but we closed this transaction yesterday, a transaction which was announced 11 months ago actually. It's taken time, as it often takes in this kind of &#x2013; in this particular geography. But it's done. In the meantime, the asset has performed very well, plus 22% of sales in the first half. And, therefore, we are getting a healthy business, which, again, is going to be a very useful platform for Baby and Medical, which, as you know, are two of the most dynamic of our businesses.</p>
          <p>I would just like to say a word, before moving into the figures more in detail, about sustainability. It remains a very, very important axis of development for Danone because it guarantees that we'll be able to deliver growth, not only in the short term but also in the medium term. Two examples, we've been entering the Top 10 of the Best Global Green Brands in 2012 recently; we actually rank 9. And this means the efforts we are doing in terms of environmental protection are being perceived and recognized by the consumer. And, secondly, we are progressively rolling out the SAP platform for carbon footprint measurement. And, for that, we've received a reward here in the UK, which is <mark type="audio gap" /> (13:04-13:08) given by Finance for the Future. So that's one.</p>
          <p>On the left hand side of the presentation you will see sourcing. As part of our management in Russia and the effort for making the business sustainable for Danone and its environment, we've set up a Milk Business Academy around a farm which is going to receive in the next five years, 700 farmers, train them, with a very concrete goal which aims at increasing in the yield of the farm and the yield of the milk of cows 10%, and ensuring high-quality and long-term supply of milk for them. So, this is the group and this is what I wanted to say about the various events which have been taking place throughout the first half. I'll now go into more figures on this.</p>
          <p>Key figures, I'm not going to go through everything again, just to mention that for the first time time, I think in the history of the group we have a first half &#x2013; or a half, simply, which is in excess of &#x20AC;10 billion. So that shows that through acquisition of these but also organically, we are actually growing and going through our milestones. 5.9% like-for-like, so that it right in the middle of the guidance for the half, with a rebalancing between Q1 and Q2, as you know. Operating margin down by 61 basis points like-for-like, 62 basis points reported. And EPS which is up by almost 5 points at &#x20AC;1.51, and a cash flow, again, which is down on higher CapEx on the different phasing.</p>
          <p>About the sales, two things to mention here. 7.7% reported, that comes from the fact that we had a currency affect of 2 points over the first half, no scope effects. And the 5.9% is broken down into 2.2% and 3.7%. Interestingly, this breakdown gives the same result in terms of volume for the second quarter, 2.1%, but that is obviously down at different things. In particular, Water is obviously down given the weather condition in the second quarter, while Baby is up by about the same amount or even more. Value is decreasing as we move into the anniversary of price increase which we passed for the majority of them in the first half of last year. And the currency effect, as you can see, is slightly higher in the second quarter than it is for the half.</p>
          <p>If you look at the dynamics of that again, 7% in Q1 was very much at the top of the guidance of the 5% to 7% guidance. 5% is at the bottom. I would just like to remind you that we had a second quarter last year which was exceptional in Water for two reasons. Number one, because of Japan and the loading of inventory in these countries following the catastrophe of tsunami and Fukushima, and, secondly, because we had tremendously good weather conditions in April and May in Europe. In front of that, we've obviously had very bad weather conditions and, therefore, we are where we thought we would be some time ago &#x2013; sorry, a month ago or two months ago, which is at 5% for Q2. And, again, that reflects the dual feature of Western Europe sales which are declining and the rest of the world, which is growing double digits.</p>
          <p>Volume value, you'll find what I mentioned before, i.e., the decrease of the value effects since the 2011 price increase are lapsing gradually. And on the contrary, volumes which stay stable with aggressive contribution from Baby and lot of contribution of Water.</p>
          <p>And now moving to the performance of each of the divisions. I'll start with Dairy. At Q2, which I think can be qualified as soft, at 2.1% and 2.9% for the first half, Q2 is softer than Q1 for two reasons, number one, because we had the Leap Day more in Q1 and, secondly, because of the deterioration in Southern Europe and Spain, which you saw before.</p>
          <p>CIS and North America are definitely on track, I will come back on that. Latin America has been providing very solid performance, in particular in Brazil, and we will be needing to add capacity in these countries very soon. Danone South Africa has been delivering as well a very good performance with, in particular the brand Mayo, which is successful. And Indonesia with Milkuat has been confirming the take-off which we have seen from last year.</p>
          <p>Volume unchanged, with CIS contributing <mark type="ph" /> so I'm pleased (18:32) this is the first quarter, while Spain has been obviously contributing negatively to the evolution and, therefore, we're at minus 0.3 versus minus 0.1, the value effect reflects, as I said, the lapsing of the 2011 price increase.</p>
          <p>One word about the CIS and Unimilk. I think you can see on the right hand side of the screen, the progress we've made. This is showing the volumes, this shows that we had a very debalanced evolution of sales last year with very negative volumes for the restructuring of the portfolio and the price increase and, at the same time, very positive value effects. We have a much more balanced relative goals this year, which is positive in volume, positive in value, and, as a result, of course, positive in sales, and which is showing gradual acceleration. What we are building is very solid.</p>
          <p>On the left hand side, it's probably even more satisfactory to see it. We are building this growth food brands &#x2013; we are building this growth through Prostokvashino, which is really, I'll come back on that, making progresses. We are building this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:50), with Activia, with Actimel. And therefore, we are really on track on with the plan, which I remind you, consisted in building brand equity and building a portfolio which will be much more resilient than the previous one. This is what we're in the process of doing.</p>
          <p>You'll see that actually on Prostokvashino, this is a small cat, very traditional, very close to the families in the Russian image. We have renovated and strengthened the brand and that's given remarkable performance, with 11% like-for-like sales in the first half. We'll keep renovating the brands one after the other and building the support to build up the sales.</p>
          <p>So this is Russia, it's really one of the markets we are investing significantly to build up and to take &#x2013; I'm sorry, to build the category. The U.S. is the other one. I think we can say that the U.S. has been a very good performer for Danone Dairy in the first half and in the second quarter particularly. The brand Oikos has become a clear number two, taking 7.3% share of market, about 20% &#x2013; more than 20% actually, share of the segment, multiplying sales by more than two. And this has helped Danone to become now the clear market leader, with 33%, ahead of all of its competitors. This performance is in line with our targets. And, of course, the second half which is coming is going to be even more important, given that would be adding capacity.</p>
          <p>About what's coming, we will not only be adding capacity we'll as well as some of our competitors are doing, we'll be going with new references. We are going to move on multipack for Oikos, which is an important one. We have decided to combine our legitimacy in knowing how to do and process Greek yogurt with the legitimacy of the brand Light &amp; Fit on the light to produce a Greek yogurt which is going to be not 100 calories, but 80 calories. And we think that could be successful. We are going to launch a new Activia Breakfast, and we have opened on Park Avenue in New York a yogurt company a kind of a space which is going to be open for people to try and discover and understand fermented products and yogurt.</p>
          <p>We're not only moving in the U.S., we're moving outside as well. Oikos, as I mentioned, has received this first half the Best New Product Award in Canada. As you can see, we have launched a light version of Griego in Spain, and here in the UK we've launched a version of Oikos with <mark type="ph" /> wine, (22:45) which I encourage you to taste because I can tell you it's really very, very, very good.</p>
          <p>Yolado, I mentioned that it's been extremely well received and now the question is going to be about adding capacity and looking at what we can do on that after, obviously, confirming that there is significant potential. So this was about Dairy and a soft Q1 but a lot of promises and initiative in two key markets, U.S. and Russia, which are doing extremely well.</p>
          <p>Waters, a soft Q2 and, after all, not such a soft Q2 because delivering a 4.6% with all the conditions I've mentioned is probably the sign of very, very resilient division now. So as strong H1 growth altogether, first of all, close to 10%, 9.6%. Q2 which has been hit by the element I already mentioned to you, i.e., the comps and the weather, we continue seeing strong underlying category dynamics and we continue benefiting from the outperformance of the Aquadrinks. I've mentioned the performance of Mizone, this is true as well in other markets, in Argentina for instance and in particular.</p>
          <p>In terms of the volume value equation, really shows and illustrates what I said about the strength of the model. A few years ago, all the factors combined would have given a very negative geographical mix which would have brought value in negative. We know that in front of that, the addition of positive mix coming from the Aquadrinks, and that's helping to add the value element, which remains positive at 1.5%. The 3.1% of volume is in line with the previous quarter, a bit lighter on the comps and as well on a slightly softer Q2 in Mexico.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:35) Okay. So for everybody here in the room and those on the call, I understand the call has been cut, page 24. So I will just start again, page 24. Forgive me for who has heard the pages are ready. I was saying, page 24, that the U.S. has been performing very well in the second quarter and in the first half altogether. Oikos is doubling its sales, taking 7.3% share of market of the total category, more than 20% share of segment of the Greek. And that's been helping Danone to become a clear leader on the market with 33%. And a performance which is in line with our targets, knowing that H2 is going to be obviously an important time for Oikos in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We are launching several products, a multipack version of Oikos. A Light &amp; Fit version, of Oikos, a lightened version, combining our know-how in Greek and position of the brand with 80 calories. An Activia Breakfast version, and we have opened a new shop on Central &#x2013; on Park Avenue, sorry, in New York, which is about yogurt and I think is going to be the opportunity for American consumers to discover this category and enter in it.</p>
          <p>More innovation in Dairy, I'll go quickly. But Canada, we've received the award for the best product in the first half with Oikos and we are launching Oikos as well here in the UK. I think it's already launched. Yolado in Spain, I already mentioned, that could be a promising start. We need to confirm, but that's, I think, something which can help revitalize the category in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>So about &#x2013; I'm moving to Water. Sorry. I'm actually moving back. And I was &#x2013; yeah, just a comment that 4.6% in Q2 is a real good and solid performance, given the weather conditions and the high comps. This is confirming that we are in a category with very strong dynamics. Solid in Western Europe, very strong outside, and we are benefiting as well from Aquadrinks, which are always very strong.</p>
          <p>And if I look at the breakdown of that, the 1.5% in value to me is very important because it is the combination of a very positive mix coming from the Aquadrinks and a very negative, obviously, geographical mix given the performance of Europe this quarter, but it means that the model is more resilient than it used to be in the past.</p>
          <p>And in Water as well, we try to innovate in Evian the city &#x2013; the Evian Masters, the golf championship has become a major so that's going to add to the image of the brand, which is obviously very important. We are launching a sparkling version of Volvic in Germany in order to strengthen our position in this segment or the category in which we had mainly Badoit and Salvetat previously, so French brands.</p>
          <p>Baby nutrition, I think it's &#x2013; we can qualify that as an outstanding performance, even more so when you take away the exceptional elements coming from the renovation of Dumex and reloading &#x2013; the loading of the distribution, which accounts for 1 point to 2 points out of the 13.6%. The rest is all organic performance on all of the same very good drivers, i.e., milk performing well when food is declining, and in milk all the countries are growing. This is a case of the UK for instance, high-single digit. This is the case of most European countries, and this the case even more so in Asia and, in particular, in China where we have been regaining some market share.</p>
          <p>So we keep as well innovating in this area. Two things, the renovation of Dumex, which, as I said, is important. We are bringing additional qualities, additional elements to the formula and we think that's going to strengthen a brand which is already very strong on the Chinese market. This is in process of being done.</p>
          <p>And on the food side, we are taking what I believe could be an important step, i.e., we are launching Bl&#xE9;dina du Jour. Bl&#xE9;dina du Jour is the fresh version of the jars, which if you happen to go to France and see this, then I encourage you to taste for yourself. I've done it. It's very good, even for adults. This is put in a fridge which is in the baby aisle. And I think that's going to be a very attractive proposition for the consumer and help us, again, making this product category take off.</p>
          <p>Medical Nutrition, our trends which are very similar to Q1 with the same detail, i.e., overall performance which is very good, overall Western Europe which is <mark type="ph" /> resisting (31:08) well. This is a case of the UK for instance, which, as you know, is one of &#x2013; the most important business we have in Medical Nutrition. Southern Europe is definitely a drag and, at the same time, we have seen the U.S. becoming more competitive. That was already the case in Q1 and it's confirmed in Q2.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets go up strongly. That's the case in particular, China and Russia. One of the important elements of the year is the progress we are doing on Souvenaid. We've seen a very interesting publication in The Journal of Alzheimer's Disease in the issue of July 2012. We'll be attending a conference, which is the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Vancouver I believe &#x2013; yeah, in Vancouver, later this year. And we are preparing the launch of these products in several countries towards the end of the year, beginning of next.</p>
          <p>So all that is obviously doing a geographical map &#x2013; a geographical breakdown of sales which is dual, as we said in the heading of the slides, minus 1% in Europe. And this is with Unimilk, which is contributing positively and, therefore, ex-Unimilk, that minus 1% will become minus 2.5% approximately.</p>
          <p>Asia remains very strong, with Japan negative effect versus last year. And, therefore, at plus 17% that's a very, very good performance. And the rest of the world is very strong, with Mexico, which has been a bit softer this quarter, <mark type="ph" /> consensually, (32:50) and the rest of the countries remaining very strong, including the good performance of the U.S.</p>
          <p>I'll now move to the margin. The left column, which is the reported one, is here to remind you that we, in the 2011 accounts, we changed the way we account for pensions. And we add an adjustment which was already presented in the full year 2011. It's obviously impacting the basis of the comparison for these results and, therefore, we are not starting from the 14.35% margin, but we are starting from the 14.47% margin.</p>
          <p>In front of that, we are delivering 13.85%. This is made of &#x20AC;1.451 billion trading operating income and &#x20AC;40 million non-operating or other operating items and current items which are predominantly the integration costs of Unimilk. The margin is, therefore, down 62 basis points and, out of the 62 basis points, 61 basis points like-for-like. There is 1 basis point for the scope and currency effect all together.</p>
          <p>What you see on this chart is that most of the evolution of the margin and drop of the margin has been coming from input costs and inflation more generally, which has been reaching to 249 bps and has not been fully offset by pricing. This is very much a carryover effect of the fact that the input costs have been increased throughout the first half of last year and, therefore, we had a base of comparison which was low. When you will see this picture in the second half, definitely the impact of the inflation will not be at all at this magnitude. But, conversely, what you can see on the leverage, which is negative, this is reflecting the deterioration of the situation in Southern Europe and, therefore, it extends to negative. This is the impact of one quarter; we'll have twice this impact in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So, margin down by 61 bps on a like-for-like basis. Again, talking about inflation, I'm just going to repeat what we said earlier this year. Specific inflation on three &#x2013; higher inflation than expected on specific things, in particular the first <mark type="ph" /> cartridge (35:19) whey and milk protein, which have been growing in excess of 20%. Overall, this means that inflation for the first half has been higher than the one we expected. And we expect for the full year that it's going to be slightly in excess of what we expect, although we expect as well that in the second half things are going to stop growing. In front of that productivity, we are definitely targeting an improvement in excess of &#x20AC;500 million, and we have been producing a significant part of that in the first half, with &#x20AC;246 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to top line, different levers. One is A&amp;P which we keep stable with the A slightly up and the P slightly down versus last year. A significant increase of the proportion of digital media spend within the A&amp;P. A global agreement with Google which aims at three priorities: optimize the media mix for digital, innovate and build digital capabilities. Our joint missions to build leverage together, a digital advantage for both Danone and Google.</p>
          <p>Apart from A&amp;P, obviously, we have other levers which are equally important. R&amp;D is one of them. Sales force is another one of them, very important indicator for Baby and Medical. And these two levers have been growing double digits. So we keep, obviously, putting fuel in efforts where we need them to keep growing our categories.</p>
          <p>Looking at the margins by business and by geography, no surprise, this reflects pretty much what I've shown you in terms of evolution of sales and what I've said so far about the reason or the drivers of the margin change. Dairy, that's minus 85 bps, impacted by Southern Europe and the carryover of inflation of milk, in particular. Waters is as well impacted by the carryover inflation, while weather conditions in Europe have not helped the solid performance of the first half.</p>
          <p>Baby is in a clear investment mode and, at the same time, have been seeing their costs increasing from the whey. But they're clearly investing and trying to accelerate the building of their category. Medical Nutrition has been impacted by Southern Europe. And if you look at it geographically, unsurprisingly, Europe is negative 200 bps. What's impressive is the performance of Asia, which goes from 20.6% to 22.6%, and this is very much the result of the performance of Dumex and Mizone, which are doing very well. Rest of the world as well is delivering a very solid margin growth, with 36 bps from 12% to 12.36% over the first half.</p>
          <p>Sorry. I'm moving from the operating income to net income. Financial expenses have been up on the cost of hedging, which has increased over the first half from &#x20AC;133 million to &#x20AC;138 million. Affiliates has been up as well on the Asia and North Africa result, which, I remind you, had been very low last year &#x2013; in the first half of last year and, therefore, benefit from a low comparison base. This explains the move from &#x20AC;23 million to &#x20AC;39 million. On the minority side, you have two movements which are quite basically Russian is increasing and Spanish are decreasing for minorities, which remain stable. Altogether, the underlying net income is up by 4%.</p>
          <p>Income tax, there's obviously some pressure in France but also outside, with an increasing cost of moving money from one country to the other. In France, what we have seen so far is unlikely to have significant impact in 2012 and, therefore, we think we'll be in our 26% to 27% guidance on the rest of the year. Obviously, we'd have to take into account what it is going to be discussed and voted later this year.</p>
          <p>All that gives an EPS, which, on the base of fully-diluted number of shares decreasing from 606 million to 603 million, is increasing by 4.7%, from &#x20AC;1.44 to &#x20AC;1.51 per share. And schematically, that is a 5% increase, which can be broken down into two parts. One is currency and scope, explaining about half of it. 2.1% in currency, which is very much the reflection of what we have seen on the <mark type="ph" /> stairs (40:35) in particular. And 2.5% like-for-like growth, which, again, if you try to understand schematically is going to be, 6% <mark type="ph" /> top line (40:45) translation of minus 61 bps is minus 4%, roughly speaking. And, therefore, you get 2 points of EPS progression, plus 0.5 being the net of tax, financial charges and the rest. So 6% minus 4% plus 0.5 gives you 2.5% for the first half.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash, I'm not going to stay on this slide, rather go on the other. Free cash flow this first half has been &#x20AC;890 million. Again, that's down since the first half of last year which was &#x20AC;925 million, so it's down &#x20AC;35 million, principally attributable to CapEx which we have decided to phase in the first half a little bit more than last year, at &#x20AC;415 million, and with a working capital which remains &#x2013; keeps doing a lot of progress, going from &#x20AC;958 million and 5.2% of sales a year ago to in excess of &#x20AC;1 billion and 5.8% for the first time for 2012. So, still very sound cash flow dynamics.</p>
          <p>This cash has been used to pay dividends essentially, &#x20AC;890 million, dividends, &#x20AC;1 billion, which means that the debt has increased in the first half, which is very traditional and normal in our case, by &#x20AC;166 million. Out of the &#x20AC;1 billion dividends of course, &#x20AC;830 million, I believe, has been paid to the main shareholders and the rest has been paid to minority shareholders. So &#x20AC;166 million brings the debt to &#x20AC;6.8 billion, which is down versus a year ago. Our balance sheet, on the other hand, is up by 4%, reflecting a growth which is larger than the growth of our sales all together and including the ForEx effect.</p>
          <p>Two elements of the balance sheet, just one quick short about the debt to remind you that we have launched a U.S. bond issue in U.S. dollars in the first half, which basically allows us to diversify further on that and we've made a coupon of 3% over 10 years. So I believe that's all good in terms of managing, of course, the financing of the group. We have, obviously, a maturity profile which is absolutely safe.</p>
          <p>And, secondly, the transaction we've made with minority shareholders on which of Danone's -sorry, on which I'm going to spend a bit of time just to explain. So you all know that we have, as part of the debt of the group, as part of the &#x20AC;6.8 billion, an amount of put option which is approximately &#x20AC;3.5 billion. Out of this &#x20AC;3.5 billion, &#x20AC;2.2 billion, &#x20AC;2.153 exactly, correspond to the debt &#x2013; the put option, sorry, owed to the minority shareholders of Danone Spain.</p>
          <p>We have concluded the transaction with two of these minority shareholders by which we are going to buy from them their shares, moving, therefore, from 58% of Danone Spain to 67%, and we're going to pay that in cash purpose, &#x20AC;91 million of cash, and in treasury stock for the rest, which is &#x20AC;6 million, or 110,039 shares of Danone. Now, two things about that. The first is that's immediately, and when I say immediately this is in coming weeks, we are going to buy back these shares so as to neutralize the impact of the transaction and, therefore, that would be as a result paid in debt. The second thing is that if you calculate &#x20AC;91.5 million cash and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:00) at yesterday's stock price of 6 million treasury stock, you get to an amount of &#x20AC;380 million, which means that we have paid &#x20AC;380 million for cancelling a debt which was valued in our balance sheet at &#x20AC;460 million.</p>
          <p>Hence, the put option will have as a positive impact on the net debt of the group and the net equity, conversely, of &#x20AC;81 million, which is the difference between &#x20AC;380 million and &#x20AC;461 million. Secondly, as I said, there will be no dilution from our group shareholders since we are going to buy back -reconstitute immediately the treasury stock which we are using. And, third, as a result, the transaction is going to be accretive on the EPS this year, next year and the following.</p>
          <p>This transaction has been done with one minority &#x2013; sorry, two minority shareholders. The rest stay on board and we are having discussion with them to understand whether or not and to what to extent &#x2013; sorry, to what extent, not whether or not, the formula of their option needs to be adapted to take into account the evolution of the economic context, which, as you have seen, is pretty strong in Spain.</p>
          <p>I think it's pretty important &#x2013; I've read and heard a lot of things about that. I think it's pretty important for you to realize one simple thing. We are talking of options and debt which we have on our balance sheet which we've  been having, and which, if I take the transaction, are being replaced by another debt, but for a larger amount and, therefore, the downside for Danone is zero.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude with the outlook telling you that we obviously do not expect the economic environment to improve in the second half by any means. On the contrary, we think it could worsen during the second half. We feel, however, that our new objectives for the year are the right ones to keep building the group in this environment. We expect sales growth for the year at 5% to 7% after a first half which has been right in the middle at 5.9%, therefore, very close to 6%.</p>
          <p>On margins, we confirm our new target of minus 50 bps for the year, which means given that we have done minus 60 bps in the first half, that the second half will be at minus 40 bps with a more favorable comparison base on the cost side but the full impact of Southern Europe. And, last, we keep progressing well in our management of cash and working capital, as you have seen, and we confirm, therefore, our objective of &#x20AC;2 billion of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>I'm sorry to have been a bit long. I'll end up my presentation with that and I will take your questions together with Antoine. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Simon Marshall-Lockyer from Jefferies. Could you just set &#x2013; on the slide if your sort of targets which you adjusted &#x2013; whatever, a month ago, can you give us an idea of how you're thinking about A&amp;P for the rest of the year? Because obviously, that was quite a significant support for the margin in the first half that you actually came out with. So, should we be expecting the A&amp;P run rate as a percentage of sales to continue to be supportive in the second half in terms of margin at the same sort of rate of 58 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we've been trying in the past few months now and quarters to explain that the way we look at things given the composition of our portfolio, given the fact that we have Baby, Medical, which use different means to fuel their developments, the fact that R&amp;D rates, for instance, the rate of R&amp;D spending are very different from one division to the other, the fact that sales force is very different from one to the other, shows that A&amp;P and R&amp;D are important factor for development.</p>
          <p>So what's important to us is to keep on pushing on all these four levels in the way we think is more appropriate. So we'll certainly keep shooting the business and develop &#x2013; and use these levers to develop the business. On the A&amp;P specifically, what we said this quarter &#x2013; this half, sorry &#x2013; is that the A has been up slightly, not as fast as the sales, but has been up slightly. The P has been down. I would expect that trend to continue in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you venture to give us an indication of -in the context of basically more bang for your buck on your spend, can you give us an indication of where you're expecting that A&amp;P run rate to stabilize? So, for how long are we going to see the...</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:32) Simon, I think it's pretty clear for everyone that what we need in the kind of environment we have is flexibility. And, therefore, I would not give you an indication about the amount of A, the amount of P, and precise percentage of the coming semester, not only because I don't think this is appropriate, but also because I think we absolutely need to have an mind which is looking at the markets with an open mind and the ability to react to make the best out of it.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you maybe &#x2013; just as we stay on this a little longer, can you just maybe give us an idea, would it be correct to assume that most of the reduction of the run rate has occurred in Europe, and particularly in Southern Europe? Would that be a reasonable assumption? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, sir. Warren Ackerman at SG. A couple of questions on the European Dairy business. The first one is you said that you're looking at your pricing and your promos SKU by SKU in Spain. Your average premium is 100% to 120% versus private label in Spain. Have you got any early thoughts on what the right premium should be and how much higher this promotional intensity need to be in Spain? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>And the second one is A.C. Nielsen showed a 150 basis point rebound in your market share in Spain in June. Just wondering whether you can confirm if you have seen a pickup in market share in June? And if so, what was the driver behind that? Was it the Yolado launch? I know this is only one month's data but, obviously, there's a change in trend versus April and May.</p>
          <p>And then just finally, more widely on price points in European Dairy. Are you comfortable with your price points versus private label in other European countries? Are you doing the same work in other markets as you are in Spain, notably in Germany and Italy, where the price points versus private label are also around 100% plus? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll probably take them backwards. There is &#x2013; there are indeed other markets in which the average price point versus the market is high. And you're correct to mention the two markets, which are Italy and Germany. However, Italy and Germany are very different from Spain from the fact that they do not have, unlike Spain, a complete portfolio. Spain has a range of product which goes from Actimel, Activia, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:12), to whatever.</p>
          <p>In Germany, we're essentially selling Dan-o-nino, I mean, the equivalent version locally of Dan-o-nino, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:25) and Activia and Actimel, so the average &#x2013; the fact that the average price is higher has a reason behind it and that's very logical. The same applies to Italy. We have a portfolio which is not full and, therefore, there is a reason for that. So, we don't look at it the same way.</p>
          <p>About Spain and the premium, I mean, rather than entering into details, when we look at Spain, we basically think of it as converging towards what France has been doing. France used to have a pretty high level of premium in the past until 2008 which they have progressively adjusted to get to a position where they are, I believe, very competitive today.</p>
          <p>I think Spain has to follow the same trajectory, probably not at the same pace, with time. But definitely will have to converge a bit more towards France. Does it mean that the price promo will be higher, shorter, whatever in June, July, August? I don't think that's very relevant. I think, again, as for A&amp;P we need to be flexible and to adjust to the market. What you mentioned about the market share rebound in June is the counterpart is the fact that the category which was still positive in March and somehow at the beginning of April, negative in May has been really negative in June. Overall, I don't expect things to improve in Spain and Southern Europe. Going forward I think we just need to stay agile and be able to make these changes to our portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's clarify that point. You said that Spain's premium will converge towards France over time. Can you give us an idea where the French premium is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:30) it's going to move exactly from to the level of France within the coming 18 months. But I think the fair assumption to take is that over the coming two, three, four years maybe, probably two or three years, there will be a convergence to levels close or closer to the one of France.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sorry, just to be clear, so what is the difference at the moment between France and Spain of the gap. Update us so we can have an idea what that convergence might be over a longer period of time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; we're in line with the average in France, so &#x20AC;120 million, &#x20AC;130 million. In Spain, we're in excess of &#x2013; we're close to &#x20AC;200 million basically.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Eileen Khoo here from Morgan Stanley. I've got two questions. The first one is on China baby food. You reported really strong like-for-like numbers even after stripping out the one-offs. And in contrast, Mead Johnson actually cut their guidance yesterday, and they talked about slowdown in the Chinese infant milk formula category. So, could you help us kind of reconcile the two a little bit?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the U.S. yogurt market, the last time you spoke about it, you said that it was a two-horse race. And in light of the fact that General Mills has or is about to launch 35 new products, spending a lot on promotion, how do you think about that now? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on China first. Well, the truth is that over the past three years to four years, both Mead Johnson and ourselves have been very successful on this market. Both Mead Johnson and ourselves have been able to supply product to the consumer which is safe enough, addressing its needs and attractive, and we have, as a result, both developed our market shares.</p>
          <p>I see no reason to assume that this is not going to continue, or at least to assume that we have lost our strength. It may be that other people in the market are a bit stronger, but I would not assume that we have lost that strength. Simply when you look at what I just said about the past few years and you go into each and every quarter and month, there's been periods during which they've been ahead of us, periods during which we've been ahead of them.</p>
          <p>They've been growing very, very fast until recently, maybe less fast now. But basically, they're having a good job, I believe, at least the way we see them as a competitor. And we are doing a very good job as well, and trying to be strong in all the feats we can. And that's always been our position in China, i.e., to be strong in the super premium, but also in the premium but also in the mainstream. To be strong in China and also in Hong Kong, where we are traditionally a presence which was not as strong as that of Mead Johnson, and perhaps we're taking a bit of performance from there, renovating Dumex, which is &#x2013; Dumex Gold, which is a brand which is absolutely key for our development in China.</p>
          <p>I mean, all that is basically explaining that have a very good performance. But I would not read into the combination of the two news you've mentioned something more than just the numbers of the quarter of two players who are strong on this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to follow on that &#x2013; sorry, just the category growth itself, do you see that slowing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, fundamentally, no. Again, I've always said that I would expect over the years the category to rebalance in terms of growth to volume and less value. I still expect that. We have not seen this movement taking place significantly, and we don't see the category is going down.</p>
          <p>On the U.S., yeah, I think the two horse was not an expression of mine, but more of some other people who, indeed, forget about the third one, and there is a third one. General Mills after all is still the number two in the market. So I don't think everybody should forget about that. They're launching a lot of very interesting initiatives, including on the Greek. Let' see.</p>
          <p>I believe we have really done a lot of very solid things in the past one year. We've been putting ourselves under as much pressure as the one you had expressed when you looked at the evolution of market share in the past one year. Oikos is doing well. The rest of the portfolio is doing better. We are a leader in the market. We are the only one present both in Greek significantly and in the rest of the portfolio significantly. Nothing is finished; nothing is given for granted, but I think we are in a very good position.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Pierre-Andr&#xE9; and Antoine. Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is on the slight decrease of margin in baby food. Could you come back on that? Because volume growth is quite strong and price effect is also very strong. And so on the &#x2013; could you share a little bit more on what are the drivers behind that? Is there some cost of growth because you had some strong initiative in some emerging markets? Or what is behind that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I had your question translated by Antoine because I could not hear it very well. Good morning, first. Nice to hear you. So, I understand your question is about the trends in foods and the evolution of the food part of baby foods. Yes, indeed, I mean, again, nothing new. This is what's been happening in the past few years, i.e., we have decided and because we thought it was right thing to do to focus all the means we have on the milk and, in particular, on the development of <mark type="ph" /> grain and milk (1:02:20). We've done that everywhere.</p>
          <p>As the result, the means both human and financial we have allocated to food has been limited. And, as a result, probably as a result of our action as well, the category is not developing. And I think you have to add to that the fact that it is a bit more sensitive to consumption trends than milk would be.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm not worried, because that's been the result of conscious decisions, and because I believe with the kind of initiative I've shown you about the Bl&#xE9;dina du Jour, which is the fresh jars which is currently being tested in France, we have an idea and there will be others which will help make this segment of the market more dynamic going forward.</p>
          <p>But, again, we have to, assumer, as we say in French, accept, that we took the decision to focus on the milk. I believe everything shows that this was the right decision. And, therefore, yes, it means that the food is not growing, but this is a result of what we decided to do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Again, to try and address your question, and I'm not sure if I fully understood. But I understand your question is about the evolution of margin in baby, which is negative 9%. While the negative 9% is really a clear result of two factors. A, the significant part of the over inflation has been taking place in this division, i.e., the increase of the cost of whey and the increase of cost of protein. What it means for us is that we have to find and we are in the process of finding alternative material to these two elements, or at least to the first element, which is the whey. So the question is in the process of being fixed.</p>
          <p>And, secondly, baby is really investing a lot in getting the sales force to carry on and go with this growth. So, no worry on my side.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just a quick question regarding restructuring. I mean, it's always been a great virtue of Danone that you have not had &#x2013; can you hear me?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Sorry. I shall repeat the question, apologies. Historically, it's always been a great virtue of Danone that you've not taken the sort of big bang restructuring programs that some others have. But, with trends in Europe, particularly Southern Europe, do you not think there's maybe a need to be doing something a little bit more radical beyond just sort of productivity savings in terms of procurement and cost of goods, et cetera? Should you be thinking about the factory footprint thinking more about the overhead space? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. That's clear now. I think the words more radical is the question, if by more radical you intend more violent, brutal, sudden, I don't think we are going to follow that route. The way the group has decided to behave and keeps behaving is to act responsibly. Not only because it is in its belief but because we're a consumer company, and I think we need to keep being perceived as being responsible by consumers as well.</p>
          <p>So that's not only because of our values but because of the business we want to protect. It's never prevented us to adapt our core structure, including in a radical manner, meaning stronger than &#x2013; I mean, stronger in some moments.</p>
          <p>What's happening in Europe is obviously a call for us to having look at our cost base and try to be a bit more challenging when looking at our cost base. I have no doubt that we are going to do that, and in fact we are already doing that. But don't expect us to be radical the way you think about it and the way most of the other companies are doing because we don't this is the right way and we think we have been pretty successful at handling that in the past.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, gents. Thanks for taking the call. Just two questions for you. One is just on the Spanish minorities. I'm just wondering what is the contribution at that line currently to minorities? And I'm obviously just trying to work out how many tens of millions of euros will now go back to shareholders rather than the Spanish minorities right at the net profit line? Now, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second one just on &#x2013; obviously it's welcome to see you guys doing a bit of a buyback, the 6 million shares you talk about to neutralize the impact of that minorities issue. Just wondering do you have any more thoughts on further buybacks? You clearly say you don't want to go &#x2013; don't need to increase your investment grade rating. Or is it potentially you think that actually you might buy all of the Spanish minorities during this year and you would probably take the same action, i.e., sterilizing that by doing a buyback? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. So, [Foreign Language] (1:09:35) don't look at the buyback of the 6 million shares as a buyback. Look at it as the neutralization of the use of treasury stock for the transaction. So, basically, what you should think is that we are not doing any buyback, we're just doing a transaction with minority shareholders by which we buy them back in debt. That's the thing number one. So it will strengthen.</p>
          <p>Your question about buyback, when do you go back with buyback, we'll come back to you with more elements in the second half. It's not time to do that now for two reasons. Number one, we've been doing different things. We were expecting Wockhardt &#x2013; to know more about Wockhardt whether we did it or not. We have closed it yesterday. We have Morocco in the process. So, we have to get a bit more visibility. And at some stage, we'll come back and speak of buyback.</p>
          <p>The second one is the fact that anyway we have 6 million to buy, so from a strict operating standpoint, that would be the priority. On the rest of minority, frankly, I'm not assuming that we'll buy a significant amount of them in the coming months and in the rest of the year. It could come, but I'm not &#x2013; I have no reason to assume that it will be more. You should not assume that every time we do a transaction with them it will be similar to the one we have done here and, in particular, with respect to the use of treasury stock.</p>
          <p>And you should assume that systematically we'll be trying to replace the debt by another debt, the first debt being the protection by another debt, which will be a financial debt. And, therefore, that any transaction is going to be accretive. I think &#x2013; I hope I've given you enough elements to understand that. But that's the way we look at it.</p>
          <p>Will we go back to the room now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions. You mentioned that Spain will probably follow the path of France over time. Can you just give us some guidance about how that transition impacted profitability in Spain and, what, if any, decline in margins there were in France? And what, if any, decline there were in terms of margins and where French profitability is relative to group?</p>
          <p>And then, two, you mentioned a third player in U.S., and clearly there is. But we've also seen the partnership of &#x2013; excuse me, in Pepsi and M&#xFC;ller. And Pepsi is clearly wanting to be big in dairy given their interest in Russia as well, so is there perhaps a fourth significant player over time? And how do you feel about the potential for all this extra capacity coming on-stream in Greek to potentially put pressure on pricing there in the U.S.? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first, I mean, to make it short, France profitability in Dairy is is in line with the average. So, you see where the gap stands basically between the two. And, again, don't make me say what I didn't say.  I have no clear picture of Spain reaching by a precise timeframe the exact profitability of France, but I think it should converge.</p>
          <p>The second thing is &#x2013; the second question was about the U.S. engineers. Just to take your own words, over time, over time, yes. And over time what we've said is that if they manage to structure an effort  &#x2013; I mean, I assume they will be successful if they manage to structure an effort which will be adding something to the category, because I do not assume that they will try and drive by selling cheap products everywhere.</p>
          <p>And if they do add something to the category, they will add something to the overall category and, therefore, I think that's going to be beneficial. And now I could be hoping that this happens soon. I'm not sure it's going to be immediate. I think it will take them a bit of time, first of all, to have -- to switch on the engine of the factory, which I understand is not done yet, and then to build something which the customer can understand. But, yeah, I mean, I think some change in the category will be welcome.</p>
          <p>And, by the way, I've not heard that Pepsi is suffering in Russia. You've not heard that I'm suffering in Russia, so that is one market in the world in which we both deliver a good performance. And, by the way, there is no other because there is no other in which <mark type="ph" /> in Dairy (1:15:00).</p>
          <p>Yeah? I'm sorry. Jeremy?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:15:15) Morning. Jeremy Fialko, Redburn, here. A couple of questions. Firstly, another perhaps on the Spanish minority. I mean, it looks as though that particular group of shareholders sold for less than the value of the put option. So if you could just give a little bit of background as to why that is the case and whether or not you'd expect any subsequent purchase to actually be made for a lower value than the put option that you've got? And also if you could give us some idea of the multiple that you paid on that? And we can do our own estimates, but if you could give us some <mark type="ph" /> color (1:15:55), that would be useful.</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, in terms of the prospects of your sales growth accelerating in the second half, I know that you've spoken about being, quote "well in the 5% to 7% sales growth range for the full year." I wanted to check whether that would apply and what the prospects are for some better sales growth in Q3, given you've got the U.S. capacity, strong performance in Russia, and also a more favorable basis of comparison in Water? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I'll start with the second one because it's the short one. All the dynamics you mentioned are basically right. Q3 is going to be an easier base of comparison for Waters. And, at last, weather seems to be turning in the right direction. We'll have more capacity in the U.S., so that should help. We have normally an easier base in Russia, so that should help. But at the same time, we won't have one quarter in Spain, but two, in the second half. And I believe that Spain is going to slightly worse than what we have seen in Q2.</p>
          <p>All that makes us use the phrase well into, on which we had very, very long debate with Antoine, because we are both French and we want you to be sure to understand, and we had a long conversation with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:25), who confirmed that we are right to use the term well into, and that you would understand precisely what we mean. So, I assume you understand precisely what I mean.</p>
          <p>On the minority, I think the reason why &#x2013; I mean, I'm not going to enter into details of what's been, indeed, a private deal, but the reason is really the recognition that Spain is going into a &#x2013; yeah, a time which is very specific and certainly not reflected by the formula of the put option, that things have changed over time.</p>
          <p>And these people have agreed that we have to take it into account when we decide on the terms by which we buy this shareholding, which indeed is at a price which is <mark type="ph" /> higher (1:18:33) than the one we had on the balance sheet. That's, I think, our reasoning. We'll try to work with each and every person with which we need to have it going forward, and I'm not going to give you more details about that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>James Edwards Jones from RBC. Two quick questions, if I may. First on your chart on page 36, that margin bridge chart, you had a column for Other COGS which had a negative impact on the margin of 105 basis points. Can you just explain that, what that was?</p>
          <p>And, secondly, you're talking about a gradual shift from brand investment, I suppose, from A&amp;P into R&amp;D. At the moment, your R&amp;D to sales was a fraction of companies like Mead Johnson or Yakult. It's less than Nestl&#xE9;; it's less than Kraft. Where do you think that R&amp;D to sales could potentially get to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first one, Other COGS is really everything which is not material, so it's transformations, it's the cost of petrol, transportation, the cost of labor, the various things &#x2013; well, depreciation, of course, plus the cost of &#x2013; sorry, any new product development or ramp up of factories we are doing.</p>
          <p>So, it's basically everything which is not material, which is traditionally something which has inflation because your organization and the salaries you pay to people in many countries of the world, in particular in the emerging world. So nothing special about that. The specificity has been more on the cost of material.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D on sales, I mean, we're progressing. The good news is that with the level of R&amp;D, which is below that of Nestl&#xE9;, Kraft, Mead Johnson, Yakult and the likes, we are still doing a good job. So probably increasing by it further, we'll have the ability to improve as well our top line.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:21:00), yeah, that's something which you will see increasing and you will see increasing for two reasons. Number one, because we are dedicating more means. And number two, because of mix. One of the things you have to keep in mind when you look at these companies is, again, if you take Danone, and you break down the average R&amp;D as a percentage of sales, you would find that Medical, for instance, is in excess of 4%. You will find that Baby is clearly above the average. You will find that Water, obviously, is below 1%. So, as the mix of the products is growing, that's going to draw as well, to push the R&amp;D as a percentage of sales up.</p>

          <p>It's <mark type="ph" /> Jamie from Deutsche Bank (1:21:45). Just coming back to the Spanish minorities, a couple of questions. Can you let us know broadly when they came to you to signal they wanted to exercise that put option in these latest groups? And also, the broad make-up of the remainder, whether it's one or two big groups or dozens of individuals? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, I won't give you details about the timing of concession and so on, I don't want to enter into that kind of thing. What I can tell you is that as soon as the transaction is realized, we need to signal it and to publish it, which is today. So it means that the transaction was done yesterday. So that's one. For the rest, we're talking of &#x2013; yeah, we're talking of a number of families and a total number of minorities which probably will be in the range of 20 plus, out of which, 5, 6 will be more important than the others.</p>

          <p>A month ago, you said you were very confident or quite confident that the issues you've seen in Spain won't spill over to France. And I recognized there are a lot of different dynamics, the retail structure is different, your price points are different. But I wonder if anything has changed in the last month or so to alter that level of confidence? And can we be sure this is just a process of Spain migrating to France or is there risk of further slippage in other parts of Europe? Thanks. And just one other question, sorry, if I may. The &#x20AC;1.5 billion of puts in your debt outstanding, can you just remind us what's in that? Presuming some of that is Russia. But what else is in that?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry. Okay, I got it. Yeah, about Spain, I think the difference is that we've had three months now, or one more month and a half to look at things to better understand the trends of market. To see in April, which was really very difficult, and May, a bit better, at June a bit down, to see the evolution of the category, the evolution of competition, to see the effect of some launches, to understand the elasticity. So we definitely have more elements and many more elements. And better understanding means that we feel more confident about what we can do and not do.</p>
          <p>I am also a bit more confident because we've basically taken assumptions. I mean, we've had the opportunity to understand that the assumptions we've taken or we are taking for the rest of the year, to me, look pretty conservative now. If Spain was completely melting, obviously, the impact would be different. But when I look at Spain for the rest of the year, I'm expecting 5% to up to 10% decline of our sales, and I know this is something I can manage. And so I have a better comfort on understanding the validity and stress of my assumptions going forward. Again, a lot of things can happen, but I think we're doing the right assumption concerning this market.</p>
