          <p>Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company's Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have questions.</p>
          <p>I would like to now introduce Ann Taylor, Vice President and Director of Investor Relations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for being with us today. I am joined by Neville Isdell, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Muhtar Kent, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent SEC report.</p>
          <p>In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at thecoca-colacompany.com under the Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconcile our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to certain non-GAAP measures which may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning and from time to time in discussing our financial performance. Please look at our website for this information.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call over to Neville.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ann, and good morning everyone. I'm going to start this morning with a few brief observations about the results, and also highlight some of our accomplishments for 2007. Muhtar will then provide details of operational performance and our priorities for the current year, followed by Gary's overview of the financials and some additional perspective on 2008.</p>
          <p>Today, we reported a very positive finish to 2007, with another solid quarter of business results.  A strong 5% unit case volume growth and 12% ongoing EPS growth capped an excellent year for the Coca-Cola Company.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, all operating units reported volume growth despite tough comparisons in some key markets. We benefited from the diversity of our geographic reach and our breadth and also the breadth of our product portfolio. We delivered consistent financial performance and achieved results ahead of our long term growth model in each quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>By successfully executing our clearly defined strategies, we achieved the following full year results: 6% unit case volume growth, led by our international operations up 8% and robust 4% sparkling and 12% still beverage growth; 20% net revenue growth, even when you exclude the acquisition of bottlers, net revenue grew 12%; ongoing operating income growth of 14%; comparable earnings per share of 14%; and cash flow from operations up 20%.</p>
          <p>Notably, this is our 11th consecutive quarter of delivering at least 4% volume growth. The strong top line performance is translating to bottom line results as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit comparable EPS.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we sold over 1.2 billion incremental unit cases, 1 billion being organic, not acquisition related. What this actually means is that our consumers refresh themselves 1.5 billion times each day with one of our beverages.</p>
          <p>We are a company moving successfully by our executing against a clear strategic growth agenda. Across the company and throughout the system, talented people are driving growth and developing a culture of innovation and also improving efficiency. We realize the journey is long and we are by no means declaring victory, but we can confidently say that we have a solid foundation upon which to deliver long term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we put our Manifesto for Growth into action, in fact we now call it the Manifesto in Action. We made commitments to strengthen our sparkling portfolio, to enhance our position in still beverages, to improve our capabilities in consumer marketing, customer leadership, and franchise leadership, and ensure that our business is sustainable.  I'm pleased to report that we delivered against each one of these commitments and are well positioned to do so again in 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Specifically, we strengthened our position in sparkling beverages with trademarks Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta all delivering solid unit case growth.  In fact, overall we captured 72% of the global sparkling beverage industry growth for the year.  Trademark Coca-Cola continued to be the key driver with Coca-Cola Zero driving expansion of the category and gaining share. Coca-Cola Zero is now in 55 countries and it has become our 12th billion-dollar brand.  Moreover, we are executing against our three-cola strategy with passionate and award winning global marketing campaigns.  This strategy has delivered the highest growth in trademark Coca-Cola since 1998.</p>
          <p>As I've discussed in the past, sparkling beverages are going to continue to be the backbone of our global growth in both developed and emerging markets.  Through integrated marketing and connection of our brands to consumer passion points like the Olympics, EURO 2008, American Idol, and Super Bowl, we are uniquely positioned to capture the highly profitable sparkling beverage opportunity.  We also enhanced and expanded our still beverage business through organic growth and targeted bolt-on acquisitions.  The biggest headline was our acquisition of Glac&#xE9;au and its Vitamin Water brand, the fast growing premier active lifestyle beverage and it has now become our 13th billion-dollar brand.  The acquisition has changed the game in North America beverages and helped align the Coca-Cola system to invest behind a winning portfolio of brands.</p>
          <p>Beyond that one headline is continued global success across categories. Trademark Minute Maid increased unit cases 5%, driven by the expansion of Minute Maid Pulpy in China and other emerging markets. We built a strong global juice position in all of the BRIC countries: Brazil with Jugos del Valle and Sucos Mais, Russia with the Multon brand, India with Maaza and now Minute Maid, and of course China where Minute Maid Pulpy is the number one brand in key metro markets.</p>
          <p>In sports drinks and water, we continue to look for the highest value opportunities and drive innovation through functional enhancements.  Additionally, we are starting to make progress in the ready-to-drink tea and coffee categories. While we are number one globally in both categories, we are continuing to innovate in house as well as work with our global partners Nestl&#xE9; and Illy to capture the opportunity in these fast growing categories.</p>
          <p>This solid performance across the portfolio resulted in our company growing faster than the industry and capturing close to a quarter of the 5.5 billion incremental, non-alcoholic ready-to-drink unit cases sold in 2007. We gained non-alcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share globally driven by share increases in both sparkling and still beverages.</p>
          <p>Our progress in consumer marketing and commercial leadership sparked new interest in our expanding portfolio among shoppers, retail customers, and our bottling partners.  The Coke Side of Life, Happiness Factory &#x2013; The Movie, and other award winning marketing programs have reignited the energy and the optimism right to the core of our brands. And our bottling partners are investing behind the business and they are driving inspirational market themselves at the point of sale. The combined efforts across the system are working and driving our winning performance every day in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Next, a commitment that has become a true passion for me; we recognize that we cannot have a sustainable business unless the communities that we serve are themselves sustainable. Our commitments center around four key touchstones: water, where we announced our new global partnership with the World Wide Life Fund to preserve seven of the world's important watersheds and to become water neutral in all our beverage production processes; packaging, where we see opportunities to turn today's waste products into valuable resources for the future.  We announced a significant expansion of our US recycling efforts by investing $60 million, including the building of the world's largest PET bottle-to-bottle recycling plant in South Carolina. And just last night, we announced our long term target to recycle or reuse 100% of our aluminum beverage cans which we sell in the US, which builds on our previously announced goal to recycle or use &#x2013; reuse 100% of our PET plastic bottles.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are intensifying our efforts to reduce carbon emissions. As an example, at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, we will provide more than 5,000 climate-friendly coolers and vending machines.  And finally, well-being; we need all consumers to understand the equation of calories-in and calories-out. We provide a range of beverage choices for our consumers and believe they thrive at the nexus of refreshment and nutrition. They all play a role in a balanced diet for all age groups.</p>
          <p>Overall, I'm pleased with our accomplishments and strong performance in the quarter and the year. We have put in place a strong foundation and remain confident in our outlook for 2008. While we continued to monitor the weakness in the US economy, we remain optimistic about the resiliency of our portfolio, particularly in the developing and emerging markets.  Of course, our eyes are wide open and we will continue to analyze and respond appropriately off this strong base.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Muhtar, I would like to make a few comments about our announcement in December. As you know, we announced plans to begin a seamless transition of the CEO responsibilities to Muhtar effective July 1, 2008. This is something that I've been engaged with the Board on since my return in 2004.  I have always believed that effective succession must be planned early in the game and also must be one of the core imperatives of how you manage the company. I have worked closely with Muhtar for nearly 20 years. I'm confident that his combination of industry knowledge, operational excellence, strategic vision, and commitment to our people, which he has already demonstrated as President in 2008, will continue to take our company forward.</p>
          <p>With that then, let me now turn the call over to Muhtar to provide the details on our operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Neville, and good morning to everyone. The strong results we have achieved in the quarter completed what was a successful year for the company strategically, operationally, and financially. The consistent execution of our strategic agenda and the renewed vigor and confidence across the organization enabled us to deliver balanced geographic and portfolio growth throughout the year.  The fourth quarter was no different as four of our operating units once again delivered positive volume growth. Clearly the system's investments behind its brands, its people, and its capabilities are paying off, and we have built a strong foundation for sustainable long term performance.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of last year, I outlined my key priorities for 2007 and I am proud to say that due to the dedication of our people around the world, we have made significant progress each of those initiatives.  First, our international operations continue to be the primary driver of growth for the company.  Volume performance exceeded our long term growth target in every quarter of 2007.  This success reflects the disciplined execution and local approach of our bottling partners every day in the marketplace and the connection of our brands with consumers around the world.</p>
          <p>Second, in North America we took a number of aggressive actions which addressed some of our challenges and enabled us to deliver on our commitment of sequential improvement in the second half of 2007.   We remain committed to restoring consistent growth in our home market while becoming the preferred beverage partner for our customers.</p>
          <p>Third, our system-wide efforts resulted in an improved efficiency for faster decision-making and operating expense savings.  These savings created operating expense leverage and were partially reinvested to drive top line growth.</p>
          <p>And finally we continued to push the envelope with innovation in product, packaging, delivery, as well as customer service. The global success of Coca-Cola Zero, our most successful launch in the past 25 years, is a perfect example of this.</p>
          <p>Today, I would like to share with you details on our progress and add some perspective on our priorities for 2008.  Our international operations continued their strong performance and increased full year unit case volume by 8%.  The performance was broad based as evidenced by 19 of our key 22 markets delivering positive growth.  Unit case volume growth in our international operations was led by the emerging markets.  For the year, we achieved double digit unit case volume growth in such markets as China, India, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Eastern Europe, and southern Eurasia.  In the Philippines, since we acquired control of the bottling operations, we also have delivered double digit growth.  Africa also produced solid balanced growth across key markets including a 13% growth in South Africa.</p>
          <p>Whilst it is clear that we are maintaining our focus in winning internationally, there are a few key markets that I would like to highlight where aligned system execution is delivering progress and results.  Latin America continues its success with all business units delivering solid growth. Latin America is now our largest operating group in volume terms, selling over 6 billion unit cases.   It is also our second most profitable operating unit with 1.75 billion in operating income. Mexico increased unit case volume 6% while Argentina increased 9% and Brazil delivered double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>This strong performance reflects the success of our strategy to drive growth in sparkling beverages led by Trademark Coca-Cola and expand our footprints in still beverages, both organically as well as through acquisitions such as Jugos del Valle. The strong performance in Mexico is particularly noteworthy as it validates our ability to transfer best practices to drive balanced growth in high per capita markets all around the world.  In Mexico, our highest per capita market in the world, we added another 25 servings per person in 2007. The growth across the portfolio led to share gains in both sparkling as well as still beverages for the group.</p>
          <p>The European Union group has established a solid foundation for sustainable growth, evidenced in the balanced geographic and category performance. Our marketing programs and strong execution of our bottling partners provided the platform to overcome a difficult summer weather comparison from 2006.  For the year, unit case volume increased 3%, successfully cycling 6% growth in the prior year, as we achieved solid growth in most key markets.</p>
          <p>We are encouraged by our progress in Great Britain, which returned to growth in the fourth quarter. Full year volume results in Germany were positive, although volume was slightly down in the quarter as we cycled strong growth in the prior year quarter. We continue to make progress in this market as demonstrated by our move to a one-bottler system and remain confident that we are building a foundation of consistent, sustainable performance in Germany over time.</p>
          <p>Europe delivered solid growth in the sparkling beverages, up 2% and still beverages up 15% for the year. Sparkling growth was driven by 3% growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, including the continued success of Coca-Cola Zero, now in 21 countries in the EU. The strong performance of still beverages was the result of solid organic growth in Minute Maid along with Nestea, Aquarius, POWERade, and Burn, as well as targeted bolt-on acquisitions.  The brand performance led to volume and value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages for the quarter and the full year. It is clear that we have the right strategies in place and the EU leadership team is effectively managing our business with the goal of delivering consistent, sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we also validated or track record of rapidly addressing problem markets and delivering on our commitment to restore growth to those markets. Let me give you some examples. Japan delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of unit case volume growth, cycling 2% growth in the prior quarter. Importantly, all four key trademarks delivered growth. The double digit volume increase in trademark Coca-Cola drove sparkling beverage growth. Execution of the three-cola strategy led to trademark or Coca-Cola achieving its highest volume growth rate in 30 years.</p>
          <p>Georgia grew 1% in the quarter, its first growth in eight quarters. The performance was driven by growth of the 190 milliliter can in the vending channel.  The results reflect progress against our previously shared plans to stabilize Georgia's performance. Aquarius and key brands Sokenbicha, Kuat and Guarana, and Iatacca also continued to perform strongly with innovation and solid integrated marketing execution leading to all four brands gaining share for the year.</p>
          <p>We have gained significant traction in Japan during 2007. With our management team in place and the help of our brand performance improving, we will continue to build upon a stabilized business in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to the Philippines. After acquiring the bottling franchise in March 2007, we committed to quickly stabilize the key markets and demonstrate sequential improvements throughout 2007. Our team's efforts to seamlessly integrate and improve execution through improved availability and focus on rapid execution resulted in performance ahead of our original expectations and volume growth for the full year.  We continue to invest in market capabilities and cold drink equipment while driving supply chain efficiencies. We remain confident that our management team will continue to drive growth in 2008 in the Philippines.</p>
          <p>Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of our international operations. We have a talented and experienced team of operators across the system and our bottling partners are aligned to deliver high quality broad based growth while investing to solidify the foundation for sustainable growth in the future.</p>
          <p>Let me now discuss the progress we're making in North America. In the fourth quarter, we achieved 1% unit case volume growth, the second consecutive quarter of growth, and we delivered on our commitment of sequential improvement in the second half of 2007. We continue to focus on revitalizing the sparkling beverage category with our three-cola strategy: Red, Black, and Silver.  For the year all three brands gained category share. Coca-Cola Zero continued to deliver strong double digit unit case volume growth even after two years in the marketplace. Our key priorities for Coca-Cola Zero are continue to build trial, increase awareness, and furthering channel penetration.</p>
          <p>For the second year in a row, the Coke Side of Life ads that were featured during the Super Bowl telecast were amongst the favorites of both media critics and viewers. "It's Mine", where the nice guy finishes first in a tussle for a Coke over the streets of Manhattan, made the top 10 list in USA TODAY's ad meter and also was the most popular non-alcoholic beverage commercial ad of nine beverage ads that aired during the Super Bowl event.</p>
          <p>The glac&#xE9;au acquisition continues to perform beyond our expectations as the trademark achieved triple digit unit case volume growth in the quarter, driven by both for sales velocity and increased availability.  Additionally we successfully moved distribution to a hybrid model to take advantage of the strength of our system while leveraging glac&#xE9;au's unique routes-to-market strategy.  I'm pleased to report that the transition to our bottlers has been successful. This acquisition has aligned our North America system and we continue to expect the acquisition to act as a catalyst for growth across our entire North America business.</p>
          <p>While we have made significant strides with our portfolio and organization in 2007, we still have much to accomplish. Overall, however, I am confident that our North America system is executing against the right priorities and we remain relentlessly committed to our goal in returning our home market to sustainable growth. Our successes with Coca-Cola Zero, glac&#xE9;au, POWERade, FUZE, Full Throttle, Minute Maid, Simply Juices, Dasani, and our recent investment in Honest Tea provide the business a much stronger base from which to build in 2008.  Our bottling partners are aligned and the system is in an improved position to serve our customers and compete in the marketplace even with an uncertain US macroeconomic environment.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to share the progress we've made in driving efficiency and effectiveness. As I said, the result of productivity ultimately is leverage in the income statement. In 2007, we successfully achieved this in the core business as well as in our Bottling Investment Group. We have flattened our organization from 80 fully functional offices to 37 business units across the world. This allows us to improve the speed of decision making and it improves our effectiveness.</p>
          <p>We executed Lean productivity initiatives at our concentrate manufacturing facilities and were able to increase capacity as well as operational efficiency. This resulted in the elimination of costs associated with the concentrate plant in Ireland. Within Bottling Investments, we reallocated expenses from manufacturing and production supply chain and invested in market facing roles to further drive execution in the trade.</p>
          <p>For The Coca-Cola Company, productivity remains a critical growth enabler to ensure the sustainability of our results over time. Looking forward, we see three main areas of opportunity: first, supply chain optimization, which will allow our system to maintain or enhance our gross margins and increase affordability of our product; second, marketing and innovation effectiveness, where we optimize investments behind our brands and leverage global best practices; and third, operating efficiency, which we use to fuel growth and build the foundation for future performance. This includes the ability to fund investments behind the highest impact innovations in product, packaging, ingredients, as well as equipment.</p>
          <p>As I look forward into 2008, part of the reason I remain confident is a result of the robust planning process we completed with our bottling partners. We have the plans in place to drive towards our ultimate goal of sustainable growth. We are focused on five strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>First, continue to drive growth from our leadership position in sparkling beverages.  Sparkling beverages provide the oxygen to our business. We know there is tremendous opportunity to grow all of our sparkling products in both developed as well as emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Second, drive faster growth in our still beverage portfolio by adding new functional benefits, developing affordable formulations, pursuing strategic bolt-on acquisitions, and seeking margin enhancements.</p>
          <p>Third, continue to generate and leverage the balanced growth that we have achieved across our geographic footprint. Growth in our emerging and BRIC markets remain robust even as headwinds are developing in the US economy. In North America, our business is stronger.  Our bottlers continue to invest, and we are better positioned from a portfolio and operating structure basis.</p>
          <p>Fourth, accelerate the commercialization of our innovation pipeline through aggressive investments in products, ingredients, packaging, and equipment.</p>
          <p>Fifth, further strengthen our system capabilities; consumer marketing, commercial leadership and franchise leadership remain our core capabilities. We will continue to drive productivity across our system so that we can expedite decision-making and rapidly respond to the changing marketplace. Savings extracted from these initiatives will enhance our ability to achieve consistent and sustained growth.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, leadership development is a top priority across our system, fostering even more collaboration, accountability, clarity, and calculated risk taking than ever before.</p>
          <p>Supporting all of this is our staunch belief in the health of our business, supported by the sustainability of the communities we serve. We understand that by acting as an engaged positive corporate citizen, we help create communities of favorably disposed consumers.  And as those communities grow, our business continues to flourish.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased with the results we achieved and the progress we made against our strategic agenda. As we enter 2008, we will be watching carefully the volatility in the macroeconomic environment. From the strengthened foundation which I referred to earlier, we are better prepared to weather any potential challenges. I look forward to 2008 being another successful year for The Coca-Cola Company.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call over to Gary. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning. As Neville and Muhtar indicated, the fourth quarter was a solid finish to the year where we are achieved strong consistent performance in all quarters. As you saw in the release, reported earnings per share was $0.52 on a diluted basis for the fourth quarter, an increase of 79%. This included a net charge of $0.06 per share, primarily related to restructuring charges and some asset write-downs.</p>
          <p>Therefore, after considering items impacting comparability in both the current and prior year, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.58 versus $0.52 in the prior year, an increase of 12%. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit EPS growth, and it's important to note that we successfully cycled our toughest quarterly comparison, cycling double digit growth in both ongoing operating income and earnings per share in Q4 2006, again with double digit growth in Q4 2007.</p>
          <p>I'm sure you have also noticed that our volume growth rate for the quarter was 5% versus our full year growth of 6%. We believe this is a very solid result. Sparkling beverages grew 4% for the quarter and for the full year. Still beverages increased 11% versus full year 12%. This quarter was impacted by a strategic decision to de-emphasize low value water in several countries such as China, which caused volume to round down to 5% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the year, reported earnings per share increased 19% to $2.57. This included a net charge of $0.13 per share, primarily related to restructuring charges. After considering items impacting comparability in both years, earnings per share was $2.70 versus $2.37 in the prior year, a 14% increase.</p>
          <p>For the year, unit case volume growth was 6%, in line with concentrate sales. Revenue growth was 20% and 12% excluding structural changes related to bottler acquisitions. The increase was driven by a 6% increase in concentrate, a 4% currency benefit, and a 2% favorable impact from price and mix. After considering factors impacting comparability, operating income growth was 14% and 10% on a currency neutral basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of margins, our core business remains healthy and expanded margins for the full year as we drove top line growth and delivered operating expense leverage. Bottling investments continues to improve margins as well.</p>
          <p>Cash from operations for the year increased 20% to $7.1 billion on strong underlying business performance and a decrease in working capital.  We repurchased approximately $1.75 billion of our stock for the full year, in line with our prior guidance. Additionally, the company paid 3.1 billion in dividends to shareowners for 2007. This contributed to a 30% total return to our shareowners.</p>
          <p>Now let me address some of the factors we see impacting the company in 2008. As you know, our long term growth targets are 3 to 4% volume growth, 6 to 8% ongoing currency neutral operating income growth, and high single digit earnings per share growth. We successfully exceeded these targets in 2007. Our picture of success will be to continue to exceed these targets. We recognize that there is some uncertainty, particularly as it relates to the US economy.  However, as Muhtar said, we remain committed to restoring growth in our home market and believe our business is well positioned to navigate headwinds that might develop.</p>
          <p>Emerging and BRIC markets have maintained their robust growth even against the backdrop of uncertainty in the US market and we remain positive on the global macroeconomic outlook, especially in many of these emerging markets. As Muhtar detailed, we will continue to focus on driving efficiency and effectiveness across our organization and we will utilize the realized benefits to further improve our ability to deliver consistent and sustained performance.</p>
          <p>On commodity cost, 2007 was certainly a difficult year with cost pressures from several of our key system inputs, particularly in North America. Commodity cost volatility remains a risk. However, as we said on the third quarter call, for 2008 we continue to expect to see a moderation in commodity cost pressures. Currently, our assumptions on commodity costs versus 2007 are a slight increase for the system and essentially flat for the company.</p>
          <p>We expect to deliver operating expense leverage on both the core and bottling business in 2008. And we will continue to invest behind our brands and innovation initiatives. Additionally, selling and service expenses will increase as we invest for growth in our bottling operations as well as investments behind our brand acquisitions, particularly in North America.</p>
          <p>General and administrative expenses were tightly controlled in 2007 and we will continue our disciplined approach in 2008.</p>
          <p>We would expect net interest cost to increase for 2008 as we carry a full year of higher debt associated with our 2007 acquisitions.</p>
          <p>For 2008, our best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will be between 22 and 22.5%.</p>
          <p>From a capital expenditure standpoint, we purchased approximately 1.4 billion in net PP&amp;E during 2007.  For 2008, we expect the total company net capital expenditures will be approximately 1.6 to 1.7 billion as we make investments in recently acquired bottling operations.</p>
          <p>And we anticipate that our range of share repurchase on a gross basis will be 1.5 to $2 billion this year.</p>
          <p>Now let me move to currency. We are effectively covered for the full year on the yen and for the first three quarters of 2008 on the other key hard currencies. Based on anticipated benefits of current hedging coverage in place, the company expects currencies to have a minimal impact on operating income in 2008.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me say a few words about quarterly phasing. As many of you know, we report unit case volume on an average daily sales basis, kind of like same-store sales, to eliminate comparability issues due to calendar variations. For 2008, we will have one extra day since it is a leap year. The first quarter will have one fewer day than Q1 '07 and the fourth quarter will have two more days versus Q4 '07. This will not impact our unit case sales reporting but will impact our concentrate sales and therefore revenues. Additionally, also remember that Easter will shift from Q2 last year into Q1 this year.</p>
          <p>Those are the topics that I wanted to cover. Now we can turn it over to your questions. Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Just looking at the fourth quarter volume trends globally, you've talked about a bit of a slowdown sequentially.  I'm just wondering how much of the decision to de-emphasize the water brand really impacted the global volume number?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Judy; this is Muhtar. Basically we had &#x2013; sparkling growth was both the same number for the full year as well as for the fourth quarter. And we still achieved 6% growth in sparkling in our international business, so we're very pleased with that trend. What you see is a slight slowing down of the still beverages, mainly water in that because we have had growth in juice, good growth in juice comparable to the full year; same also in sports, also for tea and coffee.  Essentially it has been a de-emphasizing of the water business in big large markets, particularly in Asia, like China, as well as in Indonesia, and therefore and mainly as a result of that category being low value for us.  So it has been a specific action on our part and we feel very confident about our business in all the categories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just kind of following up on that in terms of looking at this over the next 12 to 24 months and thinking about the macro outlook and you sounded still pretty positive about the macro, but just in terms of whether there are any regions or markets that may be a bit more concerning if the US starts to show a bigger slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Judy, Neville here. By the way, just one other thing on the water just to give you a data point; full year growth was 13%.  If we take our vitamin water here, the quarter was 8%. So that gives you the metric in terms of what happened with regard to water in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We don't see there being a major impact on the emerging economies or the developing economies. There will be one or two economies in the developed world where there will be housing bubbles where we think there will be some pullback. But balanced with that, we think the momentum that we have behind our existing brands and the new brands, the better execution, all the things that we talked about in our call, are such that we are going to be able to manage what may be a 0.5% decline at the worst in terms of overall global growth. And I think we already addressed the US issue. So, let me put it to you this way.  We feel we've really got a strong tailwind behind our business and that is going to carry us through 2008, even as we see some areas where there will be some economic dislocation.</p>

          <p>Good morning everybody. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the Pacific division, which decelerated sequentially aside from the China water strategy, some of the other markets that you didn't discuss in the release, Indonesia, Korea, there were some reasons there for the sequential deceleration versus the prior quarters and what efforts you're doing in those markets to improve the growth. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, hi. Essentially Indonesia was specifically related again to a slowdown of the water, just like we mentioned for China. As far as Korea is concerned, as you know, we've had a transition of our bottling partnership there and we are very confident that our new partnership and alignment with our new bottling partner there will take us into a modality of growth in Korea for the years to come, and we are very confident about that. And there has been a slight slowing down in the Australian economy. But we feel generally confident that our business will perform in terms of past historical trends in 2008 quarter by quarter in the Pacific.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, just to pick up on Korea; I think there is a real pattern here that you've seen with us in terms of acquisitions. In some instances, we were able to turn it around very quickly, like the Philippines. In others, there have been more in depth reforms required. Germany would be one example of that. And we take the pain along the way and that's really Korea. That's the story of Korea. And we are confident that we'll see that one turning around. I think we've got a good track record in that. We can deliver against it.</p>

          <p>A question on operating leverage. If you look at the 10% I guess organic or currency neutral operating profit growth for the year, if you could give us a breakdown of how much of that growth was acquisitions, how much was cost savings, and then how much was underlying organic growth? And then as we look into '08, you've taken &#x2013; the company has taken over $400 million of charges over the last two years.  What's the payback on some of the restructuring actions? And as we look at '08, what should we be thinking about in terms of productivity as a contributor to profit growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Bryan. We hesitated only for a minute because as we take these questions, we're just trying to make sure that in fact you are who you say you are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That has been experienced by a few companies over the last couple of weeks. As we look at it, let me take you through a couple of different ways. Basically if you look at currency neutral operating income, we've gotten about &#x2013; of the 10% growth, about 8% of that is out of the core concentrate business.  About a point is out of the Bottling Investments Group, and about a point out of acquisitions, so that's how it comes to your 10% operating income growth currency neutral. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Relative to the charges, we in fact had within OpEx and let me just talk about &#x2013; the quarter and the year kind of the same; what we did this year, we had significant increase actually in marketing because we continue to invest behind the brands, and we in fact accelerated some of that in the fourth quarter because we've had a really good year, and we recognized that we have the flexibility to do that, to continue to drive the growth that we are seeing across all of our markets.</p>
          <p>Within sales and service, it has been up, but primarily it has been up because of the acquisitions, primarily the bottlers, but you'll see some continued increase from that, not only there, but also the brands. Within G&amp;A, in fact the G&amp;A in the fourth quarter, on a-- if you kind of make it apples to apples, G&amp;A in the fourth quarter was up 3% and 100% of that was due to incentive plans that we have accrued for long term plans because we have actually exceeded and it's where we want to be.</p>
          <p>Relative to restructuring charges, the biggest restructuring charges this year was really around closing a concentrate in Ireland, which will be completely closed by midyear 2008. It was a result as we have said from applying lean manufacturing techniques to that and we've been able to in fact shut down a whole plant without any increases anywhere else. We're taking those, some of that's going to the bottom line, but a lot of that we're reinvesting actually behind the brands and into innovation to really drive the sustainability of this business over the long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it fair to say that the pool of productivity is going to be bigger in '08 than it was in '07?  It's just a matter of how much you spend back and how much you flex to the bottom line?</p>

          <p>Yes. I'd just like to make one comment just to build on what Gary said. I mean you will see us relentlessly focusing across the entire organization on the effectiveness and the efficiency measures and also the programs. As we said, we will take some of that to create more expense leverage on the P&amp;L and we will continue to invest for the health of our brands long term.</p>

          <p>Bryan, just on the fourth quarter of marketing spend, when I came back, I discovered that we had major markets in the fourth quarter that weren't spending a penny. The numbers weren't that good, but they still weren't spending a penny. We're back up at a level now where we've got 12 months' good solid support running behind our brands, and that's part of what you saw in the fourth quarter. So we're in good shape now coming into '08.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks; good morning everyone. Muhtar, I was hoping on your priorities, specifically the one about accelerating still beverage growth, you could peel the onion a bit more for us there.  Talk a little bit about the role of existing brands in that acceleration, the role of new brands, and give us some idea if you can about regions where you see the opportunity being bigger than other regions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that as I said, the key is organic growth.  As I said in my remarks, organic growth is the oxygen of our business and you will see us continue to drive innovation in organic growth in still beverages. I think the Minute Maid brand and the success of it in markets like China and Vietnam, Korea is a great example of that, I think you will see us &#x2013; we've just launched that also in India and it's doing very, very well.  You will see us focused on Glac&#xE9;au internationally. You will see us certainly adding much more functionality and benefits to our still portfolio through innovation.</p>
          <p>I'd like to just highlight one thing that Neville said. We are now the leader in juice in all four BRIC markets.  That's an incredible footprint. When you look at Brazil, when you look at Russia with our Dobry brand, when you look at Brazil with Jugos del Valle and Sucos Mais, and when you look at China with the Minute Maid Pulpy across all metro markets, number one; in India with Maaza, both in the mango category of juice as well as &#x2013; in the leading mango category as well as in the citrus now with our new launch, and many other emerging markets. So, you will see us focused much more on organic growth.  We've got a great portfolio, and we have a great innovation pipeline that we will drive through that portfolio.</p>

But you've had maybe 6, 7, 8 months to test the water from a just consumer buy-in or potential for buy-in in markets other than the US, other than North America.

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Quick question on Japan, it looks like as though the fourth quarter of this year was only about the second positive volume number on a positive comp in the past couple of years, the last being last year's Q4. So can you talk a little bit about the ability to sustain that, what level of operating profit you've been delivering in Japan on a currency neutral basis over the past year or so?  And can you keep the volume positive while maybe needing to accelerate the operating profit growth there over the next couple of years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John. I have said that clearly our target was to stabilize Japan. And we have done that in 2008 and we have consecutively &#x2013; in 2007 and we've consecutively delivered quarter after quarter growth. We are now in a much more normalized position in Japan, so you will see us delivering between 1 and 3% growth over the years. That's our target; that's basically how we see the picture of success.</p>
          <p>We expect modest profit growth in Japan.  Importantly also as we have stabilized Japan in 2007 and from the end of 2006 and into 2007, what we see now also is that our bottling partners are in a much more strengthened position.  Their willingness to invest in the marketplace is much more and I think that you're seeing one of the key categories in Japan.  One of also the important things in Japan in 2007 was that we had growth in two of the key channels, both in the vending channel as well as in the supermarket channel. And the vending channel of course as you know is a very highly profitable, important channel. And our bottlers' willingness to continue to invest will drive further growth in that channel is our belief.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it sounds as though your levels of incremental investment over the past couple of years, it sounds like you feel like you have normalized the margins maybe there and we should see a more normalized growth rate going forward?  Is that the right way to look at it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we stabilized the business and we are looking for a more normalized growth rate in Japan going forward. We believe also that we've strengthened our brands in all of the categories.  Sparkling notably in 2007 was a key category that has grown, particularly trademark Coca-Cola, very pleasing; double digit growth, the highest in 30 years.  The tea category is also growing and very healthy in terms of our brands as well as Aquarius; and as I mentioned in the call, we've also had a growth in Georgia coffee in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning everyone. My question relates to some of these bottling JVs. You now have a growing collection of these non-carb JVs building around the world.

          <p>First, Carlos, good morning. Let me just say that we're very pleased at where our bottling relationships are in terms of how we are aligned, how we are planning together in joint for us, and how we see the future and the picture of success jointly together.  It's a very simple reason why we have these JVs because we believe the categories that we have these JVs are much better suited to be operated through these JVs like we have now formed in Latin America for our juice acquisition and like the one that we have in Europe. And it basically creates the focus; it creates the scale and it creates the economics that deals properly with the categories and allows the bottling partners and us to focus on how we build that business together.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. Gary, I had a question for you regarding your buyback plans for 2008. You've indicated similar levels in '08 to 2007, which was under my impression pulled back based on your acquisition of glac&#xE9;au.  Can you help us understand given that your cash flows can allow a larger buyback, what's going into that consideration? I understand CCE plans to buy back.  Perhaps there are other considerations there.  Can you help us understand why that level is where it is for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, or at least I'll try. Let me go through that. First, as we look at it, as you look at the credit markets and the volatility there and with some modest increase of debt levels, we think it's prudent at this point to be somewhat conservative in some of our financial policies. And therefore with what we're looking at as well as maintaining credit ratings for the system, we think that 1.5 to 2 billion is a pretty good place to start the year. I think then it's important as we go through the year, we'll update you on that.</p>
          <p>The share repurchase that was announced by CCE yesterday is also very modest, really dealing with trying to keep their share count kind of flat, so a pretty modest share repurchase program. So I would say &#x2013; I would sum it up probably as we'll be a little cautious just because of volatility in the markets. But stay tuned and we'll update you as we go through the year, and because the credit ratings are pretty important to us as well.</p>

          <p>Okay, great. And just on the back of acquisitions, can you tell us how much glac&#xE9;au contributed to your North American volumes in the quarter?</p>

          <p>Operator, we have time for one more question.</p>

          <p>Your last question comes from Justin Hott with Bear Stearns.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. On glac&#xE9;au, CCE yesterday mentioned that they might have been a little bit slower in promotional activity in the fourth quarter due to I guess the transition there. Would it be fair to say that if CCE is ramping up that glac&#xE9;au can even accelerate its great growth? And also if you could just give us, since it's the last question, some comments on COBOs [Company- owned Bottling Operations] and where you stand with some of them around the world, your plans there? Thanks.</p>

          <p>This is Muhtar. Justin, was the last question on COBOs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay, just let just me give you the answer on glac&#xE9;au.  Absolutely it was related to the transition and it's back on a normalized sequence now in terms of our promotional calendar. And what you see there is that we have had a very good progressive increases as we have transitioned the distribution, bottle distribution into our bottlers, an increase in ACV supermarkets for distribution as well as in convenience stores for both vitamin water, smart water, as well as vitamin energy, so all of the components are working very well for us as we've move into a normalized fashion.</p>
          <p>And as far as the COBOs are concerned, as we have said to you before, we will continue to look at opportunities in our ownerships and where we see some opportunities for divestiture, we will. And we have heard Neville mention BIG as a hospital ward and we are happy with the performance of our BIG group, but over time you will see us taking some more on board and divesting some.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Muhtar and Gary. Just to wrap up and also thanks to each one of you for joining us this morning. So now we're in 2008 and it's the next step on our journey. I am confident that we've laid a solid foundation on which to build in 2008. We remain I assure resolute about delivering against our strategic agenda this year as we did in '07. We will continue to leverage our leading brands, our global footprint, and our strategic acquisitions. You will see us building also on our innovation pipeline, which we didn't talk a lot about today, all the while driving efficiency to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value. Thank you very much indeed.</p>
