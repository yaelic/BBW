        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Dennis Duffy, Vice Chairman, Operations; Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; and Rob Knight, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Union Pacific set a new quarterly earnings record of $1.40 per share, a 52% increase over last year's reported earnings of $0.92 per share. Last year's second quarter included about $0.14 per share from a land sale, so on a more apples-to-apples basis we actually increased earnings almost 80% versus 2009. Operating income was a record 1.3 billion, a 71% increase.</p>
          <p>A key contributor to our strong earnings performance was the return of business volume to our railroad. In fact, this is the first time in six years that we've reported volume growth in all six of our businesses in the same quarter.</p>
          <p>Beyond the strong earnings growth, the real quarterly highlight was achieving a 69.4% operating ratio. This is our first ever quarter under 70 and is a tremendous achievement for the men and women of UP. We are demonstrating great volume leverage, efficiently handling an 18% increase in business with little incremental cost. It's really a team effort, beginning with our employees who are dedicated to running a safe efficient railroad. Our commitment to rail infrastructure investment, a disciplined yet flexible transportation plan and our continuous safety improvement efforts are all paying off in the form of enhanced productivity and resiliency.</p>
          <p>These are the keys to delivering high quality service for our customers. Customers increasingly recognize the great value that UP franchise has to offer, allowing us to reach new markets and supporting our pricing plans.</p>
          <p>Not only are customers rewarding us with their business, second quarter customer satisfaction scores were an all-time best. With another record in the books we feel good about the direction of our company and the opportunities we have in front of us. With that, let's turn it over to Jack for a review of our business teams. Jack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim, and good morning. So I thought I'd lead off this morning with a look at our customer satisfaction which came in at 89 for the quarter. As Jim said, that's a new best ever result and we believe it's a pretty good indicator of how customers view the value proposition that Union Pacific is offering them today.</p>
          <p>I wanted to lead off with this slide because it's not only the stronger economic activity that drove our growth in the second quarter, but also a stronger value proposition that's been driven by excellent service and our new product offerings as well.</p>
          <p>The second quarter last year marked the low point for volume as the impact to the recession was felt across the business. This year with all six commodity groups posting gains, overall volume climbed 18%.</p>
          <p>We saw stronger core price improvement driven in part by a reversal of Intermodal's recent trend of negative pricing. With our major domestic legacy deals behind us, Intermodal joined the other five groups in posting core price gains during the second quarter. Overall, core price improved about 5%, which combined with the increased fuel surcharge revenue and a little negative mix to produce an 8% increase in average revenue per car. The volume gains and improved revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 27% to just shy of $4 billion.</p>
          <p>So let's take a closer look now at each of our six businesses. Our Ag Products volume grew 5% which combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car to produce a 13% increase in revenue.</p>
          <p>Ethanol volume grew 24% as U.S. production expanded to meet the government mandate. Soybean meal shipments declined 5% with a stronger South American crop now finding its way into world markets at the expense of a higher priced U.S. production.</p>
          <p>Whole grain exports increased 16% with shipments of both corn and wheat up in all three of our markets, Mexico, Pacific Northwest and Gulf. Domestic feed grains grew 9% with a boost from corn shipments to forward ethanol plants in both California and Idaho that have now resumed production. Overall, our whole grain shipments were up 9% against record low volumes a year ago. Our Produce Railexpress perishable service in conjunction with the CSX grew 16%, attracting business off the highway with a strong value proposition.</p>
          <p>Automotive revenue was up 105% driven by a 71% growth in volume and a 19% increase in average revenue per car that reflects some contracts that have been repriced over the past several years. U.S. vehicle production is estimated to be up just over 70% in the second quarter reflecting the industry's continued recovery from last year's low sales level and financial turmoils. For Union Pacific that recovery was reflected in a 77% increase in finished vehicle shipments and a 67% growth in auto parts volume.</p>
          <p>Our Chemical volumes grew 11%, which with a 6% improvement in average revenue per car produced a 19% increase in revenue. Fertilizer volume increased 36% with export shipments accounting for two-thirds of that growth. With inventory levels more balanced than a year ago, improved demand resulting from the stronger economy translated into 11% growth in our Industrial Chemicals segment. There was also stronger demand for both export and domestic soda ash, but a 35% increase in exports was what really drove the segment's 18% increase in volume. LPG volumes increased 13% and petroleum products shipments grew 11% even as asphalt demand remains relatively weak.</p>
          <p>Energy revenue increased 13% as a 3% growth in volume combined with a 13% improvement in average revenue per car. First overall volume growth we have seen in our Energy business since we saw the economy start to slide in 2008 was driven by a 5% increase in tonnage out of the Southern Powder River Basin.</p>
          <p>The largest driver was a new coal-fired unit that came online in San Antonio, but shipments to other Midwestern and Southern utilities have picked up as stockpiles reached near normal levels, economic activity picked up and the summer burn kicked in. Our Colorado/Utah tonnage was flat, impacted by continued soft demand and production downtime associated with the mines relocating equipment to some new reserves. We expect that that process is going to continue well into 2011.</p>
          <p>Our Industrial Products revenue grew 30%, as a 25% increase in volume combined with a 4% improvement in average revenue per car. Growing demand along with the recovery in the automotive industry are the major drivers of increased capacity utilization for U.S. steel mills, and that translated into stronger volumes in our steel and scrap business with shipments up 87% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our short haul movement of uranium tailings from Moab, Utah, for the Department of Energy drove the 157% increase in hazardous waste volume. And if we exclude the negative mix effect of this short haul move, average revenue per unit in our Industrial Products business would have been up 9% for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Increased drilling activity is also the driver behind a 49% increase in our non-metallic mineral volume, primarily frac sand and some of the other drilling related products. It also drove an 18% increase in rock where road and related construction tied to oil drilling is growing. Unfortunately, we haven't seen much improvement in other construction, whether it's commercial, highway or housing; our lumber was up 11% for the quarter but that pace actually slowed following the expiration of the housing tax credits.</p>
          <p>Intermodal volumes grew 24%, which when combined with a 10% improvement in average revenue per unit drove revenue up 35%. Volume for our International Intermodal segment increased 23% as import growth starts to reflect the positive economic trends over the past year.</p>
          <p>We were able to capitalize on a stronger economy in our domestic intermodal market as well leveraging a strong value proposition for highway conversions in many of our major lanes. Although we lapped last year's win with the Hub Group late in the quarter, growth in their business also contributed to gains in our domestic segment.</p>
          <p>Our Streamline subsidiary's door-to-door product grew 67% with half of that growth coming off the highway, and the new Pacer arrangement and the UMAX program improved price performance and provided better fuel surcharge recovery, helping to drive the increased average revenue per unit.</p>
          <p>So let me wrap up with a look ahead of what we're seeing here in the second half. The economy began to recover during the second half of 2009 and it doesn't look like the slow improvement trajectory is going to change much over the last half of this year.</p>
          <p>From an overall perspective low inventory to sales ratios throughout the supply chain are an encouraging signs for transportation demand, and the tightening truck and container availability that we are seeing today are encouraging signs for the rail industry.</p>
          <p>With the Powder River Basin coal stockpiles back essentially at normal levels, growth prospects have improved for our largest business segment. And if there is a dark cloud it's the continued lack of recovery in housing and construction which along with continued high unemployment is keeping alive the question of just how engaged the consumer is in this recovery. Our growth opportunities over the next six months are most likely going to come from the same segments that posted gains in the first half. Those would include Ag; for instance, ethanol growth should continue. Shipments into forward plants should boost domestic corn volumes. The fall crops are looking pretty good, right now. However, we did see strong feed grain and meal exports late last year and we don't expect those markets to be quite as strong for U.S. in 2010.</p>
          <p>While vehicle sales forecasts for the year have been trimmed slightly, manufacturer inventories are still pretty well aligned with demand and production is projected to be up from last year. So we are going to continue to see growth in this segment.</p>
          <p>As we started the third quarter our Autos business has probably seen the greatest impact from the devastating rains from Hurricane Alex in Mexico and the bridge outages on the KCSM. While we don't expect a significant impact to the quarter, it's obviously affecting our customers. Across all six of our businesses it's kind of been all hands on deck here working with our international customer service center and both Mexican railroads to identify rail reroutes and alternative solutions like truck into transloads or intermodal facilities north of the border to keep our customer shipments moving and avoid plant shutdowns.</p>
          <p>Chemicals is benefiting from improved demand in downstream markets. Fertilizer inventories are still low and demand should be strong including export potash, and we expect export soda ash to continue its current pace as well.</p>
          <p>Southern Powder River Basin coal prospects have brightened with the stockpiles down and the summer burn helping to drive demand. But Colorado/Utah stockpiles still remain relatively high and the opportunity is expected to be further dampened by production downtime.</p>
          <p>We were still waiting for signs and recovery in a number of our Industrial Products markets but drilling activity should continue to drive growth in non-metallic minerals, and with the help from anticipated growth in autos, steel shipments should stay ahead of last year.</p>
          <p>We expect growth in our uranium tailings move but we have now lapped the startup of that business, so the year-over-year comparisons aren't going to be quite so strong.</p>
          <p>Stronger import levels should drive growth in International Intermodal. We are expecting a normal peak season this year. Excellent service is attracting highway conversions in Domestic Intermodal, especially as truck supply tightens and our equipment supply improves, so we should see a strong second half with improving margins.</p>
          <p>So overall, increased economic activity, strong value proposition that underpins our growth prospects across all six groups, and core price improvements should all combine with volume gains to drive revenue growth in the second half.</p>
          <p>With that, we will turn it over to Dennis for the operations report.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jack. And good morning. In the second quarter we continued to see overall improvement trends in safety, service and value. Even with an 18% increase in volume, we maintained a strong performance, with our Service Delivery Index coming in at 92.1 in the quarter. We achieved over three points of SDI improvement versus the first quarter as this is the measure &#x2013; as this measure continues to be highly correlated with the record customer satisfaction Jack discussed earlier.</p>
          <p>Behind those results is the hard work we do in every facet of the operation to deliver consistent service to our customers. For example, industry spot and pull was a record 93.2% in the quarter. This is one of the most visible measures for our customers as it represents their first and last events of each car cycle.</p>
          <p>Car connection performance, which measures whether we put the right cars in the right train, was maintained at very high level. Terminal operations remain fluid, enabling good execution of the transportation plan, and second quarter velocity was 26.4 miles per hour, up slightly from first quarter levels.</p>
          <p>We demonstrated great resiliency and recoverability in our operations during the quarter, which enabled us to achieve these strong results. In particular, our trains experienced significant weather-related delays 15 out of 30 days in June. By comparison, last June operations were impacted by only one day. And in the face of those challenges we improved our overall safety performance, setting a new second quarter mark for employee reportables and an all-time best for reportable derailments.</p>
          <p>Running a safe and resilient network also allows us to generate strong volume leverage. In the second quarter with an 18% increase in carloadings, total train starts only increased 7%. One source of our volume leverage is productivity. Across all of our asset classes we are doing more with less. Employee productivity measured by gross ton miles per employees reached its highest level for nearly two years. Freight car utilization was a second quarter best at 8.4 days, and locomotive productivity improved 3% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Another source of leverage is our excess working resources. Today, we have roughly 2,300 employees furloughed, 39,000 stored freight cars and 1,200 excess locomotives. Although every category is down from peak levels, we still have ample resources to handle current demand.</p>
          <p>We are, however, hiring and transferring some conductors over the next couple of months to supplement locations where the combination of volumes and attrition require it. We're also in the early phases of thinking about our 2011 capital plan, including the possibility of starting locomotive purchases next year, maybe around 100 units. Although our stored locomotives are functional, new units would improve fuel efficiency, reduce emissions, increase reliability and expand our distributed power capability. They will also provide flexibility in advance of yet to be developed locomotive technology to meet Tier 4 EPA requirements.</p>
          <p>Increased productivity generates capacity in terms of throughput on our network and one of those areas we've been concentrating intently on is train length. Compared to 2009, we've increased train length in almost every major train type, establishing new records with some.</p>
          <p>For example, our Intermodal train length averaged nearly 164 boxes per train in the second quarter, an increase versus 2009 of more than 15 boxes per train. To illustrate the power of train size, the 1% improvement in coal doesn't sound like much but one car more per train saves 100 loaded coal trains per year.</p>
          <p>The unified plan continues to find opportunities to run longer trains more productively. We are also working with our customers to identify and eliminate length constraints. Beyond that, our increased use of distributed power and targeted capital investments give us the physical capability of running longer trains. This is further enhanced by the Terminal Performance Improvement initiative that facilitates throughput and performance in major terminals.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to the back half of the 2010 and peak season we will be ready and committed to exceed customer expectations with excellent service. We will also continue our efforts to operate in a volume variable manner, incurring additional expenses more slowly than volumes increase. Our robust capital programs are essential for maintaining both safety and service and we are always working to increase our overall capital efficiency, completing more work with less dollars spent. Finally, we never take our eye off safety as we strive to make every decision have a safety component built into it.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Rob to discuss the financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Dennis, and good morning. UP's second quarter financial performance was exceptional by almost every measure. Slide 19 summarizes second quarter revenues and expenses. While operating revenue grew 27% to $4.2 billion, operating expenses only increased 14% to $2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>An 18% increase in carloads, strong core pricing gains and our ongoing commitment to cost efficiency helped drive a 71% increase in operating income to a best-ever $1.3 billion. Similar to the first quarter, the biggest driver of the expense increase was the rising price of diesel fuel, which accounted for more than half of the year-over-year change.</p>
          <p>Second quarter other income totaled $19 million compared to $135 million in 2009. As you recall, last year's results included $116 million pre-tax gain on a land sale in Colorado. Interest expense totaled $152 million, up only $2 million versus '09. Income taxes increased 62% to $435 million as a result of increased earnings and a higher tax rate.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter 2010 effective tax rate was 38% versus 36.6% a year &#x2013; in the year ago quarter. The result was a best ever quarterly net income of $711 million, for earnings per share of $1.40 per share. On a reported basis, net income grew 53%. But if you strip out the 2009 land sale, earnings on a more comparable basis actually grew 81%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to price. Slide 20, we are reporting an almost 5% core price gain in the second quarter. As we discussed back in April, this sequential quarterly improvement was supported by our legacy renewals. Increased freight demand and consistent high quality service contributed. Similar to the first quarter, the second quarter pricing gains included about a 0.5 point of fuel-related increases associated with RCAF.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond the second quarter, we continue to feel very positive about the pricing opportunities we have over the rest of 2010 and beyond. Supported by UP's strong service and our remaining legacy contracts, we are committed to achieving real pricing gains that will drive higher returns.</p>
          <p>Moving on to operating expenses, we'll start with compensation and benefits at $1.1 billion in the second quarter, an 8% increase versus 2009. The story line here continues to be strong employee productivity which allowed us to grow volumes nearly 18% with a 3% year-over-year decrease in our workforce. As you heard from Dennis, we are driving efficiency gains by returning resources to the railroad more slowly than volumes.</p>
          <p>Offsetting productivity were several factors. Second quarter 2010 is the last quarter of the current labor agreement which provided a 4.5% wage hike, and as we discussed at the beginning of the year, higher agreement, health and welfare costs added roughly $25 million to the quarterly expense. Volume costs were higher as increased carloadings requires more train starts and greater fuel &#x2013; excuse me; greater crew expenses. In addition, equity and incentive compensation expense was somewhat higher year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 helps illustrate how we think about employment levels over the remainder of 2010. As shown on the left, seven-day carload volumes have seen a slow, steady climb since the third quarter of 2009, up almost 8% over that period. And since the fourth quarter, we've also started to see a sequential increase in our workforce but at a slower pace. We look forward to putting more of our employees back to work as needed for volumes and attrition. But this won't be on a one for one basis as we continue efforts to further improve employee productivity.</p>
          <p>Second quarter fuel expense totaled $608 million, a 64% increase versus 2009. Higher year-over-year fuel prices and increased volume were the drivers, adding $186 million and $48 million to the quarter, respectively. A portion of these increases were offset, however, by continued improvement in our consumption rate. Our fuel conservation efforts produced a 1% savings in the quarter, achieving a second quarter best-ever level.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 summarizes the year-over-year change in three of our expense categories. Purchased services and materials expense increased $73 million in the quarter or 18%. Growing business volumes resulted in greater use of contract services in the second quarter, particularly for purchased transportation associated with automotive and intermodal shipments. We also saw increased usage of joint facility operations and Intermodal ramps.</p>
          <p>Second quarter equipment and other rents expense decreased 8% or $25 million. Roughly $14 million of the decline is associated with locomotive lease restructured in May of 2009. So we have now lapped that expense change. In addition, better asset utilization in the form of improved cycle times and lower lease expense for freight cars, intermodal containers and locomotives contributed to the year-over-year decline. Offsetting a portion of these savings was increased car hire expense associated with the strong demand for Automotive and Intermodal equipment.</p>
          <p>Other expense totaled $122 million, $31 million lower than in 2009. This expense line came in well below our expected range primarily as a result of our continuous safety improvements which reduced casualty costs across the board. Although on a year-over-year basis the change in personal injury expense was minimal, ongoing progress in our safety efforts was reflected in a semiannual actuarial study. Freight and property claims were also better in the quarter saving roughly $15 million versus 2009. In addition, less bad debt expense and reduced cost for environmental remediation contributed to the year-over-year lower expense.</p>
          <p>Going forward, although there are several moving parts associated with this category, our current thinking is that other expense will be closer to $170 million or so in both the third and fourth quarters. This assumes some ongoing benefit from casualty performance but not at the same level as we achieved in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Although we are reporting a number of bests in the second quarter and very strong earnings growth, if you want to take away just one number from the quarter, it should be 69.4, UP's first ever sub-70 operating ratio. This was a full eight points of improvement versus 2009 despite the impact of higher diesel fuel prices. We are delivering on the goals established as part of Project Operating Ratio as we convert stronger volumes, better pricing and greater efficiency into record bottom line results.</p>
          <p>The combination of carload growth returning to our railroad, and the resulting strong cash flow supported our decision to resume share repurchases back in May. We are being opportunistic in our approach, and recent stock market volatility certainly gave us some attractive entry points.</p>
          <p>We bought back roughly 6.5 million shares for $466 million in the second quarter and we have repurchased close to $200 million of additional shares in July. We also increased the quarterly dividend 22%.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains strong with an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of 43.5%. The comparison to 2009 is somewhat skewed however since last year's June 30 ratio was the high point for the year. This year it's likely the low point as our 2010 debt maturities were more front end loaded. As a reminder, we finished 2009 at 46.1%. An adjusted debt-to-cap ratio that's in the mid-40s range supports our solid investment grade credit rating, which we continue to believe is appropriate for our business.</p>
          <p>Let me wrap things up with a few thoughts on the third quarter. As we see the world today, volumes continue to be somewhat of a wild card but they are also the key to earnings. And assuming volume growth continues, we expect to move the increased volumes in a highly leveraged manner.</p>
          <p>Volume comparisons do get slightly more difficult in the third quarter, but even if we run flat with second quarter seven day volumes we'd still be in the range of 7 to 8% volume growth versus 2009. Expense comparisons will be tougher as well. You'll recall last year's third quarter operating ratio was 73.8%, a quarterly record at that time, as we achieved bests in a number of our efficiency measures.</p>
          <p>For example, fuel costs are expected to be higher year-over-year. Our current spot price is about $2.20 per gallon which is 18% above last year's third quarter price. Beyond the cost discipline we'll achieve real pricing gains that support higher returns creating a powerful combination that drives strong financial results for our company.</p>
          <p>Of course, we can't control the economy so we will have to remain flexible and play the hand that we are dealt, but we are looking forward to our next quarterly report and the opportunity to build off of our record second quarter results. With that, let me turn it back to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rob. Before we open it up for questions I'll make a quick comment on the future. Our second quarter results are an indicator of the true potential of the UP franchise when safety, great service, pricing and productivity all come together. While many of our metrics reflect best ever results, we still have significant upside.</p>
          <p>Our network infrastructure is built to handle 190,000 to 200,000 weekly carloads and we have the working resources needed to efficiently provide great customer service as volumes return. Although there is still uncertainty around the state of the economic recovery, we are encouraged by the current demand levels and see the potential for slow, steady growth in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>So with that, let's open it up for your questions.</p>

          <p>Morning, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. So my first question is focused on the Intermodal segment. Could you give us a bit more color on how the UMAX agreement has impacted the Intermodal pricing and profitability for you guys, and could you also give us a sense of the type of benefits we should be thinking about as your Joliet Intermodal Terminal becomes operational in Q3, i.e., where should we see the biggest benefit? Will this be in network capacity, asset productivity or network fluidity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Rob, it's probably &#x2013; probably not going to talk a lot about the pricing associated with the UMAX program. I will tell you that it is improving our margin and doing what we had hoped for in terms of helping us to recover additional fuel surcharge, and so both of those are quite positive and you saw the impact of that. Customer receptivity to the UMAX program has been awesome and it's growing in volumes and service has been great, so all around we're quite happy with that.</p>
          <p>The Joliet facility is going to do all those things. It's going to be a combination of fluidity. It's going to asset utilization. It's going to improve schedules for our customers. It's going to give them closer access to the major consumption markets there in Chicago, and we will also have improved throughput in our interchange business with both Eastern carriers. So it's going to be the whole package from our customer's perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Rob, the key here -- UMAX is a piece of an overall strategy in the Intermodal but the bottom line in Intermodal is great service. We've got a lot of different products, all those corridors, and we're really seeing what can happen when you put great service products in the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for that. And should we still be thinking about kind of late third quarter this &#x2013; the Joliet coming on?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>August 1; great. And then I guess shifting gears a little bit to Dennis, could you give a sense how much further you believe the train lengths can be expanded from current levels before you'd need help from customers or make structural changes like extending sidings across your network? And how much improvement on the train lengths do you believe is possible across your manifest network and unit trains by working with your customers longer term? And what sort of timing do you think &#x2013; should we be thinking about the potential to get those trains extended?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, that's a continual focus for us and we are already addressing those issues that you mentioned, working with our customers. And we have some strategic capital points directed toward our siding extensions, more in the PNW and then across our Southeast from El Paso east. But to answer your question specifically, we expect continuous improvement in our train length. We took it up 6.5% Q-over-Q here &#x2013; 2Q versus 2Q. On the Intermodal side, you saw the numbers; we said 164. We are already up to 170 currently. We think we can go well north of 200 without taxing any additional locomotives on those particular trains.</p>
          <p>And the respective answer would rest on the commodity corridors and the commodity types. But you can rest assured that you are going to see continuous improvement in the train length and all across all categories, the premium service, the manifest service and the bulk service.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any reason why a 69.4 can't be at least that good in third quarter? I mean, normally, seasonally third quarter is a better quarter than second. You mentioned the casualty one-time benefit; you didn't quantify that. Maybe if you could help with that, that would help. Is there any reason that you see right now why you shouldn't be operating at this going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ed, if you look historically, second half is generally our highest earnings potential. So you can extend that out and it's going to be a function how we see business volumes moving. The personal injury accrual clearly helps some, but keep in mind, the higher fuel cost also penalized us. So that's a pretty good performance rate. So I'm optimistic about third and fourth quarters, but again, just watch the volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you think about head count down three and volumes up 18, obviously volumes can't last like this much longer as the comps get tougher but when do you think about those two started to converge where you start to have to grow heads again and volumes come down and they get more similar to each other? Is that a couple of quarters out or is that something that's further out than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can -- potentially third quarter you might see it up a little bit. Again, we've started some hiring, although the numbers are relatively small overall, and again, we are going to hire to support volume as we go forward.</p>
          <p>We clearly have the leverage as Dennis was talking about, that we'll still see good leverage going forward here, but I think our numbers will continue to pick up. Now, that doesn't say we're not continuing to focus on productivity. We've got some great projects underway, technology, a lot of the process initiatives that are underway that's there, but again, if we are hiring, that means our outlook and volume looks pretty darn good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you just break out the yield, the 7.7% in terms of price, fuel and mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what we said, as both Jack and Rob had said, the pricing number, when you take kind of fuel and everything out of it, was about 5% overall. We have to kind of look at Arthur's negative mix. Rob, you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add. The high level numbers would be the price, as Jim said, is about 5-ish, fuel call it 6, and negative mix of about 3 on the arc line.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Ed, it was similar to last year's number which was about $40 million positive. So year-over-year, it was about a wash and it was roughly in the $40 million range.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to zero in on pricing as we start to look out to 2011, perhaps you can give us a little bit of a sense of what your &#x2013; the tone is with your customers right now in terms of rebounding economy. Are they feeling a little bit better and is pricing a little bit more easier to drive through than perhaps this time last year? And what percentage of your book in 2011 has already been negotiated, if you can give us that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the first part of that. Jack can handle that. The pricing environment is stronger today than it's been in a long time. And again, you look at what's happening on the truck side. But all this is a function of where we think volume and the economy is going here, so projecting out to 2011. So you've got some positives potentially in the economy, but there is another factor here that don't underplay. Our service metrics have never been better. Our customers, when we do our &#x2013; we have a very robust customer satisfaction survey, that value proposition has never been better. So when I think about that, I feel very good about the potential on the pricing side going forward. I'll let Jack talk in the legacy contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Walter, first of all I have to tell you it's never easy to get price, so &#x2013; but the environment has changed. There are some markets obviously. Market demand is really what dictates your ability to take price up, but the contractual obligation. So I would tell you right now probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% of our pricing is contractually tied up right at the moment for next year which is not unusual. We're only halfway through the year. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that at a rate that you currently &#x2013; sort of what you're getting in this quarter right now, is it roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, it is what it is. There is no reason to see that it would be going down at least at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's excellent. Second question here is on -- perhaps you can talk a little bit about capital return to shareholders. Obviously, you've brought your buyback back in the second quarter and that's great to see. Can we look at -- is this going to be sort of your average run rate for buyback? Perhaps also talk about the -- your dividend payout ratio and your target debt levels, sort of just on that capital structure side when we are at looking going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, why don't you take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Walter, as you've heard us say before, we take a balanced approach. We are not giving guidance in terms of what the run rate is going to be on our share buyback other than we are going to continue to be opportunistic as we have been up to this point and that's what we will continue to do going forward.</p>
          <p>And as we said on our dividend, as you know earlier this year we increased it 22% and we would like to get into a position and be in a position where we are competitive with our dividends, steadily increasing it and being opportunistic on the share buyback.</p>
          <p>In terms of the &#x2013; what's the right level of the debt-to-cap ratio, the way we look at is we want to maintain a solid investment grade rating which we think is in that mid-40s ratio when you look at it on a debt-to-cap. So we are comfortable on that level.</p>

          <p>I understand you made some comments in the prepared remarks or Dennis did about getting ready for peak season and I just wanted to ask, Jack, Intermodal volumes have been so strong.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the indications that you are seeing in the international markets today with the international ocean carriers wanting their boxes returned back as quickly as possible and transloading into domestic -- we have some containers coming on board that we will be able to utilize. Even with our new container acquisitions, there will still be stronger demand than what we'll have containers for. So I think for this particular year the way things are shaping up right now, I think we will see a more traditional peak season and it will be up from where we're running today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ron, you have to throw in there the potential look on Ag which could be an upside. You look at &#x2013; right now coal in terms of where we are at with the burn so far. So there's some real potential here to have a decent peak.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then Rob, just quickly on that 170 in other expenses that you are highlighting for the second half, there's nothing unusual in that. That's kind of a new run rate. I'm just looking at the 246 from Q1 and wondering why it would have been that high to come down to a 170 run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that category as you know has a lot of moving parts, but what we are saying is &#x2013; from Q1, remember we had the $45 million CSXI payment in there. Looking at Q1, yes, but the 170 number is, again, a lot of moving parts but we are looking at that as sort of a more normalized level than the 122 this quarter and of course among other things what impacts that other category is volume. There are some volume related expenses in there. So it will depend upon volume and other factors.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe for Dennis, you mentioned some potential locomotive purchases as you look out over the course of the next year or so, and when you think about from an asset perspective, is there anywhere else you need to maybe make some investments as we see business is running at a better rate than it has been obviously the last couple of quarters? I know you bought a few boxes here and there on the container side, but just kind of curious if there is anything else we should be thinking about from an investment standpoint.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, Chris, I mentioned so part of our strategy was on our capital investment on these siding links, we are continuing to press that issue here. We want to continue to grow our train lengths in these key corridors. I mentioned a couple of them. So we're after that.</p>
          <p>I think food grade covered hoppers -- we're going to end up with a couple hundred of those here. So there's some really targeted specific car types that we might augment the spend with. But other than that we're into the core replacement spending and we really don't see it other than as I mentioned the locomotives. So we are working our infrastructure really hard to make sure that we are reducing, taking variability out, improving the slow orders and providing for excellent run through capability and train length.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Chris, and keep in mind the -- step back from the locomotive potential here. These are really strategic investments long term. We think about our network today, we are thinking about three, four, five years out. You've long lead times in many of these projects. So when you hear us talk about our capital budget, which we're still putting together, you've got to put that in the context of how you think three, four, five years out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Fair enough. That certainly makes sense. And I think I missed it. You mentioned the locomotives that you currently have in storage right now. What &#x2013; do you mind just reminding me what that number is?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, fair enough. And then just thinking, I guess, on kind of that capacity question, when you think about kind of the lanes, and I know you had asked about train lengths before, but when you think about specific lanes particularly when you look at the coal business and you mentioned the real leverage you get from adding additional cars onto existing trains. Is there &#x2013; other than that are there other areas that that really, you may see better opportunities than others within the commodity group that you move for for getting extra train lengths? You are doing a great job on the Intermodal side. I'm just curious about the other commodities right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are pretty well set. What we call the Red X; that's our central corridor where the coal route is, that's not needing of any train length opportunities there, but we are looking at the run through capabilities that would be at the major terminals: Kansas City, North Plattes.</p>
          <p>The other corridors would be the Pacific Northwest. I mentioned that. That's again Intermodal growth but that also facilitates grain and our manifest business out of the PNW. And we will be looking at the Sunset again, looking at opportunities there -- can we improve our efficiencies in specific locations. Won't be any wholesale double track effort but there could be pinpoint efforts where we go in and look at particularly in or around our terminals to facilitate the throughput capabilities. And then as I mentioned also, El Paso East; that is also a mixed corridor that we would look at, Chris, for some additional investment there.</p>

          <p>Okay. That's helpful. One final question just for Jim from your perspective. Anything you are seeing different from a customer standpoint, the way they are positioning themselves over the last four to six weeks with some of the choppiness we have seen on the economic front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there is a concern about sustainability here on the economy which we all have, whether you &#x2013; regardless what business you are in. What we do see with customers again they really value the service. You think about managing inventories and what the railroads been able to do, we're in markets today that you're going to try to run tight inventories you may not have been in three years ago.</p>
          <p>Our job here is to make sure we really perform service wise and sell that value proposition and get ready -- I'll tell you, it's while there's a concern on the economy, we still have many customers asking us, are you ready for peak? Are you ready to handle volume? So I'm looking forward to continued growth here.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Ben Hartford in for Jon. I just wanted to first look at the leverage potential and when we think about incremental margins going forward in the coming quarters. I expect that to slow, but do you believe that the opportunity remains to continue to drive outsized incremental margins up to the previous peak, still down 10 to 15% below previous peak volumes? So how should we think about that margin potential here in the near term before we kind of set into a run rate where we are capturing roughly half of the inflation on an annual basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ben, I think, the way to think about this is the core infrastructure, that's track, terminals, capacity. We are invested for that 190,000 to 200,000 carload level. So you are going to leverage that as you move up.</p>
          <p>Our working resources, I think we've said, we are probably in that maybe 10 to 15% range or so out there. So we still have very good leverage. Now, as I've said consistently here, obviously as you move up the curve, you're going to have to do more hiring when you look at it. But I think the numbers are very good. It &#x2013; the key for us is to stay ahead of this. Again, start thinking about 2011 and 2012 in terms of some incremental investment, but we're going to have good leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And then on the Intermodal side, from a strategic level, service is very good. Obviously, you had mentioned tight truck and container capacity. So is that putting any pressure on some of your smaller Intermodal marketing partners from a pricing standpoint? And I guess when you look over the next 12 to 18 months and look at domestic capacity shortages, does that alter your strategy from a volume versus price balance?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're always looking at the market implications and pricing, and particularly in the intermodal world I would say that it's not &#x2013; just because they are smaller, it probably does put a little more pressure on our smaller Intermodal, but &#x2013; our IMCs but actually everybody is short of equipment, the large IMCs as well as the small. And we're trying our very best to ensure that everybody gets equipment to meet their needs. So it's a tight market. A tight market like that always says there is some pricing opportunity for us. We still have some contractual obligations to work our way through here, but we do see that as an opportunity for us going forward.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of I guess a couple of things just on the expense side, and understand you have good operating leverage still going forward, how much do you think head count goes up in third quarter? If you look second versus first it was up, I think 400 or so. Is it kind of a similar step up the next couple of quarters?</p>
          <p>And then, on train lengths just a sense of where you are at with carload train lengths and what that can get to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, it's not going to be anything significant on the head count number again. Part of this is, as you think about it right now, any hiring we are doing today, much of that is looking, probably, fourth quarter, first half next year. You think about bringing new employees on. We do have the furloughed employees come back to work much quicker, but it will be up but nothing substantial unless the volume really runs. We are going to accelerate our hiring. Don't confuse that with loss of margin here. We are going to have very good margins and leverage on our business here at least for the foreseeable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, I guess, I think Dennis had talked about train length and intermodal, that 170 containers could go to 200. What about in the carload network? Is there any sense you can give in terms of average size of cars and what that could get to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tom, the only thing I would tell you is you can expect to see continuous improvement in all of our categories. The manifest side, we have plenty of room for growth. We are setting records on that now with our DPU trains and our longer trains. We are doing the same thing with bulk working with our customers and Jack's team to extend those out. That's not as rapid a growth rate but you can expect to see manifest trains and intermodal trains and auto trains continue to increase. When I quote those numbers I'm quoting you the scheduled network and that has increases expected across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can slip one more in here for Jack. On the Intermodal revenue per unit was up quite a bit, sequentially I think almost 5%, you've got the ramp with Pacer and I don't know how much the UMAX ramps but you -- then you could have peak season surcharges. Is it fair to think that that absolute number for Intermodal keeps ramping up, Jack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Tom. I think that you are going to continue to see that improve over time.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, couple of questions. And forgive me if you may have touched this; a small package company was reporting at the same time. Help me a little bit with what you are seeing in Washington and where that stands. Is rail reform just sort of in holding pattern because there's so many other issues going on Washington and they are just more focused on the politicians' minds? Help me a little bit where you see that going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the discussions have continued, but you are at a phase right now that I think they are kind of reevaluating where they are at overall, and we are ready to work with &#x2013; we have been very active. I think, again, the members I talked to involved with this, they know the stakes are very high in terms of any type of legislation, what it can mean and nobody wants to get it wrong.</p>
          <p>There's one thing this industry has done and we continue to show that: you've had more new investment go into the rail industry in the last six, seven years than in a long time. So we'll see what happens here. You got a lot of things going on in Washington today, and I would argue this clearly isn't on the top of the priority list but we take it serious, and we are going to continue to be &#x2013; to work with them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then I know that Jack gave us some nice charts on stockpile. Are we seeing sort of more normal movements out of the PRB, or is this going to be a lag effect to stockpiles coming down to more normal levels or might they even go slightly below normal before you start to see a greater pickup in sort of the volumes out of the PRB on the coal side?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Scott, we've already seen them. In second quarter we ran about 30 trains out of the PRB. Today we're running 33. Some demand pick up, stockpiles. We are having a great summer right at the moment in terms of heat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we know that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That all plays in our favor. So I think I don't really see any strange or out of seasonal pattern. I think we'll continue to see a nice run on coal for a while.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Scott, hold on here a minute. You got to be careful on normalcy. If you go back about three, four years ago, we were running 38 plus trains a day out of the PRB. We are invested for a number higher than that. So we are sitting here running what? 33, 34 right now. There is a huge amount of excess capacity up there. So we are a long ways away from what the production and investment capability is out of the mines. Again, I think that's a good example as coal, if you believe coal will pick up over time here, you going to lever that business very nicely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jim, during the earlier part of the call you mentioned, I guess, maybe at least four or five times kind of during the Q&amp;A, you got to watch out for volumes, watch out for volumes. But then you went &#x2013; I think Jack went through one of them and kind of highlighted all the stuff that's going on now building into peak. So I guess, are you anticipating a big peak and then you are concerned with what drops off after? I'm just trying to get where you are &#x2013; or are you just being conservative overall? Just trying to get a read on why that kind of repeated commentary is there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Ken, I'm probably being a little conservative, but on the other hand the visibility is very tough right now, and Jack in talking with our customers &#x2013; there you can look as he talked through some of the positive areas that are out here. But we've been surprised before. We have to be &#x2013; we kind of use the term very agile in terms of economy, where it's going. As Bernanke said yesterday, things are very uncertain going forward. So we are cautious in terms of our outlook. I would say today, though, if you add up the positives right now, they lean a little more on the positive side in volume than the negative.</p>

          <p>That's great to hear. That's great wrap-up. Jack, just &#x2013; you guys have been really aggressive, I guess, in getting some of these legacy contracts done, even some &#x2013; maybe even earlier than expected, which was I guess a good move over the long-term for you, things like the UMAX and the Pacer contracts. Are there any of the big coal contracts or other legacy ones that are due in, I guess, 2012, 2013 that any discussions that have opened up ahead of time?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. I just wanted to come back to the OR. So you sort of suggest that you're feeling pretty confident about the second half OR, and I think as the longer term target you've got for 2012 low 70s, it seems in light of this performance and the way things are trending that that would be conservative. Am I thinking about that the right way?</p>

          <p>Well, at this point in time here Bill, I mean, it's hard to argue that logic, but we are not providing guidance going forward. The potential is here; we're again as I said in my conclusion, I think we are starting to see what the UP franchise can really do, and a key here obviously will be continued volume growth, but I feel good about our possibilities down the road.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. I wanted also just to ask about the Washington issues one more time. Just as you think about this stuff potentially not going through, because we are clearly running out of time left in this Congress, is there a risk that the rails end up sort of in the penalty box kind of for having been involved in this discussion, where if you guys wanted to get something positive out of Congress, maybe the key legislators are going to say, sorry you didn't play ball with us there and we're not playing ball with you here?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to speculate on kind of the mindset, particularly when you have new members sitting up there next year. Our focus from day one is to work with the staff to help them understand our issues. We have spent a tremendous amount of time and it's across the board. The COs have been very active in terms of helping people understand really very complicated issues on &#x2013; and I tell you, Bill, I have not met a member yet that is not &#x2013; their goal is to figure out how you put more business on the freight railroad, and they don't want to screw it up. So we'll see. I think our industry &#x2013; I don't think &#x2013; we've got a great story to tell. You look at new investments, think about the jobs potential; last thing any member wants to hear is we are cutting capital and eliminating jobs, and that's what's at stake here if this &#x2013; if whatever comes out is wrong.</p>

I think overall there is no question; you can step back and say we have been at least cooperative in the discussion. We've been very straight on the risks that are out there, and at the end of the day, though, the stakes are so high we've got to be &#x2013; take this very, very serious in terms of where we are going.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Yes, just following on the Washington line of questioning here, you had mentioned that in your conversation with some of the members of Congress that they would like to see a larger market share shifting over to the railroads. Over the last couple of years there has been some talk of an investment tax credit perhaps that you could apply to incremental capacity investments and that sort of thing. Are there any other programs that come up in those discussions that could be advantageous in facilitating a transfer of market share from, say, the highway over to rail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would tell you one thing right now is to take the uncertainty off the table in terms of when we think long-term investment. The only way you're going to grow here is you've got to think investment long term, and one of the things I point out to members is when you create an environment that's uncertain in the long term, you start to get cautious in capital.</p>
          <p>The investment tax credit is still on the table. That is out there. That's probably a long shot. The fact of the matter is if they let this industry continue to move forward as we have, they are going to see more investment and more volume going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just maybe on a longer-term question involving the coal business, I know the AAR is concerned that cap and trade light could get passed here, perhaps even in a -- what would amount to a lame duck session after election day. Is that something you are concerned about? It sounds to me like you feel like you have got huge upside in terms of the capacity that's available in the PRB, but could that be perhaps never utilized if some sort of legislation gets passed later in the year?</p>

          <p>You know, John, we pay attention to it obviously, what's at stake with coal. I'm not going to speculate what can happen in a lame duck session. We take it serious. Lots of things can happen. I just have a tough time looking at this country walking away from coal when generates half of the energy, electricity production in America. So we are involved. But we'll see what happens here. Our focus has been, one, coal is going to be part of the equation. Technology has got to be also part of the solution to help coal go forward.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Newcrest. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Good morning, Cheryl.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to ask a question about slide 15, where you detail your volume variability, and I think if I have read this correctly, it looks like your yard and local starts were up only 1% versus that 18% gain in volume, which would seem like a pretty exceptional result. So I wonder if you can speak about some of your local initiatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Duff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a good portion of that is related to the train length that we mentioned, Cherilyn, across the board. We also have initiatives in all of our terminals. You see the yard and local was only up 1%; we have huge terminal improvement initiatives using our continuous improvement group, our Lean concepts across all of our major terminals. We had mentioned previously before we had shut down about or severely curtailed about 30 yards. That is still in the 24 or 25 area. We've been all over overtime, curtailing that. So car repairs, mechanical engineering on the transportation side, everyone of them have productivity initiatives that help contribute to that and help us keep those crew starts and train starts down. But a big leverage item and we continue to focus on is that train length, push that -- put that additional volume on existing trains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then last one from me. I believe you mentioned last quarter that you wouldn't feel totally confident in the recovery unless some of your industrial product categories started to participate more fully, and I just wonder if you can comment with one more quarter of volume to look at how you are feeling now versus at the end of last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; still, I mean our volume is up 25% to a year ago but again, a year ago was the bottom. I'm still concerned; you think about what's happening with housing; the housing numbers obviously have deteriorated in terms of new housing starts from where we were a quarter ago. But we are feeling better. We still have a long ways to go. And I give you an example. You take peak lumber loadings, I think it was 2005 in a quarter, we loaded about 70,000 loads of lumber. At the bottom we loaded 19,000. Now it has picked up some, but it's a long ways away. And again, as Jack mentioned, overall, construction just right now is not looking real strong. And again, I'm trying to predict the future here. I still believe until you start seeing the hiring numbers improve, I think it's going to be &#x2013; still be a tough go for a while.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sal Vitale on for Jeff Kauffman. Just some quick questions. First, on the pricing side, so pricing ex-RCAF was up 4.5%. Last quarter I think it was up about 3.5%. Was there any &#x2013; what was the main driver of the ramp-up, any particular business segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, probably the biggest change -- if you recall in our first quarter we actually had negative pricing in our total Intermodal business and that turned around in the second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then on the expense side, just looking at some of the items here like equipment rent that was down year-on-year, and I think you mentioned that about $14 million was one-timish in nature. What should we expect for the second half? Should that pretty much grow with some relationship to volume? What should we expect in terms of growth in that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's going to be &#x2013; the equipment rents are going to follow volume, and that's a direct correlation to how our business grows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last one, just a clarification on the other operating expense line. That you said going forward we should be looking at about 175 or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said around 170 or so per quarter, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, 170 or so per quarter. I think you remember last, on the first quarter call, I think the number that was mentioned was about 200 million and &#x2013; per quarter and you mentioned that about 40 million was due to this &#x2013; is it a true-up for the casualty line? And then I think you also mentioned that bad debt expense was &#x2013; was that a positive or negative for the quarter? I am just trying to reconcile from that 200 million to the reported 122.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I got you. That was a slight positive, but the bigger driver when you compare the first quarter to second quarter was the CSXI payment that we made which was $45 million in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>45 million. Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse Group. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Allison Landry in for Chris. I was hoping to talk a little bit more about the productivity gains that you guys have seen, specifically in terms of the gap between volume growth and train starts and GTMs. For example over the past couple of quarters we've seen train starts trending below volume growth in a range of about 11 to 12% and GTMs consistently at about 4% lower. But my question relates to sustainability. At what point will this gap narrow and where do you see these spreads trending as volumes come back into the network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, you want to take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously as line continues to increase, we are going to bring back our cost or in our assets at a slower pace. Rob said that, Jim said that, I said that and it's especially process driven across the board. We try and leverage everything that we can on our existing service offerings. We use technology in our distributed power. I think we increased our DPU gross tons about -- by 12% again quarter-over-quarter. We continue to do that.</p>
          <p>In the new service offerings, we emphasize with our customers productivity initiatives, putting the right equipment on the right trains. So, you know, obviously the leverage will gradually diminish, but we see upside opportunities for us in the future here. We don't see anything that would stop that from us at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Allison, one of the ways to think about this also is what mix can do. We got a lot of &#x2013; you know think of our network; you can run unit trains, like a coal train; obviously as that grows, you get a pretty good correlation between train starts and volume there. On the manifest network, which is mixed freight, got a lot of capacity there. You know, as Dennis was saying we've yards 24, 25 of our 115 primary yards that in a sense really shut down. You've got freight cars stored. So mix can have a little bit of impact on this. But again, what you've got to think here is, as you move up that capacity curve, we're going to have great leverage, but it will start to shrink some.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great color. And then my other question. We've heard that Northeast utilities stockpiles are actually closer to normal and the Southeastern ones are still pretty high. But just given the relentless heat wave that we have seen here in the Northeast, are you guys moving any of the PRB coal eastward to backfill some of the coal there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we actually do have a couple of moves that move all the way into the Northeast, and those are moving quite strong &#x2013; very strong demand for coal. So that's all good things for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look &#x2013; if you look back at Intermodal and peak levels, can you talk &#x2013; can you give me a sense of what your total container pool is now with Hub and Pacer and everybody included?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the entire shooting match, what we own plus what we have tied together with Hub and Pacer, we are probably in the 70,000 container range and &#x2013; at the moment; maybe a tad higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's including the ones you have on order?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The ones we have on order &#x2013; as I look at it, John, by the time I get to the end of the year, we are going to have probably 57% of the container fleet tied to Union Pacific, and that container fleet is expected to be about 150,000 units in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's what I was looking for. And then one last question. The auto &#x2013; your auto industry -- it's 8% of revenue, it's the smallest group, but when you look at steel, plastics, and everything else that's feeding into auto production, what's your total exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've never &#x2013; we've looked at it from time to time. It really varies. It's pretty hard for me to put my finger on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, but I think you have to ask yourself the question where do you think autos &#x2013; obviously the sector is going right now. We said when we came into the year we thought kind of 11 plus million new vehicle sales.</p>
          <p>I think the forecasts have come down a little bit in terms of the outlook. So I would argue right now I think you have more upside than you have downside on vehicle sales over the next couple of years.</p>
