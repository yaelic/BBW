          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Annual Report for 2009. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  I would now like to turn the call over to your host today, A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Group CEO, Nils S. Andersen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome to everybody. This is a full year presentation, so a little bit more details than usual quarters. I'm here today with our new CFO, Trond Westlie, who joined us on the 1st of January and he will do part of the presentation. I think most of you know him, but I'm sure you'll find that he's already well into the figures.</p>
          <p>If we go to Slide 2, just spend 2 minutes reading the comments on the forward-looking statements. There is, of course, we're early in the year, a lot of uncertainty. We feel that we came through 2009 relatively well, that we are well positioned for 2010, but it is early days. And then with the big negotiations for rates still ahead of us in Maersk Line, we do believe that it's early to come with a very precise statement.</p>
          <p>What we do expect, however, is to return to profit in 2010 due to slightly better rates than we've seen in &#x2013; or better rates than we've seen the last year, and also due to the fact that we have become more competitive across the Group following our cost-reduction programs in 2009 and '08.</p>
          <p>So if we can move to Slide 3 and start on the highlights. There's no doubt about the fact that we are not satisfied with a negative result of USD1 billion. It's a lot of money to lose. And it's of course a loss &#x2013; lot less than we made in 2008, so we have seen this year a significant decline.</p>
          <p>In the midst of all this, however, we are quite satisfied with the fact that we have achieved cost savings during the year of approximately USD2 billion, and that figure is excluding savings from reduced bucker prices, so it is real underlying cost reductions. And that has resulted in a positive cash flow from operations of USD4.7 billion. And given the severity of the crisis, we feel that this is &#x2013; this does show that we have a very, very solid business underlying.</p>
          <p>In what is, of course, first and foremost a very difficult year for the global economy, looking back one year ago we were in the midst of crisis, we were facing a significant investment program and we really didn't know how the banks would &#x2013; or whether the banks would able to provide us with sufficient financing. But looking back at the year, the main effect of the global crisis for us was really very hard pressure on the container shipping and tanker markets as well as, needless to say, but we'll come back to that, a significant drop in the oil price.</p>
          <p>Apart from the shipping area, container shipping and tanker shipping, we had positive results across most the business. We did work, in addition to costs, we did work on adjusting the portfolio of activities. We decided to close the shipyard, Odense Shipyard, as orders are completed.</p>
          <p>We decided to dispose of Norfolkline, which has been sold to DFDS. We received part of the payment in shares and will &#x2013; when this transaction is approved by the government or by the competition authorities, we will have a third of DFDS and thereby approximately the same upside to the ferry business as we had before, but also a bit of cash in hand. In addition to that, we disposed of Rosti, and I'll come back to that later.</p>
          <p>We also worked on our funding situation. We went first &#x2013; first we sold our equity shares, 5.7% of the shares we held in our own hands. And we also went to the bond market for the first time, so we broadened our funding or our approach to funding, and actually left the year with a strong financial position. We did continue during the year, in spite of the difficult economic environment, we did continue during the year to put emphasis on reducing emissions, first and foremost through more effective use of energy, and of course this is for us mainly bunker oil.</p>
          <p>These are the main comments on the highlights for 2009. We will come back to the segments later and I think the overview is quite useful. So let's go to the next slide, and this is concerning the Container Shipping and Related Activities and we, of course, we come to the, you can say, the core issue we had last year. If you look at the revenue, it is down with more than USD8 billion or 28%.</p>
          <p>The reason for that was first and foremost a decline in rates. The container industry as such had a significant volume decline, but really what made the most negative effect for the industry was our willingness and capacity to take rates down below cash operating cost and do it very fast. And that resulted in a very, very poor rate situation for the year and that is really the main reason why the industry lost the amount of money it lost.</p>
          <p>The average bunker price was down and that, of course, helped a little bit, but you can say in terms of competitiveness, what is most important for us was that the bunker consumption was down by 12%. We saved in the Container business, excluding bunker prices, around USD1.6 billion, which needless to say is a significant amount.</p>
          <p>But we can also be proud of the fact that we managed to keep, in spite of the crisis and the pressure on profitability, some lay-ups that we had to make, some scrappings, we achieved a very high level of customer satisfaction even though we, at the end of the year, had to admit had some problems with service due to the unexpected and rapid pickup of activity.</p>
          <p>The lower &#x2013; I've shown you already &#x2013; the figures already, but of course the decline in profitability from 2.1 billion &#x2013; or down to USD2.1 billion loss from a segment result, which is before interest, of 600 the year before, was of course significant. And as I said before, driven mainly by poor rates.</p>
          <p>Looking at the rate development and the volume development on the chart below, this basically illustrates that, after all the increases we've seen during the year, we're now back to a level more or less slightly below the level of January 2009, the beginning of the year, but with significant higher bunker costs. So we still on the rate side have some way to go before we establish a profitable industry.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, we just touch a little bit on the fleet situation. And starting with our own situation, we have a bit more than 500 ships on &#x2013; in our fleet. On top of that, we have new buildings of 43. And &#x2013; but looking at the capacity in TEU, which is more interesting, we actually did not change our own capacity last year. We got 3% delivered, which was very low compared to most of the industry player, and we're all &#x2013; players and we scrapped 3%. Then we reduced our time charter capacity with 3% and we laid up 4%. So we did take our capacity down slightly.</p>
          <p>Looking at the global development, and this is our best estimate, especially when we go for 2010, obviously, there's uncertainty in the figures. But looking at the supply growth we actually saw in 2009, it was approximately 6%. This is lower than we expected at the beginning of the year due to delay &#x2013; delays of deliveries. But it is of course a delivery schedule which is still significantly above the demand growth, which was a drop of 13%. So there was quite a lot of additional capacity in the market. What &#x2013; or unnecessary capacity in the market.</p>
          <p>What happened was that slow steaming, which was introduced widely last year, took out some capacity, approximately 5%. This is not something we expect to return to the market because the container lines are still very &#x2013; or loss-making, most of them. And the rates we're seeing now can not really sustain an increased cost level and slow steaming actually saves significant amounts of bunker oil. So we don't expect that to change in the near future.</p>
          <p>On top of that we had laid up, as an industry, approximately 12% of the fleet, so you can say that takes out approximately 17% of the capacity we saw at the beginning of the year. So an increase in the oil capacity during the year, but probably less than we had expected when we went into it.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2010, we expect a fleet growth or supply growth, that is new ships coming in, of 7 to 10%. We expect slow steaming to take out a little more capacity next year, because during the year the slow steaming has gained increasing popularity. And we expect that will, given a demand growth of 3 to 5%, that the number of idle ships or free capacity on the sea will actually increase a little bit.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we do expect rates to be significantly better than last year because we assume that both the customers as well as, needless to say, the liners have learned from the very, very bad situation we ended up in 2009. And we think that will put some discipline into the liners. And we also expect that the customers will have understanding for the fact that an industry losing 20 to USD30 million &#x2013; billion in a year cannot be expected to uphold satisfactory service going forward. So we expect the rate situation to be better than last year, but not good enough to give an acceptable rate of return for the business.</p>
          <p>Going to APM Terminals, the situation looks quite different from our company view. We did have a decline in volume of approximately 7% last year. That is somewhat less than the market. That's needless to say not because we've been out in price activities to try to gain market share but it has to do with new terminals and it has to do with changing trade patterns to a large extent. But the volume development was poor but not in line &#x2013; not as bad as the market.</p>
          <p>What was interesting in the composition of our customers was that non-Maersk Line customers now account for 41% of total volume, which is up from last year. And this is in line with our strategy of creating a true arm's-length relationship between our Liner operation and the Terminals business. And we hope, needless to say, that the non-Maersk Line customers are happy with the service and we'll see this trend continuing.</p>
          <p>We have focused very much on cost reductions last year. And that has helped us, together with good pricing discipline in the industry and &#x2013; at least on our side, to increase our EBITDA margin from a figure of approximately 18% in 2008 up to 24% in 2009, and we're pleased with that.</p>
          <p>We do believe that we're giving a good service to our customers. We have improved customer satisfaction figures and we were picked as Port Operator of the Year in Lloyd's List last year. So all in all on the Terminals business, good progress driven mainly, let me say, absolutely by good cost discipline throughout the business.</p>
          <p>And let's go to the next page, which is the page on Tankers, Offshore and Other Shipping, Slide #7. And of course here the market or the situation is quite mixed for the different segments within the &#x2013; this business segment. In total our profitability reduced from 1.1 billion down to USD275 million in 2009, not a good result.</p>
          <p>But this decline was in for the absolute almost 100% caused by declining profitability in tankers, where the acquisition of Brostr&#xF6;m was surely well integrated in terms of integration work in itself, organizational processes worked well, but we did buy it just ahead of the significant decline in tanker rates caused by lower demand and excess capacity in the industry.</p>
          <p>Of course the oil industry as such, we still see good oil prices, reasonable oil prices, but for the tanker industry this has limited effect because good oil prices are maintained because of good discipline within OPEC, and that means restrictions on output. The tanker markets will, for sure, improve somewhat when the good oil prices are maintained because of demand. And we hope this will happen in the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of the rest of the businesses, which is Maersk Drilling and Maersk Supply in all relevance, here the situation looks better, and that is because we have good contract coverage in the offshore activities and because offshore activities, they did come to or reduce somewhat at the beginning of the year, but they are relatively rapid coming back to &#x2013; to their normal level so this market is doing relatively well.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that the impairments in 2009 were significantly impaired more than USD300 million and this is absolutely mainly in Tankers business well. We had significantly lower sales gains. Last &#x2013; in 2008 we had sales gains of USD425 million. In 2009, only 41 million, again mainly related to the Tankers business.</p>
          <p>We sold the Norfolkline to DFDS, as I talked about before, subject to approval by competition authorities. But we will &#x2013; we see this as a necessary and positive consolidation in the ferry business. The resulting DFDS will be the largest ferry business in Europe and we'll have a little less than one third of this business and be subject to a hopeful revaluation of the shares going forward.</p>
          <p>And with that going &#x2013; being said, I think we can go through the next slide, which is the Oil and Gas Activities. And here we did see, as I said at the beginning, significant reduction in revenue and also a significant reduction in the segment result, even if we still stayed comfortably profitable within this business. And the only &#x2013; or the only reason for the decline in result and turnover was really the oil price because we did produce slightly more in terms of oil, exactly one million barrels more than we did the year before. So it was really exclusively an oil price issue for the year.</p>
          <p>The stability in the production was due to the finalization of the Qatar project. So we had increase in volumes in Qatar. This will not go on into the future as we have now basically finalized the expansion project and that means that we will, going forward, get less and less return oil from, as I so, because we're getting payback on the investments and that will be at a declining rate as more and more is paid back.</p>
          <p>And that means that we will in 2010 see a production per quarter that is lower than 2009. It will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter of 2009 which &#x2013; where there were various reasons for the level, but it will be significantly lower than 2009. And then of course in the future at least the Qatar oil share, our share will continue to decline until there are significant new investments coming into play.</p>
          <p>Going to the next page, just talking a little bit about the future and what we do in discovery and development. We do expect in 2010 to progress on our evaluations of various finds that we've made. We're talking Golden Eagle, Hobby and Pink in the U.K., which is operated by Nexens, presently on the evaluation, and we expect finalized towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We're also looking to appraise the finds we made in Chissonga well in Angola, Culzean in the U.K. and Buckskin in the U.S., all finds that has been published before. The small Luke discovery in Denmark will be looked into, whether this can be developed possibly in connection with other finds in the area. And then we're looking to get new licenses in Norway.</p>
          <p>And even if we got less than we had hoped for and bid for in the Gulf of Mexico, we did get one share of an oil field, the oil field Jack, out of the portfolio of fields that we bid for out of the Devon portfolio. So things are &#x2013; a number of things are going on in the Oil and Gas Activities and we will for the year keep high exploration activity in Maersk Oil and Gas.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 10, the Retail Activity. The Retail business was not unexpectedly, as it should be, relatively stable within our portfolio in the 2009 crisis. People still eat fortunately. And that left us with relatively stable turnover and even a slight increase in the result from the business, a 10% increase up to DKK2.1 billion on this slide, important to remember.</p>
          <p>It was in terms of turnover, we declined in Denmark but we're still building new shops abroad, and that led to an increase in the international operations and turnover. But as I said stable business, a small increase in profitability due to cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Going to Slide 11, which is the so-called industrial activities, the Shipyards, Danske Bank and the old industrial business here. We had a significant negative result from the Shipyard group, which has also been the case in the previous years. And the real news from the year was that we decided to phase out shipbuilding by 2012 when the last ships on order will have been delivered. We will phase down or reduce gradually the activity levels, and hopefully also the losses, as we go through this period.</p>
          <p>Danske Bank got an improved share of results in &#x2013; or we got an improved share result in 2009 compared to 2008, where we actually had a negative result from Danske Bank because we did make an impairment. We did not receive any dividend in 2009 because of the bank package that the government gave to the banks and they were contingent on not paying dividends for 2008 and 2009. In Rosti &#x2013; and that means we will also not have a dividend in 2010 coming to us unfortunately.</p>
          <p>In Rosti, we sold our technical plast activities. And that means that we only have 2 very small activities left in Rosti, which we will continue to pursue disposal of.</p>
          <p>And this was the conclusion of this slide and I'll now hand over to Trond who'll go through the financial figures.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'll now take you through the consolidated financial information and some outlook at the end before handing over to Nils again. As we can see on Slide #12, we ended up with a revenue of USD48.5 billion for 2009. The decline is driven by, as Nils has repeatedly stated, the freight rates in Container business and volumes, the lower tank rates, as well as the oil price driving the revenue.</p>
          <p>We ended up at the EBITDA of 9.2 billion. And the EBITDA is, of course, improved by the cost reduction, even though it is a significant decline from last year, also driven by the previous explanations on the revenue.</p>
          <p>Depreciation has increased with approximately 500 million, and that is basically driven by delivery of new vessels and rates. But the high level is also a result of the impairment for more than 500 million, leaving us at the 5.7 billion in depreciations.</p>
          <p>Sales gains, 161 million lower than last year due to the market and as well as associates improving as a result of not depreciating the impairments of associates in 2008, leaving us at an earnings before interest and tax on USD3.8 million.</p>
          <p>Financial items at short of 1 billion, an improvement of almost 0.5 billion, due to not having write-down of market values of investments, and also currency losses that was in 2008. So ended up at profit before tax on 2.9. Tax is high due to the hydrocarbon taxes from 3.8, leaving us at the loss for the year of just above USD1 billion.</p>
          <p>But with the significant loss in Container business, it also show that the result of 2009, the robustness in the other business units that actually is showing, even though 1 billion is a high loss. It actually shows robustness in the other business units and the delivery of the results.</p>
          <p>Just a few comments on the fourth quarter numbers. We have seen a revenue pickup quarter-on-quarters throughout 2009, ending up at a revenue of 13.2 billion in the fourth quarter. And earnings before interest and tax, depreciations at 2.3 billion, leaving us at an earnings before interest and tax at almost the same level as 2008, at 900 million. And that is due to that &#x2013; the improvement in the lines of associated companies as a result, as I mentioned, of the write-downs as we did in 2008.</p>
          <p>Improvements in the fourth quarter on financial items come in year-over-year as a result of the same currency effects. And that leaves us at the quarterly loss of 318, also considering that the impairment during the quarter is approximately $215 million.</p>
          <p>Going to Slide #13, just showing you a specification of impairment throughout the year, ending up in 2009 of the impairment of $539 million spread out on the segments that we actually have specified. And as I said, the impairment in fourth quarter were approximately $215 million.</p>
          <p>Going to Slide #14, showing you the operational cash flow, even though we're showing a loss of USD1 billion, the operating cash flow throughout the year is 4.7 billion. That includes a change in working capital of USD300 million.</p>
          <p>We still have an investment program that is high, and therefore the investment cash flow show almost $7.9 million &#x2013; billion dollars, sorry, leaving us a net negative cash flow throughout the year. The total asset leaves us at USD66.5 billion and the equity 30.6 billion at an equity ratio of just at 46%.</p>
          <p>Then going to Slide #15, a busy slide but it gives a lot of information relative to the funding position. On the top left, you see the cash flow generation in the last 5 years. The 2009 operational cash flow positive of 4.7 billion and an investment cash flow of 7.9, leaving the negative of 3.2 in the cash flow segment throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Going down to the bottom left, the outstanding capital commitments. The outstanding commitments is at the year end 2009 at 7.9 billion. That's a decline of 5.1 since last 12 months. And we have specified the elements of the commitments are down below. In addition, we have also obligations on the operational lease that we calculate on a usual discount rate, and that is at the year end calculated to about $12.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Going to the upper right hand, on the funding structure we see that the totaling interest bearing debt at the year-end is 21.2, an increase of 1.1 since last year. And the net interest bearing debt is 18.1, an increase of 2.6 since last year. The reason for the difference between &#x2013; the major difference between the net debt increase and the difference between the net &#x2013; the negative cash flow throughout the year is, of course, the sales of our owned treasury shares throughout the year.</p>
          <p>If you look at the bottom right, it is &#x2013; you see the maturity profile for the debt outstanding, so December 31. And you can see that it is very good maturity profile. It's spread over a long period of time. So we see that the position at year end is very good for the Group.</p>
          <p>At year end we also have a liquidity buffer, almost $11 billion. So the liquidity situation in the Group is very good. That includes of course the committed undrawn facilities of approximate just short of USD9 billion. So overall, what we can say is that combining the commitments and the outstandings, we see that the liquidity situation and the funding profile of the Group is very comfortable as we see the situation today.</p>
          <p>Then going to the outlook for 2010. In the Container Shipping market, the 7 to 10% additional tonnage is expected for the global container fleet. Cargo volumes are expected to rise by 3 to 5% in 2010 relative to 2009. And freight rates are also expected to rise. This will lead to a significant improvement in results if the level of vessels taken out of service is sustained. However, rates are not expected to lead to an expectable return in 2010.</p>
          <p>On the APM Terminals, APM Terminals experienced a continued stabilization of volumes in the beginning of 2010. The overall volumes are expected to rise moderately in 2010.</p>
          <p>The Tanker markets have benefited from the cold winter and declining oil stocks in early 2010. However, rates remain unsatisfactory and the additional new tonnage combined with weak demand for crude oil and refined products is expected to cause challenging markets conditions in 2010.</p>
          <p>In spite of the rising oil prices and a positive outlook for the oil industry, Offshore markets are expected to be negatively affected by excess capacity putting pressure on rates in 2010. Relatively good contract coverage ensures fairly high employment for Maersk Drilling, Maersk FPSOs and Maersk Supply Service also in 2010. However, several rates and ships are not under contract at the beginning of 2010.</p>
          <p>For the Oil and Gas segment, activities are expected to maintain a high activity level with increased investments in the exploration in 2010. The Group's entitlement of production for the next 4 quarters is expected to be lower than in 2009, but on average slightly above the entitlement of production in the fourth quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>So overall, the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk group is expected to post a modest profit in 2010. Cash flow from operating activities is expected to be well above the 2009 level, while cash flow used for investing activities is expected to be well below.</p>
          <p>We have to emphasize, though, that the outlook for 2010 is subject to considerable uncertainty, not least due to developments in the global economy. But specific uncertainties relate to the container freight rates, transported volumes, the U.S. dollar exchange rate and the oil prices.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll leave the closing remarks to Nils.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well just to sum up really &#x2013; thank you, Trond. 2009 was a very tough year, no question about it. And I think we today look into the future with somewhat more clarity than we had a year ago where the situation was really very, very bad. And our company managed to get through, in our opinion, the year with relatively good results.</p>
          <p>We had a loss and which was caused by low rates in the Container business and the Tanker business. And needless to say we had falling oil prices, but that was not really the issue. The issue was very low rates in the Container and Tanker business. But we still managed to generate 4.7 billion in operating cash flow due to our ability to cut USD2 billion in cost. And we do feel that this resulted in an acceptable loss of USD1 billion.</p>
          <p>For 2010, obviously the priority, number one, is to return to profit. Trond has already gone through our forecast for the year and it's early in the year. There are no guarantees for neither profit nor for the size of it, but our best expectation at the moment is a small profit.</p>
          <p>Our priorities for the 2010 are very simple. We will continue our focus on cost reduction and simplification of processes. We feel that focusing on this has served us well over the last couple of years and it actually does still result in us delivering also a better service to our customers. We've seen simplification leading not only to reducing cost, but also to higher customer satisfaction and better employee engagement through the Group, so we'll continue on that.</p>
          <p>We will obviously continue strong focus on the market and customers. This is not just short term to ensure we get the business, but it is very necessary to position our businesses right for the future, going into the right investments, making sure that we do things that make sense to the customers and not do things that we think are good for us or in general good. We need to make sure we understand what costs are driven by demands and are able to price our products correctly.</p>
          <p>We will focus on also on investments in the Oil and Gas Activities, as we've said before, and continue to be interested in investing more money into APM Terminals. That, for 2009, really proved that it was a solid business. In addition to that, we will look out for distressed assets. We are not in the market really for acquisitions. At least that's not high on our wish list, but in the case that distressed ships or rigs or other single assets come on the market, we'll be interested in looking at that.</p>
          <p>So that concludes our presentation. Thank you for listening in patiently. It was a bit longer than usual but it was a very exciting, interesting year we've gone out of and 2010 will surely be an exciting year as well.</p>
          <p>And with this we're ready for question and answers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hi there. Hi, both, to you. Just 3 questions please, let's take them one by one. First, on the very good cost control, I see that unit costs in Container Shipping were down 18% for the full year. In the 9 months they were down 16%, so that means fourth quarter was very good. Did you take extra costs out in Q4? Or was it just the utilization was a lot better in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. I mean, the 18% reduction was including the fall in bunker prices, if I'm not mistaken. And we did have better utilization during December so that was probably a very important reason why the unit cost went down more in that period. But it is an increasing effort during the year and we will continue to look at cost in that line also in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And following on from that, the 1.6 billion cost taken out, that &#x2013; the costs have actually left the business in '09? That's not an annualized figure of which more will follow in '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is just at BO, you can say, got just comparing to absolute cost level the year before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But don't forget we had started already in 2008 reducing cost. So we did enter 2009 on a lower cost base than the average of 2008. So that helped additionally as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Secondly on oil E&amp;P, in Brazil, I understand, the company has now submitted your drilling plan with the regulators. When will you be able to share that with the world at large, rather than only with the regulator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not having a very large drilling program in Brazil. We have, I believe, 5 blocks we're drilling in. So we're drilling one block at the moment and will, I mean, continue on the program, but it's not like we can say we have 20 wells planned and they will come now. It depends a little bit on timing issues, when do we have the analysis finalized, when can we get a drilling rig and so on. So the plan is obviously to drill all the blocks within the next couple of years, but it's &#x2013; but there's really not much more than that to share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the data on the first block and the completion of the appraisal well there, can we expect it during '10? Or will that move to '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm pretty sure that we will be able to have a first opinion on the first well this year for sure, and then it will be published. And we're drilling it together with EBX, so they're also on these &#x2013; very active in communication on these things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on Tankers, clearly it was a quite a horrible year. Can you do much more than you've done? You've taken probably all the costs out you can, so it's just a matter of waiting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that's a good point because the Tanker business is, of course, a business that is &#x2013; you have relatively small head count compared to the asset share among the management. It's a &#x2013; I'm sure that I hope the tanker people are not listening in, but it's a relatively simple business with a tramp-type contracting. So you can &#x2013; what you can do is really making sure you don't spend too much, and they are doing that, they have taken out the cost, and then hope for better rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally on the Terminals, 24% EBITDA margin. Clearly, a decent return now. Is there more to go for? Or do you think the return on sales and the return on capital are maxed out at these levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still below our benchmark with the other global terminal operators in terms of EBITDA margin. So we will continue to improve it. But of course in a difficult year to improve with 6 percentage points, I think we have to really congratulate the terminal people on it. It's a great achievement and it will not be that fast in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Peter Rothausen from Danske Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. A couple of questions. I'll take them one by one. Can you explain a bit more about your entitlement production guidance for 2010, whether that is solely attributable to Qatar or whether it's broad-based on all your operating fields?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The main decline is the Qatar decline and it's not a decline in the fuel production. We are talking about the decline in our share. So we'll see what comes out of the field during the year, but our share will be smaller. In addition to that, basically most of our other operations are mature and we will normally expect a decline in those fields. We will see probably a little bit more oil out of the U.K. as we're taking some additional facilities into operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of your Container business, you mentioned before that you'll continue to look into cost savings. Can you comment a bit on whether you are implementing a structural change in the way that you run your business, becoming much more simple, you could say, or commodity like? Or how do you see the ultimate business model for running a liners' business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we don't see our liner business as a commodity. We believe that we &#x2013; there is space for a liner company that gives superior service and really are focused on customer needs and understand our customers' business well. So for us it is not a commodity business. But we do appreciate that that we have cost wise to be in a leading position if we want to make real money in the business. So we are continuing to focus very much on cost.</p>
          <p>We have changed the structure of the business 2 years ago by eliminating the regions as we had them as operating entities. So we now have the headquarter and we basically have the countries or the clusters. So we eliminated one layer, and on top of that we're working on improving on our IT systems and internal processes. This is not something that happens from one day to the other, but we are seeing continued improvements in productivity and also in reliability and we'll continue on that trend. And the more reliable our processes become, the less &#x2013; or the higher productivity we can expect. So it's an ongoing effort at the moment. We don't expect really huge structural changes in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One question on cash flow. Working capital was negative in 2009. Is that a trend that we should expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'd like to take a lot of pride in the negative working capital development. But it's of course &#x2013; we have of course been helped also by the fall in turnover, so outstandings and so on has been helped by that. We will continue to have strong focus on the &#x2013; on the working capital, but if turnover and prices starts to improve again, that will put pressure on it of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my final question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very general answer. I'm sorry about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question on minority interest. It reads something like 1.5 billion, as I can see it, and almost doubling year-on-year. What's the reason behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well one effect is that we have a good result development in Danske Supermarked and there we have a significant minority shareholder, and I believe that is the most important effect. On top of that, in some terminals around the world, we're minority shareholders, so it differs a little bit about where profit flows basically within the Terminals business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Jacob Pedersen from Sydbank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, gentlemen. Just a couple of questions related to your Container business. You've obviously gained a lot of market share in 2009. How do you see the prospects for continuing market share gains in 2010? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have gained some market share last year. It looks a little bit more dramatic than it actually is. And it wasn't our strategy to gain market share but there are 3 effects coming in. One is that we have grown our backhaul business quite well last year. We were under-represented on backhaul and that we've corrected, at least somewhat, so that gave an increase. The second &#x2013; and by the way, also at lower rates than fronthaul is normal with haul.</p>
          <p>Then, we have grown our business in Croatia, which is a relatively small business. But they have done well because simply because the markets have been better there and we've also taken a bit of share of the market. And then the third effect is probably some of &#x2013; some customers have chosen to ship more with us last year as they considered us to be a more, you can say, a safe choice. And we're pleased with that, but we really didn't go out to gain market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you talk a bit about your strategy? When your time charters expire in the Container business, will you hand back vessels? Or will you keep them in your fleet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on our needs. We actually don't have a lot of excess capacity, if any, in our fleet. We have a few ships laid up and no plans to take them back into service, so it depends very much on which kind of ships come up for renegotiations. In most cases we probably renegotiate and get them back at lower rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my final question, could you just add a few comments on how you've seen the beginning of 2010 in your Container business versus fourth quarter '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We had, you can say, a mini boom in the Container business from beginning of December up till Chinese New Year, where we unfortunately had to roll some containers because the increase in volumes came quite unexpected. We've checked, of course, with our customers and ask their opinion of whether this is sustainable. And the answer we get in most cases is that this is mainly a correction of inventory where we last year saw a huge reduction in inventories. In many cases these have come down so far that replenishment was needed. So it's probably not an ongoing tendency. We hope, of course, this is not so. We hope for good development, but it's most realistic to assume that it will be somewhat less active after Chinese New Year. And then, of course, it's also important not to get confused by the growth rates that are published in the press because these are against very, very weak figures in the first &#x2013; at the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009. So we're showing growth but it's against a very, very big or weak market at the same time last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Lars Heindorff from ABG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions regarding the Oil and Gas division. Can you give us an indication about fuel production in the fourth quarter? I think you mentioned that it's 300,000 per day on average in 2009. And also what sort of run rate we should expect going into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We stated in our guidance that we will see in 2010 figures below 2009 and slightly above the fourth quarter of 2009. We did expect and did also say that after the third quarter that the production in 2009 in the last quarter would be significantly below the previous quarters. And the production in 2004 &#x2013; or 2010 will be just above the 2009 fourth quarter figures, in our estimation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it depends, of course, on oil prices. If oil prices drop, our share in Qatar will go up. So it's a &#x2013; can change somewhat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the fuel production, not your entitlement share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fuel production, sorry. The fuel production we do not wish to comment on. That is a matter for the Qataris to comment on their figures, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the exploration costs, they have increased quite considerably in the fourth quarter, and you also already stated that you expect that, that will continue to move up. Can you give us an sort of idea of what sort of levels you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; when we say fourth &#x2013; the fourth quarter exploration figure is quite high, but that's a little bit, you can say, a coincidence. So in general we expect 2010 exploration levels to be slightly above 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you. Regarding the CapEx program, which will be obviously a bit down versus 2010. But you still have, particularly in the Tankers and Offshore segment, you still have a considerable new building program. Can you give us an indication about what sort of flexibility do you have in that? Are you still &#x2013; are you in negotiation with yards about postponing or any slippage in that part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have stated on one of the charts, I can't remember exactly, what commitments we have going forward and these are the fixed commitment. In addition to that we'll of course look for opportunities and additional investments will come, but that is what we've committed to. We are continuously talking to the yards, but we are not in the position where we can specifically discuss postponements and things like that in public.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last, about your Container business. We've seen the spot rates have moved up significantly. And apparently, it appears at least, as if contract rates, to some extent, follows on. Can you give us some sort of indication about what have you done in terms of contract negotiations? Have you been out asking customers to open up contracts? Are you actually living up to the contractual obligations that you have entered into in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have as a principal that we live up to contractual obligations. In isolated cases where customers have opened contract with us as rates went down, we've also opened contracts with them as rates went up. But this has really been the exception both ways. Our customers in generally have honored their contracts and we have honored ours. Has been examples of isolated cases where we have not been able to give all the volume that people wish to ship with us from December to February, and that was simply a matter of not being able to predict the market development perfectly. There's also been cases, obviously, where the shipper's not shipped the quantities they had promised us during the first 11 months of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the Transpacific specifically, can you &#x2013; are you willing to give any comments about the ongoing contract negotiations there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Robin Byde from HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yeah. Good morning guys. Just a general question about Container shipping and idle tonnage. I think you said a bit earlier that there's fairly good discipline at the moment among the liner companies, so capacity's not being reintroduced too aggressively. As I recall, historically that's not been the case. So what do you think's changed this time around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think the most important thing is that the rates we see in the market today are still not good enough to justify an expansion of the capacity. So with the rates we see today you cannot sail the vessels faster, accepting higher bunker consumption, and you really in general do not have the fleet &#x2013; any incentive to reintroduce more ships into the fleet. I think we &#x2013; as liner shipping, it's been as an industry, it's been remarkable that we've kept up well or good service throughout 2009...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With significant negative cash flows in most liner companies. And so there is no incentive even at today's rates to increase the capacity. On top of that I think in general, we assume that the market will not continue on January-December levels going forward. You need month of security before you take an additional capacity. So that's, you can say, the logical argument for now, but the second reason is of course that the liner companies have seen huge losses in 2009...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>And we can say effectively the industry has been driven into bankruptcy. And even if we may not become the most disciplined industry in the world, hopefully we'll be able to at least not go down that route again.</p>

          <p>Hi, Steven.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Nils, and then also, Trond. And I have a few questions. Actually when you look on your impairment tests here in the fourth quarter, you could see the cumulative on &#x2013; specifically on Maersk Oil and Gas Activities, you had an impairment of USD41 million in the first 9 months of the year and now you have 126. And last year in the fourth quarter you had an impairment test of 130 for the first 9 months and now you have &#x2013; and you ended the year with 420. Is this a tendency we should continue to expect going forward that you are writing down the portfolio, your exploration portfolio or whatever you're writing down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are 2 very different reasons actually. Last year in 2008 the oil price dropped tremendously in the fourth quarter and that meant that the value of some of the fields became marginal. They're fortunately back up now, so it looks a little bit better but that such a drop in the oil price will trigger impairments in a number of cases. So that was 2008. It was really just a matter of timing of oil price. This year it's another, you can say, isolated incident, but we have written down goodwill on some fields, where we &#x2013; or drillings where we've been in carrying a partner. And having appraised the situation towards the end of the year, we've decided that there's no real expectation of success in these blocks.</p>
          <p>And then we have just, you can say, written down the carry element. The whole cost element is taken to cost as it happens. But what you pay to get into a field is activated. And then if you don't see a value, you have to write it down. But I think in general, you can say, you get, of course you keep all your figures in extra scrutiny when you come to the year end. So I guess in most companies you would see maybe slightly bigger impairments in the last quarter. But these 2 incidents here or situations are really isolated incidents or situations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a question on Maersk Line. When you look on your cost savings, you're stipulating that you've taken out, on Slide #4, you've taken out 1.6 billion in cost savings. Is that the year end effect, or is that the annual effect on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That is simply the accounts 2009 compared to 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not sort of run rate end of year compared to run rate the previous year or some &#x2013; it is simply just the actual figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. And the final one here, you had your volumes only coming down by 1% where you saw the market coming down significantly. Your rate was probably a little bit lower than what you've seen some of your competitors having. Is this reflecting that you took on over the summer a lot of volumes at a lower rate? And will this mean that once you come out of these contracts, you will actually see that you will have a more market-to-market on your freight rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we were a little bit more, you can say, reluctant to open contracts than some of our competitors. So that may have affected us negatively. But the real reasons, I guess, is that we had &#x2013; again we had increasing share mainly on the backhaul business, and that is lower rates. And we also had increasing business in the intra-Asia shipping, and that is also shorter routes and lower rates. So I think it's a little bit more mathematical than that, and we don't think that we have dropped rates more than the competition. Quite to the contrary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So we'll have one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question comes from Dan Togo from Handelsbanken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Let's just stay with the Container business here. Included in your guidance, do you expect rates to stay where they are right now? Or do you actually expect them to go further up? I understand, of course, that you indicate that they are not at an acceptable level as it is right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is too detailed a question for us to answer at this stage of the year. What we've said in our forecast, and that's probably as close as we get, is that we expect a significant improvement in the Maersk Line result and &#x2013; but we do not expect an acceptable business. And that is more or less reflecting the rates as they are now. They are better than last year but they are not &#x2013; they're not sufficient to give an acceptable return for the business. And that's as close we can get unfortunately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you could just elaborate a bit on how you see that &#x2013; to get to these acceptable levels, are there any more costs you can take out of the business? Or is it just a matter of waiting for terms to improve in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will continue to take cost of our business. We also expect Maersk Line to do better than the competition in terms of profitability. That is our stated objective. But of course at the end of day it does depend on supply and demand and discipline in the industry, and that's not something we can really influence alone. We can just await, you can say, as ships being scrapped and capacity taken out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we thank all of you for joining us. We hope we managed to answer most of the questions and create a little more clarity on the business. It is early in the year and we look forward to coming back during the year with &#x2013; back to you and for further good discussions and hopefully also delivering steady progress during the year. Thank you for listening in and joining us.</p>
