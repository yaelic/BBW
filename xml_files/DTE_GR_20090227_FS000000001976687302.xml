          <p>Good morning and good afternoon and welcome to Deutsche Telekom's Conference Call. On our customers' request, this conference will be recorded.</p>

          <p>This presentation contains forward-looking statements that reflect current views of Deutsche Telekom management with respect to future events. They include, among others, statements as to market potential and financial guidance statements, as well as our dividend outlook. They are generally identified by the words expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, aim, goal, plan, will, seek, outlook or similar expressions, and include generally any information that relates to expectations or targets for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, earnings, accounting profitability or other performance measures, as well as personnel-related measures and reductions.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections. You should consider them with caution. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict, and are generally beyond Deutsche Telekom's control, including those described in the sections, forward-looking statements and risk factors of the Company's annual report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>Among the relevant factors are the progress of Deutsche Telekom's workforce reduction initiative and the impact of other significant strategic or business initiatives, including acquisitions, dispositions and business combinations and cost-saving initiatives.</p>
          <p>In addition, regulatory rulings, stronger than expected competition, technological change, litigation and supervisory developments, among other factors, may have a material adverse effect on costs and revenue development.</p>
          <p>Further, the worsening of the current economic situation in Europe or North America and exchanges in &#x2013; exchange and interest rates may also have an impact on our business development and availability of capital under favorable conditions.</p>
          <p>If these or other risks and uncertainties materialize or if the assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, Deutsche Telekom's actual results may be materially different from those expressed or implied by such statements. Deutsche Telekom can offer no assurance that its expectations or targets will be achieved. Deutsche Telekom does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements to take new information or future events into account or otherwise.</p>
          <p>Deutsche Telekom does not reconcile its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a GAAP measure, because it would require unreasonable effort to do so.</p>
          <p>As a general matter, Deutsche Telekom does not predict the net effect of future special factors because of their uncertainty. Special factors and interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including impairment losses, can be significant to Deutsche Telekom's results.</p>
          <p>In addition to figures prepared in accordance with IFRS, Deutsche Telekom presents non-GAAP financial performance measures, including among others, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EBIT, adjusted net income, free cash flow, gross debt and net debt. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for the information prepared in accordance with IFRS.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP financial performance measures are not subject to IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies may define these terms in different ways.

          <p>Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Deutsche Telekom conference call on our full-year 2008 results. Our CEO, Ren&#xE9; Obermann and our CFO, Karl-Gerhard Eick will explain the good progress we made operationally as well as financially, as well as our new Board structure before answering your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand over now to our CEO, Ren&#xE9; Obermann.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephan, and good afternoon, everyone. As you will have seen from this morning's announcement, Deutsche Telekom has delivered a strong financial performance in 2008. We are pleased with the results as they have been produced against a background of deteriorating global economic conditions and turmoil in the capital markets.</p>
          <p>On an organic basis, revenues for the year were stable. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 0.7% to a reported EUR 19.5 billion and that compares with our original guidance of around EUR 19.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow has risen by almost 7% to EUR 7 billion. Our guidance was for around 6.6.</p>
          <p>The net income for the year more than doubled to EUR 1.5 billion. On an adjusted basis, net income increased to EUR 3.4 billion. Net debt at just over EUR 38 billion is only slightly up on last year despite cash CapEx of 8.7 billion and acquisitions, net of divestments, of EUR 4.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Against this background, we are delighted to be able to announce that the Management Board and the Supervisory Board have recommended to the annual general meeting an unchanged dividend for the year 2008 of EUR 0.78 per share.</p>
          <p>Three years ago, the new management team set out our strategy for the Group. Before going into detail on today's results, I thought it would be helpful if I summarized the main achievements to-date.</p>
          <p>Our strategy had the twin objectives of growing the business and reducing the cost base, and we have delivered on both counts. We executed our strategy to improve our competitiveness in Germany. We have achieved our target of a broadband retail net add share of at least 45% and of 0.5 million Triple Play customers.</p>
          <p>We have implemented a successful winback campaign that has resulted in our regaining more than 500,000 customers in 2008. We have gained market leadership in service revenues in mobile. We have improved the major service KPIs and we have made significant cost savings through Save for Service.</p>
          <p>Since the end of 2006, we have achieved growth savings at a current run rate of EUR 4.1 billion per annum. Internationally, our strategy to go abroad with mobile has been a success story. We completed the acquisition of a 25% plus 1 vote stake in OTE, with full consolidation from February 2009 and we saw double-digit growth rates in revenues and adjusted EBITDA in our Central and Eastern European operations in euros and also in our U.S. operations in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Within our strategy to mobilize the Internet, we have seen very strong growth in data revenues without messaging, 45% in Europe and, by the way, Q4 on Q4 last year, 64% in Germany, just in Germany, which is an amazing increase and 19% in local currency in the United States.</p>
          <p>Successfully launched the iPhone 3G in Germany and the G1 in the U.S. and in Europe and we have achieved excellent customer growth through web'n'walk, our mobile Internet product and MyFaves.</p>
          <p>And in achieving our fourth objective of building network-centric ICT, we have both developed the business and we have taken out costs. And there has been as a result, strong international revenue growth, the completion of a number of new big deals, rigorous cost cutting and the partnership deal with Cognizant, which makes us more competitive on the system integration side.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the operational performance, starting with the German and Central Eastern European operations. The revenue decline at BBFN domestic of 5.1% was at the midpoint of our guidance range. The decline in adjusted EBITDA of 4.9% however, was slightly better than anticipated. Our initial guidance has been for a decline of between 5 and 8%.</p>
          <p>The margin in BBFN domestic for the year improved slightly at just under 34%. I will go into the cost reduction at BBFN in a moment, but let me just draw your attention to the performance at T-Mobile Germany, where adjusted EBITDA has been stabilized at EUR 3 billion and the margin improved from 36.8 to 39%.</p>
          <p>In Phase 2 of Telecom Service, we agreed with the unions on call center consolidation from 63 to 33 cities. Network production with 6,000 employees has meanwhile been integrated into T-Service with the same salary and working conditions.</p>
          <p>Slide eight is on competitiveness in Germany. The strong emphasis on reducing cost at Broadband/Fixed Net, can be seen clearly in the figures.</p>
          <p>We achieved net savings in OpEx of EUR 0.8 billion and we were able to reduce the net head count in Germany by over 17,000, of which just over 9,100 was via deconsolidation. Total head count in Germany has now fallen by nearly 30,000, since the end of 2006.</p>
          <p>In domestic broadband, we achieved a retail net add share in the fourth quarter of 50%, which means that we have maintained our overall retail market share at 46% now for six successive quarters. This strong performance in net adds in Q4 is due to our competitive product offering and targeted regional pricing. In Triple Play specifically, as well as achieving our target with the 480,000 customers in Germany, we also gained 220,000 customers in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Our original guidance for domestic line losses for the year was between 2.5 and 3 million. In fact, we did slightly better than this with total line losses of 2.49 million, which, by the way, includes all-IP migrations of resellers.</p>
          <p>The emphasis that we have been placing on long-term contracts in order to reduce the churn rate, can be clearly seen on this chart. Broadband churn rate was reduced by one-third from 2007 to 2008, and nearly 90% of our broadband customers are now on two-year contracts. And for the first time, we were able to win back more broadband customers than we lost to competitors. We won back more than 0.5 million customers, we lost 400,000. So that is for us a very important milestone.</p>
          <p>In our strategy, we place considerable importance on improving the quality of service to our customer, and I am pleased to report that we have made considerable progress here. We have exceeded our target for attendance level availability of at least 80%. Our starting point was a totally unacceptable 40%, and we are also well ahead on IT stability.</p>
          <p>We are very close to the year-end target for appointments kept and we've also seen a significant fall in the volume of complaints, although there is still some room for improvement here.</p>
          <p>Our Central and Eastern European businesses continued to be very profitable. The margins for the year were nearly 42% and the adjusted EBITDA was EUR 1 billion.</p>
          <p>However, revenues and adjusted EBITDA were impacted by some of the same secular pressures we are facing in fixed-line in Germany. The sequential decrease of adjusted EBITDA seen in Q4 is partly seasonal and partly due to the weakness of the Hungarian forint versus the EUR, although the margin was more or less in line with Q4 '07.</p>
          <p>The relative stability of the margin was supported by our cost reduction program. The head count fell by 1,400 over the year to just over 15,000. There has been a significant improvement in the performance of T-Mobile Germany during 2008 and we are now the market leader in service revenues in mobile.</p>
          <p>For the year; overall service revenues fell by 1.6% which compares to the decline of 3.8% in 2007. And most importantly, in the fourth quarter specifically, we saw a slight increase of 0.5% year-on-year compared with a fall of 4% year-on-year in the same period in '07.</p>
          <p>The strength of service revenues in Q4 was supported by a very strong data revenue growth which we've always predicted was going to happen and now we see it happening, which grew by almost 64% year-on-year and strong contract service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 was minus 4% year-on-year compared with a decline of over 11% in Q4, 2007.</p>
          <p>In the year overall, adjusted EBITDA rose by 3.1% which compares to a decline of over 11% in 2007. Excluding the intangible asset sale of EUR 0.1 billion in Q3, adjusted EBITDA was essentially stable year-on-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 36.8 in '07 to 39% in '08. Compared to Q4 2007, the margin decreased slightly in Q4 2008 due to higher contract SACs in connection with the iPhone 3G in particular.</p>
          <p>Contract net adds, supported by the introduction of the iPhone in July, the 3G iPhone, in July were over 950,000 in total for the year which is broadly stable in comparison to previous year.</p>
          <p>MOUs per contract customer were up by around 6% year-on-year which translates into total contract MOUs up 12%.</p>
          <p>Data revenues, without messaging, increased by nearly 46% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Now to T-Mobile International. The growth story continues. We added 4.2 million new contract customers during 2008. That means that our total international customer base including prepaid as of December 2008 was just over 89 million.</p>
          <p>Year-on-year organic international revenue growth was 5.6% while organic international adjusted EBITDA increased by 5.6% as well. The performance was particularly strong in the U.S. and in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Our position in Southeastern Europe is further strengthened through the strategic partnership with OTE. As of Q3, 2008, OTE had more than 18 million mobile customers and 8.5 million fixed network customers.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., total revenues, service revenues, and adjusted EBITDA in U.S. dollars, all recorded double-digit growth year-on-year in Q4 specifically and for the year as a whole. The margin also improved up from 26% in Q4 '07 to 27.8% in Q4 '08. Year-on-year, it increased from 27.8 to 28.4%. Net adds in Q4 were 621,000 making a total for the year of just under 3 million.</p>
          <p>In October, we successfully launched the G1, the first Android-based device. By the end of the year, we had 3G coverage in 130 major cities which is equivalent to 107 million POPs.</p>
          <p>During this year, we will have almost doubled this to 205 million POPS that is one of our major priorities for 2009, alongside becoming even more competitive in terms of devices and attractive propositions.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'm very pleased to report that we have regained the prestigious J.D. Power award for the best line of customer care in the United States.</p>
          <p>In Central and Eastern Europe mobile; we have again seen a strong performance. Total revenues, service revenues, and adjusted EBITDA, all delivered year-on-year double-digit growth with a margin of 41%, an improvement of 1.6 percentage points over 2007.</p>
          <p>The slowdown in revenues and adjusted EBITDA growth in Q4 was mostly due to adverse currency movements, in particular, the Polish zloty and the Hungarian forint versus the euro. However, the fourth quarter margin was up year-on-year by 1 percentage point from Q4 '07. Contract net adds amounted to 1.9 million with over 550,000 in Q4 and contract churn remains very low i.e. under 1% in all key markets.</p>
          <p>Compared to 2007, net adds slowed down only slightly for both full year and Q4. The cash contribution of the businesses in 2008 increased by over 18% year-on-year to &#x20AC;1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the third component of our strategy which is mobilizing the internet. Mobile data continues to be a strong growth story. Without messaging, data revenues increased by just under 30% globally to &#x20AC;2.5 billion. However, in Europe specifically, the growth was even 45% year-on-year to &#x20AC;1.4 billion while in the U.S., data revenues without messaging increased by about 20% in local currencies to $1.5 billion. Including messaging, U.S. data revenues increased by over 30% to $3.3 billion.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we sold about 5.4 million 3G-capable devices in '08, an increase of almost 80% over the number sold in 2007. The iPhone 3G was launched at the beginning of July and the G1 in the U.S. as I mentioned, and also in the U.K.</p>
          <p>As of the year-end, we had sold 600,000 iPhone 3G within a few months in Europe including 333,000 in our still most important market in Germany. And the G1 was rolled out in a number of the other major European markets during January and February 2009 and the first signs are encouraging signs.</p>
          <p>Let me just give you some specifics to highlight the growth in mobile data in Europe.</p>
          <p>Web'n'walk users now number 5.3 million. Data revenues without messaging exceeded &#x20AC;400 million in Q4 '08. In the U.S., MyFaves users have increased to 7.7 million. Data revenues without messaging amounted to over U.S. $420 million in Q4 2008.</p>
          <p>In Europe, data ARPU, excluding messaging, increased by over 30% year-on-year to &#x20AC;1.7, UMTS data volume more than tripled year-on-year to over 2,800 terabytes.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. data ARPU including messaging increased to U.S. $9.30 and the numbers of SMSs and picture messages increased to an astounding 57 billion in Q4 2008, more than double the number at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>Let's move on now to the Business Customers division. As we announced in November, T-Systems has been restructured so that the focus is now on providing the top 400 clients with customized ICT solutions.</p>
          <p>It is on this basis that we will be reporting from Q1 2009. During '08, we achieved strong international sales, with revenues up by over 7% and an adjusted order entry book that had increased by over 5% to over &#x20AC;12 billion.</p>
          <p>Important deals closed in 2008 included Shell, Deutsche Post World Net, Sparkassen, BMW, and Alcatel-Lucent to which can now be added Linde and REWE, I don't know, spelt REWE, what it is in English, REWE, I don't know, the German Company in February this year.</p>
          <p>We have also made good progress in reducing costs. The net domestic head count fell by 4,200 in 2008. Save for Service made a contribution of &#x20AC;0.5 billion and the OpEx base was reduced by &#x20AC;0.2 billion on an organic basis at T-Systems.</p>
          <p>So, the Business Customer division has seen a clear turnaround in revenues and in adjusted EBITDA in 2008. Over the course of 2008, total revenues grew continuously quarter-by-quarter with the Shell deal having had a positive impact from Q3.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA has improved sequentially since Q2. Results in Q2 were burdened by a price decline. The improvement in the second half of the year clearly demonstrates that the efficiency measures are starting to show effect. So, our strategy is working and we've made really good progress to date but, of course this is not a standstill; there is a lot of work to be done.</p>
          <p>At domestic fixed lines, we need to continue stabilizing our broadband net add share at approximately 45%. And &#x2013; I mean, in Q4, last year we did almost 50%, so, 45% should be doable. And to deliver an aggregate number of 1 million Triple Play customers by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>In mobile, the task is to stabilize the leadership in service revenues. In U.S. mobile, the rapid rollout of the 3G network is a must and that should enable us to catch up in the mobile internet game that is just beginning by the way.</p>
          <p>The rollout of the 3G network and of more competitive devices is also key to addressing our biggest concern regarding the U.S. businesses which is still the high contract churn rate that we have seen in recent quarters. While this high churn rate was partially the result of the two-year anniversary of the introduction of two-year contracts, it was also due to the impact of competition in particular, the iPhone 3G. We have started to address this deficit with the launch of the G1 in Q4 but more needs to be done in terms of 3G network rollout as I said earlier on, and further strengthening of our device lineup.</p>
          <p>The good thing is that the spectrum which we have acquired in '06 can now be utilized fully and we actually do a great job in rolling it out and, by the end of the year, cover more than 200 million POPs and the U.S. team is on the right path and fully committed to 3G.</p>
          <p>We have also to ensure a rapid integration of OTE and to ensure that synergies are being realized. In mobilizing the internet, the challenge will be to ensure that we consistently deliver new and innovative product and data tariffs that respond to customer needs. There will be important and exciting product announcement at CeBIT next month. So, all of you are invited to join us at CeBIT and see what we're providing there.</p>
          <p>And in T-Systems, the focus will be on strengthening our international market position, stabilizing revenues and further improving the adjusted EBITDA &#x2013; the adjusted EBIT margin. We have very ambitious goals and the team is committed to achieve those goals.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me conclude with our guidance for 2009. Further to what we said in November, I can confirm that we expect an adjusted Group EBITDA around the level achieved in '08 which is around &#x20AC;19.5 billion. The same holds true through for free cash flow which we expect to be around &#x20AC;7 billion in '09.</p>
          <p>And as I hope, it will be clear from this morning's announcement of an unchanged 2008 dividend, the management of Deutsche Telekom is and feels committed to an attractive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Karl, let me just say a few words about the new Group target structure that we announced yesterday. The success of Focus, fix and grow, which was the title of our strategy with the four building blocks you are familiar with, has placed us in a very good shape for the development of our business going forward. The next stage in the implementation our strategy would involve a project to shift from a divisional to a regional go-to market approach and to strengthen the functional responsibilities across the Group.</p>
          <p>In practice, this means a further integration and harmonization of our customer and go-to market approach in Germany, which is a continuation of the process that we began two years ago, when we consolidated the sales and customer service functions.</p>
          <p>In addition, with a strategic partnership with OTE, we needed to reorganize the structure of our European operations outside of Germany.</p>
          <p>It means that in Southeast Europe we are putting in place a dedicated management team and a dedicated Board member tailored to regional market requirements, the shareholder structure in our Southeast European footprint.</p>
          <p>Separately, we'll continue to optimize the focus on the mobile-only countries in Europe and the United States.</p>
          <p>Operating across this geographically based structure will be an integrated product and innovation function, led by Chief Operating Officer, Hamid Akhavan, who will be responsible for driving bundling and alignment in the areas of technology, IT and procurement.</p>
          <p>In order to make all of this happen and to work out all the details, we have a dedicated project team headed up by Thomas Dannenfeldt who is with us for many years and has done a great job so far at T-Home to drive and detail the implementation of the entire concept. Our target date for this is July for the new structure.</p>
          <p>As the first initiative, we have decided to create a new Board position for Southeast Europe with Guido Kerkhoff, previously Head of Group Accounting and Controlling who will build up this new position as a member of the Board. From the target date of July 1, he will lead the Group companies in this region including OTE.</p>
          <p>Tim H&#xF6;ttges, will become the new CFO, starting March, 1. And Niek Jan van Damme, the Managing Director of T-Mobile, Netherlands since the beginning of 2004 will take on Tim's position at T-Home.</p>
          <p>Also from the middle of the year, Niek Jan will take on the responsibility for distribution, marketing and service, for both fixed and mobile in Germany.</p>
          <p>At the same time, Hamid Akhavan will take on his enlarged role as Chief Operating Officer for Europe. In addition, he will continue to be responsible in the Board for all those markets where we just operate on mobile in U.K., Netherlands, Austria, Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
          <p>I would like to hand over now to Karl to go into more details on the financials and by way for the last time.</p>
          <p>So Karl, please take the word.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ren&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased with our full-year financial results. We achieved a turn-around in adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and adjusted net income. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.7% to almost EUR 19.5 billion, driven by Mobile and improved trend in domestic Broadband/Fixed Network, which came in slightly better than the original guidance range. Free cash flow improved to EUR 7 billion, supported by working capital, lower restructuring payments, and lower net interest payments, more than offsetting higher income tax payments and higher cash CapEx.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income improved by 14% to EUR 3.4 billion due, in particular, to lower D&amp;A. Net debt increased only modestly by EUR 0.9 billion to EUR 38.2 billion, despite EUR 4.4 billion spent on acquisitions, net of divestments, namely SunCom and OTE, and despite cash CapEx of EUR 8.7 billion. This is a reflection of our very strong cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that we were faced with a significant currency headwind last year. With constant exchange rates revenues would have been EUR 1.3 billion higher. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA would have been EUR 0.3 billion higher. Adjusted of these currency effects and changes in the scope of consolidation, organic revenues were flat last year, while organic adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.8%.</p>
          <p>Coming to the divisions, clearly Mobile continued to be the growth driver for the Group, in terms of both revenues as well as adjusted EBITDA. Mobile revenues grew by 2.4% or 3.6% organically.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA improved by 6.2% or 6.3% organically, including the Q3 one-time gain from an asset sale of EUR 0.1 billion in Germany. In terms of organic growth, T-Mobile U.S. remained the main growth driver with 10% organic revenue growth in '08 and 12.7% organic adjusted EBITDA growth.</p>
          <p>But the organic mobile revenue growth was also supported by Eastern Europe and T-Mobile Netherlands. In terms of adjusted EBITDA growth, Germany was also a contributor, which is a particularly encouraging development.</p>
          <p>In domestic Broadband/Fixed Network we delivered on our guidance from March '08. Revenues decreased by 5.1%, within the guidance range of minus four to minus six percent. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 4.9%, actually slightly better than the guidance range of minus five to minus eight percent. This good result reflects our progress in terms of cost reduction, with net costs reduced by EUR 0.8 billion, significantly better than our original guidance of EUR 0.1 billion.</p>
          <p>These results are even more remarkable, considering that we achieved our broadband retail market share target in 2008 and were able to sell almost 500,000 Triple Play packages by the end of the year in line with our target. In comparing Q4 with Q4 please bear in mind that most of the cost savings last year, namely 0.6 billion of EUR 0.9 billion, were realized only in Q4, which obviously impacts the year-on-year comparison. Q4 '08 was also impacted by sequentially higher market investments, especially into our Triple Play offers, as anticipated.</p>
          <p>In addition, costs increased sequentially due to seasonally higher maintenance costs, further investments into IT, especially the retirement of legacy systems, and R&amp;D expenses at the product house for new products and features for the Triple Play offers, for example.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Business Customers, while reported revenues and adjusted EBITDA showed a strong decline, this was mostly due to changes in the scope of consolidation, namely the sale of Media &amp; Broadcast and the transfer of Active Billing to Broadband/Fixed Network. Adjusted for this and currency effects, revenues declined by only 1.2% rather than the minus 8.2% reported and adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat rather than the minus 20% reported.</p>
          <p>International revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, driven by big deals such as Shell, and reached 7.4%. We also saw a positive trend with regard to organic adjusted EBIT. Compared to '07, organic adjusted EBIT increased more than five times to EUR 61 million.</p>
          <p>The trends that we saw for the full year further improved in Q4. Organic revenue increased by 1.5%, while organic adjusted EBITDA increased by 27.4% to EUR 237 million. International revenue growth accelerated further, reaching 12.6% in Q4. And adjusted EBIT improved strongly, both on a reported and organic basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of our cost reduction program, Save for Service, we made very good progress in '08. By the end of the year the total run rate of the program had reached a gross cost reduction of EUR 4.1 billion per year, compared to a target of up to EUR 4.7 billion reduction by '10. Supported by currency and the incremental Save for Service contribution of EUR 1.8 billion, we were able to achieve net cost savings of EUR 0.1 billion in '08, despite higher market spend.</p>
          <p>Broadband/Fixed Network remained the biggest contributor to Save for Service, but strong contributions were also made by Business Customers and Mobile.</p>
          <p>A key contributor to this cost reduction was the head count development for the Group. In Germany the head count was reduced by 17,200 employees on a net basis, including 9,100 via deconsolidation. The net head count reduction in Germany easily exceeds the net increase of 3,500 outside Germany. This led to the reduction in adjusted personnel expenses of 5.3% domestically in Q4 or 1.1% for the Group as a whole.</p>
          <p>While we are satisfied with the progress it is clear that this is an ongoing progress &#x2013; process, excuse me and there is really no alternative to further head count reduction.</p>
          <p>Turning to free cash flow, with EUR 7 billion we clearly overachieved our target of EUR 6.6 billion. And we were able to do this despite the significantly higher income tax payments, where we received a net tax refund in 2007, and significantly higher cash CapEx.</p>
          <p>Cash CapEx increased due to higher CapEx at T-Mobile U.S., in connection with the 3G rollout, and at Broadband/Fixed Network, driven in particular by growth in DSL and VDSL expansion, as well as higher IT investments and the optimization of processes.</p>
          <p>Besides the higher reported EBITDA, cash generated from operations clearly benefited from the change in working capital and accruals. The reason for the improvement is that usually in Q4 optimization of working capital did not re-occur in Q4 '07 and therefore helped us to improve the year-on-year comparison of working capital.</p>
          <p>Cash generated from operations also benefited from lower restructuring payments, which decreased by &#x20AC;0.3 billion to &#x20AC;1.4 billion in '08. Net cash was also supported by lower net interest payments. I would like to emphasize that we achieved the higher free cash flow despite a drop in the proceeds from the disposals of assets in '08.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the bottom line. Adjusted net income increased by 14%, despite higher P&amp;L income taxes and despite higher minorities. The main driver of this, besides higher adjusted EBITDA, was an improvement in D&amp;A, predominantly due to lower depreciation at Mobile Europe, Business Customers, and GHS.</p>
          <p>Compared to adjusted net income, reported net income was impacted by a number of special charges. Nevertheless, reported net income more than doubled to &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me just mention the main special factors. In total, EBITDA was impacted by &#x20AC;1.4 billion of special charges, including &#x20AC;1.1 billion related to personnel expenses. These include charges for severance payments and early retirement.</p>
          <p>Net financial expense was impacted by an &#x20AC;0.7 billion charge predominantly due to a special write-down on the carrying value of OTE of &#x20AC;0.5 billion. I would like to stress that this write-down is not a result of a change in the business plans but rather the result of a market-driven change, i.e. increase in the discount rates.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude my remarks by discussing net debt, balance sheet ratios, our liquidity reserves, and our maturity profile. Due to the very strong free cash flow, net debt increased by only &#x20AC;0.9 billion despite &#x20AC;4 billion in dividends, including minorities, and &#x20AC;4.4 billion spent on acquisitions, net of divestments, namely OTE and SunCom. Including OTE, pro forma net debt amounted to &#x20AC;42.9 billion. Comparing this to the pro forma adjusted EBITDA including OTE of &#x20AC;21.7 billion, the pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio would be a very manageable two times, at the lower end of our target range of 2 to 2.5. Since OTE has not reported yet, the full-year '08 figures for OTE are based on the Bloomberg earnings consensus.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet ratios excluding OTE remained very strong in '08, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of two times, a gearing of 0.9 times, and an equity ratio of 35%. Each of these ratios was toward the better end of our comfort zone.</p>
          <p>Just as a reminder, back in December, we narrowed our comfort zone net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio from 2 to 3 times to 2 to 2.5 times. We want to maintain a liquidity reserve of 30% of net debt.</p>
          <p>At year-end, liquidity reserves amounted to &#x20AC;20 billion, equivalent to more than 50% of net debt. We have a total of 28 bilateral credit facilities of &#x20AC;600 million each, which add up to &#x20AC;16.8 billion.</p>
          <p>As of December 31st, the average time to maturity of the credit lines was 2.2 years. Loan terms ensure the quality of our liquidity reserve. There are no financial covenants, no MAC clauses, and no rating triggers.</p>
          <p>We have a very manageable maturity profile, especially considering our free cash flow guidance and our unused bilateral credit lines. So far we have funded &#x20AC;2.2 billion this year. The eight-year &#x20AC;2 billion bond issued in January '09 was a very successful offering with a 6% coupon and a make-up of 2.65% above the eight-year interbank rate limit swap.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I think you will agree with me that Deutsche Telekom is a financially very strong company. We successfully managed the financial turnaround and are in excellent shape in these difficult times. This is demonstrated by the positive net income development, the positive adjusted EBITDA development, the positive free cash flow development, essentially stable net debt and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio even after acquisitions, strong balance sheet ratios and a strong liquidity buffer.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Mr. Peter-Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux, your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions please, first one related to the domestic BBFN business and the second T-Mobile USA. 12 months ago, at the Investor Conference, we focused on T-Home. You gave us a fairly ambitious target of stabilizing revenues and EBITDA in that business by 2010. In the meantime, we're obviously getting closer to that time horizon and in the meantime you have either met or exceeded your operational targets. Would you be prepared to reiterate that target again today or has anything happened in the meantime that would have changed your ambition of stabilizing revenues and EBITDA in 2010?</p>
          <p>And my second question relates to T-Mobile USA. Last year, you gave us a target for customer intake in U.S., you haven't done that this time and I can understand why. But nonetheless, would you be prepared to give us sort of a number for customer intake in the U.S. you would be happy with for 2009? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Peter, the T-Home, look, our expectation was to improve trends in '08 compared to '07, both in revenues and EBITDA, as well as, of course, on the cost base. Because we &#x2013; obviously, I mean, the old traditional fixed line is going to shrink and continue to shrink but &#x2013; so we have to steer against that and compensate it with cost discipline. And I think we achieved or slightly overachieved as you said. However, I don't think it would be right to cause a different expectation. We think we can stabilize it in 2010. I don't think it would be at this point in time correct to say it's going to happen much earlier. So let us work towards it and if we get there earlier, that's fine, but I can't promise that at the moment.</p>
          <p>U.S., no, we can't give you any specific guidance on customer numbers for '09. Let's see how it goes. As I said earlier on for so far the U.S. business is not impacted by the prices, at least not to our understanding; we look at all the KPIs and we haven't yet experienced any major impact. So &#x2013; but still we were not giving any specific guidance for the moment for the U.S.</p>

          <p>Mr. Hannes Wittig from J.P. Morgan, may we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. First on the political environment in Germany, do you think that the current political and economic context in Germany makes your cost cutting more difficult, and have you recognized that in your assumptions? And, also generally, more generally, would you consider your guidance of around 19.45 billion if currencies stay where they are as a stretch target or as a very comfortable guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hannes, we have continued to make efforts to make our business more efficient in Germany but I think the most controversial point last year had been the call center location reductions where we are in 63 cities historically and we've decided to cut that down. Initially, we wanted to cut it down to less than 30 and we arrived at 33 as a compromise. But that should &#x2013; and that is currently being in execution and you should assume that we are executing what we have planned to execute and that Save for Service program is continuing. And so now I can say that &#x2013; two years ago we said between 4.2 and 4.7 we would deliver in savings. I think now we are at least at 4.7, so we will continue our cost saving initiatives. We'll continue call center location reductions. We will continue the hasnal (49.56) umbau, the personnel restructuring, but we will continue to do that in a socially acceptable way as we've done so before. So, no, is the answer, I don't think we will be hindered to do that.</p>
          <p>Guidance, I think is okay. I think the guidance is &#x2013; we feel good about the guidance of around 19.5. Look, I would never say it's a sandbag guidance, I would never say it's too ambitious. I think it's the right guidance. It's something we can achieve but we got to work hard for it and we will as in pervious years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Hannes, remember, year-to-date the currencies have netted each other broadly out. And remember that back in 2008 we were able to compensate 300 million loss on the EBITDA side just out of currency. So we proved that we can compensate even for negative currency development to a certain extent.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just one question, thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify what the charge was for, the &#x20AC;1 billion charge in Q4 precisely? How many personnel you think that will cover and what form that restructuring will take? And I presume that relates basically to restructuring you'll do in 2009, and if you can give any other clarification on your restructuring program in Germany during 2009. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Nick, we are not giving any precise guidance with respect to how many personnel that relates to. What we would like to do, however, as it will be cash effective in 2009, we'll be reporting quarter by quarter what we did on the personnel side and the end of the year how much that was in cash out.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. A couple of questions. Firstly, Vodafone guiding margins down 200 basis points or so year-on-year, seems to be anticipating increased competitive intensity across the Western European properties. How do you think about the trade-off between margin and growth across your mobile portfolio, and should we expect a similar decline for T-Mobile?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I guess a fairly simple question, but is it reasonable to assume that the Telef&#xF3;nica roaming agreement with T-Mobile Germany is worth something in the region of 200 to &#x20AC;400 million and is it right to assume it's a 100% margin? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, well Ren&#xE9; will be answering the first question. We're not giving any detailed information with respect to the roaming agreement with Telef&#xF3;nica in Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that, for instance, in Germany we're seeing &#x2013; most recently we're seeing quite a good trend. For years now, we've been waiting for that moment to happen when finally we could see a stabilization in revenues overall in the market, a pickup in revenues from mobile Internet and also some price elasticity in voice minutes.</p>
          <p>So, without being over optimistic, but I would say that our businesses in mobile see some good opportunities, in particular coming from mobile Internet. That trend is just beginning, as I said, and I keep saying to you since probably too long, two years, three years now, that trend is really picking up momentum so I am not that skeptical.</p>

          <p>Mr. Mathieu Robilliard from Exane Paribas, may you ask your question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, two questions please. First a question regarding T-Mobile USA where there was a very good number in terms of the margin apparently, essentially due to a decline in unit tax. I was wondering if that's something you think is sustainable in 2009, as you are probably going to market an increasing number of smartphones? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question has to do with the broadband in Germany. Two years ago, you were able to get a lot of customers into two years contract, I think they must be maturing at some point this year, can you tell us maybe when you expect the first wave of maturities to happen and how lower is the pricing point today versus what most &#x2013; a lot of these contracts are on? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our U.S. long-term expectation has not changed. We think that margins from today over the mid to long term can improve to 30% and beyond, up to 35. On the long run, margins, U.S. SAPs vary a little bit with the introduction of new device that's true. But not &#x2013; I don't think it's a major increase in SAPs. They could go up slightly with a stronger push of 3G devices. But then in return, see the opportunity, the difference between us and our competitors is still some 4 or $5 in ARPU on mobile Internet services. And if through a stronger push of 3G devices, we can catch up in that difference, it should be a very nice economic. So, I am not so skeptical on U.S. margin developments.</p>
          <p>What was the second question, broadband Germany customers? Yeah, not more than 90 &#x2013; or around 90% of our German broadband customers are now in long-term contracts. And we have a good systematic now on churn prediction and churn prevention. So, I am also optimistic that we have a fairly good customer loyalty and we'll continue to see even better customer loyalty in Germany.</p>
          <p>But we regained 500,000 customers who came back from competitors. That is quite unusual for the German operation. It has now apparently convinced customers that it's not always good to save the last two euros but instead accept a good value for money price, but not the cheapest and come back to Deutsche Telekom because that's where they get the best service. And that's where they get the best network, the best devices and people are now understanding that and we will keep pushing for that message.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A couple of questions. One again on the U.S., I was just wondering if you can give us a bit more detail on the data rates that your 3G investments are giving and how that positions you against the Verizon and AT&amp;T rates?</p>
          <p>And then the second question was on group leverage. Because I guess if you were, for example, to sustain your dividend at current levels into 2009 there would naturally be some further deleveraging taking you comfortably below the low end of your target range. Just kind of wondering, as a management team, what your thoughts are about whether in the short term you're happy see the leverage fall below that target range. And if not, what kind of actions you've planned to take either through M&amp;A or increased distributions to kind of keep it in that range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where we built the network and where we have coverage in our 3G network, we can deploy HSDPA and can go up to 7.2 and then in the next steps increase the data rates even further, if that's what you mean, the competitiveness of the quality of the access. Where we are, we're pretty competitive. Our problem is yet, because we only got the spectrum in '06 to be deployed for that and ever since had to clear the spectrum, we still need to catch up in building out the network, and that's one of the most &#x2013; the highest priorities in the U.S. management. But where we are, definitely we have a great network. What was the second question on?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we would do with this kind of surplus equity. Now, first and foremost, let me give at least an indication of an answer. Including OTE, we arrived at 42.9 or so net debt, which is precisely two times net debt-to-EBITDA, and then we will see how the company is further developing. I personally would be satisfied if that this, today's dividend level could be stabilized, I think that will be my personal opinion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just wondering first on the U.S., to what degree you feel there's a need to cut price to react to the recent moves by Sprint and the carrying (59.06) momentum of Lita metro and to what degree that would impact your voice ARPUs this year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just wondering to what degree the dividend decision was tied to your expectation of stable other <mark type="inaudible" /> and free cash flow in the current year, was that an important part of the decision to keep the dividend flat and &#x2013; in terms of the '08 dividend paid in '09?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first one. U.S. is &#x2013; the current plan is a churn reduction plan rewarding loyal customers. And so it's not a broad offering. And I also think that T-Mobile U.S. has always had a position of offering a good value for money package and good service and good and differentiated devices. And so there is nothing new. We will position our company in a competitive way, but the current price position is not seen in the light of &#x2013; is not seen as an aggressive overall price cut, it's more a loyalty tool.</p>

          <p>And bear in mind, it's $50 roughly, just on voice only if you would include a normal data package, 25, $30 on top, which is still way above on our average ARPU level. So, it's not meant to be turning down prices at all. Justin, could you remind us on your second question, it's about whether stable EBITDA and free cash flow guidance for '09 would imply stable dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I didn't ask it very well, did I? Obviously, there's been some comments in the German press in the last few weeks from the German government or elements of it that companies should consider cutting dividends, and then they clarified that &#x2013; if those &#x2013; only those in a weak financial position. I was just wondering when you were presenting your proposal to the Supervisory Board, how important it was that you were able to demonstrate stable EBITDA and free cash flow for '09 when arguing for a stable dividend for the current year, i.e., the '08 dividend paid in '09. Was that important or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Justin, I hope you don't expect me to give you detailed reports from Supervisory Board discussions, but I can report to you that our arguments for the dividend were confirmed and were seen also by the Supervisory Board and supported. So that's why Management Board and Supervisory Board came to a common dividend decision to be proposed to the AGM, by the way, which can only decide finally.</p>
          <p>And the criteria for dividends were discussed last year several times and to the strong free cash flow, of course, is always one important criteria for dividends &#x2013; of course not the only one. So I can only confirm we are and we have been committed to an attractive dividend and we've performed, and we've performed in a number of criterias very well and, therefore, everybody agreed that this dividend should be a stable dividend.</p>

          <p>Mr. Graeme Pearson from Nomura, may we have your question please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good afternoon. Have the KPIs in Central and Eastern Europe changed materially so far in Q1? And second, I think you said that MOU per contract customer in Germany grew about 6% in 2008, just wondering if you could give us the number for the fourth quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Graeme, on the first quarter, let's maybe start with the fourth quarter and especially in the mobile businesses in Eastern Europe. I think there is a couple of KPIs in certain of the markets which actually lead to the conclusion that, other than currency impact, we didn't see too much impact on our operationals.</p>
          <p>In PTC for example, the contract churn came even down year-over-year. The number of contract net adds in the fourth quarter were basically flat, minutes of usage even increased and the bad debt level is not existing, it was slightly negative for the first nine months and actually turned now into a surplus position.</p>
          <p>Similar trends that we've seen in Hungary where we have only seen a very minor minutes of use decline of 1.7%, churn rate remained very low and stable at 1.3%. Net add growth of 9.5% and bad debt levels only marginally on a very low level increase.</p>
          <p>So, I think on our major Eastern European market for KPIs actually don't look to us anyhow surprisingly. So, we're still very confident with the KPIs and we haven't seen anything in the meantime which would make us change our view on that.</p>

          <p>Mr. David Strauch [Oddo Securities], your question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I've got questions, please. The first is, so you beat your 2008 guidance, you have increased even your 2009 guidance. Since November, I wanted to know what are the factors that were better than what you were expecting that justifies why now you are more confident with what you can publish in '09?</p>
          <p>And second question is in T-Mobile U.K., so you're still lagging in terms of revenues and EBITDA margin against some very tough, at least against O2. So, I wanted to know if you've plan to address your strategy in terms of pricing or so on in order to get back in terms of ground and revenue growth, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, David, on the guidance, remember what we said back in November. Now, at that time still the 2008 guidance of around 19.3 billion EBITDA and around 6.6 billion free cash flow was valid. We said, on the basis of that we will be at least meeting the achievement of 2008 on the EBITDA side and we will be matching the free cash flow side.</p>
          <p>We came out better than we were expecting in 2008 and we feel confident, despite the currency moves, which by the way have netted each other probably out so far year-to-date. We feel confident about this, yes, slightly increased level, that's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And David if I understood your question correctly, on the U.K., yes, you're right, a couple of KPIs look unfavorable compared to O2 and we're not happy about that obviously. But also, our net add contract we seemed to develop a little bit more momentum now.</p>
          <p>Our ARPU contract to me also looks not so bad. We seem not to have lost as much as some others have. So, not all is black there. And we will have to regain the momentum, which is clear. We focus on value leadership to drive profitable growth in the market with the introduction of our solo, which is SIM-only contract carriers, and Combi, which is traditional minutes and texts but with a value guaranteed plan, into the market late in Q2, resulting in a doubling of contract net adds year-on-year in Q3.</p>
          <p>So, also the exclusive launch of Google in the U.K, we became best 3G network in the U.K. So, that's also not a bad starting position.</p>
          <p>And by the way, the Google device is also seeing good take-up so far. And we're driving &#x2013; we will be driving bold and sustainable cost efficiencies through initiatives like our network consolidation agreement with 3 UK which is now pulling into execution phase.</p>
          <p>And so we expect significant cost savings to come through as well. And we also will improve at the same time the quality of coverage and service to our customers.</p>
          <p>And then I should probably mention sales of data devices, they rose significantly for mobile broadband, actually by 250%. And, we are going to leverage our best network position with a strong POPs and mobile data sales.</p>
          <p>So all together, I don't think our starting position to improve our performance in the U.K. is so bad, because we have something we've never had before, which is a good network. And if you are in mobile, it's actually favorable if you have a good mobile network, because that's the basis for everything else. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for letting me in again. I hope you can hear me now. My question is concerning the strategic shifts you have made in with the German entities. What impact can we expect from these changes on KPIs like your line losses for example? And in general, what do you think Ren&#xE9;, for line losses in the next quarters going forward, will there be a change in the development there?</p>
          <p>And a second brief question, relating to your guidance once again. You still &#x2013; you're not obviously concerned about the currency development in Eastern Europe. But, can you imagine a certain situation where you have to pull the plug and say now with the guidance only valid for the currency exchange rate as they are going forward and they might be adjusted if it gets too dramatic? That's all. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Thomas. In Germany, you are mentioning the most strategic change for this organization since a couple of generation of CEOs. And I am absolutely determined not to fail with this, because I think now it's the time to make it happen.</p>
          <p>Customers &#x2013; more and more customers expect us to treat them from not as a divisional service provider, but in an integrated way. So, they are being recognized as one customer, overall their revenues are being recognized, their different products they are using are recognized and supported and so forth.</p>
          <p>So, customer service should have an impact both in terms of loyalty and in terms of maximizing the customer value for us. However, let's be realistic. This is &#x2013; it's the beginning of a long-term process. We need to reconcile our IT systems. We need to really redefine some of the service processes and we need to make sure that our service support systems are harmonized so we can do all those things which I envision that we can on the long run, but it's a long-term process.</p>
          <p>Product development and network development; if we do it out of one perspective it's going to be more efficient, but also it's going to be more powerful. If &#x2013; for instance, if the mobile network is being planned in conjunction with the fixed-line broadband rollout, and so the fixed-line broadband rollout goes to a certain point where mobile than can compliment it, or the fixed-line network is being build exactly to the needs of the mobile traffic increases and so forth.</p>
          <p>Those kinds of thinks make a lot of sense and we can plan and prioritize our resources better. I cannot quantify it. Honestly, I could try and makeup some long-term kind of bullshit numbers here. I just don't, because I know there are synergies, I just have to do much more work and we have to do much more work in order to be able to quantify them. Give us some time. It's the right direction. We are going to make it happen. We will not fail with this.</p>
          <p>Line losses; in the next quarters, let's see how it goes. I think we might do all right. Because we see a higher degree of loyalty and our service KPIs develop well and customer satisfaction also goes up slightly. So, I am not so skeptical for this year.</p>
          <p>And therefore, overall, I believe we can do it similarly good as we could do this year, last year also in '09.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, Mr. Friedrich, again, what we said before. We showed last year that we can compensate for currency movements. We've always been a manager of fixed currencies within our portfolio. Sometimes they net each other out as so far this year. And therefore we feel good about our guidance of around 19.5 but then it be set round to give us some flexibility even also on the currency side. So if we leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Frank Rothauge. I have two questions actually, good afternoon. First one is on the cost reductions and the charges you have taken. You showed us that you already achieved a cost impact of 4.1 billion, you have taken 1 billion additional charges in Q4. So, don't you think that 4.7 billion is not overly ambitious? And in the past you said several times that cost reduction will be back-end loaded, so would you regard this 4.7 billion not as even conservative as a cost reduction target for the full time until 2010?</p>
          <p>And second question is concerning CapEx, in particular on &#x2013; in the Broadband/Fixed-line area. You recorded a quite high CapEx last year and recently there was a meeting on broadband build out in Germany and the aim is to cover 75% of population with high &#x2013; with fast broadband. What does this mean for CapEx outlook going forward? Should we anticipate significant higher CapEx to sales ratios than in the past for the broadband fixed-line business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, very clear statement right at the beginning. For us it's very, very important that we keep a good track record in delivering a good free cash flow. And therefore, we've set ourselves the objective of doing equally good as we did in '08 and whatever we do is to be seen as second priority, because a strong and quick, consistently strong free cash flow is important for us. So free cash flow, and then within the free cash flow target, we can make investments.</p>
          <p>Second criterion; we have to prioritize our investments obviously. One very important area is the Unites States, where we will build out our network. The other important area is also the mobile Internet in general, in other markets, because as you can see now, the traffic increases, we want to be seen as the best network, and therefore, we want to put our money into where our mouth is in terms of strategy.</p>
          <p>Also broadband in Germany, we may do even a bit more, but it does require some regulatory changes and long-term security for the investment. For instance, if the regulator decides that all those increased efforts are being reflected in the unbundled line prices or that the European or German regulators create a framework for us to be able to negotiate with resellers or with our competitors on commercial terms, long-term arrangements as opposed to every two-years prices being determined by regulators, then we might think of doing more and support the objectives of the government.</p>
          <p>But, it has to be seen before economical conditions. And we will have to amortize and get good returns on our capital. Otherwise of course, we can't do those investments.</p>
          <p>Bottom-line, free cash flow objectives are more important than anything else and we will pursue them with rigor.</p>

          <p>Mr. Tarkan Cinar from WestLB. May we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I have two questions. And the first one is regarding the union of the German fixed network and mobile business. When do you expect this business or this new strategy should be noticeable at the customer side and noticeable at the company side in regarding of revenues, profits or something else? I do not need the exact numbers just the time until it will be noticeable.</p>
          <p>And, the second question is I heard from some companies for example, M-Net, that they awarded a contract to Alcatel-Lucent for a fiber access network in the Munich area. So, are there similar projects with Deutsche Telekom and other network suppliers? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said it earlier on, and I repeat it, noticeable for the customers, you could argue some of these things are noticeable already today. For instance, when you walk into a paypoint in Germany, 800 of them are alive. You see our whole product range, and you see sales people who are trained in both areas. And you'll get, as a customer, you can get benefits if you are customers both on mobile and on fixed. Those things we'll have to continue to build and increase our efforts.</p>
          <p>On the Network side, and on the Product Development side as well on integration of IT systems, that will take a longer period. So, I will not give you any promise. But of course, the objective is to be as fast as possible, and show customer facing results and benefits, because we are not doing it for doing it. We are doing it for making more money with it. And therefore, we are working very hard. I just can't give you a precise date, because it is a long-term process.</p>
          <p>M-Net and others are building and we are talking, and not necessarily now with M-Net but with other companies about partnerships. For instance, with Vodafone or NetCologne, in order to share the burden of network build up for broadband. Again, that is before the background of regulatory assessments, and we would like regulators to support these endeavors and give us the ability to long-term plan and to have security and have the freedom to negotiate those kind of deals, rather than them dictating the conditions, under which we have to do it because, if that's the case, it's much less attractive.</p>
          <p>And therefore as I said, I am appealing to all people who are involved in the political side as well in regulatory side, to finally create an environment which is incentivizing investments, rather than disincentivizing us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a couple of questions on the fixed line business. On the win back campaign there was quite a marked increase in the win back from 154,000 in the first nine months to greater than 500,000 by the end of the year. Are those numbers, both of those numbers comparable? And if so, what were you doing in the fourth quarter and how does that flow through into Q1 and 2 this year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on this process of putting together T-Mobile and T-Home in Germany, presumably you're now going to change the way you produce your numbers to have a German number combined. So, the old financial breakdown is going to change, is it? And you said you don't want to be drawn on any of the synergies et cetera. But, things like the collective labor agreements, do they have to be renegotiated in the two vehicles if they're put together? And are those the sort of processes that need to be done before July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the reporting of course will have to follow the structure, which is following our strategy. And our strategy is connected life and work across networks and different access channels to develop our product and services and our structure is following this. And the reporting is also going to follow this.</p>
          <p>I am just reluctant, at this point in time, to give any number promises, which are in addition to our guidance, because as I said, there's a lot of details to be worked out. I am in this industry since long. I know there are difficulties, but also opportunities with that putting together effort. But it's not the time now to give any specific numbers or any specific dates. We will do a good project work in the next two months and thereafter we might give some more details. But, at least it takes a bit more time before we come back to you.</p>

          <p>And Brian, on the winback campaign, that has been going on now for more than 12 months for 150,000 customers we stated in Q3 are customers who already were with Deutsche Telekom under full contract, whereas the 500,000 customers are registered customers. So, there is not that much of a fixed deviation, it's just how we stated it. So, 500,000 customers registered, not all full yet with Deutsche Telekom but registered as winbacks yet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One first question regarding the pro forma net debt figures you gave us with OTE, it does not include a fund to the present value of the production of the group covenant?

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the second question, we haven't got any formal expectations. What we can say is, what we would expect is the normal slide past decision by the regulator, which has always been followed --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the <mark type="inaudible" /> (1.21.58) not for ULL (21.59).</p>

          <p>For the MTRs. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For ULL I'll tell you that the regulator has a good opportunity now. And I hope that the regulator will use that opportunity to help us and our competitors who are investing to have a better plan, plan ability and long-term security to amortize the investments. And if &#x2013; it's a good objective to cover the country with DSL but it's only going to happen if the preconditions on the commercial side are in place and therefore the regulator has a great opportunity to enable carriers like us to build the network further out with ULL. And so we hope that there is an increase not a decrease. But that's of course not decided yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">

The first 5% of the fee covenant has an option to put it to Deutsche Telecom in the course of this year. This is not yet included because it's not yet sure that they are going to put it.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you very much. Good afternoon and congratulations on these good numbers. Two questions please. Given the strategy that you announced last night and the merging of AT&amp;T fixed and mobile businesses in the States, why should we not worry soon that Deutsche Telekom's mobile-only strategy in the U.S. will become a problem?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, Obermann, given what you said in the Annual Report about the share price and that given also that increasing dividend, so our management buying shares, might not be sort of politically acceptable right now. Should we at least expect some sort of Investor Day soon? And also, do you think that buybacks are more than likely as long as the stock remains at this level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't change my opinion on mobile-only in the U.S. The situation we started off from here in Germany is completely different. And since we have a network and we have all the structures and we have some 10.6 million broadband lines plus all the fixed lines and so forth, there is for us the best option to proceed and to go ahead is really to integrate Mobile and Fixed and treat customers in an integrated way.</p>
          <p>I don't think necessarily you need to own a network, a fixed-line network in order to continue to provide services around connected life and work and mobile Internet services. So, I don't see it as a problem that we are not owning a fixed-line network at all, neither in the U.S. nor in other markets.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to &#x2013; what was the question on buyback of shares? This is the age-old question. We are always positioned and we have always positioned our company like\long-term dividend orientated stock with attractive dividends and we've created the pre-conditions or we've got all the criteria in place that we could pay, could suggest this time again an attractive dividend. And I would not categorically rule out buyback, but I tell you, it's very unlikely at the moment.</p>

          <p>Hi. Could you give us a bit more of a sense of the scale of the data opportunity you see in the Europe mobile market, as and when you have full 3G rollout? I guess what I am trying to do is just balance the slowdown and competition in the market and the anniversary of SunCom to get some idea of the growth potential there going forwards. And secondly could you explain what the connected life and work and new regional approach means for your M&amp;A strategy as and when you have the balance sheet capacity to think about that? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Yes, the opportunity in the U.S., I'll give you two perspectives. One as statically speaking, about the difference between our ARPU in data and the ARPU of our competitors who are advanced with a broadband mobile network and who have already an attractive complete proposition from device through service and that is currently I think, 4 or $5, as of today already.</p>
          <p>So our ARPU is, from data is 9.3 and their's is somewhat, what is it, 13, $14 or so. So that's already a huge difference and this is because we haven't yet had a chance to rollout our 3G network to the same extent as they did.</p>
          <p>But that's again, only the beginning, I mean if you look ahead, think about this, why should an email go to your PC at home, there is just no point and yet only, whatever 2%, 3% of all emails of 80, 90, 100 billion emails a day are mobilized.</p>
          <p>There is a whole lot of applications which make more sense if they are in your pocket when you have them available at hand, whenever you need them. And so that's why I am forecasting a significant continued growth on traffic, on the extra side and also however under proportional, but also increase in revenues.</p>
          <p>And so, mobile Internet has just began, it's very hard to quantify that for the next couple of years, it is going to be the growth driver and the impact of the Internet so far is going to be exceeded by the mobile Internet in the next couple years, I am pretty sure of that.</p>
          <p>So I believe in that and I keep believing in it since years as you know and therefore we will push for us to be more competitive in that category in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And connected life and work is in particular reflected in our product growth net. You see, for instance; sharing of music, cosmetic synchronization of personal information management data and many other applications, which we're going to show at CeBIT in about two weeks, you'll see about 20 new use cases with quite impressive innovation which has been built in our product development and design centers. So just come and see it, you have to see it; it's very difficult to explain on the phone. Thank you. No, it has no impact on our M&amp;A strategy, because I'm not going to comment on it. Sorry for that.</p>
