        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin the presentation of Results for the First Quarter of 2012. And I would just like to again explain the usual procedure for the questions after the presentations. The first questions will be taken from the room, then over the phone, and we'll end up with the calls coming in &#x2013; via e-mail. This is planned to last between 75 minutes and 90 minutes.</p>
          <p>So we can begin, and I'll hand the floor over to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. First of all, I apologize for this change in the venue for the holding of this meeting. We had planned to hold it in London, but as a result of events beyond our control, because of the problems announced in the U.K., we have been forced to bring it here to Madrid. But in any case, thank you for attending. As usual, I have with me Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, the CFO; and Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro, whom you know has recently been appointed Director General for the group. Today's presentation will also follow the usual structure. I will first discuss the main highlights for the quarter. S&#xE1;inz Armada will explain the results and the financial position of the Group. I'll end with a brief summary and then we'll move on to the questions and answers.</p>
          <p>And to begin, during this first quarter the performance of the company has evolved solidly, thanks to the international diversification process we have carried out in recent years. In one of the most difficult years in recent times characterized by the economic crisis and the situation of the power sector in Spain, the company has continued to improve its results and has obtained 4.1% more in EBITDA and 3.1% more in recurring net profits, with a net profit that was over &#x20AC;1 billion for the quarter. This continuous internationalization process carried out by Iberdrola has made it possible for EBITDA as of March 31 to grow in all businesses, thanks to the contribution made by the international activities that have offset the weakness of business in Spain. The operating cash flow has increased by almost 2% to &#x20AC;1,820 million, contributing to strengthen the liquidity position of the Group, which after signing yesterday the credit lines, this now amounts to more than &#x20AC;10 billion, enough to cover the financial needs over the next 30 months. This shows the strong commitment taken on by the company to maintain its financial strength.</p>
          <p>In a complex year and facing difficult market conditions, flexibility and anticipation are our best tools to increase our solid position. And this is highly valued by the international financial institutions, which is facilitating the raising of resources under very favorable conditions. And as I had just said, this gross operating profit has grown in all business groups. EBITDA in the Regulated Business increased 8.9%, thanks mainly to the greater contribution of the integration of Elektro since May 2011, which more than offset the impact of the Royal Decree 13/2012 on the remuneration of the distribution activity in Spain. In Renewables, there's a growth of 2.8% in EBITDA as a result of a greater output. Finally, the Liberalised Business presents an increase of 2.7%, mainly because of the improvement of our activities in the United Kingdom. The contribution to EBITDA to the Group by the international businesses has been decisive, with an increase of 20.4% during the period and again with all businesses growing. I would like to highlight that even if we discount the contribution of Elektro, the EBITDA in the international business continues to grow at 9%. On the other hand, the performance of businesses in Spain has been negative. And in fact, EBITDA generated in this country dropped by 10% during the period.</p>
          <p>In the Regulated Business, there has been a drop of 15%, and I'm talking about Spain because of the impact of these regulatory measures approved by the Spanish Government on March 30. In Renewables, EBITDA is Spain has dropped 10% as a consequence fundamentally of a drop of 9.4% in output due to the lower wind from January to March. However, thanks to the increase of 54% in wind production since the beginning of April, this trend has been turned around and the accumulated growth is currently 7.1%. In other words, in one month we have offset the drop in output in the previous quarter; and in fact we have increased the output. The Liberalised Business has a flat performance with a drop in production of 21.2%, mainly hydro, offset by the positive effect of a Supreme Court ruling, which exempts generating companies from financing certain items and declares Iberdrola's right to the reimbursement of the amounts paid out so far for this concept.</p>
          <p>Regarding the management of the balance sheet, I would like to highlight that one of the main objectives for Iberdrola is to maintain the financial strength and reduce the debt level during this exercise or during this year. And to obtain this, we continue to work to optimize the Group's financial structure. Up to March 21, we had raised over &#x20AC;1.8 billion in the financial markets, including the largest bond exchange operation carried out by a European firm with an issue of &#x20AC;1 billion and with a maturity of 6.5 years and a very competitive cost. And as we planned, we closed the first quarter with a liquidity of &#x20AC;9.7 billion. And as I said yesterday, we signed in London with 22 financial firms a syndicated loan and a credit line amounting to &#x2013; up to &#x20AC;1.2 billion under very favorable terms that significantly improve those obtained recently by other Spanish companies and by the European power sector and with a demand that almost double the size of the operation. We have also reduced leverage from 48.8% at the end of 2011 to 48.5%, including the financing of the tariff deficit. If we exclude it, the leverage ratio would be 46.9%. The operating cash flow has increased by almost 2% during the period. This has enabled Iberdrola to maintain the main financial ratios that the CFO will comment on. And finally, the recurring net profit has increased by 3.1% and net profits, as I said, exceeded &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>And now I will briefly focus on the regulatory situation of the sector in Spain where I think the greatest concern in the markets currently exist. Firstly, I would like to highlight, as I said at the last meeting &#x2013; or as Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro also mentioned, the traditional energy mix in Spain is very competitive. Thanks to this, the prices of electricity in the pool in recent years have been 10% lower than the European average, and I want to repeat this and reiterate it. Also &#x2013; and it was also said then, the distribution activity in Spain receives a remuneration, which before bringing in the recently announced regulatory measures was also 10% lower than the average in the main European countries.</p>
          <p>In spite of this the average tariff that the residential consumer paid in Spain is higher than that European average, as indicated in the National Reform Programme for 2012 recently approved by the government two weeks ago. This is a result: "Fundamentally to the decisions on energy policies approved through the last decade, which have contributed to the fact that close to 50% of the final tariff corresponds to costs that are unrelated to the power supply, and in particular are associated to the development of very costly energy &#x2013; Renewable Energy, mainly solar technologies. And this means that in Spain the cost per megawatt-hour is the highest in Europe according to the European energy regulators." This is what has created the tariff deficit problem in Spain, an inherited problem and the current government has already taken major steps to correct it. In 2012, &#x20AC;3.3 billion was securitized in the tariff deficit. &#x20AC;7 billion are still pending for which there is a transfer commitment and we are requesting the ministry to speed up the securitization. In February, the government approved Royal Decree 1/2012 to provisionally suspend the procedures for the previous signing of the remuneration and the economic incentives for the new renewable and cogeneration facilities. Additionally, in March the government approved an average increase in access tariffs of 6.3%.</p>
          <p>However, we believe that some of the measures are not going in the right direction. In Royal Decree 13/2012, there has been a reduction of more than 12% for the remuneration of an activity that is already efficient and unrelated to the generation deficit, that is the distribution activity, and there's no economic model to justify it. And the methodology to calculate the remuneration for the distribution activity was guaranteed under Royal Decree 222/2008, which established a general framework for the period 2009, 2012. This certain measure modifies remuneration conditions that had already been established until December 31, 2012. And this has caused alarm on the financial markets, and this does not help the value of the companies in the sector, neither do they help the rating of the Kingdom of Spain. However, I am convinced that this measure, which was taken urgently, will be completed with others that will help tackle the current structural deficit problem and restore confidence in our energy model. Measures such as stopping the construction of the most &#x2013; costly renewable facilities including the pre-assigned facilities whose remuneration has grown exponentially in recent years; increasing the cost of the system; remunerating with non-discriminatory criteria for all the Regulated activities to reduce the current disparity; and take measures to provide incentives to energy efficiency and which have disappeared, the so-called progressive tariffs to further liberalize the market; reducing the use of regulated, integrated tariffs; eliminating items from the tariff that should not be paid for only by the consumer; sharing Renewable cost with Other sectors, as they have already done in Italy; and while the problem persists to fund future deficits between all the power agents. In our opinion, the start-up of these measures will bring about predictable and reasonable tariffs.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand the floor over to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada to explain the results in further detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'm going to review the most important aspects of the accounts and the operating evolution by businesses. And I would like to finish with a brief analysis of the group's financial situation. Elektro has made a contribution towards the results of the first quarter without an equivalent contribution in the same period of 2011, because this was consolidated in Iberdrola in May last year. And the two main regulatory impacts included in the accounts of the first quarter are the following; firstly, Royal Decree 13/2012 that has been mentioned by the President which has a negative impact of &#x20AC;58 million as regards the gross margin of the group business in Spain; the lower payments for the Liberalised Business have an additional impact of &#x20AC;4 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the whole, in 2012 the total impact will reach &#x20AC;256 million; &#x20AC;241 million correspond to the low remuneration of the group business and &#x20AC;15 million less, that correspond to a lower guarantee of power. The ruling of the high court relative to the funding of the social bond has a positive impact of &#x20AC;118 million in the first quarter with less levies in the Liberalised Business in Spain. So in 2012, the total impact will reach &#x20AC;170 million. But I have to remind you that Iberdrola has included this effect of the social bond because this is the favorable ruling from the high court to an appeal that was presented by Iberdrola and EDP and therefore it's to be specifically applied to these companies. And the positive net effect before tax both impacts in the accounts of the group in the first quarter is &#x20AC;55.4 million.</p>
          <p>Sales; sales grew 10% and now stand at &#x20AC;9.3 billion and procurements, 14%, and now stand at &#x20AC;5.8 billion. The gross margin has grown 4.1% and now stands at &#x20AC;3.38 billion, including the positive impact of the rate of exchange, &#x20AC;326 million. And those responsible for this growth are the Regulated Business in Brazil, Renewables and the businesses of the U.K. and Mexico. And this has to compensate the weaker behavior of the business in Spain that has shown declines in the gross margin in the Liberalised Business as well as in the Regulated Business because of a lower level of production because of the regulatory impact to the basic margins that includes the allocated. Commission rights has gone up 3.3% and now stands at &#x20AC;3.429 billion.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses have grown 11.8% with the consolidation of Elektro and with some other specific factors that have had a negative impact on the quarter. The evolution of the net operating expenses will slow down until the levels are more in line with the increased or decreased activity. The consolidation of Elektro without an equivalent in the same period has added on another &#x20AC;43 million and a rate of exchange of &#x20AC;7.5 million. Net staff expenses now stand at &#x20AC;450 million, including the consolidation of Elektro and other costs related to restructuring costs and efficiency measures. Net external services have grown 13%, including &#x20AC;20 million that corresponds to Elektro and seasonal effects that are related to storms and additional maintenance work carried out in the United States. So, the net operating expenses of a recurrent nature have grown or would have grown 5.5%.</p>
          <p>As we go up to levies, they've dropped 29% and now stands at &#x20AC;186 million after the impact arising from the ruling of the High Court that I referred to before, although we are still paying higher rates both in Spain and in the United Kingdom. And as was explained by the President, the growth of EBTIDA is based on diversified business model with Renewables and the Regulated Business while providing 64% of total EBITDA. The EBITDA of the Regulated Business that includes Spain, U.K., United States and Brazil has grown 8.9%. It now stands at &#x20AC;1 billion and the consolidation of Elektro compensates the lower contribution of our businesses in Spain and the United States. The EBITDA of the Regulated Business in Spain has dropped 15.1% and now stands at &#x20AC;339 million. And the CapEx of &#x20AC;58.5 million in the remuneration of the business is the main cause for this negative evolution, and reduces the gross margin by 8.7%. And the net operating expenses have grown &#x20AC;12 million because of the greater maintenance costs and other costs related to efficiency measures. In addition, levies have grown 18.5% due to lower &#x2013; or higher local taxes.</p>
          <p>The Regulated Business in the U.K. has reached an EBITDA of &#x20AC;213 million with an increase of 4.8%. That has &#x2013; is linked to high investments. Throughout the fiscal year the gross margin will grow quicker until it reaches something like 4% to 5% in agreement with the higher remuneration base after the investment is made. In addition, control measures for costs have reduced net operating expenses by 13.2%. The Regulated Business of the United States has provided an EBITDA of &#x20AC;213 million according to the IFRS regulation, which represents a drop of 5.1% However, the underlying evolution of the business has been positive as regards the gross margin with a growth of 5.3%, in spite of the adjustments related to the IFRS regulations that are related to the cost of fuel that have penalized the greater revenues after applying the new rates and the positive effect with the rate of exchange, but there are also some time effects and climatological effects that have reduced the revenues reported from first quarter.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses have grown by 29% as a consequence of the rate of exchange, because of the more intense maintenance work carried out after the storms we had in the last quarter of 2011. And we've also carried out some more maintenance work with the good weather in the United States. EBITDA in Brazil has grown 105% and now has reached &#x20AC;288.9 million, with Elektro included in the perimeter of which represents another &#x20AC;120 million more. The 4% growth in electrical demand and positive resettlements and the adjustments of rates payable since April 2011 that we reported in the quarter and the greater unitary margin are the rest of the factors that have proved &#x2013; that have produced this growth. The impact of the rate of exchange is negative.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses have gone up 101.8% and &#x20AC;42 million have to do with the cooperation of Elektro and rest of it have to do with the inflation costs and more activity. And EBITDA is going to grow 20.2%. So in the fiscal year, this growth will slow down because Elektro has &#x2013; was incorporated to the consolidation perimeter in May 2011 and the rates will be updated in August this year.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to the Liberalised Business that includes Spain, U.K. and Mexico, the EBITDA has grown by 2.7% and now stands at &#x20AC;828 million. Spain provides 64% of the EBITDA and the main factor of the growth in this quarter is the U.K. that will provide &#x2013; or is providing 25% of the total EBITDA and has had a significant degree of recovery relative to the previous year. The business in Mexico provides 11%, with a positive impact in the rate of exchange and an underlying evolution of the business that is also positive. Net operating expenses have grown 9.4% and levies show that there's been a strong decrease of 58.7%.</p>
          <p>As regards to the Liberalised Business in Spain, firstly, the introduction of the Ordinary Regime has been reduced by 31% because of the drop of 63% in hydraulic production that had been partially compensated by a 14% increase in nuclear production because we've had the driest winter of the last decade. Electrical demand dropped a little bit, 0.9%, in the quarter. All of this has been partially covered with better prices in &#x2013; well, something like &#x20AC;63, and for 2012 we have 65 terawatt hours sold at a price about &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour. The basic margin has dropped 11.9%, although the strong reduction of the item connected to levies as a consequence of the ruling of the High Court, which is &#x20AC;118 million, compensates this drop in the basic margin. There's also a negative effect of &#x20AC;50 million related to settlements that were included in books in 2011 without equivalents in 2012, which partially compensates this effect of the reduction in levies.</p>
          <p>Finally EBITDA stands at &#x20AC;541 million, showing that there's a stable evolution. And the basic margin of the Liberalised Business in the U.K. reaches &#x20AC;388.7 million, because the margins of the business have recovered from the minimum figures of 2011 because of the improvement in procurement cost, because the contracts &#x2013; the core contracts signed in 2008 at very high prices has come to an end and also because there have been better sales prices. And this improvement fully compensates the decline in gas sales, 80% &#x2013; 8% and electricity 3% in this quarter. Net operating expenses now stand at &#x20AC;148.6 million because of non-recurrent effect, that effect leading to annual comparison. In addition, the expenses of 2012 also include some staff expenses that are non-recurrent. In this matter, the EBITDA of the business has partially recovered and now stands at &#x20AC;212 million. However, this EBITDA figure is still far below the levels prior to 2011 with margins over sales that are lower than the levels that have been taken onboard by Ofcom.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA has grown up to &#x20AC;292 million and the evolution of the business is positive as regards to gross margin with a greater heat rate with more availability and with increases of capability of the plants in spite of some shutdowns. And the expenses related to these shutdowns in France and two maintenance costs have penalized net operating expenses and have slowed down the evolution of the business as far as EBITDA is concerned. And the EBITDA in our Renewables business has grown 2.8% and now stands at &#x20AC;441 million because the good quarter of international business served to compensate the poor quarter in Spain, and as the President pointed out, production dropped 7% because of the adverse weather conditions in the country, which is also in line with what we saw as regards to the Liberalised business.</p>
          <p>On the whole production has grown 13%, thanks to the production figures of the United States, which has 27%; the U.K. 58%; and the rest of the world with 20%, because the best wind conditions and the greater installed capability have made the load factor stand at a figure of 29.6%. The greater weight in the United States means that the average prices have dropped 3.6% to &#x20AC;69 per megawatt hour because those wind farms that are used in France that do not have PTCs are being commissioned. Those &#x2013; because they are lower merchant prices in the United States, and as you know, we have part of the production there. Operating capacity has grown 6.5% and now stands at 13,398 megawatts and installed capacity is something like 14,000 megawatts. Expenses have grown 6.2%, in line with an increase in our operating capacity.</p>
          <p>The U.S. gas business has been transferred to the Liberalised Business in January 2012. So, that means that the EBITDA of the first quarter was &#x20AC;429 million. In other words, this quarter in 2012 has to be compared with the figure that I reported before for the first quarter for 2012, in other words &#x20AC;429 million. And EBITDA grows 1.3% below 4.1% reported at the level of the EBITDA. And this has been due to a 74% increase in provisions, fundamentally linked to the integration of Elektro and some non-recurrent provisions in Brazil that have a total of &#x20AC;23 million. The 7.1% increase in amortizations is due to this integration of Elektro that has been partially compensated by an increase in the life cycle of wind farms.</p>
          <p>The net financial results increased 43% to &#x20AC;324 million, mainly because of the lower market value of the exchange rate hedging linked to our results in foreign currency. Since last year, both the pound and the dollar devalued versus the euro, while this year they have been revalued. Regarding financial expenses, for interest an increase of &#x20AC;34 million due to the higher cost in the debt in real is at Elektro and the higher average debt compared to the first quarter last year. Regarding debt cost, it's 4.5%, a slight increase versus 4.3% in the first quarter of 2011 but a slight improvement regarding the end of 2011. Net recurring profit grew 3.1% to &#x20AC;934 million. However, the reported net profit increased somewhat less, 0.7% to &#x20AC;1.022 billion, mainly due to the lower non-recurring profit. The tax rate improved from 21% to 23% in the same period last year, as a result of additional 1% in the tax rate in the U.K. in 2012.</p>
          <p>Regarding the financing for the group, during the first quarter of 2012 there has been a reduction in the pending tariff deficit of &#x20AC;980 million, down from &#x20AC;2.991 billion at the end of 2011 to &#x20AC;2.011 billion at the end of this first quarter. Iberdrola has collected close to &#x20AC;1 billion through further securitizations, and as the Chairman said, we are now awaiting the funding of the new administrative process for the further &#x20AC;7 billion that have been irrevocably committed for the utility companies. And as the Chairman said, the company has continued with its policy to strengthen the balance sheet in 2012.</p>
          <p>The adjusted net debt is &#x20AC;31.66 billion, slightly below the closing at 2011. And in like-to-like terms, the aim is to close the year at levels below &#x20AC;30 billion. Leverage is 46.9% excluding the deficit, and at 48.5% if we include it. The policy to strengthen the balance sheet and the growth in cash flow generation makes it possible for the company to maintain its strength in financial ratios, both excluding and including the deficit, reaffirming the commitment of the company to optimize the solvency ratio. The ratio FFO over net debt is 19.3% and 20.7% excluding the tariff deficit, and the RCF over net debt ratio is 15.6% and 16.8% excluding the tariff deficit. We expect that by the end of the year, in like-to-like terms, ratios will be over 20% in the case of FFO over net debt and over 16% in regard to RFC over net debt. And we also highlight our excellent liquidity position, as the Chairman said, since at the end of the quarter we had &#x20AC;9.7 billion in liquidity and credit lines available. And yesterday, we signed the extension of credit lines amounting to up to &#x20AC;1.2 billion. So, our liquidity improves even further. Since before 2014 only &#x20AC;1.8 billion would mature, this makes it possible for us to cover over 30 months of funding needs. And as the Chairman also said, we have swapped short-term bonds or long-maturity bonds and it this further improves the debt maturity profile, where in 2012 we only have &#x20AC;1.6 billion and another &#x20AC;2.5 billion in 2013. And we have reduced the maturities in 2013 and 2014. The average debt life increased from 6.2 years to 6.1 years at the end of the first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>And now, the Chairman will draw conclusions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pepe. I think that the results once again indicate Iberdrola's capacity to obtain positive results in a very complex macroeconomic environment. And in spite of the fact that we're still suffering the effects of probably the most or &#x2013; the hardest economic crisis since the second World War, we have improved results in the first quarter of the year, thanks to that internationalization and activity diversification model. As I said earlier, we have increased EBITDA by 4.1% in spite of a 10% drop in the gross operating results in Spain. The three major groups businesses show growing results, with a greater contribution of the Regulated activities. The internationalization process carried out successfully by the company has made it possible for EBITDA generated outside Spain to grow by 20.4% vis-&#xE0;-vis the 10% drop in Spain. And frankly, there are net profits of more than &#x20AC;1 billion with a growth of 3.1% in recurring terms.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow increased 1.9% to over &#x20AC;1.8 billion, contributing to the improvement of the group's financial position, which is a key aspect in Iberdrola's business model. But the sector is currently affected by a large number of external factors mainly. From the global point of view, the growing volatility of the credit markets together with the lowering of the credit ratings of the debt of several countries and an increase of the perception of risk in the sector. Also, the regulatory situation in Spain has strongly penalized the capitalization of utilities in this country. To mitigate the impact of this complex environment, our priority have been to strengthen the company's balance sheet. We therefore ratify our commitment to continue to improve our solvency ratios and our liquidity position by maintaining our capacity to generate cash flow. With this purpose, the financial management strategy for the group will be based on four main pillars; controlling investments, efficiency improvements, liability management and possible divestments.</p>
          <p>Our investments will be given a priority rating, selecting the growth opportunities that are most effective based on predictability and profitability. We'll also maintain our efforts to improve the efficiency in all businesses by looking at the specific aspects in the various geographic areas. Regarding liability management, we'll find a way of funding our needs at the lowest possible cost while strengthening our liquidity position and improving our financial profile. And finally, whenever the market conditions are favorable, we could carry out the divestment of some assets. With this, the aim is to reduce the debt and maintain the remuneration of our shareholders, as reflected in our divided proposal that we will submit for approval at the next shareholders' meeting.</p>
          <p>And finally, I would like to repeat, the major strategy pillars in our model, which have enabled us to multiply EBITDA by four during the last decade; first of all, continuous efficiency improvement; secondly, strengthening the balance sheet; and finally, the business diversification and internationalization. And these will be the basic aspects in our future strategic lines with the objective of maintaining the remuneration of our shareholders which we will present on Investor Day, the date of which will be announced in due course. And once again, you can be assured that all the women and the men that work for this company will continue to do our outmost to continue to improve our results for the benefit of everyone.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and now we'll move on to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Alejandro Vigil from Cygnus Asset Management. I have several questions. The first and the last slide, you were talking about a strategic updating with putting the focus on reducing the debt and maintaining the dividend. I don't know whether you can say something further about the reduction in CapEx improving the return ratios, cost savings, et cetera, or when do you think you will be able to give us more details on these items? And the second is regarding the macro situation in Spain. Can you tell us how you see government measures on a macro level and the impact this is having on Iberdrola? And the third one, on a regulatory level, we've also seen the first regulatory decision in the distribution sector. It has been disappointing. There has been a major cutback. And if &#x2013; is this a sign of more negative measures for the sector or on the other hand, do you think that the government is looking for other kinds of solutions? These are my questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the first point, there's not much else I can say. We're working on it. We're going to hold our Investor Day, and I hope that we will be able to hold that meeting soon. And once we have the new measures that the government may possibly take, so based on that we will hold the Investor Day. We were planning to hold it during May or June, but it will depend on this. And there we will present the details on this, as we've done every year. But I was just trying to get the main focus, and I mentioned investments' predictability, profitability and execution term and also the issues of debt as one of the pillars and remuneration to the shareholder will be another pillar. And we will try to give you the figures on all this and discuss it with you during the Investor Day meeting. And we will announce the date.</p>
          <p>The macro situation in Spain; well, I remember that in 2008 &#x2013; I don't often write for the newspapers and this is one of the times when I wrote an article that was published by Elbais. I think it was the month of October, November 2008 and the title was something like The Return to Real Economy or something like that. And I said that it was urgent for the government to take urgent measures to create a new economic model and forget the bubble we were living in. And I think that this government is taking very urgent measures. Few governments that I can remember in such a short period of time have taken so many structural measures. And I also have to say that measures are being taken but we cannot expect immediate results.</p>
          <p>I remember in 2001 when we presented our first strategic panel &#x2013; 2001 to 2006 there was quite a lot of skepticism because people were asking for immediate results. When we said we were going to double the size of the company, the results, et cetera, et cetera, by 2006, well, there was a lot of skepticism. But facts proved that we reached those goals and exceeded them. And I would say the same thing now. Measures are being taken and when many measures are taken, not all of them provide immediate results. We have to have a little bit of patience. But the worst that can happen is not moving, and making decisions at difficult times is what leads to solutions. So I would suggest you read the article I published in Elbais in 2008 where I advocated many of the measures that are being taken now. And possibly if they'd been taken then, the situation would be less painful than it is now. Jos&#xE9;, would you like to answer the other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's very difficult to talk about what will come because the few meetings we've had with the Ministry have been more of a monologue. They've asked us questions, we've given them our opinion, but we don't know what impact our opinions has had. What is reality? The reality is that there's a structural deficit of &#x20AC;4 billion or &#x20AC;5 billion. The measures that have been taken in this Royal Decree 6/2013, 60% of them are not recurring. And with the new government decision of not taking to the state budget the additional cost of the islands, the year 2013 &#x2013; well, this year already has an additional deficit of over &#x20AC;1.5 billion plus the structural deficit that would be around &#x20AC;4 billion. I think that these are very significant figures that cannot be resolved within the electricity sector and measures will have to be taken outside the electricity sector. That's my opinion. But the companies have given the government solutions to put an end to the deficit. But what the government is going to do, the fact is that nobody knows. Yes, Manuel Palomo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Manuel Palomo from Citigroup. I also had several questions. The first is regarding CapEx. We're talking about CapEx controlling the future and in view of what we've seen in Spanish distribution that may be the line that will be followed. But on the other hand, in the press we've seen the possibility of investing in nuclear power plants in the U.K. And I would like to know what your opinion is on that. And the second question, regards the outlook for the Liberalised Business in Spain; we've seen the first quarter was extremely dry. It has rained a lot in April. It's raining in May due for C&amp;E improvement, or will the possible drop in nuclear power be offset with the increase in hydro and will we remain on a more or less constant level? And finally, a doubt regarding one of the slides you showed, 35, this is for the CFO; talking about on &#x2013; like-to-like basis the net data will be below &#x20AC;30 billion in 2012. Could you give us some details on how many &#x2013; how much is considered in securitizations in that &#x20AC;30 billion or what is that major debt reduction based on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the CapEx, I explained the parameters. The parameters are predictability, return and execution period. There are a number of countries and markets where we have certain frameworks and investment commitments regarding the predictability of the turn, short maturity periods for those investments, and that's where we're going to focus. In the U.K., we have investment commitments in the Regulated Business amounting to over &#x20AC;5 billion for the coming years. Why? because we have predictability there's an agreement with the regulator on the facilities we need to work on and what return that's going to provide. The same in the U.S. we already have commitments with the regulator with agreed returns, both for the construction of the line we're working on for the integration between Canada and Massachusetts in Maine as well as the distribution area. So, those are the priorities. What are not priorities; well, those things that are not clearly predictable regarding the return and those that have a very long maturity.</p>
          <p>And that brings me to the question on the British nuclear issue. There have been some comments in the press recently saying that we were indicated in buying the German project. That has been clearly denied. We haven't even discussed it. We're working on our project, and we're waiting to be given the necessary predictability to say yes or no or go ahead. But in any case the decision won't be taken before 2015. So, we're currently working. Yesterday we were with the Ministry for Energy and Climate Change that &#x2013; opened our offices in London and here again stated that in the next few weeks there will probably be a clearer framework. And based on that clarity we'll make a decision in one direction or the other. But there has been nothing decided right now apart from the work in the studies that are being carried out regarding the Liberalised Business in Spain.</p>
          <p>Paco, can you say something about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in general, the Liberalised Business &#x2013; well, the question was about Spain but I'll also refer a little bit to the U.K. and Mexico that have helped to offset the complicated situation in Spain. Mexico is stable. We've had a couple of atypical breakdowns let's say that are not usual, and we see a stable a development in the business. U.K. is performing very well through improvements in efficiency, especially in retail, as a result of the integration improvements in flexibility in the generation equipment that's making it possible to participate in the complementary market. And this means that the business is doing well and is stable. Perhaps there are some delays in some costs related to efficiency that could make the results at the end of the year not so brilliant as in this quarter. But results are clearly going to improve compared to last year. And in Spain, the key is hydro generation. We've done well this quarter because of the ruling of the Supreme Court that has partially offset the resettlement of &#x20AC;50 million last year, and the next three quarters have to be stable because it's currently not raining. So there's no difference compared to an average year, let's say, and the unknown quantities the last quarter, it's not a good year for Spain &#x2013; it's not a brilliant year for Spain. But we trust that the U.K. can offset it. It's difficult to place bets on the future, but I think our objective will be to maintain or improve on the situation we've seen this quarter, and let's see if the rainfall in the last quarter helps.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've practically sold all the energy for the year at over &#x20AC;60 in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right. I've sold practically all the energy that's being placed at the price of over &#x20AC;60. So there is no risk or unknown quantity regarding the earnings, but as usual there's the issue of being able to improve supply with lower cost energy or having to do it with higher cost energy and therefore reducing the margin. And we also have the potential upsides of the U.K. continuing. And I hope that we'll be able to defend the castle. Basically, the analysis we're performing now has to do with the year. And as you know, this company can raise something like &#x20AC;6 billion in cash flow by covering the same consolidation perimeter, and because of the uncertainties we expect that we're going to have an investment environment that's going to be somewhat lower than what was reported last year. And last year, it was &#x20AC;4 billion or so. So that means that at this point in time, we feel comfortable and we're waiting for the debt reduction to stand below &#x20AC;30 billion. So, that means that a significant chunk of the &#x20AC;7 billion of the tariff deficit will be securitized throughout the year and this is &#x2013; we'll have to cover our own part of that of course. But I think that the situation of the group as regards cash flow generation and investments and so on and so forth is very solid. And we'll see how the debt will be reduced throughout the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I have a couple of questions. And the first one is, could you please update the situation in Brazil, because we've received more news as regards renegotiation in terms of the GM levels? And could you please say something about the tariff revision that you expect for 2012 with the retroactive effects in August 2012, if I'm not mistaken? And then could you give us some information, because in the United States it's being said that the FERC towards the beginning of March has accepted and also said to reduce that you reduce the retribution of transport assets. Do you think that there's a risk for you assets in that country? That's the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Brazil I have lots of new news that I'm about to refresh your memory. We started in Brazil 1997. We've been there for 15 years with the same &#x2013; partnered with the Banco do Brazil and Trevi, and I think that this is a tremendously advantageous association because La Compa&#xF1;ia de Energ&#xED;a is a company that has grown in the field of distribution and generation. And we would be delighted to carry on as we have been until now with our 40% or 39%. If it were to because of the international accounting rules change and what we're consolidating nowadays in a proportional manner mean that with the new regulations, we cannot consolidate this unless we have a majority share. So this is why we've been talking to our partners and we're still talking to them, because we want to establish formulas that allow us to do this. With our partners, we've accepted these terms but they are not getting the approvals that are required from their managers to be able to carry this out. But in view of the time that has elapsed, what we are doing now is looking into three alternatives. There are all kinds of alternatives that will allow us to obtain or to achieve these objectives, and I can say no more about this issue. So in other words, we are starting things. We have been now focused on only one point, but we've opened up to other alternatives. We've opened up the spectrum and &#x2013; without forgetting any previous alternatives. So, I hope that I'll be able to give you some news as soon as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And now, regarding the second question, do you know anything about that or could you say something about that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the tariff revision in Brazil, yes. The revision of Elektro has been carried out and this affects our revenues since August 2011, if I'm not wrong. And in 2012, we have no tariff revision and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:55) will be starting in 2013 or 2014, and I think that the first one is set <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:05). So for the time being, the only tariff revision we've had has to do with Elektro.</p>
          <p>As regards to question on the United States, you know that the North American model &#x2013; it's a very open system and it's a system in which any regulated activity, any of the stakeholders can ask for an opening of the case to analyze the remuneration terms of any of the activities we did till last year, and through that process we improved the terms. So, the stakeholders are the regulator or any other body. So the District Attorney of Massachusetts in something that doesn't really affect them because the remuneration for transportation lines depends on the federal state and they consider that the remuneration program &#x2013; not ours, but that all of the distribution lines have in the State of New England is excessively high. Well, this is not new because this has happened on previous occasions. So, this has opened up a process. Sometimes they accept these procedures and sometimes they don't. If they &#x2013; this is accepted by the court, you can justify why. Those affected justify why not, and there's a debate with the regulator and in the end they draw certain conclusions. And if those conclusions are satisfactory for all the parties involved, everybody is happy, and if they're not satisfactory you resort to the Court of Justice in order to defend your case. And I think that this is a very lengthy issue, and we'll see what the outcome is like.</p>
          <p>It's not the first time that this happened in the United States, and we're rather used to this kind of approach, because when you talk about the retroactivity approaches that don't exist in other countries, well, in the United States there's retroactivity whenever they wanted because you have to justify regulated activity as long as there's a reasonable remuneration. But if it's not reasonable, you review the whole thing in one way or another because we consider that the remuneration we had in the State of New York was not reasonable. We did the re-case, we did the tariff provision and as a consequence of that, they modified the terms, the terms that we have nowadays that we consider to be reasonable. So, that's the usual approach to this subject. So, it's something completely normal in a sector which always guarantees a reasonable retroactivity, in other words it creates value systematically.</p>

          <p>Next question from the room, Virginia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, my name is Virginia Sanz from Deutsche Bank. I have several questions for you. Firstly, I'd like to know what you expect from the gas business in the states that is currently reporting losses. So, do you think that that could be turned around? And another question; what's your exposure emergent in the case of Renewables in the United States? In the U.K., you've said that although the Liberalised Business is now starting to improve, the margins are much lower than what we saw before 2011. So by when do you expect that these margins will go back to the levels expected for this, or is this going to happen in 2013? And then with regards the recent reduction in your rating, is this still a priority for you? Do you want to go to the previous rating, the DA rating, or perhaps that is no longer a priority? And I would like to know if this reduction of the rating, does it have any implications for the cost of debt or do you think that we could carry on along the same path until the end of the year? And not only that, those &#x2013; the final slides that was presented by Mr. Gal&#xE1;n, I know that you're going to present a strategic plan one of these days and in view of what you've said, what I would like to know if these new lines were going to reinforce the balance sheet and perhaps what you were going to do is forget a little bit  about the growth pathway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For gas USA, I've said this a many times before; you know that one of the targets was that when we purchased Scottish Power we have those assets, and at that point in time that company was making lots of money with gas at &#x20AC;8, which was a very reasonable split. Unfortunately, in the United States there is something which is called shale gas and nowadays, gas prices are $2 for 1 million BTUs. So, the margins on $2 are not the same as relative to &#x20AC;8, and that's the problem what's going on in this field. So, what is there to happen? Possibly, but I believe that in the midterm according to what the analysts say, the prices in America will converge in relation to international prices. It didn't seem logical for them to be four times below the levels of the international market. So, they are now liquefying plants to export gas. There are also some commitments on the part of some obviously producers because they need to generate cash very quickly and this will increase the prices. And when the prices increase, margins will behave in the right manner. Then the business will be moving along completely different lines. But you know that the gas business for us is not a strategic business because if at &#x2013; at a given point in time, if we were to be given a good offer, we could get rid of that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have something about 20% in merchant for this year, roughly. That's the figure. Yes, and as regards the U.K., I think that this was mentioned by Paco C&#xF3;rcoles previously, we're still far away from where we were before but we are heading in the right direction. How quickly can this be done? Well, as quickly as we possibly can in a reasonable fashion. Although last year was a horrible year, this year is better. As you know, last year we had the cost effect because of the commitments taken on because of the purchases of coal in previous years and price effect. The cost effect has been reduced whereas &#x2013; well, it's more reduced and the price effect has improved just a little bit. So we're doing as much as we can so that all costs, as you brought it up before &#x2013; so that the operating costs can be managed properly in such a manner that we have a lower cost &#x2013; lower operating cost so that we can improve. I think that this will not happen immediately but it will grow progressively over the months. But we're not going to change from white to black in only few months.</p>
          <p>As regards the rating, would you like to say something? Perhaps you could say something about rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that this company has always maintained a policy aimed at trying to maintain its rating, but when there are external factors they affect you. Well, if you read the report issued by Standard &amp; Poor's, they talk about the Spanish situation and the regulatory issue, and well yes, of course, there are things that are beyond our control and we try to do something about them. But I'm afraid that what we can't do is chase something that is permanently in motion. So what we can do is manage the financial ratios and the balance sheet in the best possible manner, trying to preserve our solidity and our cash generation and the liquidity of the group, which is what we are focusing on, as the President pointed out during his presentation. So for us, rating is a very important thing but above all it's important to maintain the liquidity, solidity and cash generation. As regards the impact of the rating reduction, it's something like &#x20AC;10 million. We have no facilities in this respect. You can't cancel the impact we have some grid well, that depends on the different ratings and the margins we have, A- with the two agencies &#x2013; two rating agencies. So in theory, we have an A- rating, so the impact is limited and I think that the maximum impact would be something like &#x20AC;10 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the last question, I think that we've answered it systematically in the past. So I think there have been two stages in the company, a strong organic growth stage in Spain and Mexico and Brazil basically a second strong growth stage, corporate growth with the acquisitions we made outside Spain, the internationalization, and we're currently going through not a growth process but an organic growth and the development of what we have acquired. So as the same line &#x2013; the line with the objective of looking much closer at strengthening the balance sheet, looking much closer at the financial ratio issue, looking much at the debt issue, and if possible being even stricter in those investments that we have to take on, and as I said earlier, by establishing priorities for those that have the greater security, the highest profitability and the lowest execution period, and leaving aside those that have longer execution periods, less security or less profitability. And this will probably take us to a scheme of investments that will be smaller than in the past, and this year will possibly be an example, and we'll give the priority to those elements. And as the &#x2013; as CFO said regarding the rating, it's not an issue of A, B, C or D. It is the financial solidity that will enable us to keep a comfortable position. If in the country we're in, as occurred with Standard &amp; Poor's, there's a drop in the rating and that drags us down, there's little we can do against that kind of thing. But we can do things to maintain that cash flow over debt ratios, et cetera, on the levels we've mentioned and which we intend to maintain or even improve on. Any more questions from the room? Yes, in the back.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I'm Jos&#xE9; Mart&#xED;n Vivas from Ahorro Corporaci&#xF3;n. I have three questions, please. The first in the Renewables Business, I know that you're going to set up a strategic plan. But could you tell us something about it since the results have been perhaps a bit weaker than we would like and the load factors, probably quite good in fact and the installed capacity has grown considerably; could you tell us something about the prospects for the rest of the year and how you see it?</p>
          <p>And secondly &#x2013; and excuse me for coming back to the regulatory issue, we've been talking about it for many quarters, but do you have any input from the Ministry regarding the timing? Endesa said yesterday that they expected this to happen before summer, and before we were talking about the month of May. So, slowing this down any further is very bad for the sector. And regarding the securitization of the &#x20AC;7 billion, you've already signed the transfer commitment, but do you think that this securitization could be carried out before the measures or is the Ministry putting the brakes on for some reason we don't know? And finally, regarding the business in the U.K., do you have any input on the development of the White Paper and the funding? It seems that there isn't an agreement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll answer the last question which is the easiest. Yesterday, the Minister told me, and in the Queen's speech it was said that before the end of the year the official documents would be ready regarding the energy market reform. And he told me that in the next four weeks the documents and debate will be made public, but it's not the first time that it's been said but I have to tell you, that's the news from yesterday and I can't say anything else. Will you answer the other two, Jos&#xE9; Luis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the regulation timing, well, I agree with what Endesa says. I don't think it can be done in the month of May, and the most optimistic forecast is that it will be done during the month of June whatever measures are going to be taken by the government, but there's no real base for this assumption. And then regarding the securitization issue, well, the fact is that it's been stopped for the last two or three months, and we don't know the real reason for this either. Initially, it was said that there were problems with the CNMV to register the brochure, et cetera, but the CNMV says that there isn't a problem. But anyway I hope it will be re-launched. They'll probably wait to bring out these regulatory measures, and then start to securitize the deficit, but that's just a hypothesis.</p>

          <p>Good morning, yes. I think that there are two things we need to consider to analyze Renewables in the first quarter. First of all, the generation mix in the various territories which, as you've seen, has been much higher in the U.S. and has been lower in Spain. So if we look at each line, the growth in the operating power has been around 6% to 7%; the increase in generation around 13.5%; prices, as was said during the presentation dropped by about 5%. But if we take the mix from the previous quarter that adjustment is just 2% because of the U.S., as explained earlier by the CFO, and that means it would take us to an increase in the gross margin of around 8%. And if we also consider that in those results we have the power issue, and power is the combined cycle facility where we had a contract until June 2011 &#x2013; capacity contracts that disappeared in July and in the third or fourth quarter last year, we saw there was a radical drop. And if we took out power because of the issue of climate and power, the growth in gross margin would have been around 8% too, and it would have taken us to an EBITDA for our Renewables of around 8%. So everything would be in line with the forecast. In the year, the growth should be somewhat higher than this increase that I've just mentioned. Well, without knowing as much as Javier does, I'll say it in just a few words. The wind has been blowing everywhere except in Spain and since there's been less wind blowing in Spain but the price is higher and has been blowing more in the U.S. where the price is lower, well, you can work out the figures. I, myself, get lost. Any more questions from the floor? Well, let's move onto the phone.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Yes, I would just like one clarification regarding one of the objectives finishing the year with less than &#x20AC;30 billion in debt. I would like to know whether in this objective you consider including any sale of assets and whether you could tell us more or less the magnitude of that possible sale of assets or do you think you can achieve it comfortably without selling any assets. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to everyone. I have three questions. The first, on a comment you made regarding the impact of the funding of the social bonus, you said that it would only affect Iberdrola and the EDP because you have appealed and you won the appeal. Endesa is already considerate, for example. I just wanted to understand the legal base for that. And secondly I would like to ask the price in the U.S. in Renewables has dropped 13% in the first quarter; could you break down &#x2013; break it down by PPAs and merchant market? And finally two questions regarding the Shareholders' Meeting. The first is whether you're going to lift the 10% ceiling right to vote and when you're going to announce the dividend? I understand it's going to be flat compared to last year and is it going to be ex-ante in July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding Endesa, I don't know how Endesa does their accounting. You'll have to ask them. I have no idea about the competition, so I can only explain what we do. Regarding the PPAs, well, this is a detailed issue and we can send it to you, answer in writing. And regarding the limitations in voting rights, you know that this is still going through the legal procedure and once that legal procedure ends, based on the results we will take it to the bylaws. And regarding the dividend, it's been announced, yes. It's in the documents for the Shareholders' Meeting. The amount included in the final dividend is given, yes, the same as last year. And we'll probably use the scrip dividend formula, so it would be ex-ante before July.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. I have two questions. The first one whether you have decided to maintain your activities in Elektro and whether you are feeling a deterioration in the environment in Brazil, mainly in generation with the delays at <mark type="ph" /> Bashygasul (01:08:47)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes, Carolina, could you repeat the second question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there has been deterioration in investments in Brazil. The investment at Bellamonte is delayed, also at <mark type="ph" /> Bashygasul (01:09:05) or is generation in Brazil still interesting to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure I understand the question, but again, I repeat, we are studying all alternatives. There is no decision and therefore, when we have all the alternatives and we have a decision, we will explain and we'll say what we'll be doing with A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and all the rest. And currently, there are studies on the alternatives to attain the objectives that we've proposed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was whether there was a deterioration in the investment environment in Brazil because of the delays in the construction projects.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I have no news on that. I think it's quite the opposite. We're used to what in Brazil they call the precautionary measures, it's fairly frequent there. But they stop, they start, they stop, they start again. But I have no news on anything serious and this is something that usually happens in projects of this kind. It's part of the normal process.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Pablo Cuadrado from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning to everyone; just two questions. The first one is whether you can quantify the impact from the fiscal reforms that were approved at the end March in Spain, especially the tax deductions, could you quantify if there's any impact? And a very quick question regarding the tax rate that's dropped to 21%; I think that at the end of the year we should expect something like 23%, 24% from &#x2013; for 2012, so the tax rate then should increase compared to the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you answer the two questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. The impact of the deductions, it isn't very significant. Regarding the increase in tax rates as a result of the government measures, there are some financial impacts but not property impacts, but it doesn't significantly affect the financial profile of the company. We're basically talking about a modification in the payment law which could mean a maximum of &#x20AC;100 million in financing for the year. And there was a permanent elimination of freedom of amortization that can also affect us by several tens of millions. So therefore, we're talking about &#x20AC;150 million to &#x20AC;200 million in financing cost as a result of these changes. And these don't affect property but the financial expenses. And we're paying a forward amount of money that we will recover in the future. So we're talking about &#x20AC;150 million, more or less.</p>
          <p>Regarding the tax rates, one of the main effects, as the CFO said &#x2013; one of the reasons is that we're at a rate of 23-point-something percent is because of the 1% drop in business tax in the U.K. And therefore, by the end of July, there would be an announcement of a further 1% reduction in the rate in the U.K. And therefore, the tax rates could stay at the level we're at now without significant increases during the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to clarify something as regards the social bond, and I want to ask you how did you put this in the books from the regulatory perspective and if there's any risk in spite of the ruling from the High Court that it not be recognized during this year or perhaps there would be some delay in that respect? You're talking about the rulings that are not being executed. Well, that's a big concern for me. Well, obviously, this is an issue that's going to be done. Could you please tell us how that is going to be included in the books, in the accounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that he was referring to how this affects the regulatory deficit, but we were paying this &#x2013; we were &#x2013; the generators were paying for the social bonus, possibly &#x2013; and the generators would no longer pay it because of the ruling, and that means that there will be a greater tariff deficit as regards Iberdrola. What we have is the right to recover those payments that have already been made because of this concept of the social bonus from previous years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have a couple of questions that are related to Brazil. Elektro has had a 30% growth with a very good progression in demand, but if I've understood you there have been resettlements. But I would like to know about the recurrent evolution of the ex-Elektro activities, and as we have seen they've gone pretty wrong. And then the other question connected to Brazil; do you think that &#x2013; with these adjustments in profitability in terms of distribution, do you think that little by little generation is becoming more attractive vis-&#xE0;-vis distribution as regard future investments in the country? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in generation we started a long time ago, far before all of this, and I'm talking about hydroelectric generation. We started off with the generation of combined cycles in 2003 to 2008 and then electricity and wind power now. So it's an issue that has been ongoing and we are dealing with reasonable terms and of course, well, the interest rates have also reduced &#x2013; been reduced substantially in Brazil. So there is a cost effect and there's revenue effect, which is the normal adjustment that is made everywhere when the financial costs in such intensive businesses like these in capital occur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to adjustments, do you know anything about adjustments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, that's a non-recurrent effect because &#x2013; well, due to a number of issues, there have been some bad debts that have cropped up and adjustments were made. So it's a non-recurrent impact, and we're talking about &#x20AC;20 million, as I've said before. Yes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:15:57), yes, and that has already been solved and corrected.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Javier Suarez from Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Thank you for answering my questions. I have two questions, as regards to slide number 41, where you showed a number of objectives or guidelines for your strategy. You're talking about the retraction of CapEx but the question is last year CapEx was something like &#x20AC;4 billion but what is your opinion in numerical terms &#x2013; up to what extent is the company capable of reducing CapEx in 2012 or 2013 quickly, if necessary? And the second question has to do with your decision to maintain the dividend policy. So I suppose that you get to carry on with the payment of scrip dividends? And the third question has to do with details on page 30 of the presentation. You said that there's been an increase in provisions that is pretty strong, and fundamentally I think that it's because of Brazil. Perhaps you explained this before; before I had problems with the telephone lines, but perhaps you could give us some details on these additional provisions. I'd be very grateful to you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as regards investments, excuse me, but we're going to hold a meeting in a few weeks during the Investor Day. And which of the investments are we going to prioritize? Well, we'll give priority to those investments that have been committed that have a shorter execution period, higher profitability and a higher level of predictability. And we'll not focus on those that have longer term or are not predictable and do not have a security in terms of returns. We have reduced investments over the years. And which of them will remain; right now we've committed investments in the U.K. that are predictable. Those are in distribution until 2015 and transportation until 2021 or 2022, in other words the next 10 years or so. We also have those in the United States committed until 2015 in transportation and distribution. And the rest of them we have committed but we have some investments that have to be made in terms of maintenance in order to maintain our services properly. And the rest of them are investments that have to be maintained for the power stations. But there are no other investments that have to be made that are mandatory. So, we revise each and every one of them as a function of the criteria I've pointed out.</p>
          <p>How much is this going to be; well, the company has generated &#x20AC;6 billion in cash flow for the year. So with &#x20AC;6 billion in cash flow per year and with these investments, sorry, we are in a very comfortable situation. The dividends policy, scrip or non-scrip, I don't know mostly in each case. We want to maintain the remuneration of the shareholder but in the most convenient fashion. We believe that this system has been until now a very attractive system for investments, and a very large number of them without a scrip because of the tax benefit, but in the future we'll see what happens. Although, what we want to do is maintain things that we have been working in recent years as regards the payments made to the shareholders. Yes, the increase in provisions is because of this issue connected to Brazil, which has to do with the non-recurrent bad debt issue that has been cleaned up and that's it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have two people with their questions from the Web. The first question has to do with the CapEx of 2012 which I think has already been clarified. And the second one is, you do you expect for the EBITDA in the U.K. in 2012? And thirdly, what do we think about the inclusion of Spanish demand, and when do we expect changes in this demand? And Philippe Ourpatian says, can we confirm the net recurrent profits from 2012, bearing in mind the current macroeconomic situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that the evolution of Spanish demand, that has already been covered. But in any case, Spanish demand in the first months of this year has been pretty resistant and in fact this is one of the markets which I think is roughly slump or the decline relative to now I see as 0.6; in the U.K. it's greater; in the United States it's also higher than in Spain because of the weather conditions. But what's going to happen from now until the end of the year? Well, that will depend on weather and on how things evolve. But I have to say that the behavior has been reasonably good in the first months of the year with relatively small declines. And in some of the sectors, we can see that there has been a stabilization; for instance, in the service sector that had a significant slump last year is becoming linear; and the industrial sectors, in some geographic areas there have been increases however in terms of domestic demand, and as a function of the weather, well, it's dropping more in some areas than others. But we're talking about 0.6 on average, which I think that considering the current recession is a pretty reasonable indicator. And the other one, Ignacio, was what? This was the guidance figures for the net recurrent profits in 2012. Well, in principle, this is something that, yes, we will maintain these guidelines we've been mentioning until now. Well, there are no more questions then.</p>
