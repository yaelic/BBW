          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Statoil's First Quarter Earnings Presentation and Conference Call. My name is Hilde Nafstad. I'm the Head of Investor Relations in Statoil.</p>
          <p>Before we start, let me say that there are no fire drills planned for today, so in case the fire alarm goes off, you will need to exit through the two doors in the back of each side of the room and continue on towards the same side.</p>
          <p>This morning at 7.30 Central European Time, we announced the results for the first quarter of 2011. The press release regarding the results was distributed through the wires and through Oslo Stock Exchange. The quarterly report and today's presentation can, as usual, be downloaded from our website, statoil.com. There is a link directly to the presentation on the front page of statoil.com.</p>
          <p>I'll ask you to kindly take special note of the information regarding forward-looking statements which can be found on the last page of the presentation set. Please note that questions can be post by means of a telephone. Questions cannot be post directly from the web.</p>
          <p>The dial-in numbers for posting questions can be found on the website. The operator of the conference call will explain the procedure for posting questions over the phone immediately before the Q&amp;A session starts.</p>
          <p>It is now my privilege to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Torgrim Reitan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hilde, and good afternoon everyone. It is a pleasure for me to present the results for the first quarter 2011, a quarter with very good progress within key areas. The production has developed as we planned and it is satisfactory in the first quarter. It is in line with my expectations so far. We have had significant progress when it comes to fitting a new production capacity on-stream, or demonstration plans at Leismer in Canada, and the field development Peregrino in Brazil, are both on-stream currently. Both of these are examples of large developments that are not put into production, and these fields they are in ramp-up phase, and are both long lived assets. And they will contribute with more than 70,000 barrels a day in new capacity to Statoil.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we have now closed the sales process of selling 40% of both of these assets, which we used to own a 100%. And those transactions, those are generating proceeds of more than NOK 30 billion, and accounting gains of more than NOK 14 billion. You should please note that it is only the oil sand transaction that is part of the first quarter results, the Peregrino transaction that was closed in April and that belongs to the next quarter.</p>
          <p>So through these transactions, we have demonstrated how we create value. We have applied our North Sea experience and competence to large and complex developments and we have demonstrated value creation through the portfolio authorization. Furthermore we have sanctioned new projects in Norway, in Canada and in Algeria. Vigdis North and Katla in Norway, those are both part of the fast track portfolio of projects. Hibernia in Canada and the In Salah Southern Field in Algeria.</p>
          <p>In February, I told you that we sanctioned 20 projects in 2010 and that we plan to sanction 40 more projects in 2011 and 2012. And this is still valid and it is good to see that we progress as planned when it comes to project development. Furthermore, we've had significant success with this Skrugard discovery in the Barents Sea. And this represent a significant progress in the region and it is strengthening our belief in the potential in the Arctic areas.</p>
          <p>And we are also very satisfied with the awards in the 21st licensing round on the Norwegian continental shelf, where we secured new acreage in the Barents Sea close to the Skrugard discovery. And in addition, we had acreage in an interesting part of the Norwegian Sea actually very close to the Luva discovery.</p>
          <p>We have also made discovery in Brazil that is close to the Peregrino field and it's firming up volumes for further development in this area. And in that area all campaign will continue with further drilling activity. We have also got drilling permits in Gulf of Mexico and we are actually the only company that currently holds two drilling permits after the moratorium and I expect that we'll resume our drilling activity soon in that area.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I'm satisfied that we have accessed new exploration acreage as well in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, excuse me in deepwater in Angola, the pre-salt Angola and in Kazakhstan through the Heads of Agreement on the Abay block in the Caspian Sea.</p>
          <p>So, overall, I'm very satisfied with the strategic progress during the quarter. Then over to the production, our production this quarter is satisfactory. It is in line with my expectations. However, it is not more than we need to be in line with what we have guided at. The reason for equity production being 6% below first quarter were discussed in February at our capital market update.</p>
          <p>And first of all, Gullfaks is currently not producing at full capacity. And this will have an annual or yearly impact of around 30,000 barrels per day. The production at Gullfaks is stabilized and we have not had negative surprises from the field and its reservoirs. But it is still too early to conclude on when we will increase the production from the Gullfaks field.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased to see that we are brining new fields on stream in line with what I have told you and started and the initial production from Leismer and Peregrino have been in accordance with what I expected. But I'll remind you that they will gradually be building up production and you should not expect to see significant production contributions before we get closer to the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Gas production this quarter has been strong. It has been in line with normal seasonal patterns although somewhat lower than first quarter 2010. The winter months will normally have significantly higher gas production than the summer months and this year it will be no exception.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have reduced production permits related to the fields Ormen Lange and Troll. Both of those heals produced well during the first quarter and they reduce permits. They will mostly have an impact in the second and third quarter this year.</p>
          <p>All right, than over to the earnings, this quarter we have delivered operating results, the third largest operating result in statoil's history. The quarter have been characterized by high oil and gas prices and the net operating income came in at NOK50.7 million and this is an increase of 28% compared to first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>And as usual, we are just for certainly items in the accounts to make the quarters comparable from an operational point of view. And the 3.4 billion of adjustments in this quarter are mainly related to the partly divestments of our oil sands position where we've booked a gain of more than NOK 5.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Furthermore we reversed impairments related to re-gas facility at Cove Point in the U.S. that amounted to NOK 1.6 billion. This was partly offset by an underlift situation in the quarter and by change in fair value of inventories. As such we delivered adjusted earnings of NOK 47.3 billion and that is an increase of 22% compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Liquid prices increased by 33% and gas prices increased by 20% and that impacted the accounts with NOK 17 billion in the quarter. Our production was as expected lower this quarter and that contributed negatively with NOK 5 billion compared to third quarter last year.</p>
          <p>We are stepping up exploration and our exploration costs increased by NOK 0.6 billion in first quarter compared to last year and that is mainly related to increased drilling and increased field development costs in the early phase. Lastly, we see a slight increase in operating expenses and DD&amp;A and that is due to more fields coming on-stream and increase estimates related to abandonment costs.</p>
          <p>So the adjusted earnings after tax decreased by 2% and that is due to a high tax rate on adjusted earnings. This is largely caused by a higher income from the Norwegian upstream activities and consequently higher taxes and higher tax rates on our international activity. Now we come back to tax in more detail in a few minutes, then some details on the various segments.</p>
          <p>After the reorganization of Statoil, we have made some changes to the segments reporting. We do now report on three operating segments in addition to Statoil Fuel &amp; Retail. Development and production Norway delivered adjusted earnings before tax of NOK 39.4 billion that is 35% increase compared to last year.</p>
          <p>The increase was mainly due to 33% higher oil prices in krone and 38% higher transfer price of gas between MPR and DPM. And increased prices contributed with NOK14 billion in higher revenues compare to last year. This is partly offset by lower year-on-year production of oil and gas and that contributed negatively with NOK3.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Furthermore in that segment, DD&amp;A increased by NOK1 billion due to new fields coming on stream and as I've stated removable and abundantly cost experience which we have mentioned earlier. Development and Production international. That believe it an adjusted earnings of NOK5.2 billion and that is a 16% increase year-on-year. The increase was mainly due to 33% higher oil prices in Krona and that contributed the NOK3 billion in increased revenues. This was partly offset by lower equity production due to suspension of production in Libya and lower gas raminsations of partner operated fields internationally.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have higher exploration expenses and that was mainly related to expenses expensing of the key level in Egypt. Marketing, Processing &amp; Renewable MPR as you now call it, they delivered and adjusted earnings of 2.7 billion and that is a 47% decrease compared to first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>That decrease that was mainly due to that the transfer price between, MPR and the Norwegian offshore area, increased by 38%, while the realized gas price increased less with 20%. Furthermore the contribution from the marketing and trading activities was less in the quarter due to lower margins from a short term sales. Also the ownership share in Gassled is reduced from 33.1% to 28.5%. That was valid from 1st of January. And this is in accordance with the ownership agreement that took in place when Gassled was established 10 years ago. And lastly within that segment there has been loss in the crude processing trading and marketing due to weak trading results from trading gas liquids and from lower refining margins.</p>
          <p>Okay, then over to tax. The tax rate on reported results was 68% both the gain on the oil sand transaction in Canada and the reversal of impairments at core points had very low tax rate. And this is the main explanations for the difference between tax on reported results and adjusted earnings. The tax rate on adjusted earnings also deserves attention this quarter, both because the total tax rate was higher than previously guided but also because the tax rate in the segments deferred from what are normally expected to see.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the higher share of the earnings derived from the recent Continental shelves, but if our tax rate is high, and these pulls the average tax rate cut. Secondly, the tax rate for Development &amp; Production Norway is high due to relatively lower effect of the uplift in an environment with high oil prices. We have when we invest in Norway, we can from a tax point of view depreciate status with 30% in addition to the full investments and that can be done over six years. And the impact of that additional tax value on the margin is less when the oil price is high, the impact of that is less in the totality when the oil prices is high. So that is part of the explanation.</p>
          <p>And you should expect to see our tax rates on Development &amp; Production Norway, close to 74% going forward, if the current price environment persists. The tax rate within Development &amp; Production International is impacted by the dry exploration well in Egypt. In Egypt, we have no tax shield. We have also had one-off tax adjustments in the international business. And in addition, a related high share of income this quarter comes from Angola, from Algeria and from Nigeria. In these countries, the tax rate is rather high and around 50%.</p>
          <p>We have previously guided on the tax rate internationally around 40% to 45%. However, in the short term, you should expect a somewhat higher tax rate within this segment and I expect to see it to be around 50% to 55% for the time being. In a couple of years, when production from Brazil and North America steps up, I expect the tax level to be reduced. Within the MPR segment, the tax rate is a consequence of the earnings compositions within the segment and the contribution this quarter is mainly from the natural gas area where the tax rate is relatively high. And I expect going forward to see a combined MPR tax rate around 70%. But you should expect the tax rate within this segment to have some volatility, I mean based on the composition of the earnings which will vary from quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>Our guidance on the adjusted tax rate on the corporate level has not changed and it remains in the range 70% to 72%. The change in the short-term outlook for tax rate internationally implies that I expect the tax rate towards the up end of the range for the rest of 2011.</p>
          <p>Then moving to the cash flow, we had a very strong cash generation in the first quarter, driven by high oil and gas prices, good production as well as proceeds from sale of assets. The cash flow from our underlying activity amounted to NOK 57 billion in the quarter. We paid NOK 16 billion in tax that was in February. And the cash flow used in investing activities amounted to a gross investment of NOK 19 billion. However, the net investments ended at NOK 8.7 billion. That is due to that we adjust from the proceeds from the sales of assets, and that is related mainly to the sale of the stake in the oil sands, Canadian oil sands business.</p>
          <p>As a comparison, in the first quarter last year, the net investment was NOK 19 billion. So, the underlying cash generation for the quarter after investment and taxes was as such NOK 32 billion before all the financing activities. For the next quarter, we will have two tax payments, each of approximately NOK 14 billion. In June, we will pay approximately NOK 20 billion in dividends. However, the proceeds from the Peregrino transaction is received and safely in our accounts, but they will be part of the next quarter's cash flow. So, you should expect a quarter with large payment in and out.</p>
          <p>Then to the balance sheet. The balance sheet continues to be strong and the net debt-to capital employed is 19% end of quarter and that is a reduction from 25% at year-end. Then over to forward-looking statements and guidance. As I said, at the start of my presentation, our first quarter production was in line with my expectation and in line with what we need to meet our guidance but not more than that.</p>
          <p>Our view for the rest of the year has not changed and our production guiding therefore remains. For 2011 we expect that to be around 2010 level or slightly below. And I will use the opportunity to remind you on what I said in February. When comparing 2011 with 2010 production, the risk is more on the down side than on the upside. And this is still valid. There is uncertainty related to the new fields ramping up and we have extensive maintenance program and there will be gas off take on certain days.</p>
          <p>And please note, for the next few quarters, seasonal gas up tick and maintenance will leave us with a substantially lower production level than in first quarter. The winter months will normally have significantly higher gas production than the summer months and this year will be no exception. In fact, the reduced permits of Troll, Ormen Lange will mostly effect the production in the second and third quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Then maintenance, you might remember that last year was impacted by heavy maintenance for gas facilities in this third quarter. This year as well, we will have maintenance that affects both liquids and gas production. And now we expect a maintenance impact of approximately 100,000 barrels per day in the second quarter, around 70% of this will be related to liquids. I also expect that the total maintenance impact to be around 50,000 barrels per day over the year and this is also mainly related to the liquids production.</p>
          <p>Important things to note is that this year the maintenance will be more evenly spread over the next two quarters than last year. And my last point on the next two quarter is related to the Norwegian continental shelf. You can expect the production from the Norwegian continental shelf for second and third quarter in 2011 to be somewhat lower than the total production from the Norwegian continental shelf in the same quarter in 2010. But the NCS production will be more evenly distributed between the quarters this summer.</p>
          <p>With regard to exploration activity and organic investments, we maintain the guidance for 2011. So that concludes my presentation and thank you very much for you attention and then I will give the floor to you, Hilde, who will lead us through the Q&amp;A session. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Oswald Clint here at Sanford Bernstein. I'll just try two quick ones please Torgrim. Firstly, just on upstream OpEx on a unit basis does seem to be up quite substantially, even though you said, there was a slight increase in operating cost, looks to be up 9%, 10%. I wonder, if you could just talk about that, what could be the major drivers of that and that on a year-over-year basis? And second question, just curious on the reversal on the Cove Point regasification terminal, almost 12 months after you actually wrote that down, in terms of why you're riding back half of that provision from last year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. When it comes to unit production costs, there is an increase year-over-year on that one. It is mainly related to &#x2013; cost related to start up of productions. And we're in a period now where we are preparing for lot of start ups and the start ups are coming later. And one example of that is the Peregrino field that started in April where we had significant cost in the quarter related to that field to get it on stream. So that is the major part of that explanation.</p>
          <p>When going forward, we don't give a specific target on the unit production costs. We see that it is slightly increasing; it is slightly increasing as we go. Not much more than by inflation actually, so it is in that range. What we aim at is to maintain our competitive position when it comes to unit production cost. We're among the better companies on benchmarks, and we aim to maintain that competitive positions. Specifically, I would like to mention the Norwegian Continental shelf where we have field in lot of different phases. We have some fields that are on decline and have very unit production cost. We have should expect with close to 100 NOK per barrel. And we have new fields with significant in oil. And we see that in new field actually compensate well for the more old field when it comes to unit production cost all in the regional continental self level. But you should expect this parameter to increase slightly as the years goes by.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Cove Point and Cove Point expansion, we did quite some impairments adjustments last year. What has happened over the last year is that we renegotiated the capacity related to Cove Point expansion. So that's lost an explanation of the reversal that we did in &#x2013; that was in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Cove Point and Cove Point expansion is looked upon as one common asset from the accompanying point of view. And related to this, with volumes, we see increased value of vertical cargos away from the U.S. or this with cargo almost going to that terminal.</p>
          <p>They are going all the places at significantly higher prices. So the value of that value chain is higher, when spread is higher. So that is the main explanation for the reversal of that line.</p>
          <p>So the value of our LNG value chain is final and we expected it to be last quarter</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let's move with the next question now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Hootan Yazharifrom Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. A couple of questions, your gearing has obviously fallen quite dramatically post the booking of the Canadian asset sale and you're looking to book Peregrino in the second quarter. So again you should see another substantial drop-off in gearing. Can you just give us some color around how management is now considering the gearing level; are you looking towards acquisitions or shareholder distribution to address what is a very lowly geared balance sheet? And also just coming back to the cost side, are you now in a period where you feel that all the cost reductions that you were aiming for in your previous targets have been achieved or do you believe that costs can remain under control and you continue to cut costs and implement initiatives or should we continue to expect costs just to grow in line with inflation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks. First gearing, it is a comfortable situation when it comes to the balance sheet and as a CFO, it is sort of a good taste to be whoever, I am &#x2013; of course, this is a situation that we monitor closely. The best proposition I can give it to you as investors is quite easy. It is actually to realize a great project portfolio that we have in hand. We have more than 100 projects in the pipelines. We are going to sanction 40 more over the next two years. And we have a lot of things to do in the portfolio. And those projects actually compete very well in the industry when it comes to breakeven price. An average breakeven price is around $50 per barrel. So that is to me the best value proportion, I can give and the best way that I can use &#x2013; we can use the money.</p>
          <p>But as we said, we have an investment program which is at $16 billion this year. And with the current price environment that is our gearing is expected to be decreased if that persists.</p>
          <p>And on your specific comments on M&amp;A, I will of course &#x2013; I appreciate the question but I will of course not answer that question. What I can say is that our radar screen is large. It has always been &#x2013; we have been quite actively in the acquisition and divestment market over the last four to five years. So you should expect there to be activity on that going forward as well.</p>
          <p>When it comes to capital distribution, we have suggested to the Annual General Meeting dividend of NOK 6.25 and that will be paid in June, early June and we are also asking in the Annual General Meeting for a mandate for share buyback. Please remember that is something that we have done for many years. So that is just to have a tool box available as we always wanted to be fully loaded. So that is the guidance I would like to give along that one.</p>
          <p>When it comes to costs and cost reduction, we took out significant synergies after the merger that is more or less delivered. We of course benchmark ourselves heavily towards other companies and all the peers when it comes to cost competitiveness, also beyond the unit production costs. We see that we compete well. We compete well across most perspectives. But when that said, we can always be better at costs and that has still a significant focus in the company.</p>
          <p>So the initiatives that was implemented after the merger that has been delivered on. We are working constantly on further reductions. And for instance, during the financial crisis, we said, okay, we will have to do quite a bit, and we did, and few examples we reduced travel costs by, I think it was 27% in the company over a year, just one small example. And that goes along a lot of categories. But we are working seriously on the further cost improvements going forward. I think that is, that is important.</p>

          <p>Teodor Nilsen from First Securities. I've two questions. The first one is related to the MPR division where you reported pretty weak results compared to consensus estimates, at least and let's say that's due to difficult trading market in low natural gas margins. So my question is, how is outlook for this division. Second question is related to the Peregrino South discovery that announced for 10th of April is this a potential tie-in to candidate to the current installation, what is the volume potential of this discover. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. MPR results and question what we expect going forward? There are some stable &#x2013; stable elements of that results. It the results from the Gossland and transport and processing part, that will typically be a stable part of the results. The refining business will fluctuate with refining margins from quarter-to -quarter and then it comes to the more commercial units. And they will typically also fluctuate, they're dependant on the market opportunities as they arise. So it is hard to give a guidance on the level, you should expect it to fluctuate.</p>
          <p>I would say that last quarter is sort of not very good results from the trading activities, but it is expected to fluctuate. Just to give some flavors on the main drivers of the natural gas trading results, the prices on the national balancing point was increasing quite rapidly through the quarter. We have always a lot of gas at hand that we need to sell and we cannot sell it on the day ahead basis, so one, so we need to be in front of the market. So we sell gas before we actually get to the day, when we have to deliberate. So that is &#x2013; so there is lagging effect in the results on the gas, while internal price between the upstream business is and other software prices in the market in the period so that explains part of &#x2013; part of it.</p>
          <p>On the oil side, it was especially rig to almost the progress as strategy which was very profitable last year. And this quarter it has impacted negatively on that strategy. But that strategy in whole is providing value. So that just exemplifies that's the results will fluctuates dependent on the market circumstances.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Peregrino itself, I am enthusiastic about it. We reached 130 meter column of hydrocarbons. We have most stated volumes related to it. And so I am not prepared to do that currently but it proves that the area where we have Peregrino is an exciting one. It has potential beyond the Peregrino field and it's as you know forming up volumes that we expect someday we'll it be produced.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. It's Barry MacCarthy from Royal Bank of Scotland here. Thank you for the presentation. I have a question on slide seven on the cash flow. You showed that cash flow from underlying operations of NOK 57 billion taxes paid take NOK 16 billion of that, can you help me reconcile that please with the stated cash flows provided by operating activities on page 32 of the release which are NOK 30 billion for the quarter and some large moving items in working capital section and the largest &#x2013; among the largest the increase in the current financial investment. If you could help me understand that would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. I'll leave the word to <mark type="ph" /> Coetta Thompson (43:22) to answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you refer to page 32 of the financial review which starts with the NOK 50.3 cash flow from operating activities and what we have done is adjusted for the next part which is call adjustment to reconcile to net income to cash flow provided by operating activities, depreciation, the exploration and the FX and the sale of assets and that fall together next NOK 6.4 billion, that takes the NOK 6.4 billion and the NOK 40.23 billion up to NOK 56.7 billion. When you ask about the cash flow from operation, I also want to emphasize that for accounting purposes the changes to financial investment and derivatives is an operation part of the cash flow, but it's really, for us, part of the liquidity. What's placed in the market between over and above the months is not cash and cash equivalent any more. It's on the operation, so the build up &#x2013; the change there of 13.2 billion is not really from a commercial point operation. It's the financial deposits, which we make in the market three to 12 months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's Michael Alsford from Citi. I've got two questions please. Just firstly on natural gas market in Europe, could you maybe give the color as to what you're seeing currently from your all sort of gas buyers, and whether you are seeing sort of an increase of take from your long-term contracts currently given we're seeing obviously higher spot prices at the moment and the fact that maybe they see the incentive to take volumes under their long-term contracts currently, because you seem to be talking down a little bit production for second and third quarter.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just from Gassled, you highlight, you might potentially sell your equity stake in Gassled. Could you maybe give a bit more color as to, are you looking to completely divest of your stake in Gassled or are you looking to take a partial sale and maybe a little bit on the timing as to when we might see you looking to divest that stake? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. First on the outlook on European gas market. It has been a market where the quite a bit of turbulence over the last few years and in my previous job, I headed up the trading activities within natural gas. So, from 2009 and onwards, we would actually surprised by two things. One was the strength of recovering and the non-recovery especially in Germany. And the second one was the increased demand for gas towards Asia.</p>
          <p>So that surprised on the upside so the markets firmed up quite rapidly. And I would say actually both of those two points are still valid going forward. So the prices currently, they are quite healthy. If you look at the spot prices in a historic context, it's around 2006/07 levels I think which is sort of good.</p>
          <p>And natural gas compete currently is very well with alternative sources of energy. We see that both the case that German nuclear capacity is down and also the tragic situation in Japan after the tsunami and earthquake has actually firmed up this further. So we see European gas market where gas is attractively priced compared to alternatives and where this it is robust prices as we see it. I won't speculate into further development but it's an okay market to operate in.</p>
          <p>And if you consider our position in this, you know you should remember that Norwegian gas has to travel one-fifth of Algerian gas, one-ten of Russian gas and also one tenth -- one eight of Russian gas and one tenth of Qatari gases. We have low unit cost for our gas and we have access to all the landing points. So we consider ourselves to be very well positioned for what's to come in that market.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Gassled and sales process, you are right we are evaluating the asset and evaluating whether that has more value for others than for us. So we are thinking about it. I will not go into any specifics on the timing of it. But you are right, we are thinking about that asset.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Brendan Warn from Jefferies, Just one quick question Torgrim. Just as a and more of an over the horizon indicator of cost and a reflection of your cost reduction, just can you make comment on the trend of the total recordable and lost time injury frequency. It looks to be heading or trending back up to where you were at 2006, 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on &#x2013; that was lost time frequency. So a day, I mean if you looked at &#x2013; if you look at safety KPIs in general, it is a positive trend over the years. The serious incident frequency, which is the &#x2013; one that we consider as the most important one. We have reduced that significantly over the years. I think it was around six in 2006, in 2010, it was 1.4 as far as I recall and this quarter it is 1.2, so that is progressing well.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the other ones, I'm not prepared to answer in detail the explanations of those developments. But I make a general reflection on the importance of safety which is to our company extremely important. And we consider ourselves to be good in that respect, but we need to be better and better and better. And I will encourage you to &#x2013; there is elected to the PSA authorities after the Gullfaks incident which is also an important learning exercise for the company. That was an incidence where we with various barriers functioned, but it has a potential, we agreed to that. But the first important that we never, never get complacent, when it comes to safety, we need to be better everyday on this front. We are progressing and have full attention to it.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital. So, Torgrim you talked about more downside risk to the production guidance for this year and talked about some gas off take. Are you been starting to the higher instance of unplanned maintenance on the NCR <mark type="ph" /> and how much kind of contingency used to building into your forecast for this year and indeed a treatment where on in several growth rate after 2012 by nature of perhaps the slightly ageing sort of productive capacity in that part of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, very good question, thank you. On &#x2013; I deliberately said that is more downside risk than upside risk in the production in 2011 compared to 2010. And I said that in February of the capital market update and it is still valid. So the main risk elements related to this year is ramp-up of production from new fields. It is maintenance that we are able to deliver on the maintenance program and step-up the production &#x2013; after the maintenance program which is as important. It is related to gas off take situation over the years and it is also related to opportunities in the gas markets to differ gas production to a latter point in time.</p>
          <p>So, that is the main uncertainties &#x2013; main uncertainties. Furthermore, we have not catered for &#x2013; we have not catered for large incidence beyond what you sort of should expect from a company like ours, you should expect that we will have unplanned losses as we operate a significant portfolio that we not &#x2013; we're not catering for. For instance, incident like Kvitebj&#xF8;rn pipeline a few years back when someone drive an anchor over a pipeline and destroyed it. So we're not catering for that. Furthermore, we will remind you that we said 2010 level or slightly lower. So that is the wording that we use on it. So, we are &#x2013; we have produced so far this year, as I should expect but it's not more than what it should be. When it comes to unplanned losses so far this year, we have had some, if you look at rate compared to earlier its approximately where it has been over the last period as such. There are not big changes in that respect.</p>

          <p>Hi, Ms. Jon Rigby from UBS. Two questions on tax and just follow-up on Peregrino. On tax, can you just confirm whether the guidance you're providing on the international tax rate is a permanent fee charges one just related producing conditions and oil price?</p>
          <p>And then the second I almost hesitate to ask this, but when you clean-up your financial items and still get a charge for the year. You appear to also show a charge on &#x2013; a tax charge i.e. a tax charge on a charge. I just wondered what was going on there and what we could expect on a cleaned up basis, what your tax rate would be on financial items.</p>
          <p>On Peregrino, can you just confirm &#x2013; have you received some cash already? Is there a net cash to balance to be received or we are getting the full amount in second quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you and <mark type="ph" /> Coetta (55:50) you can start preparing for the question on financial items in fact, when it comes to international tax, I understood your question about the &#x2013; this was a permanent change in the tax -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Expected tax internationally. And I mean the tax rate in this quarter was very high in the international segment. You should also expect it to be 50% to 55% over the next year or so. We have earlier guided on 40% to 45%, so yes in the short-term you should expect increases &#x2013; increasing in the tax rate internationally. Whoever Peregrino is stepping up and our production in the U.S and Canada is stepping up with much lower tax rates. So that will drag it down over couple of years as such. So that is &#x2013; that is what we should expect.</p>
          <p>Then just the reflections on other things to look at for &#x2013; in the international segments. When we are drilling wells, if we are drilling wells in countries where we don't have a tax protection or tax position it is typically impact more on the tax rate than else for instance the Kiwi well this quarter. And in earlier quarters we have had dry wells in the Gulf of Mexico and in the U.S., we don't have tax protection either for accounting purposes. So dry wells in those areas will typically drag up the tax rate within the international segments.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Peregrino, yes we have received money related to Peregrino. There was &#x2013; that was received in late April, so that's it sit in our accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So was that the &#x2013; that was the full amount of disposals that you received in advanced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that was the &#x2013; full amount we will run up with fully paid and sits in &#x2013; sits in our account so that is fully received.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate on financial items is hard one to predict because it all depends you have in the group, we could have currency losses in one jurisdiction and gain in other jurisdiction. And also the tax rate vary very much from approximately 20% up to 60% to 65% for the = net financial items. And especially when the net financial items come down to zero, it that could be any percentage. The tax rate as it is now, it's minus 114%. But what we say if we have to say a figure which should be an average figure we have said 40% to 45% on the net financial items but that is the tax item which can vary the most in the whole composition of the tax.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On that I think we will run up with one last question if you have any more questions in queue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Now we actually have one question, I'll put that it right now. Please hold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Theepan here at Morgan Stanley. Just a couple of follow-up questions specifically. Firstly could on even just on volumes, could you give us estimate where you think yearend production would be for Peregrino, sort of the exit rate?</p>
          <p>And then secondly just if you could give us an update in terms of where we are on sort of final investment positions that some of the key projects there for this year. And then lastly I think on the Skrugard announcement, you suggested the potential for an appraisal well. I know you are going to be drilling another well on the license, but for next year I was just wondering when do you think that appraisal well maybe drilled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The year end production on Peregrino, we'll not given estimate on that one. What I can say is that is going to be 37 wells in that license and they will have &#x2013; each of them have significant contribution as well. I mean we are progressing on preparing the wells and there's wells tied up already. So that the step up is progressing as expected when it come to the Peregrino.</p>
          <p>When it comes to key projects for this year step up we had just upon Peregrino. We have the Skarvas a key project of production in 2011. That is a BP operated and that is expected to start work in second half of the year. We have Pazflor which is a Total operated license in Angola that is going to have a large impact in 2012, but we expect it to start up in the very end of 2011. And then I would like to mention shale Eagle Ford and Marcellus, which are stepping up. We have rig crews and frac crews available that we need to build it up and it is building up as expected as such. But that is that you know invest and drill as you go so that might vary going forward or you know the step up related to that.</p>
          <p>Yeah so that is the main contributors to 2011 step up production. Then your last question, Skrugard  and appraisal well. I mean we are sort of enthusiastic about the area and so on and we have more work to do out there. I am not prepared to discuss on them that is going to happen but it is important for us to firm up the volumes in that area and so on. So we can mature it even further.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So unless are there any further questions in the room here in Oslo. One last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to natural gas you previously indicated that based on contract renegotiated its basically 70% that you sell oiling and 30% that you see in the spot gas market is that also good indication going forward if you assume relatively high offset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just a second. I think there are couple of points I want to make in that respect. First of all we have in 2009 when we faced a significant drop in European prices we renegotiated the contracts. We were early out in that respect and then we had great period for three years as such.</p>
          <p>So what we did was to put some more supporting decorations into the gas formula as such and together with that we had excess capacity to pipelines and liquid market as such. So we could operate that.</p>
          <p>When that is said, when it comes to the mix of what's going forward you should expect actually this year to be less &#x2013; I don't have the specific numbers in front me here but you should actually expect the exposure to spot to be less this year and last year.</p>
          <p>So that is &#x2013; but what we can say is that if you look at the long-term contracts around 70% of that volume is linked to oil and gas products as such. That is still valid and then there is a certain amount of gas with outside the long-term contracts as I said.</p>
