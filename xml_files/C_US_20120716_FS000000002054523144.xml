          <p>Hello, and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Vikram Pandit; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach. Today's call will be hosted by John Andrews, Head of Citi Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>
          <p>Mr. Andrews, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. On the call today our CEO, Vikram Pandit, will speak first; then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards we will be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2011 Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>With that said, let me turn it over to Vikram.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>John, thank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. As you know, we reported earnings of $2.9 billion for the second quarter of 2012, and excluding CVA and the loss from the partial sale of our stake in Akbank, net income was $3.1 billion. That amounts to $1.00 per share.</p>
          <p>Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in light of the economic environment we faced during the quarter. The investments we have made continue to show encouraging results. Loans and deposits in Citicorp had solid growth. Our market businesses were resilient despite volatility, and we increased market share in Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>Revenue in Transaction Services set another record as we leveraged our unique global footprint especially in trade finance. While our consumer businesses were impacted by the slower economies, we still saw positive operating leverage in both Latin America and Asia, excluding Japan. We're managing our expenses closely and making sure we're right-sized for the environment we anticipate. Expenses decreased from both the first quarter of this year and second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>For the first half of the year, we had positive operating leverage in each of our core businesses. In Securities and Banking, the revenues excluding CVA and DVA increased 2% and expenses decreased 5%. In Transaction Services revenues increased 6% and expenses increased 2%. And in Global Consumer Banking revenues increased 2% and expenses increased 1%.</p>
          <p>More broadly, we've been managing our risks very tightly throughout the organization. Citi Holdings assets are now $191 billion or approximately 10% of our total assets as we reduced our legacy assets in Citi Holdings by 9% during the quarter. Citi remains highly liquid with over $400 billion in cash and government securities, and our capital levels continue to be among the strongest in the industry. As of the end of the second quarter, our Tier 1 Common Ratio was 12.7% under Basel I and was an estimated 7.9% under Basel III. We still expect to exceed 8% under Basel III this year.</p>
          <p>When you put it all together, we're generating solid returns in our core businesses. For the combined Citicorp and Corporate/Other our return on tangible common equity was 14.7% excluding CVA/DVA and Akbank. On the same basis for Citigroup our return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 8.2%.</p>
          <p>And given the amount of disallowed DTA, return on Basel III becomes an important measure of capital. On the fully implemented 9.5% basis, our return on Basel III capital in Citigroup was an estimated 10.3% and our return on Basel III capital on the combined Citicorp-Corporate/Other was 18.4% excluding CVA/DVA and Akbank. And while the environment is uncertain and we continue to optimize our portfolio, we have the capacity to earn similar returns on Basel III going forward.</p>
          <p>On a macro level, we believe the eurozone overhang will continue. Our on-the-ground sense of the emerging markets leaves us more positive than we were a few months ago and maybe even better than some market perceptions. In the U.S. consumer demand and thus loan demand remained low as consumers continue to de-leverage. And as central banks have lowered interest rates, the margin from lending has decreased and it is expected rates will stay low for the near future.</p>
          <p>That said our strategy is showing results and we're executing it diligently; focused on capital flows between the world's top 150 cities; on serving multinationals globally, as only we can, and on the faster-growing emerging markets are right for the times and the capabilities of our bank. We are diversified and while the negatives will pop up here and there, our footprints and strategy will serve us well over time. In short, we're in top of the things we can control.</p>
          <p>John will now take you through our slides and then we'll come back at the end and take questions together. John?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to highlight a few significant items affecting our results on slide 3. First, on the revenue side, CVA and DVA were a positive $219 million in the second quarter. We also recorded a pre-tax loss of $424 million related to the partial sale of our investment in Akbank, compared to a gain on sale of nearly $200 million on HDFC last year.</p>
          <p>On the expense side, legal and related expenses remained elevated at $480 million, and repositioning charges were $186 million, roughly half of which was related to Securities and Banking. In addition to these items, our reported results were affected by foreign exchange translation as the U.S. dollar generally strengthened in the second quarter against local currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses and credit costs. While FX translation had no material impact on our earnings or regulatory capital ratios, it did affect individual line items and reported business drivers, which is why I'll discuss more as we'll go through the presentation.</p>
          <p>On slide 4, we show second quarter results. Citigroup reported net income of $2.9 billion or $0.95 per diluted share. Excluding CVA/DVA and the loss on Akbank, earnings were $3.1 billion or $1.00 per diluted share. Revenues of $18.6 billion were down 10% versus the prior year on a reported basis. Excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of minority investments, revenues were down 7% from last year as revenue growth in Citicorp was offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the continued decline in Citi Holdings revenues.</p>
          <p>Expenses of $12.1 billion were 6% lower than the prior year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the significant expense items I just mentioned, core operating expenses declined nearly 3%. Credit costs of $2.8 billion were down 17% versus last year. Net credit losses of $3.6 billion were 31% lower than the prior year. And the net reserve release was $984 million, down 50% from last year. Citigroup end of period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $655 billion as continued loan growth in Citicorp outpaced the wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 6% to $914 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide 5, we show results for Citicorp and Citi Holdings, excluding the impact of CVA/DVA. Citicorp generated second quarter revenues of $17.8 billion and net income of $4.2 billion. Year-over-year Citicorp's reported revenues were flat and expenses declined 3%, and we maintained positive operating leverage in each of our three core businesses. Excluding FX, Citicorp revenues were 5% higher than last year and expenses were roughly flat. Pre-provision net revenues in Citicorp were $7.4 billion for the quarter, up 5% from last year. And for the sixth consecutive quarter, we grew loans year-over-year in every business in Citicorp. Total Citicorp loans grew 10% with consumer up 2% and corporate loans up 22%. Excluding FX, Citicorp loans grew 13% with consumer up 5%.</p>
          <p>Citi Holdings had revenues of $903 million and a net loss of $933 million. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $191 billion of assets, down $18 billion during the quarter, and $74 billion or 28% year-over-year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for approximately 10% of total Citigroup assets.</p>
          <p>On slide 6, we show a nine-quarter trend for Citicorp's result. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp's revenues of $17.8 billion were flat to the prior year and down 8% from last quarter on a reported basis. Operating expenses of $10.3 billion were 3% lower than the prior year. Citicorp's net credit losses of $2.2 billion declined 25% from last year, driven by improvement in North America cards. And the net loan loss reserve release in Citicorp was $715 million, down nearly 50% from last year. This reflected lower net releases in North America cards, as well as a net reserve build in International Consumer Banking primarily driven by loan growth. Excluding CVA/DVA, earnings before taxes of $5.9 billion grew 7% versus last year, driven by lower operating expenses and lower credit losses partially offset by a lower net reserve release.</p>
          <p>On slide 7, we show Citicorp's pre-tax earnings by business, excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of loan loss reserves. As you can see from this chart, our earnings excluding loan loss reserves are increasingly steady and are diversified across the franchise with a growing contribution from Consumer and Transaction Services. On a trailing 12-month basis, through the second quarter, Consumer Banking generated 46% of Citicorp's earnings and together with Transaction Services, these businesses represented nearly three-quarters of pre-tax profits.</p>
          <p>On slide 8, we show Citicorp's pre-tax earnings, excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of loan loss reserves for the first half of the year. On this basis, pre-tax earnings increased by 34% from the first half of 2011 driven by lower net credit losses as well as an improved operating margin.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 shows the results for Citi &#x2013; for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues of $5.1 billion were up 4% versus last year, largely driven by higher gains on sales of mortgage loans. Total card revenues declined 6% year-over-year. In branded cards, average loans declined, reflecting an increase in the payment rate and spreads remained under pressure due to the continued impact of the look-back provisions of CARD Act and higher promotional balances.</p>
          <p>In retail services, net interest revenues were stable while non-interest revenues declined driven by improving credit and its impact on contractual partner payment. Total operating expenses of $2.5 billion were up 5% year-over-year driven entirely by an increase in legal reserves related to interchange litigation.</p>
          <p>Credit costs declined by over 20% to $716 million. Net credit losses were down 29% to $1.5 billion driven by improvement in cards and the net reserve release was $814 million this quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew to $1.2 billion from $468 million last year.</p>
          <p>Overall, we continued to see progress in our North America Consumer franchise. Average deposits grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 5% year-over-year, including double-digit growth in checking account balances. In branded cards, accounts also grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 5% year-over-year. And for both card portfolios, net credit margins continued to expand year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Turning to International Consumer Banking on slide 10; in total the International Consumer businesses achieved positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter, with declines in reported revenues and expenses of 4% and 5% respectively. In constant dollars, revenues grew 4% and expenses were up 3%.</p>
          <p>Latin America achieved positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter, with revenues up 8% and expenses up 3% in constant dollars. Asia, however, had negative operating leverage with revenues roughly flat and expenses up 2% in constant dollars. Most of the revenue pressure in Asia was due to lower investment sales given continued weak investor sentiment.</p>
          <p>Cards revenues continued to grow on higher average loans and strong purchase sales, and lending and deposit revenues were flat versus last year as growth in certain markets was offset by pressure in Korea and Japan. Korea in particular is being affected by consumer regulatory changes. We show more information on these trends in the appendix.</p>
          <p>Despite these headwinds, most drivers for International Consumer Banking continued to grow in the second quarter. Accounts grew 6% year-over-year and on a constant dollar basis we grew average deposits, average loans, and purchase sales in every region.</p>
          <p>Credit costs were $730 million in the second quarter, up 16% from last year. Within credit costs, net credit losses continued to decline, down 12% to $613 million. However, we recorded a net reserve build of $86 million in the second quarter, principally due to portfolio growth versus a net release in the prior year. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew 3% year-over-year to $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we show growth trends for International Consumer Banking in more detail. On a constant dollar basis, average loans grew 10% over the prior year and average deposits were up 1% including 7% growth in checking account balance. Card purchase sales grew 10%. As reported, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have grown pre-tax earnings excluding the impact of loan loss reserves each quarter for well over two years.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows our Securities and Banking business. Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues of $5.2 billion were down 2% from last year and down 22% versus the prior quarter. Investment Banking revenues of $854 million were down 21% from the prior year on lower underwriting activity and generally flat sequentially as growth in M&amp;A and equity underwriting offset lower debt underwriting revenues. Overall, our wallet share in Investment Banking has improved year-to-date in all major products.</p>
          <p>Ex-CVA/DVA, equity market revenues of $550 million were down 29% from the prior year and 39% sequentially on lower market activity in both cash and derivatives. Fixed income market revenues, again ex-CVA/DVA, of $2.8 billion were down 4% year-over-year and down 41% sequentially from strong first quarter. Year-over-year revenues in rates and currencies grew at a double-digit pace driven by particularly strong performance in our foreign exchange and local markets businesses. Credit and securitized products were down year-over-year due to weaker market conditions.</p>
          <p>Lending revenues of $608 million were up significantly versus prior periods. Year-over-year loan growth and improved spreads drove higher net interest revenues. And we had $42 million of gains on lending hedges this quarter compared to a loss of $85 million last year. Total operating expenses of $3.6 billion were down 8% from last year driven by efficiency savings and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by nearly $100 million of repositioning costs. Net income, excluding CVA/DVA, grew 16% year-over-year to $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to Transaction Services on slide 13; revenues of $2.8 billion were up 5% from last year as growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions more than offset a decline in Securities and Fund Services. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 9% driven by strong growth in deposits and trade loans. Securities and Fund Services was down 6% year-over-year on lower market volumes. However, revenues did show an increase sequentially.</p>
          <p>The drivers for Transaction Services continued to show strong momentum. End of period trade loans were up over 50% from the prior year and average deposits were up 8%. Expenses of $1.4 billion were flat versus last year as incremental investment spending was offset by efficiency savings. We achieved positive operating leverage in Transaction Services for the second consecutive quarter, driving 6% earnings growth year-over-year.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, we show a nine-quarter trend for Citi Holdings. Citi Holdings reported loss was $920 million in the second quarter. Revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, were down over 62% year-over-year to $903 million due primarily to overall lower asset as well as the absence of gains on the sale of held-to-maturity securities and other assets in the second quarter of last year. Operating expenses of $1.2 billion were down 25% versus last year, and total credit costs were down 31% to $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at Citi Holdings in more detail on slide 15; revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management were $87 million this quarter versus $47 million last year, driven by a higher contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture. In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 31% versus last year to $931 million, primarily due to declining loan balances.</p>
          <p>In the Special Asset Pool, revenues, ex-CVA/DVA, were negative $115 million in the second quarter compared to a positive $1 billion last year. Net interest revenue was negative $77 million, as interest-earning assets remained a smaller portion of the Special Asset Pool. Non-interest revenue, excluding CVA/DVA, was negative $38 million, compared to a positive $1.1 billion last year, which included the significant gains on the sale of held-to-maturity securities and other assets. We also booked $85 million of reserves related to private label mortgage securitizations in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Citi Holdings operating expenses were down 25% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, mainly due to declining assets as well as lower legal and related costs. Credit costs were down 31% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Total net credit losses were down 39% to $1.3 billion, reflecting a significant reduction in loans in the Special Asset Pool as well as a declining loan balance and improved credit trends in Local Consumer Lending. We released $269 million of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holdings compared to $583 million last year.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with $191 billion in Citi Holdings, or roughly 10% of total Citigroup assets. The $18 billion reduction in the second quarter included roughly $11 billion of sales, approximately $6 billion of net runoff and pay-downs, and $1 billion of net credit and net asset marks.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of negative $265 million were down from the prior year driven by the $424 million pre-tax loss on the partial sale of Akbank compared to a gain of nearly $200 million on the partial sale of HDFC last year.</p>
          <p>Expenses of $597 million were down 3% versus last year, mainly due to lower legal and related expenses. Assets of $289 billion included approximately $101 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $135 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities.</p>
          <p>Turning to total Citigroup expenses on slide 18; total operating expenses of $12.1 billion in the second quarter were 6% lower than last year, while core operating expenses, excluding legal and related cost and repositioning charges, declined nearly 3% in constant dollars to $11.5 billion. As I mentioned earlier, legal and related costs remained elevated through the second quarter and we also incurred nearly $200 million of repositioning costs. However, we also benefited from FX translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened in many markets. In total, for the first half of 2012, we reported expenses of $24.5 billion.</p>
          <p>As we look to the third and fourth quarters, we currently believe that our core operating expenses should be roughly at or below the $11.5 billion we incurred in the second quarter. Additionally, however, we will continue to incur legal and related costs and repositioning charges, which on a combined basis have exceeded what we would otherwise consider to be a normalized level of roughly $250 million per quarter. Obviously these charges have been running at an elevated level and will continue to be difficult to predict, particularly in this environment.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. Net credit losses continued to improve in the second quarter, down 10% sequentially to $3.6 billion. And the net loan loss reserve release was $984 million. We ended the quarter with $27.6 billion of total loan loss reserves and our LLR ratio was 4.3%.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 shows our international consumer credit trend, which generally remained stable to improving in the second quarter. In Asia, the NCL rate remains below 1% and 90-plus day delinquencies were flat at around 50 basis points. In Latin America, the NCL rate continued to improve to 4.1% while delinquencies were fairly stable.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, we show the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, split between residential first mortgages and home equity loan. In residential first mortgages, we ended the quarter with $63 billion of loans down 14% from a year ago. Excluding the incremental mortgage charge-offs of $315 million in the first quarter, net credit losses were roughly flat sequentially at $426 million. 90-plus day delinquencies were down 3% to $3.8 billion driven by continued loan sale.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we sold approximately $500 million of delinquent mortgages. 30 to 89-day delinquencies were up slightly versus the prior quarter, as expected, driven by re-defaults of previously modified mortgages. In home equity loans, we ended the quarter with $37 billion of loans, down 13% from a year ago. Excluding the incremental charge-offs of $55 million in the first quarter, net credit losses were down 11% sequentially, and 90-plus day delinquencies were also down versus the prior quarter at $864 million. In total, we allocated roughly $9.5 billion of our loan loss reserves to North America real estate lending in Citi Holdings, and we maintained over 30 months of coincident NCL coverage.</p>
          <p>On slide 22, we show our key capital metrics. As of the second quarter, our Basel I Tier 1 Common Ratio was 12.7%. Adjusting for the final market risk rules recently adopted by the U.S. regulators that will be effective in January 2013, our Basel I Tier 1 Common Ratio would be approximately 11.3%. Under Basel III, our estimated Tier 1 Common Ratio as of the second quarter was 7.9%, up from 7.2% in the first quarter. These estimates both include the impact of the final market risk rules and are based on the proposed advanced approach for calculating risk-weighted assets under the recent NPR.</p>
          <p>As you may be aware, the regulatory proposals also require Citi and other banks to calculate its risk-weighted assets under a newly defined standardized approach and to use the lower of the two resulting ratios for our reported Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio. We continue to review the implications of the standardized approach, but based on preliminary data and I want to stress that this is preliminary, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio for the second quarter as calculated under the standardized approach approximates the ratio under the advanced calculation. However, the risk-weighted asset components are somewhat different. We continue to expect to be above an 8% Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio later this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 shows the components of our Basel I and estimated Basel III capital ratio. As of the second quarter, our Tier 1 common capital under Basel I was $124 billion compared to an estimated $99 billion under Basel III. Over half of the difference reflects the disallowance of our minority investment in unconsolidated financial institutions with the remainder driven by pension liabilities within other comprehensive income and deferred tax assets.</p>
          <p>Turning to the denominator, our total risk-weighted assets under Basel III as calculated using the proposed advanced approach were an estimated $1.25 trillion or 28% higher versus Basel I.</p>
          <p>Looking at Citicorp and Corp/Other, our risk-weighted assets increased by only 15% reflecting the strong credit quality of our loan portfolio, the low asset intensity of our service businesses, and our focus on flow facilitation in capital markets. The impact of Citi Holdings on our total risk-weighted assets will decrease over time as we continue to wind down those assets.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, we show our returns on tangible common equity, assuming TCE is allocated based on estimated Basel III risk-weighted assets. On this basis, the return on tangible common equity for Citicorp plus Corp/Other for the first half of 2012 was an estimated 15.9%, and including Citi Holdings, Citigroup generated a return of nearly 9%.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, we highlight our returns under Basel III, again using risk-weighted assets is calculated using the proposed advanced approach. Citigroup's return on Basel III assets for the first half of the year was an estimated 1% including a 1.8% return for Citicorp plus Corp/Other. And if we assume Tier 1 common capital levels of 9.5% of Basel III risk-weighted assets across each business, the return on Basel III capital for Citigroup would have been an estimated 10.6% for the first half of 2012 including a 19.3% return for our core businesses in Citicorp plus Corp/Other.</p>
          <p>Let me close with some comments about the outlook. First, Global Consumer Banking; overall credit quality remains good, with continued improvement in North America and stable credit in Asia and Latin America. We expect these trends to continue for the remainder of the year assuming no meaningful downturn in the global economy.</p>
          <p>Latin America, despite the noise this quarter from FX, was the fastest growing of our regions in consumer, and we expect that to continue particularly in Mexico given both market growth and the strength of our franchise.</p>
          <p>Asia consumer revenue growth has slowed, reflecting the two principal issues that I mentioned. First, investment sales remain weak, as retail investors in Asia have de-risked given the same global macro concerns that have slowed institutional activity. And second, specific country slowdowns, most notably in Korea, where policy actions by the government have trimmed the availability of consumer credit in that market. We see these trends continuing in the near term, which would imply some revenue headwinds for Asia into the third and fourth quarters.</p>
          <p>North America consumer benefited from another quarter of strong mortgage activity, which we currently expect will continue into the third quarter. However, in cards, high payment rates from consumers reflecting ongoing economic uncertainty and de-leveraging and our shift to higher credit quality borrowers continues to weigh on loan growth. This trend will likely remain into the third quarter absent a meaningful improvement in the U.S. economy.</p>
          <p>Transaction Services continue to produce strong revenue and earnings growth, and had a second consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage that we expect will be sustainable going forward.</p>
          <p>In Securities and Banking, there were a few key takeaways this quarter. First, the biggest challenge we and the industry face is the ongoing macro uncertainty, reflected in low levels of client activity. Without meaningful signs of accelerating economic growth or a credible resolution as perceived by the market to the European issues, the reduced activity is likely to persist into the third quarter. Having said that, the strength and breadth of our fixed income franchise, particularly our rates and currencies business, was evident in the second quarter and first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to equities, we believe our business is past the problems of the second half of last year, and we continue to execute well, although low levels of client activity remain a substantial challenge and that will likely continue into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Investment Banking franchise continued to see momentum with wallet share gains in every major product, although overall market activity remained muted. Based on that, we are cautiously optimistic that our investments in our banking franchise are showing results.</p>
          <p>Given the current operating environment, we remain very focused on right-sizing our businesses in Securities and Banking for the opportunity we see, and we are keeping a tight rein on expenses as the positive operating leverage we produced in the second quarter and the first half of 2012 demonstrates.</p>
          <p>In Holdings, the wind down of assets will continue, and our primary focus remains the mortgage portfolio. Mortgages continue to face a number of challenges including the substantial foreclosure backlog, ongoing political headwinds, and the risk from any weakening of the U.S. economy. As such, we have not released any general loan loss reserves against our mortgage portfolio to-date and have maintained robust coverage ratios.</p>
          <p>In summary, one of the biggest issues we face remains the uncertain macro environment and in particular the European sovereign debt issues. As such, we will continue to run our risk exposures very tightly while serving our clients. Basically we will continue to manage what we can control and limit our exposure to what we cannot control. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic about our prospects given our client franchise, our unique mix of businesses, and our unparalleled footprint.</p>

          <p>John, thank you, and before we go to questions, I do want to point out to everybody that this is John Andrews' last earnings call. As you know, he'll be moving to the Institutional Clients business, and he'll be heading up our client content development there. John's been with Citi for over three years and as all of you know it's been interesting three years. And throughout that time, John has served this company and our investors extraordinarily well. He's not only a consummate professional who understands our business, but he's also been a strong advocate to the outside world and has provided life counsel internally. But he'll still be at Citi, and so we'll continue to be able to work together. In the meantime, Susan Kendall will be the acting Head of Investor Relations. John, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Quick numbers one first. Tax rate as reported was low, but I'm just curious on how much the Akbank sale or DVA/CVA might have impacted and what you think the core might be over the next, say, four quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, four quarters is a little bit far to go out, Glenn, but let me try to help you out for the balance of the year anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the effective tax rate in the second quarter was down about 500 basis points, I guess, from the first quarter, and there's two factors that impact the tax rate in the second quarter. First, as you mentioned, the loss on the sale of Akbank does carry a higher rate, certainly, as it produces a higher tax benefit for us. But the second factor is, overall, we've got a downward revision in our expected tax rate for 2012 due to a forecasted change in the mix of our earnings. So if you look at the first half of the year now, our effective tax rate is roughly 22%, and that's the rate that you should expect us to have for the balance of the year. And if you look, it's basically the same tax rate as we had last year if you adjust the taxes for the Japan DTA write-off that we had. So we're roughly at 22% going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. Cool. On the MSSB potential, a 14% transaction, assuming we get a price whether it be agreed upon or through arbitration, that's anything lower than where you have it marked, I'm just checking, do you take the full mark on the full position but you only get the partial capital benefit? Is that how I remember correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on exactly what charge we take, how off &#x2013; how far off, if any, the &#x2013; let's call it the third party appraiser comes in. But whatever mark that we would &#x2013; that we would potentially have to take in the third quarter, that would be probably a full mark, and we would get the full benefit of the payment. Don't forget from a Basel III point of view, any mark is irrelevant against our Basel III capital ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Basel III point of view, we basically have written the entire investment off at this point in time as required under the rules for investments in unconsolidated financial subs above 10%. So any mark will have zero impact on Basel III ratio.</p>

          <p>Fair point. I know you're going to be limited here, but if you could help us with anything on LIBOR. I know back in December, you settled in Japan, and then you had specific comments about internal investigations in the U.K. at the time of the Barclays release.

          <p>Well, let me take that, Glenn. And, yes, we are a member of number of interbank rate-setting panels, and we as well as other banks have received requests for information and we're cooperating with them. These are confidential requests, but we're fully cooperating with government authorities on these matters. The only thing I can say to you is though we cannot discuss any details, do not infer from the situation of one LIBOR submitting bank that every bank is in the same or a similar position. I think it's not the case that you can draw conclusions about the regulatory consequences for any one particular bank. That's about all I can say at this point. We did make a statement when &#x2013; or rather there were clarifications when there were issues that came up in the U.K., and you already know about the investigation that was ongoing in Tokyo.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. John, I was wondering if we could just clarify the expense comments that you made. I think you said that you expect the kind of core of $11.5 billion, you think you could hold that for the rest of this year each quarter, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I said, John, at or below the $11.5 billion for each of the next <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:02) quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the other stuff, the litigation and the repositioning, the episodic stuff, did you say that you kind of see $250 million as what you might call a regular occurrence of that, and you've been above that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's exactly right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you go back, on a more normalized level, we would expect those types of expenses to run something about $250 million or so a quarter, call it $1 billion a year. Obviously they have been running at elevated levels for the first half of the year, and for last year as well. And, it's a little bit difficult to predict exactly where those types of expenses are going to go for the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So is it your hope that they're in that $250 million range each quarter and that's combined &#x2013; those two things combined in the next two quarters, but obviously you can't know for sure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't put hope. I would say that our expectation of normalized levels would put them at $250 million. For the third and the fourth quarter, I think that is likely to &#x2013; you should assume that they will continue to run at somewhat elevated levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Although I can't predict what they're going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then on the net interest income and the net interest margin, the margin down 9 basis points is a little more than you had thought it might be a few months ago. What were the drivers of that and what kind of outlook might you have on the margin and net interest income potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we had said that it would probably be around 2.85% plus or minus 1 or 2 basis points. So we're somewhere around a 3 maybe 4 basis points off that guidance that we had given. And basically the entire &#x2013; at least 3 basis points of it &#x2013; the entire shortfall is just about entirely due to some higher than anticipated levels of prepayments that we've got in our branded cards portfolio in April of this quarter. The prepayments &#x2013; the payments were higher than what we would have normally anticipated. I can tell you that the payments now has &#x2013; the payment rate has stabilized, so it's not something where we can see that throughout the balance of the quarter.</p>
          <p>So I would say that consistent with our previous guidance, I would expect NIM to more or less stabilize at the second quarter level for the balance of the year. Again, as always, plus or minus 2 or 3 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that includes the benefit of TruPS redemptions and any other actions around the debt footprint that you've talked about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you remember, I think even back in the second quarter, I had mentioned that the continued reduction in long-term debt would be one of the tailwinds that we saw as far as benefiting NIM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then separately, could you update us on where the DTA stood at quarter end, John, and whether you consumed or built any DTA this quarter and any expectations you have for the rest of this year on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the second quarter, DTA came down roughly $1 billion from where we were at the end of the first quarter. There's about three factors that play into that. There's about roughly $200 million of that decline comes from components of OCI. There's another $300 million that is really just the FX impact on DTA that we have on our balance sheet that's carried in foreign currencies. And then there's $0.5 billion due to just a balance sheet adjustment for some purchased foreign NOLs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Great. And then last question for me, on the equities, does the weakness this quarter have anything to do with the weakness from the second half of this year, or is that more just a pure volume and cash equities issue this quarter? Could you just give us some color on what happened this quarter and compare it to the back half of last year, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we actually &#x2013; actually, the client volumes in the second quarter were up a little bit perhaps from the fourth quarter of last year, and so we actually &#x2013; against where the revenues were from the equities business in the second half of the year, the second quarter by comparison looks pretty strong.</p>
          <p>So, we actually think that the business did fairly well in the second quarter. There is always room for improvement, we'd like to be able to grow our prime finance business a little bit more, so that we're somewhat less susceptible just to changes in market volumes, but the business did okay given the market volumes that were out there this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Jim Mitchell, Buckingham Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good morning. First, maybe we could just talk about Asia. You highlighted that things are slowing not surprising. Does it change the way you think about the investment spend over there, I know you've been bulking up pretty aggressively in China on the retail footprint in Asia, ex-Japan, does that &#x2013; does it change at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is again to split Asia into a variety of different parts and John talked about that briefly. The shift in Korea is a regulatory shift and we have a fairly decent size presence in Korea and that's not a place where we've been investing in any case. It's an adjustment to a new regulatory phase just as the U.S. business is doing that on the retail side.</p>
          <p>Japan, we've had our own issues there and that's also been reflected there and we really haven't been investing in Japan either, while we &#x2013; as I said a little bit earlier, I think we believe that at least we feel better about a lot of the Asian economies than we did few months back and frankly we feel better about it than some of the market perceptions out there. Our ability to grow in China is important to us and we'll continue to do that. Our ability to do whatever we can in India is important, although there are regulatory constraints in what we can do.</p>
          <p>So, a big part of what we wanted to do, we got done last year in terms of investments in Asia, hereon in terms of our growth it's going to be country-by-country, depending upon where we have regulatory permission and where we see growth, some of that may continue, although it'll be at a very different pace than it was last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And John maybe on the mortgage business, I know you've perennially been negative, what is it going to take as we hear more and more anecdotal evidence that things are at least maybe are stabilizing, people are getting more optimistic, when do you &#x2013; what do you need to see to release reserves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what people see right now would be pockets of improvement. And to the extent that there are some green shoots out there, that's great. We're still very focused as I said in the prepared remarks, as far as the risk of the foreclosure overhang, I mean there are still an awful lot of foreclosed asset or foreclosures in process that have yet to hit the market. So, I don't look at this yet as being a robust housing situation and maybe a little bit of it comes from the fact that, I lived through the mortgage issues of the early 1990s and it took years for that to clear up. And in comparison, the early 1990s were small potatoes compared to what we're going through now. So, I need to see a little bit more evidence and I think I speak for Brian Leach, our Chief Risk Officer as well, as far as that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. So, just real quick following up on the question in Asia, it's certainly encouraging that you guys have seen or feeling better than you were a few months back. It might be helpful if you could give us a bit more color on what you're seeing there that's giving you that confidence?</p>
          <p>From my end, I was kind of surprised to see the continued strong purchase sale growth, so maybe if you could let us know if there was something specific that was driving that certain markets that were stronger than others? And just maybe give a little bit more color, because I think there are a great deal of investors who are quite concerned about growth in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, let me start it by saying, overall comment in Asia, given the low amounts of fiscal or government debt and kind of the strong overall nature of the economy still, I mean we're arguing whether China grows at 7%, 8% or 7.5%, 8.5% rather than 8%, 9%, so given the strong nature of the underlying fundamentals, they've got ample policy room, that's the first thing to keep in mind, and they've actually been using it. And that's an important perspective to keep in mind in terms of the trajectories of this economy.</p>
          <p>Secondly, some of the growth issues have been affected by the supply side issues. Asia needs a lot more infrastructure. We're seeing signs in certain countries where that's changing as well. And so, if the impact on Asia was because of Europe slowing down and the impact on Asia was because of a lack of the export markets, some of that is being made up for with policy alternatives, a shift towards consumers consuming and infrastructure spending and we see that sort of stuff on the ground and that's important.</p>
          <p>The broader trend which gets to what are the clientele or what is the clientele we serve, we are largely an urban bank in Asia, and cities are growing. Despite all of these things, urbanization is a very powerful trend. Middle-class is growing. People are coming in the cities. That's what drives our business. So, yes, the macro is important. As I said I'm feeling better about the macro than I did myself a few months back. It's the micro that's really important our clientele, urbanization, rise in middle-class there &#x2013; that's where it's coming from and then when you look at, well, what part of Asia? Yes, there are some country differences, no question about that and we talked about that, Korea is the country difference, where &#x2013; it's a regulatory-driven country difference, but when you get to the urban centers, they have a lot more in common with each other than we believe and so that's really what's driving it.</p>
          <p>And the urbanization theme is really a powerful driver, it transcends the GDP growth theme. We don't have numbers for that to share with you on a macro basis, but that's what drives the business and we continue to be very comfortable that that theme continues for a long time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your question on cards, I think the region overall again on the ex-FX basis had purchase sales growing about 7% year-over-year. And we saw purchase sales growing in most of the countries, quite frankly; off the top of my head, Australia, India, Singapore and Hong Kong would all be countries where we had reasonably good purchase sale growth year-over-year. So, it's not concentrated in just one market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Quick question, it's just basically a clarification. Vikram was quoted in the press regarding return of capital over the weekend, I just wanted to make sure as far as the timing that was referenced in that article; were you just referring to the standard CCAR process that's going to kick back in for 2013 or was that actually something outside that standard process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, let me tell you exactly where we are, that's the better way to start. One, it is about the CCAR process, but more importantly, even whether before you get there, our priority right now is earnings generation, it's capital creation and we've been doing that and that's the reason why we expect to be about 8% and maybe more by year-end and that's what's driving us. I've also said, we are committed to creating returns for you and returning capital. Especially, as you look at the stock, this price represents compelling value; having said that, you know we have to go through the CCAR process, this is a decision that's made by us with the regulators. And frankly, at this point, we really haven't decided what we're going to do and we will decide on that when we get closer and when we get closer to submitting CCAR, at that point, we'll make it clear to you.</p>

          <p>Great, okay. And then last one for me. Visa and MasterCard settled on Friday, I think you all have been &#x2013; certainly the results have reflected some reserving there. So my guess is that you're fully reserved. But if you could maybe give some color now that we see the actual settlement in writing?</p>
          <p>And then separately, when you think about &#x2013; it seems as though they're basically making a bet that consumers &#x2013; there won't be a big change in behavior and that there won't be much momentum behind separately charging for credit card. Can you talk about what your view is on that and how much &#x2013; remind us how much of the $3.6 billion in credit card fees that you all had in 2011 is credit card fee versus debit? And then, what your view is on the higher end consumer and whether or not maybe if there is an additional charge those folks could start to baulk at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, there was about 10 questions there. I'm not quite sure I wrote them all down, but I'm going to &#x2013; I'll try to answer what I remember and then whatever I leave out come back at me, all right?</p>
          <p>For the settlement that got announced, we're &#x2013; I'm not going to go into the details of the merchant settlement. We're actually not allowed to do that. There's actually confidentiality restrictions that have been posed by the court. I can tell you that we were fully accrued as of the end of the second quarter for our expected share of the settlement.</p>
          <p>And as far as future impacts of the proposed network rule changes, it's far too early to try to guess what those may be, I mean, the documents are &#x2013; I think the ink is still wet in front of the court. So, it's a little hard to sit there right now and come to some sort of judgment as to what the impact could be on Citi's cards businesses. Whatever impact there will be, it will be based upon factors really outside of our control, including merchant behavior in response to the new rules.</p>
          <p>So, all of this is a little bit hard to judge right now. You asked the question about credit card fees, don't forget debit fees are a very, very small percentage of our overall fees, which is why we didn't have as much impact from the Durbin Amendment as other institutions. I'm not quite sure what else I left out from the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that was the best &#x2013; the big thing there. So, that $3.6 billion from last year, which you basically assume that's pretty much all credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the debit fees run a couple of $100 million.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, great, thanks. John, could you talk a little bit about whether the credit or revenue trends that you're seeing in the Consumer Banking in Asia and Latin America are consistent with the local markets, better, are there any where they're weaker? Can you just talk about how you see them competitively positioned? Then I've got a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Moshe, don't forget, we have a very specific target market in that region. And we're focused for the most part on what we would say is a very highly creditworthy customer base. And we're also very cautious as far as how we extend credit cards as well as even the secured lending we do on mortgages, but we actually benefit from a lot of the regulatory rules in those countries, which insist on a very &#x2013; very low loan-to-value type of requirement.</p>
          <p>So, we think that the &#x2013; certainly from an Asia point of view, again, we've got some extraordinary performance at this point in time, but we think that it's running in line what we would anticipate from the market segment that we choose to serve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just kind of going at the question about the reserve on the mortgage in different way; I understand your kind of reluctance from how you feel about how robust the recovery is, but one would think on a point-to-point, the quality of the portfolio has improved relative to those reserves and there must be a trigger at least from an accounting standpoint that would say, if it was adequate before it's got to be more than adequate now. I mean, are we at least approaching something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hard for me to say what we're approaching. We feel that we maintain adequate reserves and they're appropriate given the current economic environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. One of your large competitors did report on Friday and made the comment that they felt like they were at the point where &#x2013; they kind of were passing through that tipping point &#x2013; from that standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then, Moshe, &#x2013; not to be disrespectful, sir, but maybe you really want to direct your question at them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And you've got more months coverage too, so anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Moshe, one thing I just want to be clear on it. The one thing you will see, as we have said, as we begin to incur credit losses in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement. We will release reserves to cover those losses because those loans have been fully reserved for. And so, we will be doing some level of reserve releases now, those amounts at least to-date have been fairly modest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if your question is more towards general reserves then we're not prepared to release as yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. First, your Basel III ratio went up and two other large banks that reported went down, is that just the impact of winding down Citi Holdings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. We &#x2013; I can't comment on why other institutions had their ratio go down. As we've commented and I've specifically commented on this, until the NPR came out, everybody was just estimating what their Basel III ratios are. And as I had mentioned, we were trying to be very conservative in how we were estimating our Basel III ratio.</p>
          <p>So, we had communicated to you that our Basel III ratio was 7.2% in the first quarter and after we went through the volumes of the NPR and the final rule making, we came out &#x2013; we were still at 7.2%, which is, but it reflected a certain amount of conservatism on our part going into calculating that 7.2%. And so, now when you look at the growth from 7.2% to 7.9%, I'd say there is some impact in there, of course, from Akbank. The Akbank sale generated 23 basis points or so of improvement. But a lion's share of the improvement is really due to income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, Vikram, in his opening comments said, he's become more encouraged in the last several months and I'm just curious what are you looking at that gives &#x2013; that what's changed that makes you more encouraged about emerging market trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think it's important to qualify it that way. We're continually concerned about Europe and we're managing our risk extremely tightly as a result of that and obviously you see what's going on in the U.S., you all are as close to it as we are as well, we'd all like to see more job creation in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The emerging market story to me is again what we see on the ground and we see a lot of policy alternatives being put into place, lot of actions being taken by government, we see move in different parts of the world to make those investments in infrastructure, which raises investment spending in these countries and we see a lot of these economies are very actively managed and they too felt the impact of the European slowdown and they're doing what they can to deal with that.</p>
          <p>And so, whereas a few months ago, we had the impact of the eurozone coming at it and not clear what the policy alternatives or what the active management of these economies were going to be. We're seeing that right now. And in addition to that, as John talked about, we're seeing that in our consumer businesses as we talked about purchase sales and what's happening with the key trends. The key trend in the emerging markets is urbanization when you cut through all of that that's where the growth is coming from and that trend continues.</p>
          <p>So, it's piecing together lot of data points &#x2013; it's one of the unique advantages we have at Citi. I mean, we're in just about every country that's in the emerging markets and we have that advantage to be able to talk to our people on the ground and get their information and piece it altogether, that's what drives my thinking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, if I can come back at the credit card settlement question in a different way. It seems to me the big structural change really is the ability for merchants to have a surcharge on credit card transactions. And at least, you must have done some analysis around the merchants' proclivity to do that and maybe look at the case study of the gas stations, which have been able to do it for years, right. So, have you done any analysis around how likely merchants or hotels are to introduce a surcharge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is analysis that our cards' guys have done on that, but I'm not prepared to comment on that analysis at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly just a small question; on page 16, on the Citi Holdings assets summary, the assets listed next to the MSSB venture are $20 billion and it had been $25 billion for the last couple of quarters. Is that in any way revolved around the buy down or why is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, as you may recall, we have mentioned in the past, there were certain margin loans that we've been carrying on our books as the &#x2013; as the joint venture has begun to set up &#x2013; it's in process of setting up their own systems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those systems now have begun to come online and so you're starting to see a shift in those loans being moved off of our books on to the books of the joint venture itself.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. If I could follow-up on expenses, a lot of talk about right-sizing for the expected environment and it sounds like specifically within the S&amp;B where we have seen some expense management, especially looking year-over-year <mark type="indiscernible" /> (71:35).</p>
          <p>Maybe just give some color in terms of how much of the declining expenses that we've seen and as you think about going forward is coming from lower compensation, how much is bringing down the head count? And then, all conceptually, obviously you're not going to give us all the numbers, but also like certain businesses that you may look to prune, how should we think about those three components in terms of both driving the expense progress so far and what might be on the table going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, I was having a hard time following all of your questions and so I apologize. But in general we &#x2013; as I said, we target a 3% to 5% reduction in expenses in every business going into each and every year that's our expectation that businesses are going to be able to produce operating efficiencies. And I think that you see that in one of the slides that we've got on the deck here. For the quarter, I think, we've generated about. I think it's $700 million worth of efficiency savings and we've done about $1.3 billion for the first half, which is in the slide that's somewhere in the back of the deck. So, these are things that we work all the time.</p>
          <p>Specifically, you take a look at compensation costs, you take a look in the supplement that we provide you, we break out compensation costs. Compensation costs for the first half of the year are down something on the order of 4% or 5%, I don't recall the number just off the top of my head. So, there certainly is a good element of head count reduction that is contributing to the overall expense reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically within the Securities and Banking segment, obviously the question that I'm sure you guys are asking yourself and a lot of other &#x2013; of your peers, how long will revenues remain under pressure and what are some levers that you can pull? So, going forward, how do we think about potential savings from lower comp, lower head count or actual businesses that you might just exit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And Matt, as we have said in the past and as we continue to say we're very focused on making sure that we've got the right resources in that business to deal with the opportunities that we see. You've seen expenses coming down in the business year-on-year. They've now had two consecutive quarters of lowering expenses and we're going to continue to look at that business and make sure that we've got it sized appropriately, but I'm not going to tell you that you're going to &#x2013; you should expect to see two more quarters of expense reduction coming out of Securities and Banking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just separately, as we think about the Basel III Tier 1 common target of greater than 8%, obviously you're getting by the end of the year, you're already within striking distance of that. Is there anything unusual that might limit kind of capital build or from here is it just the matter of, you make money and what the RWAs continue to what they do. Is there anything that would &#x2013; I guess, it seems like you're being a little conservative because you're pretty close to the 8% now and I just want to make sure there's nothing that might offset the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, &#x2013; yeah, it really is down to a &#x2013; to the extent they represent anything that's a simple formula. It really is about making money and adding to your capital base. And that is very much what we're focused on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then just lastly on the LIBOR, both you and JPMorgan have said you can't really comment on it but both of you have also said don't assume that all banks are the same, which I think some people are interpreting as a positive that you might be less exposed. So, I will ask again if there is anything more that you can say, and if not, when will investors and analysts have a better sense of what's going on, the timeline if you could offer anything there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>It's hard to say. These are all government investigations around the world. They're going to take their time. The one thing we can assure you is you'll know at the same time we will. And, beyond that, really there's really nothing more to add on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. John, you talked about the securities business and the outlook for the third quarter, and barring any major changes in the economy or in the capital markets, you thought that the activity would be similar to the second quarter. Question, would this &#x2013; is it similar in the sense that we should see a flat sequential number then Q3 to Q2, or are you suggesting that the decline on a sequential basis could be equivalent in the third quarter versus the second quarter &#x2013; to the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gerard, we feel pretty good about the perform &#x2013; we feel very good about the performance that our Securities and Banking business had in the second quarter given the market environment in the second quarter. And, there's nothing unusual about the revenues that we put up in the second quarter in that market environment. So, as you start to think about what market environment you may be modeling for in the third and the fourth quarter, you could look at our second quarter performance as being reflective of the environment that we had in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add to that. We have made changes to that business since the fourth quarter last year, structural changes, cost changes, reengineering changes. And, some of them, obviously, you've seen in the expense numbers; not all of them are completely done yet. And that's just to provide you a little bit more color to what John just talked about.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. On the mortgage business where you guys had the gains this quarter from a basis point standpoint, what were the spreads on the sales of mortgages in the second quarter versus what they &#x2013; where they were in the first quarter? Did they widen out or shrink?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall gain on sales spreads were down a little bit in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. I want to say they were down something on the order of maybe 40 basis points or something like that, 30 basis points; I just don't have that number off the top of my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say that the gains still, though, are materially above historical spreads that you would see in this type of &#x2013; in the sales activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would definitely say they're still well above the historical levels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that &#x2013; I hate to say this is a new norm, but if rates stay where they are as the Fed has suggested they want to see through the end of 2014 that &#x2013; we don't know what volumes will be, of course, but do you think the spreads could actually stay at these unusually high levels for as long a period of time?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, I &#x2013; as we said, we think that the current levels of &#x2013; that refinancing activity should stay high certainly into the third and probably into the fourth quarter.

          <p>Sure, understandable. The other question I had was you guys mentioned that there has been a structural change in Korea in terms of the consumer banking business.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. I was wondering if you could just comment on where you stand in your negotiations with Morgan Stanley on the 14% sale of the joint venture. We haven't seen a deal yet. Are discussions progressing? Have you &#x2013; have they moved to an arbitrator? Is there anything you can tell us about the timing? Do you still expect to complete that sale potentially, say, in the third quarter? Or, just what can you tell us given that we haven't seen a deal yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's actually pretty simple. Later today, I believe, we should be exchanging values with Morgan Stanley. And, our expectation is that the two firms will be more than 10% apart and that means that the process will then go to a third-party appraiser. That's laid out in the contract. The third-party appraiser, I think there is &#x2013; I don't know if it's five or six days that we get to pick the appraiser, and then the appraiser has a certain amount of time. But, the expectation is that the appraiser needs to complete their work by somewhere around August 30th and the contract &#x2013; I believe that the transaction closes no later than September 7th by contract.</p>

          <p>On the LIBOR issue, let me try it a different way. Is it unreasonable to infer that since you had the TIBOR issue in Japan that you have internally reviewed other areas such as LIBOR?

        <plist>
          <p>So, is it just paydowns from your current holders, or are you benefiting from being able to sell some of your assets more actively to investors, potentially realizing some gains or losses as you're disposing them more rapidly than just the P&amp;I payments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're active sellers. Even in the mortgages, as we said, we're &#x2013; we sold $500 million worth of delinquent loans this quarter. And, in virtually every one of the businesses, we certainly look for sales wherever we can get it. One of the things that you should have seen is the business in Belgium came out this quarter so that was part of the reduction. So that represents a sale. And, you'll see that &#x2013; yeah, the &#x2013; basically it's a difference on the international line. At least $3 billion of that international line difference relates to the sale of Belgium. So, we're still looking to sell portfolios. Yeah, it's part &#x2013; it certainly is an active part of what the people in Holdings look to do every day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then lastly on Holdings, is there anything else in Holdings that you'd want to be retaining, or should we expect that everything in Holdings right now is slated for elimination over time and if there is any commentary around CitiFinancial that at one point was going to be in sale mode?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Betsy, you should think that everything in Holdings we are looking to either sell or wind down, and I don't have any update specifically to CitiFinancial.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, John, you mentioned that your &#x2013; that you continue to be focused on the events in Europe. It looks from the disclosure in the slide deck today that your net funded exposure in the GIIPS countries has not really moved very much from the end of the first quarter. I'm just curious, given that one of your large competitors did sound a bit more cautious on Europe this quarter versus last quarter, have your unfunded exposures in Europe, given that they are larger than the &#x2013; than some of your competitors, have those come down over the course of the past three to six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you compare the information on 30 &#x2013; page, yeah, 36 is where we've got the GIIPS; then 37, the slide following that, I believe that we actually give you what the current unfunded commitments are for the GIIPS countries. And, I believe the unfunded commitments actually increased by maybe $1 billion over the course of the last three months. But, again, all of this is well within what we believe is our risk appetite for these countries. And, you'll also notice that, when you look at the GIIPS, the funded credit exposure, the total current funded exposure actually came down by about $700 million or so. That's largely due to trading assets and AFS exposure. The funded credit exposure was flat, but I think if you look at the table, we give you the components of the exposure broken out between sovereigns, financial institutions, and corporate and what you'll see is that, while the exposure remained flat, there was a change in mix so that more of that flat exposure now is directly related to corporate customers. And, again, this is where &#x2013; we're in the business of serving our customers in those countries. And, we want to make sure that we are there for our client.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add one thing. We've been cautious on Europe for the last 18 months and maybe some of our competitors are just catching up to that cautiousness. And, by the way, it takes a long time to bring exposures down. When &#x2013; one thing that John said is really important; when you look about &#x2013; think about Europe, you've got to separate out the multinationals that are all over the world and some of them higher quality than their host countries. And so, our exposure reports try to break those out as much as possible but we're on top of this constantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And, John, just a follow-up on the DTA question. You mentioned about $0.5 billion of the DTA benefit this quarter came from the purchase of foreign NOLs. Is it your expectation that you will continue to purchase those foreign NOLs or is that a more episodic event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Actually, what I thought I said it's a balance sheet adjustment for purchases of NOLs that we had done in the past. In other words, we had in the past....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...purchased some foreign NOLs; we didn't pass the benefit through the income statement. So, we had an increase to deferred tax asset and then a deferred liability, not deferred tax liability, but an unearned income liability, sitting on the balance sheet. And, we just don't feel that that's something that we need to have at this point in time. So, we just took the opportunity to reduce both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for the clarification there. And, then finally, it sounds like you've got a similar heightened confidence of operating leverage trends within the North American GCB and I'm curious as to how much of that is driven by the relatively strong performance now and it sounds like you expect it to continue in the third quarter in the mortgage business versus some of the other businesses within North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good question. In the past, we had said that we expect to be &#x2013; have North America at sustainable positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...I think that, given where mortgages are, we're likely to have positive operating leverage in North America now in both the third and the fourth quarter, although I have to admit that going into next year then those elevated levels of mortgage sales will give us some difficult comps that we'll have to take a look at.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. John, just a quick question on the North American consumer; what we've seen the last couple of quarters again with the reserve release, you guys again have been fairly conservative as the coverage ratios remain very strong. I'm just thinking as, particularly with the card business being a big bulk of the reserve release, it seems to be either at or past more normalized levels, if you will, whereas the consumer mortgage or retail piece seems to be trending now more at stabilized levels. So, how should we think about the magnitude of reserve release going forward as we &#x2013; as you balance between the card improvement and more stabilization on the consumer side of mortgage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I wouldn't sit here and start forecasting where we're going to be as far as loan loss reserve releases in the future. I can tell you that both of our card portfolios in North America, both the branded as well as retail services, the credit trends remain very positive. And, our view is that you should continue to see improvement in the level of NCLs and in the NCL rate in both of those portfolios through the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so, at this point you're not thinking necessarily any <mark type="ph" /> necessarily (93:42) change near term in terms of the pace, what we've been seeing the last couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to get into a quarter-by-quarter pace, but you should anticipate that NCL rate coming &#x2013; still declining in both portfolios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then just separately, you guys put out the statement on the Moody's downgrade. Just how should I think about &#x2013; with the ongoing de-leveraging on the debt side, your comments previously about spread margin, how should we think about that financial impact at this point? Has it become more significant at this stage of the game?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I lost the drift of your question but....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...try one more time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; with the Moody &#x2013; the recent Moody's downgrade, you put out a statement challenging that downgrade from your perspective. In terms of how that has drifted &#x2013; how the rating agencies have drifted over the past year or so, it appears now that we're now likely to see a more meaningful impact at this stage. But, I'm just trying to think how I weigh that downgrade or where we've come in the last 12 months relative to your ongoing de-leveraging efforts and your comments related to spread and margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I &#x2013; actually, I think one of the things that you could take a look at is take a look at some of our bond &#x2013; our cash spreads and how they have performed. If you take a look at our 10-year rate or our five-year rate, I think what you'll see is that if you go back to February when Moody's first &#x2013; the day after Moody's announced that they were going to downgrade banks and then take a look at how our bond spreads, our cash spreads have performed from that day, the day after the initial announcement to the day after they finally then announced the actual downgrade, our bond spreads have actually improved. And, I think that that somewhat speaks for the way that the market is looking at the strength of our balance sheet. They can see the capital. They can see the liquidity. They can see the improved risk metrics. And, I think that that's a much bigger driver of our bond spread at this point in time than the Moody's rating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add to that. Ultimately, bond spreads are going to be influenced by 7.9% Basel III capital now, going higher as we said going forward. It's sustainable to earnings. Slides 7 and 8, I think, are really important. They talk about the earnings power of the company and the markets know that sometimes more than people who analyze these things from the outside do and I think that's going to have a bigger impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's a fair point. And, I just was more saying I think the longer-term debt has widened a bit over the last couple of months and that's what I was more focused on in the short-term cash spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, to the extent that you look at what's happened with the long-term debt, and I tend to look at it from Moody's announcement to post Moody's to the final Moody's announcement and then during the last couple of weeks. During the last couple of weeks, our bond spreads have widened a bit but I think that that's much more a focus as to what was happening in the market from a euro point of view as opposed to a Moody's reaction.</p>

          <p>Thanks, guys. Just a couple of questions to clarify; on expenses so it sounds like <mark type="ph" /> NGT (97:35), the North America positive operating leverage should still be achieved by yearend and, if anything, actually third quarter now and you feel better about. And, should we still expect Latam consumer to continue to provide positive operating leverage? But, then Asia sounds like might be tougher, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. And, then GTS, you still feel that the positive operating leverage is achievable going forward? And, obviously S&amp;B, it's going to be dependent on the market and how much rightsizing you can achieve and how quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think those are all fair comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And, then in terms of the margin outlook that was helpful to hear that stable from where we are today to 81-ish. But, just on the NII, maybe I missed it; should spread income also hold up, or should there still be a natural drift lower because of the run-off portfolio lower for longer? How should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you've got that pegged as well. We're still &#x2013; we're going to continue to see NII under pressure as we've got some of the higher yielding portfolios continuing to run off, and the benefit that we should be getting would be from things like the TRUPS redemptions and the lower level of long-term debt as we replace a lot of those funding costs with deposits. And, you've seen our deposits have a nice steady rise over the last couple of quarters including this quarter where we've been able to grow average deposits and end-of-period deposits at some fairly healthy rates.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A follow-up on the margin; you said the margin should be stable at these lower-than-expected levels. But, if the rates stay this low, how much more drag might there be to NII or the corporation as a whole, say, over the next one or two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if the NIM stays at roughly that &#x2013; let's call it 2.80% as opposed to 2.81% but &#x2013; and anything like that, we're still looking to see the loan book continuing to grow and so it may be at lower &#x2013; at a lower near &#x2013; lower NIM, but we still see overall nominal margin dollar expansion. I don't know if I answered your question, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it differently. What inning are we in for the pain from this low rate environment? I don't think you or anybody really expected a 10-year rate to be this low, and global rates are also low. So, have you adjusted to this? Or, if the 10-year stays down at this low level, do you have to revise your revenue expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Revenue expectation this year, five years from now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Over the next one to two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, unless you know something, I don't see long-term rates going up for the next one year or two years, especially from everything I see going on in Europe. Frankly, the only place of growth we see is the emerging markets. So, our revenue expectations are very realistic that we're going to have low interest rates, long period of time, definitely short end but also at the long end for the next year or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, then as relates to emerging markets, I was a little surprised too that you said on the ground you feel better about emerging markets over the past few months, and you've highlighted many secular trends. Do you also feel more positive from a cyclical standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, the cyclical standpoint comes completely from the list of policy actions that have been taken and they have not worked their way through yet. And that's an important perspective to have in mind. The other is that as I said these emerging markets, both the business people and governments, act faster. They try to fine-tune their economies to changes, and the big change here was the European picture. While some of them anticipated, not everybody did, and they're doing that as well. And so, as I say, we just feel better about the environment in total. They have a plan, they're acting on it, and I think we'll start seeing some results. Obviously that's not only true on a secular basis but we think that it's got a lot of merit on a cyclical basis as well. Having said that, Europe still continues to be an issue and it's going to be the dominant factor, affecting all economies.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then last follow-up, what signal would you rather send; John said expect revenue headwinds for Asia and you're saying you feel a little bit better about the opportunity. Is this a signal that you, as a firm, you're sending is to be cautious with Asia, don't mess up because revenues are slowing? Or, is the signal that, hey, don't miss out on the opportunity; things are better than people realize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the signal is very clear. I think what John is saying is that there are some specific issues in Asia at this point in terms of our consumer business. It's Korea, it's Japan, it's investment sales and that we want to remain cautious with respect to all of those. The signal both John and I are saying is, when you cut through those, look at the underlying purchase sales, credit card volumes, what we see on the ground, we like that.</p>

          <p>Great. This is John Andrews. As I did the calculation just now, this is my 65th quarterly earnings call in an IR capacity, so it's with a sense of relief that I say, if you have any follow-up, feel free to call the team. Otherwise, I look forward to continuing the dialogue with a lot of you in the future in my new role. Thank you.</p>
