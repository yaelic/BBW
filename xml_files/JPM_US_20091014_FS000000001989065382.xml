        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to JPMorgan Chase third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I will now turn the call over to Mike Cavanagh, CFO of JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead, sir</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining Jamie and I. We'll go through the usual slide presentation that's available on the web. I just refer you to slide 20 which gives the usual forward-looking comments disclaimers for read at your own leisure, and so with that, let us get started on the overall results on slide one.</p>
          <p>The highlights here, so we had $3.6 billion of net income in the quarter. That's earnings per share of $0.82 on revenues of $28.8 billion. I won't spend too much time talking about where the results came from here, because we'll go through it business by business, but obviously it was very great strength in the investment bank and strong performance in the asset management commercial bank and retail banking businesses as well as very strong results in our corporate investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>The backdrop again though is credit cost remained elevated and you are going to see that by line of business, various degrees of flattening in charge-offs or slowing pace of increase, but nonetheless, continue to be at very high levels. We added $2 billion to the consumer credit reserves, though to bring the total credit reserves to $31.5 billion, which is obviously a very strong number both for the firm and for each line of business. I'll point that out as we go through overall reserve to loans for the firm of 5.3%.</p>
          <p>Capital, very proud of the capital level of the company. Tier 1 common through the retention of those earnings grows through $100 billion to 101, with a Tier 1 common ratio then of 8.2% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.2%. Obviously, very, very strong capital levels.</p>
          <p>Slide 2 has everything I just described on it. So I'm going to skip that and take us to slide 3, the investment bank. So here let's walk through the results in the investment bank. You see the circled number, the net income of $1.9 billion on revenues of $7.5 billion for the business overall. I'll just make one clarifying statement upfront that a couple of the items that you all have been focused on in the past together had an immaterial impact on the overall profits, the combination of two items.</p>
          <p>One is the tightening of credit spreads, spreads on JPMorgan's name and counterparty credit spreads, DVA/CVA as it's known, netted together for a modest net negative, and then we had gains of approximately $400 million, mostly realized on those legacy leveraged lending and mortgage positions, mostly leveraged loans.</p>
          <p>So moving through with putting that aside, let's just move through the underlying real dynamics of the business. So Investment Banking Fee line, $1.7 billion, up a bit year-over-year and obviously off some from the record quarter that we had last quarter, second quarter where we booked something like 2.2 billion of investment banking fees. We maintained the #1 year-to-date rankings across all the major capital raising categories so the Investment Banking franchise is doing quite well and continues to do so.</p>
          <p>The Fixed Income Markets line revenues of $5 billion, and that obviously has those gains on leveraged loans that I talked about bringing the total value of the leveraged loans now carried on the books down to a market value of $2.2 billion or carried at about less than 40 cents on the dollar. That's a 26% reduction from last quarter, so we're likely not to be talking about that any more from this stage. And then strong performance across most of the other products really in the Fixed Income Markets area.</p>
          <p>Equity markets, similar story, $941 million worth of revenues in equity markets, particular strengths ongoing in the Prime Services segment there.</p>
          <p>Last thing I'll comment on in the Investment Bank is credit costs. You see credit costs of $379 million over on the left and the explanation there is that that is charge-offs of $750 million, partially offset by a release in allowance related to particular loans that got marked down in the quarter for which we previously held our marks in the form of reserves. That's just a geography swing leaving us with well marked on a net basis between reserves and marks on those loans. But that was a release of 371 to get you to the 379 net number. Overall, though, leaves us with 8.44% at the end of the quarter of reserve to loans there.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Retail Financial Services on the next slide, some of the drivers here, top half of the page is the deposit-taking side, the Retail Bank. Here as we said, I'll just point you to the circled number, average deposits, $339.6 billion, up obviously versus a year ago, given the Washington Mutual transaction at this time a year ago. And declined as expected by about $8 billion from last quarter, as we let high cost Washington Mutual CDs, one-year CDs are rolling off mostly in the third and the fourth quarter coming up.</p>
          <p>Everything else in the branch production side, we'd say we still have underlying good growth in the retail banking franchise, inclusive of WaMu, and away from WaMu as well, and the WaMu integration continues to go quite well with the last conversion happening in a couple of weeks here. So everything healthy and on track in the retail bank.</p>
          <p>Consumer Lending side down at the bottom of the page, total firm-wide originations and renewals of credit totaled about $140 billion in the quarter and 46 billion of that is what you see down in the bottom of this page in the retail side. That's 37 billion or so of mortgage loan organizations, about flat year-over-year and down a bit quarter-over-quarter. Remember, the real dynamic in that business is our exit of the broker channel in the past 12 months, helping drive some of those numbers, replaced by activities more directly originated by ourselves.</p>
          <p>And then the next is auto originations, you see about $7 billion of auto originations. We've done well in terms of market share in that business in the prime side and particular strength this quarter with the Cash for Clunkers program.</p>
          <p>So moving to the next slide, slide 5, for the income statement for Retail Financial Services, we'll just take this in two pieces. So if you see in the middle of the left-hand side, the retail bank, on revenues of about $4.6 billion, up substantially from a year ago given Washington Mutual in particular. We had profits of 1.043 billion in the quarter. So, very profitable business in Retail Banking consistent and up a little bit from last quarter.</p>
          <p>And then the other side of RFS is Consumer Lending at the bottom of the page and driven by the very high level of credit costs that I'll go through in the next slide of $3.8 billion, which includes some additions, about 1.4 additions to loan loss reserves. We ended up having an after-tax loss of about $1 billion in Consumer Lending.</p>
          <p>So moving to the slide on the credit portfolios in Home Lending, let me just talk through that for a second; so here &#x2013; slide 6 this is, I will just start on the upper left with some the overall commentary here.</p>
          <p>So as we said last quarter and then a month ago at a conference, we continue to see initial signs of stability in the consumer early-bucket delinquency trends. We're just not ready to declare that that's a sustained trend, but it is continuing to be what we actually observe.</p>
          <p>Another overall comment is that as far as the impact of foreclosure moratorium, the trial mods which we've been very active in doing, and just the overall extension of processing of REO through the courts, those things are obviously having an effect on overall delinquency percentages and stats, but just wanted to make it clear that we're doing everything we can to stay on top of the income statement, taking recognizing losses through charge-offs and adding to reserves without regard for the impact that those factors would be causing the overall delinquency stats.</p>
          <p>So with that moving over to the left-hand side, you see the actual charge-offs for the quarter in the circle there. That totals up to about $2.1 billion this quarter across these three portfolios, down a touch from last quarter. So charge-offs themselves actually stable quarter-over-quarter, but obviously at a very high level, which is driving the business to the after-tax losses we saw.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side then in outlook, I won't go through these piece by piece, but it's unchanged. Looking ahead to what we see, we're not changing any of these numbers and obviously whether we advance to these levels is going to be a function of whether some of the early-bucket delinquency trends that we described continue or not.</p>
          <p>And then the final important point on the purchased credit-impaired loans we acquired from Washington Mutual; it will be about $150 billion or so that we wrote down by $30 billion through SOP 03-3, at the time we did the transaction. Overall that portfolio is behaving in aggregate as we expected, but we measure impairment at sub-portfolio levels for purposes of accounting impairments and so as we look at the prime portfolio &#x2013; not Option ARMs, just the prime mortgage portfolio &#x2013; we see some weakness. We obviously measure that in terms of expected lifetime losses on that portfolio and have added $1.1 billion that is put on the books in the form of loan loss reserve as opposed to an incremental mark. So that is 1.1 billion of the 1.4 billion loan loss addition in RFS or in Consumer Lending in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So with that, moving on to Card Services on slide 7, you see as expected and unfortunately, a loss of $700 million in the quarter. That is fully driven by the continued elevated credit costs, high credit costs in the quarter, basically coming in consistent with what we talked about last quarter. So the charge-off rates on the Chase portfolio, the legacy Chase portfolio versus &#x2013; as opposed to the runoff WaMu subprime portfolio, Chase portfolio 9.41% charge-off rate circled there down at the bottom on the left up from 8.97 last quarter, trending towards the 10% plus or minus that we talked about last time for where we would head by the end of the year. I'll get to outlook commentary in a minute. And we bolstered reserves here by about $600 million.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, the dynamics here, we continue to see end of period outstandings circled at 144 billion, trending lower from the year-ago and last quarter and that's the factors we've talked about before: backing away from balance transfer business on our part in the marketing side together with lower actual consumer spend on their cards, the lower charge volume, as well as the charge-offs, all driving outstandings down, which puts pressure on revenues.</p>
          <p>And then the other piece is sales volume itself. You see circled $78.9 billion. Excluding balance transfers, that number is down 6%. So it's down year-over-year but we think we're actually holding our own and doing well in terms of share of spend, but the overall market we believe is the factor driving the 6% year-over-year decline. And that, obviously, factors into the revenue side. So that together with the credit costs gets you to the loss in the business. Obviously, high level of stress on the losses in the Washington Mutual portfolio, and so losses in this business we expect to continue as we said through next year, no different from what we said before there.</p>
          <p>On the Commercial Banking business, page 8, here you see profits of $341 million, up 9% year-over-year. Continued good dynamics in this business. Obviously, credit trends are up but revenues are up year-over-year largely due to the impact of Washington Mutual. But at $1.5 billion that along with very good expense management gives us the earnings power to absorb a more normalized credit environment. So you see on the credit costs line, total 355 million of credit costs; that's on higher charge-offs. You see circled down on the left, 111 basis points of charge-off rate for the business, up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but consistent with what we've talked about. In this kind of economy, these portfolios, credit is going to normalize. We end the quarter with more than 3 &#x2013; at 3% reserve to loans which we think is very well reserved for the business.</p>
          <p>Next, on Treasury &amp; Securities Services, slide 9, profits of $302 million, which is down both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Liability balances are down and assets under custody up a little bit versus the prior year. But the revenue side, down 8%, with the big driver being declining revenues in the security service side, the custody and investor services business and that's abating levels of activity in the securities lending business together with overall lower liability balances in that business. So, a disappointing revenue decline in WSS [Worldwide Securities Services]. TS down a little bit on the revenue side and that drives the overall profit number of about $300 million in the business.</p>
          <p>Asset Management on slide 10, net income here of $430 million, up year-over-year 23% on revenues of $2.1 billion which are up 6% year-over-year, and you can see the spread across the various businesses, Private Banking, Institutional and so forth. Really continued to do well in the business here. Assets under management, $1.3 trillion. That is all the market level impacts on the business together with nice positive inflows of $113 billion for the past year and continued inflows of about $34 billion in the past quarter. Investment performance continues to be strong and that, of course, is the necessary ingredient in this business so overall, things continue to be doing well in the Asset Management business.</p>
          <p>And then lastly on the income statement is the Corporate segment. I will spend a minute on this. Page 11, so breaking it up into the pieces you see in the box in the upper left, the net income box, so net income of $88 million in private equity. That's on revenues of $155 million. The first time we've had some positive valuations in private equity in a little while.</p>
          <p>The next line is important. That's Corporate. That's everything else inclusive of the Treasury business and the corporate investment portfolio. Here obviously a very strong $1.3 billion of net income. A couple of pieces there that are noteworthy. One is noninterest revenues of $900 million after tax and that is primarily related to trading gains in the investment portfolio. Think of that as positions we own that aren't available for sale accounting. On those, we had a separate increase in the OCI account of about $3.7 billion after tax in the quarter, but this is what runs through the P&amp;L because it's mark to market. That $900 million is obviously a very strong number in the quarter. And the secondarily it's the benefit of the net interest income on the larger AFS portfolio which is appropriate given where we are in the balance sheet demand from clients as well as the low interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>So what I'll say here is obviously the $1.3 billion number is high here for the profits of Corporate. We see that coming down to something more like 500 million plus or minus after tax positive in the next quarter or two, and beyond that, it will drift lower to a more modest positive as we get to the middle and then through the end of next year. Of course, a caveat that that is subject to the volatility of one-time items, but that's the dynamics of Corporate.</p>
          <p>Capital on page 12, you see, again, what I said up front. We have $101 billion of Tier 1 capital &#x2013; Tier 1 common capital that is, 127 of Tier 1 capital up strongly versus last quarter and obviously for the point I made about the improvements in OCI, tangible capital is up even more to the tune of the $3.7 billion after-tax improvement in the AFS portfolios, which we still have. Capital ratios at 10.2 and 8.2, we think are very, very strong and on top of that obviously the great strength and the earnings power of the company and the 31.5 billion of reserves.</p>
          <p>So let me now just spend &#x2013; wrap up the quarter and talk about outlook on slide 13. To just make a few points. Many of this is familiar to you, but obviously in the Investment Bank, we are seeing great results in the Markets businesses and we don't know when but we would just make the point that revenues in the markets, fixed income and equities we would expect to normalize over time as condition in the markets and customer activity levels stabilize. We don't know when but that's just a point we would make about the strength of the results in the Investment Bank. Looking backwards, we were very strong first three quarters of the year obviously.</p>
          <p>On the Retail Financial Services side, nothing different here. We've covered this and it's unchanged. Obviously the consumer lending business will remain under pressure and a loss maker so long as credit costs remain at these kinds of levels.</p>
          <p>On the Card Services side, let me just say that the outlook for as we now look into say what we can see into the early part, maybe the middle of 2010, we'd say Chase portfolio net charge-offs of plus or minus 10.5% or so highly dependent after that on where unemployment and the economy goes. But that's as far as we can see. And just in terms of some noise in the numbers, in that there will be a swing between the fourth quarter and the first quarter as the payment holiday we did earlier in the year runs through the loss bucket. So that will actually depress fourth quarter loss rates abnormally to 9% plus or minus. And we'll get to the other side of that in the first quarter of next year where it will be 10% &#x2013; 11% plus or minus. But the underlying dynamic is the advancing towards 10.5% as a true core number.</p>
          <p>WaMu losses as I said in the runoff portfolio, nothing different here, trending higher and continued pressure on the level of outstandings in charge volumes, translates into the picture of the card businesses as we said, loses money for the foreseeable future on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Commercial Bank, nothing different about our commentary here. We expect credit to continue to weaken but we feel very strongly reserved and the business is positioned quite well and healthy.</p>
          <p>Unchanged commentary on Treasury &amp; Security Services and Asset Management. Private Equity, we don't know. It will just be a volatile line. We have $6 billion of capital deployed that we hope to make a return on but we can't predict quarterly results.</p>
          <p>And Corporate is as I just described. 500 million plus or minus, subject to one-time items in the next quarter at least, maybe two.</p>
          <p>And the final comment on outlook is obviously if the economy weakens from here, we could need to do additional reserving. We are likely to do additional reserving if the economy actually weakens from where we are currently running.</p>
          <p>So finishing the quarter and now just hitting quickly before we go to Q&amp;A on a few key topics. On the capital planning side, just worth making the comment that obviously the 8.2 and the 10.2 capital ratios are very strong. We think we're &#x2013; there's a lot of dialogue obviously out there about potential for changes in regulatory expectations in terms of capital and liquidity and our point would be that we feel very well prepared to handle whatever comes along on that score but details obviously for all of us are to follow on that score.</p>
          <p>And then the dividend comment, no different than what I said a month ago at the &#x2013; at a conference which is that it's a Board decision and when we are confident that the economy doesn't have another potential leg down in it which looks like to us in all likelihood a peaking and then a decline in our actual credit costs, charge-offs coming down, as well as external factors like peaking unemployment and as a external factor, that at that stage, we would likely make a single significant move initially up in the dividend to something in the range of $0.75 to a $1.00 per year from the $0.20 level we're currently at. And from that point forward, we feel comfortable with our 30 to 40% payout rate of normalized type of earnings. And if we're lucky, that first significant move could come sometime in the early part of 2010, but that requires the economy to stabilize as we've talked about earlier.</p>
          <p>Update on some of these consumer initiatives. Obviously you saw us in some of the Treasury Department statements making significant strides in modifying mortgages. We think that that's the right thing to do and are actively engaged, 262,000 mortgages modified. Early days to tell how successful those actions will be. The only point I make is that it's not a delayed &#x2013; negative delayed P&amp;L impact for us. We are staying on top of, as I said earlier, the credit and &#x2013; credit cost impact, we believe, of having the modification program at the level that it's at. Still the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>On overdraft fees, again, we're doing the right thing for the customers, we think, given how they're behaving and how usage of debit cards has evolved so it's the right thing to do. It will cost us some money. We don't really know and we don't have final rules from the government on what they're going to expect the industry to do, but if nothing else were to change, i.e. consumer behavior, which it likely will, we can see that be something that could cost us about up to 500 million, plus or minus after tax in the Retail business, but again, that's a pretty simple number. We don't have all the other impacts that likely come along to say that with any great degree of conviction.</p>
          <p>And then finally, I would just say that despite the challenging environment, you have seen us be very active on the credit card product side. We think we have a great business when you look out several years despite the near term pressures and our eye is on that prize so we are focused on delivering better new products. You saw it in terms of the new affluent card we rolled out in the quarter and the marketing behind that together with some new small business products and as well the Blueprint service to help our clients manage their borrowings better that was highlighted in an ad in the papers today.</p>
          <p>So feel very good about our-just an example of how we're staying focused on investing in all of our businesses despite again the challenging times and the earnings power of this place, and the capital strength allows to us do that. So with that, that's all I wanted to say up front. I'm sure there is questions that you want to ask us beyond that. So with that, I will turn it over to Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski [BAS-ML]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First thing I wanted to do was just make sure that I correctly balanced the &#x2013; what I think was still a cautious tone on credit and reserve building in the press release, the comment by Jamie that we really haven't seen the &#x2013; whatever stabilization we have seen last long enough to be confident that it's lasting. With on the other hand, the comment that I think you might have made to the press this morning and forgive me if I didn't get it right that you still think that the end of the reserve building period is near and I just want to understand the thinking that goes into all those comments</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the point is that subject to the economy stabilizing and these trends continuing, which we just don't know &#x2013; that is the point. If that were true, we are getting near the end of reserve building. But we don't know, and we have to remain cautious of what does happen from here. And if things worsen, we may need to do more reserve actions and that's the message. Not really different from what we said last quarter actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And in terms of the gains that you saw, that you pointed out both through the P/L on the corporate side and the AOCI swing, which was pretty significant, can you give us a sense for how much of that might have been actual realized gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The preponderance of it is unrealized, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously all the AOCI &#x2013; there was a few hundred million dollars of gains that were realized related to the AFS portfolio and the rest were unrealized values.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then another question just on the WSS unit within Treasury &amp; Security Services that you referred to, I'm just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on what's driving the contraction in those spreads there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's largely customer activity levels and change in appetite on products, but I think that's one business where we'll have to look and see how the rest of the industry performs when we see some other results to get a firm conclusion there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that. And then just one final question on cards. You note that the managed margin actually bumped up by, I guess, close to a percentage point to about 910 basis points. Are you still looking for the regulatory changes that kicked in to cost you ultimately about 0.5 billion? I think that was the number that you had outlined.</p>

          <p>Our last number was 500 to 750 million after tax, plus or minus obviously. And again, all other things staying the same which we just don't know and it's obviously hard to see given everything else that's going on in credit.</p>

          <p>So let me just &#x2013; this is Jamie. Let me just give you a little more on card. The card business is going through a substantial adjustment, and we know that we have visibility to early losses next year. So we know we are going to lose a lot of money next year in cards and it could be north of $1 billion in both the first quarter and the second quarter and that number will probably only start coming down as you see unemployment and charge-offs come down. And the UGAS stuff is a static analysis. We think it will cost that kind of number, but it really does relate to how everybody else in the marketplace reacts.</p>
          <p>You have to do a better job underwriting up front and you have to do &#x2013; if you want to main your clients &#x2013; a better job, I'm going to call it marketing but things, rewards, services and things like that to grow the business. So what we're doing in the card business is we're really looking past 2010, and we've asked the people in the card business to build new products, great new products, clear and simple marketing. To do it where we have competitive advantage. We have competitive advantage on the cost side. We think we have competitive advantage in the brand side. We have competitive advantage because of our retail distribution, and we think we are going to come out of this as a slightly smaller business, because people are going to cut back credit in subprime and places they can't manage the risk properly, but we think it will be a great business coming out of that, but you really won't see the results of that until 2011 and 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First one for Mike. Curious about interest rate positioning and then the thing that brought the question is if you look at your consolidated average balance sheet, the yield on your long-term debt came down 51 basis points this quarter. It's only 209 basis points. I'm just curious if we're looking at a net yield or do you have a significant amount of floating rate debt? It's 270 billion strong, but it's an amazingly low number. It's helping to support obviously the net interest margin. So curious on how you're positioned in this incredibly low rate environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess we can follow up afterwards on the debt question, but generally looking ahead, we &#x2013; and holding aside the Investment Bank, which obviously has its own dynamics that aren't net interest margin related. And what we do in the investment portfolio which is a deliberate decision about how we position the company which we've been open about. The rest of the businesses will run at relatively stable dollar margin spreads, pressures being actual runoff of some of the consumer portfolios and general stability in the rest of the portfolios, on dollars of margin and close to the same in percentage terms. The overall company has9 a lot of other factors that go into it, but the real dynamics there typically run through the investment portfolio and the investment bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you said you wanted to follow up on the long-term debt one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, yep.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and maybe while we have Jamie there, too. Look, you've both commented on some of the regulatory changes that are coming, but I'm just curious on the ones that you might think could have the most impact, because cards had a legitimate impact on how the business is managed, but between the formation of the CFPA and the potential changes in the over-the-counter derivative land, are those the two that are front and center given your comments on how you feel about your capital ratios already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the capital is a little different, because you are reading around the world, people talk about higher capital liquidity and market and risk and size and God knows what and changes in accounting and all that; we're very well positioned for that. We've got plenty of capital. Remember, we have now double the amount of Tier 1 common that was required in the SCAP [Supervisory Capital Assessment Program] test and all that. So &#x2013; but you are right. The two main regulatory issues front and center are derivatives and we really don't know how it is going to turn out.</p>
          <p>We hope it turns out in a rational way, which is we've been a proponent of getting most of derivatives into &#x2013; over-the-counter derivatives into a clearing house, but we don't think they should be forced into an exchange. And there should be room for over-the-counter with proper &#x2013; and you always read about they don't have capital and they're not regulated and all of that is just untrue.</p>
          <p>Over-the-counter derivatives if you are doing it through a broker-dealer, which is regulated by the OCC and the Fed, had capital and requirements and counterparty credit requirements, and reporting requirements and we think it's important that that business be allowed to exist so you can service your customers properly. We don't know how it's going to turn out yet. It's flip-flopping all over the place and with all forced on an exchange, yes, that could have a material impact on the business, and on a lot of companies in America, because I think that would change the way people have to do business in that area.</p>
          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Agency again, that, everyone acts like that is a given that will happen some way. I wish it weren't. I thought we had a chance to streamline, strengthen and simplify our spaghetti regulatory system and instead, we're making it more complicated and more litigious, which over time I think will be more damaging to our country than not damaging.</p>
          <p>We are in favor of consumer protection. We just don't think that's the right way to do it. If you have to have a consumer protection agency, the most important one which will affect the long-term health of the business will be if you have proper settle preemption of states, and you could draw a scenario where if every state had its own rules and its own requirements and its own disclosures, how are you going to run call centers? The disclosure forms for documents are going to be even longer and more confusing; litigation will be higher and remember, all of that will be paid for by the customer. So one of the great lies of this whole thing is that it won't. Anything like that will be paid for by the customer and we don't know how it will turn out yet. We'll see.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I hear you there. I have more faith on the derivatives side, too. Mike, maybe last question. Just a quickie. I know it's also an involved question, but could you comment on the impact of the falling dollar, both on the balance sheet and income statement side on the quarter. Does it do much, or do you run much of a hedge?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, it looks like you continued to buy securities this quarter. Just wondering if you can give us highlights of your philosophy approach to building the securities book when loan growth for the industry is obviously not there and how do you think about the rate risk associated with the growing investment book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me get this. So we, remember using &#x2013; growing your balance sheet in the investment portfolio is just another way of utilizing your capital and managing interest rate exposures and other exposures. But it is true that over time we built up that portfolio. We do it to make money. That's what we're here for. We're a profit enterprise, and we do it to balance off other exposures. When we create deposits, we have to buy longer term assets and things like that.</p>
          <p>Our interest rate exposure in a very simplistic way &#x2013; and we do disclose this in the 10-K. I don't know what the number is today, but &#x2013; 10-Q, but it's going to show for a 100 basis point, one-time move in the curve it will cost us $1 billion dollars. We don't look at it in that simplistic way. We look at actually a whole bunch of different scenarios to make sure this company is &#x2013; so we have a mismatch of $100 billion and that's really simplistic. We move that around pretty quickly so you shouldn't assume it is going to stay in a position like that. But we make other decisions, when we want to buy mortgages, what is the mortgage basis, what are the other scenarios that we're protecting against.</p>
          <p>So we don't take a tremendous amount of risk. We did see an opportunity in the last six months to put on some assets at good spreads and the people in the investment office were allowed to go into credit products and some trading product because we're being paid an awful lot of money to do it . And remember, that's what we're here for, not just to be simplistic. Mike said that that number over time will come down, because the portfolio will come down and the capital will probably be used elsewhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Kind of a related--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But remember, you don't lose it all, because your capital doesn't go away. You still get to do something else. It really depends on the decisions that we make going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the same philosophy, hedging the MSR as the bias on rates is up over the next few years that same investment office has an integrated view about how you're hedging the MSR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The MSR, as you know, is generally, is short duration, short volatility and short the mortgage basis which is mortgage spreads against swaps or treasuries. And the general premise is that you're hedged against those things. And even when you're hedged, you're going to have a lot of volatility, because remember, you're hedging against a model. So you are going to always have some volatility. There are occasions where we use the MSR to take the position you want to take on mortgage basis, volatility or duration and the real question is, what is the cheapest way to do it? So the folks in the investment office have the authority to do that if and when we think it's the best way to do it. But for the most part, you are going to be hedged those three things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it is integrated with the rest of the view of the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In card, any idea what the impact of payment holidays and other deferrals and modifications in card are having on delinquencies, and is the payment holiday something that you would do again potentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're not going to do it again. I don't think you are really allowed to do it anymore. Mike said it is going to reduce the charge-off rate by 50 or 75 basis points in the fourth quarter and increase it by 50 or 75 in the first quarter. Obviously, we think it's net present value positive, and we probably won't do something like that again. A whole bunch of other numbers get affected but we try to adjust for all of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But beyond that, there are other modification discussions and deferrals and re-aging that's going on in card?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The standard. Obviously there's more because you have more things in work out and more problems, and recovery rates are at 5%, not 15. There are other things happening in card. Card is having a tough time. So like I said, we are going to take this opportunity to build a great business.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question. The WaMu CD runoff, Mike, should that help the net interest margin at some point going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. A couple questions. One on just the NFS changes that you made and just how you think through managing the business for that. I thought when you bought WaMu, one of the opportunities was to raise the cross-sell and as you were doing that, NSF and things like that would come down. I'm not sure if you are making these changes ahead of cross-sell improving, or if there's another opportunity for you to morph the business line to get to the ROAs that you were hoping with the change that you're making.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basic questions is NSFs are coming down, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you bought WaMu you had indicated that you had expected that you we're going to be doing that given that California is a pretty high NSF market and that you were going to be making up for that ahead of time with cross-sells increasing. I am just wondering, have you gotten to the cross-sell piece part or target that helps you reduce NSF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason &#x2013; remember, one of the things you do in a merger, is you have to also merge the product sets. You have a change in the products and how they're being used. We've also had a change in customers and how they're actually using the products and stuff like that. You are seeing both those taking place in the WaMu branches. And the cross-sell is doing what we expect to do. We are adding the people in the branches and the marketing and I think we are at the top of what we want.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the conversions we will get the new products in. That's on its track as it was with Bank of New York and Chase before that on the introducing other products and think of whatever happens on fee side as independent, but we're doing both &#x2013; we're doing both the right way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the NSF changes that you're making now should have an impact on the ROA in the business, no? Or are you going to have any offsets?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The real NSF changes we are going to be making &#x2013; that we announce will be sometime in the first quarter. We're going to have opt-in and a new set of products and no more than three a day and a whole bunch of different things and that's really the details really being designed now and think of that as a first quarter item.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I personally don't think there will be a lot, but it is not a static &#x2013; Mike gave you a static number, $500 million, plus or minus. But it's not static. How do customers really use things and if everyone else does it, can you change your pricing a little bit so my guess is, you will get back some of it but not all of it</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Did you test it before you came out with the numbers though? I would expect so, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We will be testing some of that, but the answer is no.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then warrants, just how do we think about that process and how that is going to evolve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in the hands of the government so obviously, we're awaiting what they choose to do. I think they're just trying to get their process down to be a universal one and hopefully they get that rolled out publicly soon. But that ball is in their court.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't affect our company at all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, and then just two other quick things. One on trust business. How do you think about the normalized range for the trust business? I know back a couple years back you had target ROAs and pre-tax margins for the different businesses and it seems like TSS is running way below what your goals had been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our goal is exactly the same as what it was before, and I think it was supposed to be a 35% margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, 30, 35% pre-tax margin. We've put more capital on the business. So on an ROE basis, it's a different ROE. The pre-tax margin this quarter was 26. 31 last. So there's nothing wrong with that kind of pre-tax margin target for the business over time, Betsy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>And then just lastly, on normalized outlook &#x2013; normalized earnings for the overall company. How do you think through what your franchise should be generating over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not going to give you a forecast, but I think Mike was saying that the ID, we wouldn't expect to earn on these levels on a normalized basis necessarily and that Corporate line is going to come down from 1.3 billion to 800 to 500 over time depending what decisions we make. Card, we don't know yet.</p>
          <p>So you all &#x2013; we have seen a lot of the analysts do some really good work on normalized earnings and they're kind of all over the place. But if you want to think ahead on the company a little bit with almost $32 billion reserves, whether that number goes up a little bit or whatever, you know when things normalize and whether that's 2011 or 2012, it's going to have to come down to 15, or 12 or 10. So you know you have that. And I don't &#x2013; not that we could set earnings but you also know these other businesses, some will go from losing money to making money. So the underlying earnings power of the company is very powerful. And that's what we tried to build all the time, more branches, more bankers, more clients to drive that number in 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. You mentioned the $500 million &#x2013; was it after-tax or pre-tax, and is that the total amount of your overdraft fees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's after-tax and it's just an estimate of what changes might do. It's a very static number. Maybe we'll try to get more information on it later. But it's just a very rough estimate because we knew you'd all be asking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's simply related to the overdraft fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the changes in the policies in general, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And loans were down about 5% linked quarter, 16% year-over-year. Is that supply or demand, what are some of the ins and outs there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, consumer portfolios with the &#x2013; you've got runoff portfolios from Washington Mutual in Credit Card and large ones in Retail, and obviously some tightening up of underwriting standards in those businesses generally. So expect that at the origination levels, that for a period of time here we're going to have downward pressure on those balances. We're in the business of making loans against our underwriting standards today and so it's active supply meeting demand on that score.</p>
          <p>On the commercial side, commercial bank, you've seen a little bit further decline of loan balances down a few billion dollars to 102 or something like that this quarter and that's more &#x2013; it's a little bit of everything, but it's demand, clearly, because we see extended credit lines utilized at their lowest levels of all time. So you can see a swing in those kinds of numbers as soon as confidence returns in our commercial clients and they have some use for that money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you seen any tick up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Corporate Banking, the investment bank, it's mostly corporations going to the market and paying down their loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the loans in the investment bank are down from 90 billion to 60 billion over a year, and that was probably more than we expected but to be expected.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give any more color on your trading which is a lot greater than I think a lot of people expected? Your trading revenues are kind of flattish linked quarter, but your trading assets are down and VAR is down. So is all your trading benefit through client flows or wider bid-ask spreads, or what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, VAR is a good one-point measure but part of VAR is going down because you are starting to drop off some of the more volatile time periods that were in the time series, but the trading was strong really across most areas. There's a lot of client flow and spreads are still higher than they were at the bottom. So they're not nearly as high as they were after the crisis, but they're coming down a little bit. A lot of very good client business and some good trading around that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Last question. This is the first phone call since you had the change in the management of the investment bank. Clearly, your investment bank is doing well. The question is, is this a good time to change the management when everything seemed to be going right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I guess &#x2013; I guess you don't necessarily make what you think the management changes which are going to be for the next five to ten years because you think you are having a good quarter or a bad quarter or something like that. In fact, very often you get caught doing it at the wrong time. You can't do when it's a bad quarter. It won't look right and you just try to figure out what the right thing to do for the long-term health of the company and so I don't think it relates at all to whether you are having a good quarter, a good year or a bad one.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions. My first is on the supplement page 16. It talks about some the changes you that made in terms of your inputs for your evaluation on your mortgage business, and I wanted to know if you could talk &#x2013; give a little more color as to what the inputs were, how things have changed. The last major change it looks like you made was in the fourth quarter of 2008. How you see the housing market; it looks as if California might have turned down again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the way to look at it, the model is always being adjusted and so you are always updating it for home prices, housing turnover, pre-payment models, and you do it at a very detailed level. You do it differently for 4.5% mortgages than you do for 5.5 and high or low LTV and stuff like that. That's just updating constantly and sometimes those model changes all things being equal have a benefit and sometimes all things being equal have a negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate how that's constructed. I just wanted to get more color from you as to, is there anything in the U.S. housing market that you see differently on a regional basis improving or not improving, or is it rates driven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was mostly lower housing turnover and lower pre-payment rates. Remember we also make judgments on whether those things are going to continue regardless of what's in the model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Would you go one step further and comment on the California housing market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the housing market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know the data as well as we do, and you have seen, again, the numbers and of course, you dig into them. You can always question them and &#x2013; but that in half the markets in America of the major MSAs, we have seen a stabilization, in fact a little bit of increase the last couple of months, but call it stabilization of home prices. That was more true for lower priced homes than higher priced homes, but it also happened in places where price is down dramatically and where prices weren't down dramatically. And obviously Florida is still bad. Parts of California we're actually seeing some improvement. We have seen those improvements in MSAs where foreclosures are a high percent of sales and we've seen them in MSAs where foreclosures aren't as high as percent of sales. So I would agree with you. There's a lot of distortion in that number, but all things being equal, it's a good fact not a bad fact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, and then just one point of clarification. Mike, when you talk about the commercial portfolio and 111 basis points of charge-offs, I was unclear as to where you thought that was going to go? Is it stable at that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, trending a little higher. And remember, so it's the same message as we continue to see &#x2013; our reserves are probably good, but you probably have continued pressure on charge-offs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the great things about that business and I'm going back to the old Bank One days when 60 or 70% of the revenues were loan related and now it's more like 40 or maybe even less percent loan related. So, here we have a commercial bank having a very good return in a very tough time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And they've done a hell of a job controlling their credit losses and of course we know in tough environments they're going to get worse, but they've been far better than you might have expected even up to now in this type of environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well positioned, too, right? Great State of Texas</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we've been very careful in commercial real estate, so that's $12 billion and though losses are 2.3%, we expect those to go up. We just don't think they are going to be a dramatic impact on our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Would you comment more broadly then, the last question on timing of commercial real estate, if it's been Waiting for Godot, when you think it affects the industry? Do you have derivative exposure, meaning derivative to someone else's real estate exposure? And just comment more broadly on that and that's my last question, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as to derivative exposure, we have lending exposure I just mentioned in the commercial bank. Obviously we have some in the investment bank. But we wouldn't put those in the material kind of category where it makes us that nervous. In commercial real estate, the values have already dropped, and it's going to be recognized over the next couple of years in people's P&amp;Ls as people <mark type="inaudible" /> and take writedowns and can't refinance properties and stuff like that. So we believe you will see several hundred additional smaller regional based banks go &#x2013; not make it. But there's also going to be a lot of capital eventually be coming into the real estate business and people try to recapitalize and buy properties at good cap rates. It could be an opportunity for us. Not a negative over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was hoping to just flush out some comments with respect to the delinquency trends in home lending. I guess you kind of talked to stabilization. Yet on slide 17 in the slide deck, it looks like all those lines are going up. I guess it could be the discrepancies between percentage delinquencies versus dollars delinquencies as portfolios come down, but can you maybe talk to that and also if you can expand in terms of what impact or quantify what impact foreclosure moratoriums and modifications are having on overall mortgage delinquencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Clearly on the overall 30 plus delinquencies, that's where you get the distortion as things stay in buckets longer. So I won't try to take that number down too much. And you see that really in both of those buckets so in percentage terms on 17, you do see those effects rolling through. On a dollar basis, it is stabilization that we're seeing across those portfolios and again, it is part portfolios coming down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the thing is, the stuff that is coming in the front end and is going bad for the first time, that is where you are seeing stabilization, and then the actual roll rates as those deteriorate over time. And we try to adjust &#x2013; on the delinquency side, we keep all mortgage modifications in delinquencies throughout the trial process. That's actually driven up our delinquencies not down, and Mike you may remember, if you would give an estimate what that number was. I'm going to say it was something like 20%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. 20 to 30% higher, depending on the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then with respect &#x2013; you mentioned reserve releases in the investment bank, is that just attributable to markups in leveraged loans and it flows through that line, or I guess more clarification on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No that's in the credit &#x2013; in the total provisioning line, we took $750 million worth of charge downs. So carrying value of loans written down by $750 million but on a  loan-by-loan basis, many of those loans entered the quarter already having reserves up against them. So on a net of reserves basis, they were already on average carried at, say, 60 cents on the dollar. So it is just a geography swing. We like on a particular &#x2013; this is hypothetical, we like 60 cents on the dollar and we just have a charge-off event. So we charge the carrying value down by 40 cents and release the 40 cents of reserves that we had. That's all running through the credit cost line. It's a release of allowance for loan losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just lastly, I mean &#x2013; obviously bid-ask spreads in the fixed income market have been extremely wide and I'm sure this quarter benefited from that, but I guess it feels like it's maybe narrowing at the point. Can you talk in terms of how that's trended over the last six months and at what pace and kind of how that plays out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's different for every single product so it's hard to say. But if the benchmark was one before the crisis, it's got as high as six and it's come back to two. But it's really different for every product and one may have been unnaturally low and it may never come back to one. But obviously &#x2013; I mean competitors are back, which I think is a good thing for the industry. So, there's just much more competition today and people competing both for the flow and reducing spreads.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Guys, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're starting to get the pay criticism thing really heating up again in the press and I don't suspect that it's necessarily going to go away as these bonus numbers kind of pile up through the quarters. How does this affect your thoughts on if there's some more controversy and some more political pressure? How will that affect your discretionary decisions on pay as you head into the final quarter of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just draw you the big picture. If you look at what the FSA has spoken about or the Financial Stability Board and we don't yet have the Fed &#x2013; the Fed or the Treasury are going to put out their own guidelines, but most of those guidelines that are global, if you look at the pay policies of JPMorgan Chase, we already follow them</p>
          <p>We don't have parachutes or change of control or special severance packages. We already pay people a substantial amount of their compensation in deferred comp and stock, or as restricted stock or options. We already have claw back for &#x2013; I'm going to call bad behavior and things like that.</p>
          <p>We've already asked the senior people at the company in the operating committee and the executive committee to keep a lot of their stock that they ever get issued to them as long as they have their jobs so they become substantial shareholders over time. We've always looked at long-term sustained performance realizing that the rising tide lifts all boats and the sinking tide can sink all boats. But we've looked at the contribution people make to help building a great franchise at JPMorgan; and that includes recruiting, how they treat clients, systems, not just financial results. We maintain those standards and we think we have done it right and fair. We are going to continue doing what we are doing. We think industries have to pay for performance over time and we are committed to treat each individual properly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. I know you are probably tired of this question, but you have mentioned in the past that you have a preference for &#x2013; correct me if I'm wrong, share repurchases over dividends and you seemed to go out of your way to mention the kind of dividend outlook and I didn't hear anything about buybacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just mention one other thing about comp because it hasn't been about the &#x2013; we also have claw back the operating committee far in &#x2013; we can claw back for almost any reason from the operating committee members, so.</p>
          <p>And dividends, we want to give clarity. We get asked a lot of questions. We just wanted to give clarity about dividend. Obviously shareholders relied on it. Going into a bleak environment with the potential that it was going to get even worse, the first goal became to protect the company, but once we're convinced that that's gone we're going to obviously want to re-establish the dividend.</p>
          <p>We've always said about stock buybacks is that's an opportunistic thing. We buy back when we think it's cheap or it's the best thing to do with our capital and we are not going to buy back when we think the stock is expensive or we have better uses for the capital. It will be unrelated to dividend, because the dividend is a very long-term decision you should make to your shareholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I was wondering &#x2013; I know that as we look at the overall numbers, they can be a little confusing as to any pointing to the economic outlook, but as you kind of get the data firsthand from people that are running the businesses that are dealing with the small business &#x2013; smaller businesses, mid-sized businesses and consumers, I mean, what does it tell you about economic outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, what we see &#x2013; you actually all see pretty much what we see, and there seems to be stability in the environment in terms of consumer spending, confidence. In terms of delinquencies, a little bit of improvement in home price. Those are actual data and that can be forming the base of a recovery or not. But we're not going to spend a lot of time guessing about that. The only thing I can say anecdotally which we do get very consistently now is that business, small business, middle market, large corporate, are kind of poised and waiting to see that the recovery is taking hold because they do have plans, expansion plans and growth plans and to me it would be a good sign if that's true because maybe people get a little more comfortable and start taking a little more risk and making more investments in the future.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Just a somewhat related, you made a lot of announcements in new products in the like in the card business recently. Can you talk a little bit about how aggressive you are willing to be from a competitive standpoint there given the weakness &#x2013; relative weakness of some of your competitors, and are there other businesses that you see where you can do the same sort of thing?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first thing is to get our own model right, our own products and the services and make sure we adjust to the new laws and things like that. If we think we have that right, yeah, we could be very aggressive on the marketing side. We're willing to make real investments in our business once we're convinced that we're building the right kind of business. So our marketing budget so far for 2010 in Card is up by several hundred million dollars. It's not down. But we'll spend that money when we actually feel we're going to get a good return on it.</p>

          <p>Almost every business is making investments. Investment bank is still making investments in Asia and prime broker and systems and commercial bank is building in the west coast, California, Atlanta, Washington, Florida because of the WaMu acquisition. Retail is still opening branches and <mark type="inaudible" /> the branches. TSS is still running products. Credit Card is adding products. Asset Management is both adding products and adding bankers. So almost everywhere the underlying subjects that drive growth, banker, branches, systems, products; that we're still doing and we've never stopped.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. A couple of questions. On the loan loss reserve, could you just clarify. If you build the reserve and find, let's say in 2010 or 2011 that you don't need a substantial portion of it, will it be available to repatriate into earnings? Because I've heard both views from various regulators.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is, under current accounting rules, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, the mortgage mods, could you tell us has the process smoothed at this point? What the pipeline looks like and how long do you think it's going to be to get that pipeline fulfilled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is just growing pains in these processes so we obviously have been very active in getting modifications started. I would say one of the things it is still early to see how effective people are in making their payments, which is obviously one important thing. But other issue there is just people complying with all the terms of what is required under the government's guidelines in terms of amounts and types of documentation before it can be declared. So there's still I would call those growing pains in the process. It's a little early to really say that it's stabilized and worked through. A lot of energy going into it. Adding a lot of people to it, us and across the industry.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Mike, do you see this as something that is going to be permanent in the business? I mean, is this an emergency measure that two, three years from now will be over with, or is this something that you guys are going to have to live with and to some degree or another permanently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The right way to look at it is it is so large, the problem in housing today, that we certainly hope there is nothing like this ever again. We've always had workout departments and default departments, the REO departments and just &#x2013; prime delinquencies are ten times what you would have expected &#x2013; or losses ten times what you expected in almost any environment. It'll come down to a much more normal thing eventually and you will have delinquencies and charge-offs and foreclosures that are just much smaller than they are today. It will probably never be this big again in our lifetime. Once we work through what we have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That sort of leads into the final question. On the 1.1 billion addition to the allowance for prime mortgage in the purchase portfolio, in looking at that subgroup, was that mainly an issue, an unemployment issue, an underwriting issue? Can you add any color to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's no different than the &#x2013; it's the same factors that drove through from originally subprime into our own prime portfolio causing dynamics that look the same in terms of weakness in prime. It's home price declines and stress of unemployment, even reaching up into a prime segment to put stress on losses.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anyway, in regard to the 1.1 billion reserve build for the impaired loans, is there any carryover to your own portfolio where you haven't changed your guidance? I guess, I'm just really wondering what the difference is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's no difference. Our guidance is, I think, 600 million in quarterly losses or five or six or whatever is on that slide for prime which is consistent with what we've said before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I know it's consistent, I'm just wondering why the--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why the difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why there was a change in one and not in the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No particular explanation on that one. They're just different portfolios, and we've been watching them and standards of looking at them are a little different between the two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if you exclude the 1.1 billion which hopefully is totally nonrecurring then your only other major reserve build was in the credit card portfolio and so two things related to that, number one if the loan loss in the card portfolio is going to be down in the fourth quarter because of the holiday you mentioned and then up again next year, is this reserve build now for next year so there shouldn't be any further reserve building in the card portfolio? I guess I'm wonder how to think about those factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it really relates. Remember, in general &#x2013; I'm going to oversimplify this. In general, you are forecasting forward based upon assumptions where your losses are, and that's where the 12 months, the nine months plus distressed and that's what your reserve is. So the hope is what you said is true. But for that to be true you are going to have to see a little bit of improvement in charge-offs. If they stay where they are, we don't need to add to reserves. If they start getting better, yeah, reserves, in effect, you'll have too much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess where I was going, it seems like there shouldn't be much reserve building going forward because you have taken care of the cards going into next year and the 1.1 billion is nonrecurring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We hope you're right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the last question is, related to the reserve I think you said, Jamie, in answer to an earlier question that the probably normalized charge-offs are in the 12 to $15 billion area and under &#x2013; go  ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just saying that the 32 billion will come down a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's reserves too, Ron.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one of the real criticisms of this whole thing is that a lot of the policies are all pro-cyclical and one of them is reserving. So we went from 7 billion in reserves to 32 and it is going to go way back down again. And it's going to go back down again in a predictable way once you start seeing improvements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know where the level is going to bottom out at, but we hope it's less pro-cyclical a regime once we get to that point in the cycle anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and you mentioned that right now, under current accounting you could bring it down. Do you see any changes being talked about on the regulatory or accounting front that would change your ability to bring down the reserve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not really when it comes to loan losses. If I was the regulators, I would change loan loss reserving to not be so pro-cyclical.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right I think we would all like that, but I'm just wondering if there's anything...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you all analyze and back out loan loss reserve additions and reductions and so would I. We're not fooling anyone with these things, and so I hope there might be some more rational changes and they're going to do it. If they do it, it might very well lead to higher on average reserves</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a quick follow-up question on mortgage banking. You had the negative revenue in the mortgage production line item, just wanted a little more color if you could on rep and warranty reserve. I'm sure that is what was impacted in the number, and any sort of gain on sale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That was going back to the point of making sure we're taking the P&amp;L impact early of some of these problems, getting our re-purchase reserves fully caught up and consistent across our portfolios was a several 100 million impact that swallowed up the production revenues in the quarter. It won't run at that high level. So the re-purchase reserve, looking ahead, it will still be something though.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but let me ask an administrative question. What were your troubled debt restructurings at the end of the quarter? I know you usually put those in your 10-Q, but I'm wondering if you have that information as of September 30th, and if you do, what are your expectations for those balances going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe it's going to be flattish to where it was but you will see that in the Q, and that's a little bit of a function of you need more time for things to move into that categorization, like something like six months after the reserve is &#x2013; after the restructuring is on the books and performing and then it will move, but we can follow up with you off-line on that one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. If we look out over the next year or so and we continue to get this rebound in the economy and the markets, you are going to have the combination of both very strong capital, which you talked about with respect to dividend and buyback, but also very, very strong liquidity. I guess I just wonder how you think about using those two from an offensive point of view because as we all think about normalized earnings many years out, there's a lot of stuff that is going to happen between now and then. Does it mean you are going to have very strong loan growth at some point? Does it mean your deposit rates can be much lower than others? Can you have so much liquidity? How do you think about that eventually working itself through the income statement over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, it's no different than anything we've said already. We've long had a management philosophy of running a company across all these businesses that have very strong liquidity and very strong capital, thinking of it as a strategic imperative. So I'm not worried about the &#x2013; where you can run your returns if you lightened up on that because we're just not going to. We think we can always run these businesses for a good return with that kind of approach if we do everything else right with the kind of franchises we have.</p>
          <p>And so really what that translates to is just the investments that Jamie referred to earlier, the consistent &#x2013; that advantage that we have is we don't get distracted and continue investing in growth across all of our businesses through thick and thin and when things are a little thin, often it's the best time. That's why we're actively doing all the things to inject growth into the existing businesses and hopefully you see that in healthy growth when you go out two, three, five years across all these businesses. That's the &#x2013; where it translates into P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just separately, on page 12 you reiterated the impact of consolidating off balance sheet assets would reduce Tier 1 capital by about 40 basis points. I guess one, has there been any talk about pushing that out or changing what the implementation would be and two, if we continue to get credit stabilizing and improving is there an opportunity to use reserves that you currently have versus having to increase reserves which I think is driving most of that 40 basis point drag?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are cutting out a little bit, but I think in terms of the FAS166, 167 stuff is expected January 1st, 2010, that's when we expect it. Obviously, until that data is here, the authorities there could just decide to delay, but that's not our expectation. Point is, for us, it's very manageable at these ratios.</p>
