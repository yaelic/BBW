      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to each of you. Thank you for joining this conference call during which together with Didier Valet, our CFO and also our Business Head, we will presenting you with Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale's third quarter results. And more broadly, we will take a look back at the first nine months of 2011 and discuss the outlook in an environment which had dramatically evolved over the few past months.</p>
          <p>Slide three, if we go to see a summary of the third quarter, let me just remind you that when I presented you with our half-year results early August, the level of political and economic uncertainty around the Greek sovereign crisis was already high. But events have turned out to be even more turbulent over the summer than we could have foreseen.</p>
          <p>In this difficult context, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale has been adapting to the new environment and has been accelerating its transformation. The group's third quarter net income of &#x20AC;622 million shows resilience with business client revenues holding up in the face of market turbulence. In this quarter, we have also a few exceptional items and overall impact is not significant but which nevertheless we will comment because some of them are relatively important to understand.</p>
          <p>The first among then there is the positive contribution, plus &#x20AC;542 million after tax, from the revaluation of the group's own financial liabilities which reflects, as you know, the increase in the usual spread of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. That's a positive.</p>
          <p>Against this positive accounting item at NBI level, the negative impact of the Greek crisis is felt in two ways. Through the rise in the provisioning rate to 60% on the group's holding of Greek government bonds, the impact is minus &#x20AC;239 million after tax and through strengthening of provisions at our Greek subsidiary Geniki, which has the effect of raising the NPL coverage ratio from 63% in Q2 to 70% at the end of September 2011.</p>
          <p>Further, we have this quarter decided to impair the good will on some of the consumer credit subsidiaries of our Specialised Financial Services division, the impact of which on group net income is minus &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>As you already know, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale's exposure to GIIPS sovereign risk is low. During the past few months, we have halved actually this position since the beginning of the year. And we have decreased further this exposure in the last few months. Currently, the residual exposure to the five GIIPS country on the banking book stood at the end of October at just &#x20AC;3.4 billion. I will come to that more in detail.</p>
          <p>During the summer, we also accelerated the transformation started back in 2010 in order to adapt to the new environment. Determined actions on deleveraging have yielded concrete results and significant results. &#x20AC;10 billion of legacy assets were disposed of between the 1st of July and the 1st of November, with a very limited impact on the NBI, minus &#x20AC;121 million and taken together with other actions by SG CIB, we achieved an overall &#x20AC;40-billion reduction in our funding needs roughly two-thirds of our 2013 targets.</p>
          <p>In view of higher levels of uncertainty and recent decisions by European authorities concerning the need for banks to hold additional capital buffers for sovereign risks, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale's priority lies with capital enhancement. We want to be in line with this objective as quickly as possible. The board proposes not to distribute a dividend for 2011 to comply with that, incorporating the dividend provision for 2011 into its capital. The group Core Tier 1 ratio increases at 9.5% at the end of September 2011 and the EBA capital enhancement comes &#x2013; and it's an estimate &#x2013; comes now to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, an amount which the group will cover for internal means over the next three quarters.</p>
          <p>If I turn now to page 4, let's take a look at the group net income, split by business franchise. Here we have corrected for the items which I mentioned earlier, the effect of Greece and the impairment of goodwill as well as the legacy asset portfolio in order to illustrate the underlying robustness of our businesses.</p>
          <p>As you can see, first of all, our domestic and international retail banking activities excluding Greece, have delivered a steadily rising contribution to group net income over the past few quarters. And despite the effects of the political upheavals in the Mediterranean basin and Africa earlier this year, deposit growth is dynamic and we are active in our role of supporting the financing of the economies. The results of our third core business, the CIB division, are influenced by the state of financial markets. Its core results, nevertheless, show resilience over time thanks to our leading franchisers in equities and financing activities, but also because of strong and conservative risk management.</p>
          <p>During the past quarter, we started implementing our first concrete deleveraging actions as I commented in our financing and markets activities. As for our other businesses, Specialized Financial Services &amp; Insurance demonstrates a growing contribution following the refocusing of certain businesses and reduction in the cost of risk and under capital and liquidity constraints, while the Private Banking, Global Investment Management and Services division performance is affected by market conditions because of income from performance fees.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, the group has strengthened its provisioning policy in Greece, both in the retail banking activities and again sovereign risk and you can have on the slide the effects of these two elements. We have also the depreciation of the Greek sovereign debts. You can also note that successful management of the legacy asset portfolio means that it only has a marginal impact on the group results as illustrated on this slide and the recent acceleration of sales of legacy assets has had very little impact on the group net income.</p>
          <p>Slide five; let's focus now on the exposure on sovereign risks. Let's start first of all with Greece. As I said, our Greek government bond exposure in the banking book has significantly decreased over the past nine months and is now particularly low. At the end of the quarter, the exposure stands at &#x20AC;575 million representing an average markdown to par of 60%. The provisioning rate takes account of the third quarter provision of &#x20AC;333 million pre-tax, calculated on a mark-to-market model basis taking account of the bond's residual duration and liquidity.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you here that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale holds only short and mid-term Greek debt and has no post-2020 exposure. Looking ahead and assuming that the Greek bond exchange will go ahead, the provisions booked for a total of &#x20AC;728 million will be allocated to the respective businesses once final conditions for the exchange are established to be offset against the final cost.</p>
          <p>Secondly, let's turn to our retail banking activities in Greece through a policy of restrictive loan allocation and prudent provisioning over the past years. Our subsidiary Geniki has achieved a control reduction of its loan book minus 22% over the last two years, which now stands at &#x20AC;3 billion while at the same time limiting the group's liquidity risks. We aim to continue this process over the coming quarters and as I said, we have enhanced the coverage ratio on the NPL.</p>
          <p>As you can see overall, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale has now a very limited residual exposure to Greece. In the other four GIIPS countries, we do not have retail banking activities and so we will focus on sovereign exposures in the banking book. As you can see, our banking book's exposure to countries are undergoing new restructuring plans, Ireland and Portugal is not significant, &#x20AC;200 million for Portugal and &#x20AC;300 million for Ireland.</p>
          <p>The exposure to Spanish and Italian debt are limited and manageable, as you can see also on the slide, around &#x20AC;700 million and &#x20AC;1.6 billion for Italy.</p>
          <p>The market valuation of the banking book for the four countries at the end of October stood just at minus &#x20AC;200 million below book value. And let me highlight that 39% of the &#x20AC;2.8 billion exposure is maturing in less than 18 months, so we will have a natural further decrease of this exposure with no cost for the group.</p>
          <p>As for GIIPS exposure on the trading book, these are mark-to-market at all times. Net outstanding amounts can fluctuate on day to day depending on customer flows, the most recent figure at the end of October for the five countries, &#x20AC;2.2 billion, of which 1.6 concerns Spain and Italy.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Didier Valet who will give you more detail on the Q3 results. Didier, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, and good morning to all of you. So, now if we turn on page 6, and then have a look to the consolidated P&amp;L figures, you can see that the group net banking income stands at &#x20AC;6.5 billion for the third quarter 2011 and it is resilient in spite of financial market turbulence. There is a 4% increase compared to third quarter 2010, and if we adjust for the revaluation of our debt, that means a reduction of roughly 10%.</p>
          <p>When we look into detail, as we will detail it further, and so you can see that group net banking income is sustained by solid revenues in our retail franchisees and also resilience in our CIB Division despite difficult market condition.</p>
          <p>Turning to operating expenses, you can see that they're under control with the confirmed slight decline quarter-on-quarter and the controlled gross year-on-year, only 0.7% increase on a like-for-like basis. In terms of cost of risk, you can see that there is an increase but I will detail that on the next slide. It is essentially due to the Greek risk and depreciation excluding that, excluding Greece, the cost of risk is stable compared to the second quarter and down compared to the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>As Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned, we did record an impairment of our goodwill for our consumer credit activities, so it's &#x20AC;200 million. And so this led to a net, a group net income of &#x20AC;622 million and accumulated group net income for the first nine months of slightly below &#x20AC;2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page seven, in terms of cost of risk, we can say that the cost of risk excluding Greece is stable compared to the second quarter at 51 basis points. We were at 50 in Q2 and 68 basis points last year. Starting with the French Networks, you can see that the cost of risk in line with the guidance that we set for the full year which was around 40 bps and we are, let's say, at 37 bps in the third quarter, almost stable compared to Q2 and down compared to the previous quarters. Over the quarter, it is important to notice that we have strengthened our portfolio-based provisioning within the French Retail Banking business.</p>
          <p>In International Retail Banking excluding Geniki, you can see that the cost of risk is down at 81 basis points compared to 100 in the previous quarter. This has been fueled by first Russia and with the cost of risk decreased significantly at &#x20AC;20 million in Q3 compared to &#x20AC;41 million in the second quarter so equivalent to 65 basis points in Q3. Also, we've seen a drop in the cost of risk in Czech Republic thanks to certain reversal of provision linked to several individual corporate credit files.</p>
          <p>In Romania, the cost of risk has increased to 315 basis points compared to 252 in Q2 following the reassessment of our corporate credit guarantees. On retail business, the decrease that we've seen since the first quarter of 2011 continues as a number of new entries of doubtful loan is going down.</p>
          <p>Lastly in Greece, as we mentioned at the beginning, Geniki cost of risk increased sharply with &#x20AC;181 million of net allocation to provision compared to roughly &#x20AC;100 million over the last three quarters reflecting a strengthening of the coverage ratio on our corporate exposure. As Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned, altogether, the coverage ratio of our doubtful exposure increased in just one quarter from 63% to 70% in Greece.</p>
          <p>Turning to CIB excluding legacy asset, the cost of risk remains low at 25 bps. The &#x20AC;70 million provisioning set aside in the quarter has been showing more than its 50% by strengthening again on the portfolio-based provisioning. The cost of risk of the legacy assets remain low, at &#x20AC;118 million compared to the &#x20AC;113 million the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>And lastly, in Specialized Financial Services, we've seen the ongoing decrease of the cost of risk confirmed at 137 basis points compared to 156 in the previous quarter. The improvement came both from Consumer Finance and Equipment Finance. Altogether, you can see that the group, during the quarter, have strengthened the balance sheet &#x2013; the quality of its balance sheet by increasing the coverage ratio of its doubtful loans by 3 percentage points from 71% end of June to 74% end of September.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to page eight, and have a look to our balance sheet structure and liquidity and funding. We have significantly improved our liquidity profile in the past years. When we look at the situation income of customer deposits, they increased by 4% compared to September 2010 and by 18% compared to end of 2007.</p>
          <p>This, as we view this also, were in the same period of time, we have reduced significantly our reliance on short-term funding. If we look at the funding balance sheet, new definitions that we present, you can see that short-term funding and interbanking deposit reduced in percentages of the total from 39% end of 2007 to 24% end of the third quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>In term of long-term resources, when we look at equity customer deposit and medium and long-term funding, you can see that that represents three quarter of the total funded balance sheet and they also cover all the long-term assets that we have to fund, so which are long-term assets, so shareholdings and intangible and tangible assets, customer loans and also in securities held to maturity and available for sale securities.</p>
          <p>So, this mean that the short-term funding of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is fully used to fund the trading portfolio related to current activities and also to have some interbanking lending and an excess of deposit to the Central Bank which has strongly increased as you can see compared to end of 2007 but also has slightly increased compared to where we were as of end of June.</p>
          <p>If we turn now to our long-term funding program, we said in September that it has been already fully executed. It was &#x20AC;26 billion for the full year. And in the third quarter, we did issue &#x20AC;4.1 billion of new medium to long-term debt with an average maturity of 5.6 years and at a price of 100 bps above the mid swap. Due to our deleveraging program and our strict management of these resources, we set the 2012 program at &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;15 billion, so half what we have issued in 2011 and part of what we raised within the third quarter is a pre-funding of our 2012 earnings.</p>
          <p>Finally, to be in line with our peers, we have let's say refined the definition of unencumbered eligible central assets and you can see that they amount to &#x20AC;77 billion, stable almost compared to where we were at the end of August and on top of that, it is something that we were mentioning earlier. We have &#x20AC;13 billion of liquid assets which are not Central Bank eligible but that we can mobilize as soon as we can in case of a need.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the performance of the businesses on page nine. Starting with the French Networks which we quote solid commission and financial results during the third quarter. You can see that customer franchise has continued to expand. And with almost 54,000 net current account opened in the third quarter 2011, deposits grew by 5.4% year-on-year and many on the back of an increase in both regulated savings and sight deposits.</p>
          <p>Loan outstanding increased by 3.1%, supported by housing loans which benefited from previous quarter and new production and also by corporate loan demand demonstrating the fact that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale continue to support the French economy. Altogether, the loan-to-deposit ratio has improved being down by 4 percentage points at 126% compared to 130% a year ago.</p>
          <p>In term of revenues, the revenue excluding PEL/CEL and excluding SMC increased by 1.4%. If we look at the personals for the first amount, it is up by 2.3%, again excluding SMC and PEL/CEL. And this is being in line with our guidance which lies 1.5% to 2% growth for the full year for the French Retail banking business. Cost income ratio reached 62.9% and income of bottom line, the contribution increased all the French Networks was almost 15%.</p>
          <p>If we turn to page 10, in International Retail Banking business, we can say that the half robust business model and they're operating in countries with good fundamentals. Starting with loan to deposit ratio, you can see that it has further increased compared to end of June at 98% and it was fueled by a good deposit increase, up 5.5% versus last year and almost 3% versus end of June. We've seen strong inflows in Russia and in Mediterranean basin.</p>
          <p>The cost income ratio is stable compared to second quarter at slightly below 60%. And in term of result, we have seen the first benefit of the merger in Russia. Remind you that we have finalized as a merger from a legal perspective June 30 and from an IT perspective, October 1. So, now we have a single brand in International Banking business which is Rosbank and BSGV, fully integrated within Rosbank organization. Czech Republic has continued to deliver a strong and a recurring contribution and you can see that in other Central and Eastern Europe countries excluding Greece, the contribution at &#x20AC;21 million has also improved.</p>
          <p>So altogether, International Retail Banking business excluding Greece has seen its contribution increase by 14% compared to last year while Greece did weight &#x20AC;426 million on group net profit.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 11 on the Corporate and Investment Banking business. As the market environment has strongly deteriorated during the third quarter, our CIB revenues show a resilient performance especially in equity derivative and in structured finance in Europe, but the low level of activity affects some of the businesses.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, as you can see, and on the slide on the bar chart comparison at the low hand on the slide, with a decline by 30% Q-on-Q, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale does compare well compared to peers especially when you look at the outperformer or best performer. They are more lucrative in the U.S. than in Europe, which seems to have suffered while U.S. market seems having less suffered from the sovereign crisis than European ones.</p>
          <p>If we turn now more into detail to market activities, we've seen over this business line has implemented a rapid and significant reduction of its funding needs during the third quarter as part of our prudent adjustment of our liquidity profile, but also having an effective control of market risk, which has helped to contain the revenue decrease. In term of equity performance, while we faced a certain volatility on correlation as well as putting markets and dividend expectation, the revenue are resilient despite this challenging market condition especially in flow derivatives and we were able also to have a just 23% reduction in our revenues compared to second quarter at &#x20AC;472 million.</p>
          <p>In fixed income, currency and commodity activities, they were affected by the virulent, violent spread widening that occurred across credit assets. For example, the iTraxx main indices was multiplied by two times over the quarter, while the CDX indices increased by 50%. This movement has also been further amplified in Europe by the sovereign debt crisis, which led to some &#x20AC;87 million losses on our sovereign positions with deleveraging and mark-to-markets. As a result, we have seen our revenue down by 70% to &#x20AC;159 million.</p>
          <p>Lastly, with &#x20AC;660 million of revenue, Financing and Advisory result remains solid, driven by core franchises in structured finance like natural resources, infrastructure and export finance in Europe, which have maintained a robust level of activity for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Also, we've seen good revenue activities in leveraged and acquisition finance in Europe. However, capital markets activities suffered from weak issuance volumes but trend most acute in Europe again as exemplified by the postponement of several equity or fee notably in France.</p>
          <p>Lastly, turning to legacy assets, as we already mentioned, revenues turned slightly negative this quarter at minus &#x20AC;37 million. I remind you that we have seen in the third quarter &#x20AC;45 million of gross income of deleveraged, while the net cost of fees has slightly decreased compared to second quarter at &#x20AC;118 million.</p>
          <p>Altogether, revenues have reached &#x20AC;1.2 billion, down 30%, as I said, compared to previous quarter. Core stands at &#x20AC;971 million. The first effect of the expense reduction program launched are tangible as expense declined almost more than 16% compared to second quarter and 14% compared to last quarter of Q3 2010.  In terms of contribution to net income, excluding legacy asset, the core CIB contributes &#x20AC;193 million to group net income.</p>
          <p>If I turn now, page 12 and just have a focus on the legacy assets and what we've done in the third quarter. During the second half, starting in July 1, we accelerated sales of these legacy assets, reducing the portfolio first by &#x20AC;5.8 billion of notional in the third quarter with, as I said, a very limited P&amp;L impact of minus &#x20AC;45 million in revenues.</p>
          <p>And in October, we further reduced this portfolio by &#x20AC;4.2 billion of notional with minus &#x20AC;76 million impact on in term of revenues. This means that the total amount sold and amortized year-to-date, so in the first 10 months of this year, was &#x20AC;15 billion reducing the net book value of this portfolio to less than &#x20AC;19 billion as of end of October.</p>
          <p>This has led us to reduce the liquidity needs of this portfolio. In term of USD, we were able to reduce by or more US$13 billion, since end of June, the liquidity needs of this portfolio, contributing significantly to reduce of liquidity &#x2013; of USD liquidity needs at the group level.</p>
          <p>In terms of dismantlement of RMBS CDOs, we have continued to do that. So, dismantling one CDO in the third quarter, and this is part of the nominal reduction that I mentioned 0and also putting us into position to dismantle partially a new CDO in the fourth quarter, relieving &#x20AC;1.3 billion of Basel III capital at the &#x2013; by end of 2013. Already, &#x20AC;1 billion is almost &#x2013; &#x20AC;0.7 billion is already secured.</p>
          <p>Finally, we continued to add this regular assessment of the portfolio evaluation by BlackRock and you can see that despite the sale completed in the third quarter, we continue to have &#x20AC;1.8 billion of positive credit valuation on this portfolio. We do intend to continue the reduction of this portfolio, and we aim to have lesser &#x2013; around &#x20AC;13 billion by end of 2012 and less than &#x20AC;10 billion by end of 2013.</p>
          <p>If you turn now about to page 13, on Specialized Financial Services and Insurance, so a few words, you can see that revenues reached &#x20AC;850 million in the third quarter, 2.6% versus third quarter of last year. The positive momentum in our Insurance business continues in the third quarter 2011, despite an unfavorable complex of savings.</p>
          <p>Life insurance activities recorded gross inflows of &#x20AC;1.8 billion for the quarter. Net inflows have been hampered by high outflows and were slightly negative in the quarter, minus &#x20AC;300 million, but which is in line with the contracting French market. And when we look at the performance year-to-date, we continue to have net inflows of &#x20AC;1.1 billion year-to-date in France, well in line or above competition.</p>
          <p>We have seen also a good trend in terms of distribution of personal protection insurance as well as property and casualty insurance, showing the synergies that we continue to be able to strike with our retail networks particularly in France, but also, for example, in Russia in terms of personal protection insurance. Globally, Insurance revenues have increased by 19% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Specialized Financial Services, the activities &#x2013; these activities have sustained their performance over the period in a resource-constrained environment with stable revenues. In terms of new business, you can see that we've seen a 9% increase of our fleet under management. We've seen a new business in equipment finance by 4.6%. And in consumer credit card financing, which is one of our major refocusing aim, has increased by 6.9% in terms of new business.</p>
          <p>Globally, Financial Services activities have also improved their use of cash resources by first stabilizing the net outstanding of equipment finance and consumer credit at &#x20AC;18 billion for the equipment finance, down 4%, and &#x20AC;22.3 billion for consumer finance, flat compared to last year.</p>
          <p>We have also launched development of access to external funding sources. For example we launched an issuance &#x2013; bond issuance in Russia and also, we continued to optimize our risk-reward ratio with a more selective origination, which also is part of the benefits of the regional reduction in cost of risk.</p>
          <p>Overall, thanks to the goodwill impairment, the net income contribution of this division has slightly increased compared to Q2 and strong decrease compared to last year at &#x20AC;147 million.</p>
          <p>Lastly, turning to GIMS, in this division, that business holds out in an adverse markets. Starting with the Private Banking business, we have &#x20AC;83.6 billion of assets under management, up 2% compared to a year ago. There was a slight outflow in Private Banking this quarter, minus &#x20AC;0.6 billion. But when we look at the performance year-to-date, inflow amounted to &#x20AC;3.3 billion, slightly above 5% in flow rate which is in line with our peers.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenues, they are resilient, down 2% compared to Q2, 6% compared to last year, with fee and commission holding up well. And it is essentially net interest income that we've seen some weakness.</p>
          <p>In custody, we've seen assets under custody at &#x20AC;3.4 trillion and asset under administration at 421%. And in this favorable interest by context, we've seen revenue up 11.5% at constant scope and exchange rate versus last year and the improvement of the cost-income ratio and certain new mandates which has strengthened the franchise.</p>
          <p>U.S. Brokerage business has benefited from the highly volatile markets, especially in August and in September. And this has led &#x2013; this has led to record revenues up 6% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in Asset Management, we've seen that TCW has recorded positive net quarter inflows for the fourth consecutive quarter, with a net cumulative inflow at &#x20AC;1.6 billion for the first nine months, while Amundi net quarterly contribution has decreased from &#x20AC;28 million last year to &#x20AC;19 million this year, especially as deference fees have been poor this quarter.</p>
          <p>Altogether, the contribution to group net income of GIMS division was down by 25% year-on-year at &#x20AC;60 million, but a slight increase compared to the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Before turning the floor to Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, I have a few words on the corporate center where there was a lot of items this quarter. So just to remind you, the pre-tax &#x20AC;822 million revenue impact linked to re-addition of our own debt which is based on effective refinancing strengths and no longer on CDS indicator which has been too volatile and too disconnected from our effectively financing spread.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you can see that we have impaired our initial participation portfolio by &#x20AC;57 million as of end of September to discount the decrease in equity markets, while the &#x20AC;28 million of systemic bank levies is the quarterly impact. And we have also saw the impact of the provisioning for the Greek levies for &#x20AC;333 million in the third quarter all together, a net income of the corporate center amounted to &#x20AC;58 million at this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, I leave the floor back to Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric for the conclusion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me conclude and turn to page 16. We announced at the beginning of September, as you know, that we would accelerate our transformation to prepare for the new environment and in particular, through actions to reduce our liquidity needs by &#x20AC;75 billion to &#x20AC;95 billion at the end of 2013, out of which &#x20AC;50 billion to &#x20AC;60 billion regarding our CIB business.</p>
          <p>As a result of these actions, at the end of September 2011, our overall liquidity needs were already down by approximately &#x20AC;40 billion. This reduction was achieved through a rapid adjustment of our capital market positions, the accelerated disposal of a sizeable amount of legacy assets, Didier has already commented on that in detail, and we started also to sell on the secondary market some loan portfolios. This figure puts us at close to three-quarters of our overall goal in terms of liquidity reduction for CIB, demonstrating the flexibility of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>When it comes to U.S. dollar funding needs in particular, where our targeted reduction was particularly significant, by the end of the third quarter, we already achieved 80% of the total target announced of $50 billion. Let me also point out that all these reductions have been achieved with a very limited P&amp;L impact.</p>
          <p>Our medium-term strategy now involves the continuation of balance sheet reduction to be realized through further disposals of legacy assets, we've explained what we expect in the next two years, and also, secondary sale of loan portfolios. We will also continue our policy of selective renewals of credit lines and the running off of some activities which are particularly on a risk in terms of liquidity and capital consumption. Through these measures, we will consolidate and extend a significant reduction in funding needs already achieved.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a few minutes to look at our capital ratios, slide 17. At the end of September 2011, the financial structure of the group was significantly strengthened relative to the first of January 2011 under the combined effect of our control of risk-weighted assets and the growth of our capital.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the slide, the capital generated over the nine months period contributes to 98 basis points to the growth of our Tier 1, and Core Tier 1 ratios, based on solid retained earnings, 65 basis points. And as mentioned earlier, our board has given the priority in the strengthening of the Core Tier 1 and priority to be as quickly as possible in compliance with the objectives of EBA and has decided to propose to the AGM not to distribute a dividend for this year. We have also the benefit of the scrip dividend in 2010 and the capital increased reserve for employees.</p>
          <p>Risk-weighted assets are marginally up this quarter by 4.5% at &#x20AC;334.5 billion due to foreign exchange impacts, whereas at a constant exchange rate, they are stable, in line with the group's prudent risk management and reflecting notably the decrease in market risk exposure, minus 4.6%, compared with the second quarter of 2011 and the significant reduction linked to the deleveraging of our legacy asset portfolio.</p>
          <p>Overall, our T1 ratio reached 11.6% at the end of September, and the Core Tier 1 stands at 9.5% up, again, as I've said 98 basis points since the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>The second graph on the slide demonstrates how Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale will meet the new EBA capital requirements through internal means. First, we will need to adjust our current 9.5% Core Tier 1 ratio to take into account the impact of CRD 3 at the end of the year and the EBA methods of calculating Core Tier 1 capital.</p>
          <p>The fact that based on our exposures at the end of September 2011, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale does not need to constitute a sovereign buffer, reflects our very low exposure to GIIPS sovereign debt. These leaves a gap of around 60 basis point to be bridged through internal capital generation and other actions corresponding to supplementary capital of about &#x20AC;2.5 billion &#x2013; &#x20AC;2.1 billion, sorry, &#x20AC;2.1 billion. It's our estimate current &#x2013; compared to the preliminary estimate of &#x20AC;3.3 billion calculated on the basis of the end of June data.</p>
          <p>Based on the Bloomberg consensus estimates on November 1 of our fourth quarter 2011 results and the first half of 2012 results and an assumption of a return to 35% dividend payout ratio on 2012, we showed that our expected capital generation from retained earnings would virtually get us to the required 9% ratio by mid-2012. On this basis, the execution of our already planned deleveraging actions in targeted CIB businesses and further disposals of legacy assets will be sufficient for us to reach 9% by the end of June 2012.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, we announced two months ago that sales of business assets will liberate &#x2013; will free &#x20AC;4 billion of capital by the end of 2013, corresponding to roughly 100 basis point of Core Tier 1 capital. Any sales of such assets concluded before mid-2012 would, of course, provide us with an additional margin for reaching this 9% level. So, clearly, reaching this intermediate target by end of June 2012 will be achieved with no capital increase and will put us fully in line with our 2013 targets of Basel III Core Tier 1 capital ratio well above 9%, again, in 2013.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to page 18 to sum up this third quarter results. With our &#x20AC;622 million of good net income, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale business model has demonstrated its resilience in a highly uncertain and turbulent environment. Our strong business fundamentals underpinned solid revenues and our balance sheet is sound. We have significantly strengthened this balance sheet during the third quarter, showing very low residual exposure to Greece, very limited exposure to GIIPS sovereign risk.</p>
          <p>Our cost of risk is moderate. We have decided to increase the coverage ratio. And in view of the high level of financial turbulence, we are strictly controlling our market risks. Over the summer, we have shown our ability to adapt swiftly to changing funding constraints through legacy asset sales and deleveraging of our CIB balance sheet at a low cost. Our organic capital generating capability is intact as shown in our results once you strip away the effect of the provisioning effort we've made on Greece over the past two quarters.</p>
          <p>During the summer, we announced that we were accelerating the transformation of our group to adapt to the new environment. This means that in the coming quarters, we will continue with CIB leverage reduction, look to dispose of business assets as announced, make cost adjustments within CIB and capture gains in productivity in international retail in 2012, deleveraging the bank with reduced funding needs further and improve its capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Together, with capital strengthening through earnings generated during the next coming three quarters, again, we are thus ensured of reaching the 9% Core Tier 1 capital ratio required by the EBA no later than mid-2012, putting us well back up &#x2013; putting us well on track to reach our Basel III objective well above 9%, and as I've said, without a capital increase.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the Q&amp;A session. Again, with Didier and our business heads, we will answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have a question from Mrs. Delphine Lee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have a few questions. First of all, on deleveraging, is it possible to get some color on the P&amp;L impact? I mean, you have basically deleveraged &#x2013; sold some assets &#x2013; in legacy assets with a limited P&amp;L impact. But maybe just on the rest in total, the &#x20AC;60 billion to &#x20AC;80 billion of risk-weighted assets reduction, if we could have some color on how it breaks down and the impact for the divisions?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on funding, is it possible to get some update on your intergroup loans for Greece and maybe, also the main subsidiaries in CE?</p>
          <p>And finally, on your liquid asset buffer, you mentioned the &#x20AC;7 billion of unencumbered Central Bank eligible assets, but I think you mentioned before that you had &#x20AC;105 billion of liquid asset buffer. Where do we stand at the end of September? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; I will turn to Didier. Let me just comment that, again, so far, really, we've experienced a capacity to deleverage at low cost. We have commented, again, the &#x20AC;121 million for the sale of &#x20AC;10 billion of legacy assets. That's &#x20AC;76 million in October and the rest in the third quarter. It's a very, very limited given the amount we saw on this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Regarding the rest, Didier, can you perhaps give us some figure?</p>
          <p>And then, the funding on Greece, we've maintained a &#x20AC;1.2-billion line. And to the subsidiary, it has not increased in the last two years. On the rest of the Central and Easter Europe, perhaps you can comment also, Didier, and then make a comment on the liquid assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First, regarding the deleveraging P&amp;L impacts, so there was the cost to sell these assets. And then, at same time, a run rate &#x2013; I think this is more your question, Delphine. In the CIB business, we are expecting, let's say, a net gross of total income impact of around &#x20AC;500 million that will be split, roughly, &#x20AC;750 million in terms loss of revenues. And then follow that, we will have a &#x20AC;250 million of cost savings which are, in turn, efficiencies as we've said in September. And also, reduction in bonus, which will be of course not linked to this source of revenues.</p>
          <p>We have not taken into account into account any re-pricing benefits in these assumptions on the reduction of the risk-weighted assets within our CIB. Bear in mind that part of the risk-weighted assets in the CIB reduction, which is liquid assets equivalents, which could be deduction from securitization or risk-weighted asset reduction, would also come from the legacy assets which are not contributed at all in terms of those, let's say, limited revenues and also limited costs.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the funding intra-group, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned the question about Greece. Have in mind that the two other countries where we do have funding from the parent is Romania, where we you remember, there was this agreement in 2008 which led to the crystallization that sealed the funding from the parent whose &#x2013; from the foreign parents to their local subsidiaries. So, they are still relying on funding from the parent.</p>
          <p>And also contrary to what I read in the press, our Russian subsidiaries, also are let's say, getting some funding from the parent, especially, let's say, in Rusfinance and in XBS JV.</p>
          <p>And lastly, on your question regarding the liquid assets, you have that in the footnote. Let's say, in the footnote, we did specify that too much with the old definitions, so not just CIB eligible but also a room of maneuver that can exist elsewhere. The total, let's say, of these liquid assets is &#x20AC;90 billion. The reduction compared to end of June is essentially coming from the reduction that we've made during summertime of our position within capital market activities, which were definitely the type of maneuver that we identify in term of capacity to be nimble in reducing this risk exposure. And also, a certain legacy assets that were, let's say, liquid repayable on the market but not CB eligible have also been sold on the market, as we've shown in the deleverage. And this explained why, let's say, we've seen this figure reducing. But what is the most important is the cushion that we have with CB, which has remained as you've seen stable compared to end of August and end of June.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all. Two questions, if I may. First on Geniki, so I don't &#x2013; well, I just want to be sure to understand why part of the loss is kind of classified as an exceptional item. I understand that increase of NPL coverage, but why would you, I mean, classify this as just exceptional? And still on Geniki, can you tell us about how is deposits are behaving right now? And last question on Geniki, what are your expectations for the next quarter as regard this subsidiary? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, again, what we've just highlighted is that there is an additional, I would say, a provisioning compared with a run rate to increase the coverage ratio, as we've said. And that's why we &#x2013; it's not the full amount that we are considering as exceptional.</p>
          <p>And secondly, as I said, we've been able to maintain in the last two years, a gap between deposits and loans of the same amount, &#x20AC;1.2 billion. And we are, again, very strict in terms of credit origination, limiting that at the very, very minimal level, as well as paying attention to maintain the deposit and we are competitive. We ensure to be competitive in terms of pricing, and may I say that probably, the fact it's a subsidiary of a foreign bank can help in that process. So clearly, that's very &#x2013; that's monitored on a very, very close basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then, what do you expect for the next quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I mean, if you can predict what's going to happen in Greece, but I think that this clearly now, there will be a government which will apply the package. And let's say, we can expect, I think, a still negative result, I would say, additional provision more or less at the same level. We monitor the situation, as I've said, very closely. We have clearly the highest coverage ratio in the Greek banking universe at 70%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. I've got quite a long list, but very small questions, hopefully. The first one is, can you explain why you're not using liability management to boost sort of NC?</p>
          <p>Secondly, the cost in CIB are down year-on-year, but maybe less than could have been the case. Can you maybe explain how you see the flexibility of the cost base or is it due to the fact that past bonuses have not yet been accrued?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, in domestic retail, with slowing economy and, potentially housing market and increasing funding cost, do you think you can achieve growth of revenues in 2012?</p>
          <p>Then, I've got a question on deposits in Q4. To date, can you explain whether the deposits have stopped falling?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on Basel III impact. Given that you've cracked now quite few CDOs, would you care to update us on the impact of Basel III that you now anticipate? Has it changed compared with a year ago? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Michel P&#xE9;reti&#xE9; will comment on the cost of CIB. The rest, I think &#x2013; well, Laurent Goutard, Head of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Network, will comment on the outlook for the French network revenues. I will first hand the floor to Didier on your asset and liability management, deposit in Q4 and Basel III outlook. Didier first.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first on liability management. Let say, we've seen that certain of our peers have done it. So, let's say, we are looking to market evolution, and we'll not mention anything more. It is something that is not also &#x2013; has also to be discussed with regulators.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And perhaps, the deposits &#x2013; in the evolution of deposits, there was a question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question, deposits, Guillaume, was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have we seen further drop in Q4 to-date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, further drop, let' say, as you've seen in French Retail Banking business, let's say, the trend is modestly &#x2013; let's say, extremely slightly down Q3 and Q2. And BNP reported the same impact, as it was essentially linked to time deposits. And I think that in terms of time deposits, we are even better resist, and what they've done in terms of sequentially evolution.</p>
          <p>At the group level, let's say, I think, on the top of my mind, a &#x20AC;8 billion reduction end of September compared to end of June. &#x20AC;3 billion is linked to a exchange rate movement, because we've seen some weakness especially in Romanian leu, Russian ruble and in Czech krona. We have also reduced certain relationship with large corporate in USD, so we've seen certain deposits which went out but, let's say, the lending reduction in profit was more than positive income of liquidity contribution so there was no, let's say, as you say, full in terms of the franchise that we are clearly focusing on.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Basel III on the last point. Let's say, now, it's part of our level, let's say, to achieve this well above 9% by 2013, so we will not provide you a quarterly update. But, let's say, you've seen that most of the time, we had conservative assessments of changing regulation impact and so, we have a capacity to mitigate and to manage this effect.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. So, we've been launching, as early as in June, a plan in order to reduce our cost, there was, first, a lot targeting discretionary costs whereby we've been starting to slash out cost on a series of items such as consulting, such as traveling, such as, also, freezing of recruitment until the end of the year. We are targeting a reduction of cost for next year of something between 5% and 10%. And as you can see on the quarter, our cost have declined by close to 14%. And what we are also working at is adapting our bonus base to the current environment. So &#x2013; and in conclusion, it's a very strict plan of cost reduction for next year and for this adaptation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, clearly on CIB, there will be more to come and there will a flexibility on costs. Perhaps Laurent to complete the set of questions &#x2013; Guillaume's set of questions on the outlook for the French Retail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a few outlook on the French Retail. So far, I would say, we are confident in our capacity to keep a resilient business model in 2012, even if we are going to face increase of funding cost and also, pressure on fees and commission with additional safer implementation. But we are confident, first of all, in our capacity to continue to develop the positive activities and to improve the loan-to-deposit ratio and at the same time, to keep the cost of risks in line with our guidance around 40 or 42 basis points.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Maxence Le Gouvello from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A few question. The first one is just to come back on Patrick's question regarding Geniki. I have not been able to find the NPL ratios on Geniki. So, if you can provide them, it would be great.</p>
          <p>The second one is to follow up regarding Guillaume's question on the French Retail. We saw an increase of the cost base on the third quarter. Part of it, I believe, it's different in term of comparison base between PEL and SMC, but can you give us on the clear underlying basis, how the costs are changing?</p>
          <p>The third one will be on the performances, SGSS, the better flavor between the performance of the custody and the broker activities.</p>
          <p>And the last one is sort of a bit of an update on Lyxor, looking to the significant drop of the asset under management, how is it driven and how do you want to reposition the Lyxor activities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, your last one, how would you want to reposition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, reposition, because apparently, a part of the performance is mainly driven by the point that you are more European exposed than the others. Do you want to change a bit the business mix to expand on other markets or you just say, okay, we'll stay as we are and we just wait for better environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, on Geniki, the NPL rate is 40%, 4-0.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I turn now, perhaps, to Didier on the evolution of the cost &#x2013; if I've understood well &#x2013; of the French Retail business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But, you have the detail, Maxence, on the cost evolution in the appendices. So when you do, for the like-for-like basis, the cost evolution in the French Retail are &#x2013; let me find it, on page 32, are, let's say, 3.3% if we exclude SMC contribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Within that, you should have in mind that we did provide part of the dividend <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:00) so part of the premium which has been agreed with the social unions end of October, so it was in our account in the third quarter. I would say that it is likely because usually, we tend to have a premium, more paying in Q4 than in Q3. And on top of that, let's say, we have also the cost of the investment that we are conducting within the French Retail. As you remembered, to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I guess, the question was the split between Security Services and new hedge. You have on the slides, the performance in terms of revenue. So, Securities Services is up by 11%, 11.5% exactly. Also, because the basis for Q3 2010 was probably a bit low and Brokerage activities for new hedge is up 6%, which is very logical. It's a pure intermediary business with a lot of volumes in the market during the summer and September, so increase in revenues.</p>
          <p>Cost-wise, you see that there is a further cost reduction, first, a cost income reduction in Securities Services, two points after a nice decrease last year. And Brokerage, also, we've been able to maintain cost under control, even reduced them during this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michel then to complete on Lyxor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Lyxor has been somewhat affected by the market environment and the result of a falling markets. But according to our experience, in the last three or four years, we are confident that it should be reverted. And especially on ETF, they should be reverted when the market climb back. And we are confident on the ETF side that we have the right model to continue to succeed as this product, transparent and efficient in index tracking and generates, for us, zero and, for our clients, zero counter-party risk.</p>
          <p>On the alternative investment, it's the same. We've been affected by market conditions. But if we refer back to 2008, we've seen that we've recovered all outflows very quickly and that the model shown by Lyxor is extremely resilient. So all in, we're pretty confident about the relative performance of Lyxor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One last question for you, Michel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Asset impact on Lyxor, asset management was a little bit below &#x20AC;9 billion which was sizeable in just one quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. One last question for Michel. The value at risk has been massively reduced between Q3 and Q4 and &#x2013; sorry, Q3 and Q2. What's, on a normal market, what will be the, for you, the right level of deval? It is something in the range of 40? Or where is the deleveraging? Is this definitely going to be below 40?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In normalized markets, I would say that it should be around 40 or below 40, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just emphasize that, again, we decided to manage this period of time with turbulence, uncertainty with a very, in a way, conservative risk approach and market risk approach. I would like to emphasize that. It is reflected in the value at risk, also the level of stress test. And again, it's a business model which has changed now for more than two years with limited risk in our business. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Pierre Chedeville from CM-CIC Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Some few question. Regarding Greece, your coverage ratio is 70%, which is quite higher than Credit Agricole <mark type="indiscernible" /> (63:03). Just a question regarding this point, because <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:06) says that its recovery rate is quite high. Also but the real estate exposure and the default rate on the real estate exposure is low in Greece because prices remain stable. Do you observe the same thing with Geniki Bank? And what is your recovery rate? And what could be the difference between the exposure of Geniki and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:33) that explain this lag between your coverage rate? And a follow-up question on Greece, what is your breakeven data would say regarding this subsidiary?</p>
          <p>My second question relates to the potential gain on toxic assets. You said that you had a potential gain as of September of &#x20AC;1.8 billion. Since that, you have sold &#x20AC;4.2 billion of these toxic assets. So what is the residual potential gain after this sale?</p>
          <p>Regarding the assets eligible to Central Bank, you gave the amount of available assets. What is the amount of non-available but eligible to Central Bank assets?</p>
          <p>And my last question will be marginal regarding the International Retail business, which is supposed to be a one day, one trigger regarding the SocGen business model, I would say. When we observed the last five quarter, we realize that globally, Africa and Mediterranean basin, are making, I would say, more of 80% of the net income of the zone, I would say, at this part of the original business model. Retail international business model of SocGen is still very resilient, I would say, in tough times while the development in Eastern Europe remains questionable in terms of profitability and in terms of net income.</p>
          <p>So, what is your view regarding the downturn on this activity and particularly, what is your view regarding the evolution of its profitability which is globally, today below 10%? How do you see the evolution of the profitability of this retail activity and the balancing between eastern countries, globally, including Greece of course and Africa and Mediterranean basin? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Jean-Louis Mattei, Head of International Retail comment a little bit broadly on our different entities. Let me just highlight that I consider personally, especially in view of the potential difficult outlook for the Eurozone economies, that it is definitely a key advantage to have strong presence in retail outside the Eurozone. And we still have the capacity definitely to improve the profitability but Jean-Louis will go through the different regions and subsidiaries. Didier will answer your question on the eligible assets and legacy assets.</p>
          <p>On Greece, I'm absolutely unable to comment on competitors. Let me just point out that there has been a law in Greece which was preventing banks to use their guarantees in terms of housing for loans below &#x20AC;200,000. So, that made the capacity to get back money a bit difficult. Again, I can't comment on each competitor. It was a law for all markets. Let's see going forward in the coming quarters how things are moving for each bank. Perhaps, Didier, on the legacy assets first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so, Pierre on the update on the legacy asset, the toxic asset, because you see that we can sell them with a limited impact on the P&amp;L. Just to mention, we will of course provide the update end of Q4, let's say BlackRock is being decided just on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the page 46 where you have the detail, just have in mind that most of the sales that we made in October when the buckets are U.S. CMBS and U.S. CLOs, so this means that the rest of the credit value, positive credit value that you can see has not been impacted that much by the sale that we made in October.</p>
          <p>On your second question, which is what are the order, let's say, eligible Central Bank assets but which are encumbered which have been used as of end of September, the amount was &#x20AC;25 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Louis then, perhaps if you can comment on International Retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just to say that as you said in your question, we don't face any big difficulties in the, all different, say, all the network of the International Retail Banking activities. And you have seen that the performances are pretty good in Sub-Saharan Africa, in North Africa and also in the French overseas territories.</p>
          <p>So, after that your question was about the other areas, mainly Central and Eastern Europe. Of course, I will not comment anymore on Greece. We are facing some big difficulties in Greece and we have a big impact on the net profit of BHFM, but you have seen also on the slide dedicated to the International Retail Network, but we have a twist, of course. The net profit is improving on a quarterly basis and we will continue like that.</p>
          <p>Proceeding to Central and Eastern Europe, we have to differentiate maybe four main risks outside Greece. Czech Republic, definitely some success story and we will continue to develop a very profitable activity in this country. Romania, as it took me straight, said we are still in Romania as of today. Cost of risk which is, like I say, above our expectations, but we will expect some improvement in the future. We have pushes in terms of rebound of the economy in Romania, but there is some positive signals sent not only by the market but also by some rating agencies concerning the rating of a country. So, maybe we will have some improvement in Romania. It will come back on very high profitability as before some years ago.</p>
          <p>After that, there is Russia. Russia, Didier already mentioned, that we made two important steps in Russia: the legal merger in July, the operating merger in October with one unique IT system for the two ex-universal banks. And now we are, as you have already seen, we are starting to increase the productivity of the universal banks. We already announced that we will decrease the staff by more than 2,000 people in the end of 2011 and 2012 and we will continue.</p>
          <p>And globally speaking, in Russia, as you know, the profitability will increase because of it is savings and also because of the evolution of the activity. We are number third as of today in retail banking in Russia in terms of production. And we have now in Russia a very good corporate activity platform with our colleagues from CIB. So we are confident in the future.</p>
          <p>After that there is a fourth area is Central and Eastern Europe which is these small countries. We are in nine small countries starting from Slovenia to Georgia at the Far East. We know that we have to increase the profitability of these countries but you have to take into account that in the most important countries like Slovenia in comparison with others of course, Bulgaria and some other countries, the profitability as of today at a pretty good level. But we need to continue to improve the efficiency of these subsidiaries. We need to gain market share, and we need at the same time to take care of the costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So clearly, if you wish, from a strategic point of view and I can see that clearly it's a pillar for the group going forward. We will be able to improve the performances in the coming two years. There is more hard work to be done in particular in Russia as we said with the productivity gains related to the merger in 2012, the full benefit of synergies between the different businesses. But clearly, in my mind, when I think about the environment and here we need to take a midterm view not just a quarterly one, it is a clear advantage to have the strong presence in these regions. Next questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Thibault Nardin from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. Four quick questions on my side. The first one is on legacy assets. From what I understand, you've sold mainly CLOs and CMBS in Q3. So, mainly low risk-weighting assets. So, my first question is actually if we could have a bit more color on the legacy assets you've sold in October and what would be the average risk weighting of these assets?</p>
          <p>The second one is more like a follow-up on my first question is marginally on ETF. What is your outlook for synthetic ETF in Europe? And would you expect any change in the regulation there? Third question is the view on austerity measures announced yesterday and the impact on the real estate market in France and also your tax rate for the next two years?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on Romania, on the top line more specifically. We have seen a relatively weak revenue this quarter, so again wondering with the, again, lower commission on the FX business and lower rates or is it something else this quarter? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Didier will give you more information on what we saw in terms of legacy. I don't know if we can give you the risk-weighted assets weighting for the sale in October. And we'll comment on the tax rate, Jean-Louis will comment on the top line on Romania. One word on the ETF and then Michel can comment, but as I've been involved, let me say, there is the current debate, I would say, regarding ETF, and in particular, regarding synthetic ETF. Let me just say that in our view, first of all, the risk in physical ETF is exactly similar to synthetic because you have a lot of borrowing, the counter-party risk, which is related to the fact that is collateral, which is lent to other counter-parties.</p>
          <p>Secondly, clearly Lyxor is ahead of the curve. ETFs in Europe are regulated under their usage regulation. We disclose every day, every day the composition of our assets, which are used as collateral. We are very strict in the counter-party risk research edition which is very, very limited. And so clearly, we would not be afraid.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, we would be happy to support any strengthening of the regulation, in line with our own practices. So, from that perspective we are emphasizing on what we are doing, promoting our practice and we'll be very happy to see that as becoming market practice. Michel, again, I think if you want to comment anymore on that. Then legacy, first of all, Didier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Thibault, so on the legacy assets, we sold not many as I said here within CMBS but the rest in the third quarter we sold also RMBS and we cracked one CDO for RMBS. When you say that in term of risk-weighted assets this is mainly assets which are lowly risk weighted, you should bear in mind that especially for the fully rated RMBS and CDO for RMBS it's more through the potential deduction that you have the impact on our common equity Tier 1, that is through risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>And you can see on page 17 of the presentation that the legacy asset portfolio contribution to the inflation and gross of our Tier 1 was 28 bps. It was 15 bps for the first six months, so you can see that this disposal including cracking have generated, let's say, a further, let's say, 13 bps of Tier 1 and 10 bps of common equity Tier 1 in this whole third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Your second question was what is the tax rate. On the tax rate, well this quarter it is higher than what we used to achieve or deliver. Essentially for two major reasons, bear in mind that the 8/22 that the reevaluation of our own debt is taxed at the French tax rate, which is 34%, so well above the normal, let's say, high 20s that we do have.</p>
          <p>And on the other side, let's say, at the group level, it's not in the International Retail Banking, but it is at the group level. Our, let's say Greece liabilities has no deferred tax assets so this seems that the losses that we have in Greece have no tax impacts, where they are, let's say, taxed at zero. Of course, this has led to an important impact on the effective tax rate that you see. We expect for the full year to get a tax rate around 30% for 2011 and going forward to be between 28% and 30% for 2012 and following years.</p>

          <p>Finally, Jean-Louis Mattei on the top line of Romania. A few comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Few comments on Romania. As I said before as you know, we are still expecting a better rebound of the local economy. And in 2011, globally speaking, the net banking income of the bank continue to decrease slightly. At the same times, we are monitoring very carefully the overhead expenses. We decided to decrease the number of staff in the bank and it has been done right now. We will not expect 2012 to get the staff.  And we as I said, we have cost of risk above our expectations for the time being in Romania. Globally speaking, the bank is still profitable and the ratios, for example, cost to income ratios even within this difficult period of time, is pretty good at 56% in Romania.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any last question before we end this session?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Anke Reingen from RBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Anke from RBC. Thank you very much for taking my question. First I have a question on slide 16, and I'm sorry if I'm sort of like going back on the risk-weighted asset debate. But just to confirm, you're basically saying risk-weighted asset reduction of &#x20AC;60 billion to &#x20AC;80 billion of which &#x20AC;30 billion to &#x20AC;40 billion is coming from asset sales, which leaves &#x20AC;30 billion to &#x20AC;40 billion from CIB and this includes the &#x20AC;1.3 billion of legacy assets. Is that correct? And the revenue losses of &#x20AC;500 million you mentioned as, basically, with reference to the CIB reduction, but doesn't refer to the legacy assets?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I just wondered on your dividend policy for 2012. Are we going back to your original guidance, i.e., 35% payout ratio with some 65% stock dividend? And then I wondered, the dividend cancellation for 2011, does this mean there is no &#x2013; you are not paying coupon on some of your hybrid instruments? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Didier answer your question on slide 16. Again, let me emphasize clearly, it's a one-off decision in 2011 regarding the dividend with the idea in this uncertain environment to show that we are able as quickly as possible, I insist on that, to meet the requirements for the end of June. And clearly, we are keeping a 35% payout ratio assumption for 2012 and beyond. Perhaps, Didier on slide 16.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, before slide 16 and on the coupon hybrid, let's say at this stage, there is no reason to change our policy even if the scrapping the dividends is providing us the option not to pay the coupons, while that said, there is no reason at this stage not to pay the coupon on the hybrid.</p>
          <p>Regarding the risk-weighted assets deleverage, yes, it's a &#x20AC;30 billion, &#x20AC;40 billion risk-weighted assets reduction in CIB. As well, let's say, we expect in the recurring way to have this minus &#x20AC;500 million gross operating income. On top of that, and this is the other &#x20AC;30 billion to &#x20AC;40 billion risk-weighted assets reduction equivalent. It's when, let's say, on the contribution that we will lose, will depend on the assets we'll sell in the coming quarters to come. Okay.</p>

          <p>Great. Good morning. I've got three questions. Firstly, just wanted to focus again on the corporate deposit trends. Trying to understand if there were any meaningful trends in recent months. And also in relation to the tenor of those corporate deposit trends, whether you've seen any change in the tenor. And also if you could just clarify if there is any increase or change in ECB dependents in terms of funding?</p>
          <p>Second question was just on CIB, trying to understand the &#x20AC;750 million. If you could give us a bit more color on which types of businesses in particular SocGen is exiting from and which ones it may be more committed to. And final question just on Russia for next year, what kind of cost savings we should start thinking about for 2012 run rate?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Kinner, on Russia and the custody, we will comment in due course. And let me just remind you that we plan to cut the head count by something like 2,000 people. On the tenor and the trend for corporate deposits, as Didier mentioned, we decided to basically, as part of the deleverage exit of certain number of relationship in particular with non-European counterparts and it was effectively on that basis or to some decline under corporate deposits.</p>
          <p>But otherwise, in our retail activities, things are going in the right direction. And a lot depends on our policy in terms of paying. The corporate deposits, they are sensitive to the price and, again, it's monitoring that we do on a regular basis. Sometimes we want to be more aggressive, sometimes less. It really depends but there's nothing really particular to comment.</p>
          <p>On the ECB, Didier and then Michel perhaps we see on the businesses we want to basically reduce our exits.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just to start on the ECB, and to remind you there is two ways to use the ECBs and main refinancing operation and the long-term refinancing operation. We said in August that we used during one week the main refinancing operation. We tend to use more main refinancing operation as a way to get some flexibility and adjustment. I can understand that certain of our peers do prefer to use long-term refinancing operation. But altogether, and let's say, this is exactly the same tool in term of managing your liquidity position. So it's a limited amount. And when I look at say, the Tier 1, and then I'll use the average of French banks and I divide it by four, we are below this one-fourth of the total.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Michel on CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>So, in September, indeed, we announced that we would review a series of business either on the global view or regional. We were targeting business which had lower adherence to SG CIB's core expertise and significant long-term funding needs. So in terms of global business and the review, there are three. We are talking about real estate, financing, aircraft financing and shipping financing. And in terms of regional, it's mostly about LBO acquisition finance, infrastructure finance, export finance in Americas and Asia. And in terms of regional business we are talking about soft commodities financing in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add a little bit on that, it's &#x20AC;750 million we mentioned in term of revenues. So, there is, remember roughly &#x20AC;350 million which is coming from the businesses that Michel has mentioned and there will be roughly the rest that will be split equally between market activities and structural finance activities and financing business. In term of no longer let's say, cut-off businesses but more, let's say, lower consumption of funding and, of course, this will have an impact on the revenue generation of these two subsidies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay what I suggest is that we stop there. Of course, our IR team is at your disposal if you have any further question beyond the ones we answered. Let me just say, in a nutshell, this third quarter as you can see was a very important step towards meeting our objectives, but it's one step. We did a lot clearly but going forward, we will do more. And we will be, again, absolutely in line with the regulatory objectives as I've said without any capital increase. It is very obvious from the figures we presented today.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. Bye-bye.</p>
