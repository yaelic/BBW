          <p>Good morning. My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the conference over to Randy Burkhalter, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Christie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss fourth quarter results. Our speakers today will be Mike Creel, President and CEO of Enterprise's General Partner. Mike will be followed by Jim Teague, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and then Randy Fowler, Executive Vice President and CFO of General Partner will speak last. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management team.</p>
          <p>Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made in this call.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy. Enterprise had another successful quarter to end 2011 setting financial and operating records with our integrated system of assets and an all-time high natural gas volumes, NGL fractionation volumes and fee-based natural gas processing volumes as well as near record liquids volumes. This led to new records for net income, adjusted EBITDA, gross operating margin and distributable cash flow.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we invested $3.6 billion of growth capital to develop midstream infrastructure, primarily related to the Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale plays to serve our producing customers and to accommodate our petrochemical customers and meeting their increasing demand for NGLs as feedstocks.</p>
          <p>We completed two large projects in the fourth quarter of 2011. The Haynesville Extension of our Acadian natural gas pipeline system and our fifth NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu. The Haynesville Extension provides producers access to 12 interstate pipelines at served markets in the Midwest, Northeast and Florida, as well as our legacy Acadian system, and the fifth fractionator at Mont Belvieu increases our nameplate fractionation capacity to 380,000 barrels a day at that location. These projects, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion of capital investment, were completed 5% under-budget and began generating new sources of gross operating margin and distributable cash flow in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our commercial, engineering and operations teams continued to develop new projects, capitalizing on growth opportunities provided by our diverse system of assets. We currently expect to spend approximately $3.5 billion on our organic growth projects in 2012. In total, we have about $6.5 billion of projects under construction that are scheduled to begin operations in 2012 through 2014. We expect these new primarily fee-based assets will generate additional distributable cash flow through 2015, giving us clear visibility to near-term growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to our financial and operating performance, we reported record results again this quarter, supported by growth in natural gas, NGL and crude oil production in the shale regions, as well as strong NGL sales margins. Our integrated system continues to operate at record or near-record volumes.</p>
          <p>Enterprise reported gross operating margin of $1.1 billion for the quarter, a 33% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010. This led to record adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion and record net income of $726 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net income attributable to Partners for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $0.82 per unit on a fully-diluted basis, compared to $0.33 per unit on the same basis for the fourth quarter of 2010. I will point out that net income for the fourth quarter 2011 included $130 million, or $0.15 per unit of gains from sales of assets.</p>
          <p>Our partnership generated record distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion this quarter, which provided 2.7 times coverage of the cash distribution declared with respect to the quarter. Included in distributable cash flow this quarter was $593 million of net proceeds from assets of &#x2013; from the sale of our natural gas storage assets in Mississippi and $1.1 million common units of Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. units. Excluding these proceeds, our distribution coverage was still 1.5 times, allowing us to retain some of our cash flow to help fund our growth capital projects and reduce our dependence on the capital markets.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we invested approximately $3.6 billion in growth capital and improved our credit metrics, while only issuing $543 million of Enterprise common units. We have the flexibility to create additional value to our partners due to the way we manage our cash distribution coverage, and the fact that our General Partner no longer has any <mark type="ph" /> interest (5:17) of distribution rights. This disciplined approach to the cash management results in a lower cost to equity capital, reduces equity dilution and supports long-term distribution growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to segment results, our NGL pipelines and services segment reported record gross operating margin of $635 million for the quarter, a 39% increase over the $457 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business benefited from strong demand for NGLs as higher NGL sales margins and higher natural gas processing margins led to a $157 million increase in gross operating margin.</p>
          <p>Our NGL marketing business continues to have higher NGL sales margins, driven by strong industry fundamentals, such as increased petrochemical demand for light end feedstocks, regional basis differentials, and a strong butane isomerization market. Our Rocky Mountain processing plants also contributed to the increase in gross operating margin due to strong processing margins, higher equity NGL production, and increased fee-based processing volumes.</p>
          <p>The Meeker gas plant operated near full capacity this quarter, processing approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas. We also completed an expansion of our Piceance Gathering System which supplies our Meeker gas plant, resulting in lower pipeline pressures and higher gathering volumes from some of the more NGL-rich gas producing areas.</p>
          <p>Fee-based natural gas processing volumes increased 22% to a record 4.1 billion cubic feet a day for the quarter, compared to 3.3 billion cubic feet a day for the fourth quarter of 2010. Gross operating margin for our NGL pipelines and storage business decreased $10 million to $170 million this quarter, primarily from lower NGL volumes transported to fractionators in Louisiana due to the startup of our fifth NGL fractionator at Mont Belvieu, decreased NGL volumes on our Tri-States pipeline from unscheduled maintenance on the third-parties offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, lower propane deliveries on our Dixie pipeline due to warmer weather, and higher pipeline integrity expenses on certain pipelines.</p>
          <p>The Mid-America and Seminole pipelines reported a $16 million rise in gross operating margin, largely due to an increase in system-wide tariffs that became effective in July 2011. Total NGL pipeline volumes were 2.3 billion &#x2013; million barrels per day this quarter versus 2.5 million barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>A few weeks ago, we announced that shippers exercised options to increase their capacity commitments on the Rocky Mountain expansion of our Mid-America pipeline to 82,500 barrels a day from an initial 38,500 barrels a day. That's a 114% increase. We executed firm 10-year shipper bay transportation agreements with shippers to support this expansion which will enable them to maximize the value of their Rocky Mountain NGL production by providing access to the largest NGL market in the U.S. The expansion will also complement our Texas Express Pipeline joint venture which will provide shippers access to Mont Belvieu for their mixed natural gas liquids.</p>
          <p>We also announced our plan to move forward with the construction of the Appalachian-to-Texas ethane Express Pipeline or the ATEX Express Pipeline provides shippers an attractive option to move ethane from the Marcellus and Utica basins to Mont Belvieu where they will have access to every ethylene plant in the United States. Shippers have executed 15-year take-or-pay preceding agreements to move ethane volumes ramping up to 120,000 barrels per day over a five-year period beginning in early July &#x2013; early 2014 and Jim will go in a more detail about these projects in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Our NGL fractionation business reported gross operating margin of $69 million for the quarter, that's an 80% increase over the $38 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. Gross operating margin from Mont Belvieu fractionators increased $23 million primarily because of the addition of two new fractionation units. Frac four began commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 while Frac 5 began operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 and both have been running at full rates. Gross operating margins were also up at our Norco, Hobbs and South Texas fractionators.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines &amp; Services segment reported gross operating margin of $199 million for the quarter, a 46% increase over the $136 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010. Our Acadian Gas system reported a $30 million increase in gross operating margin for the quarter largely due to its Haynesville Extension pipeline that began service on November 1st, 2011. Gross operating margin from the Texas Intrastate system increased $24 million, primarily because of growing production from the Eagle Ford Shale. Total onshore natural gas pipeline volumes increased 14% to a record 13.2 trillion BTUs per day for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Producer development of the Eagle Ford Shale continues to be strong as the rig count increased 88% to 210 active rigs at the end of 2011, compared with the 112 rigs operating at the end of 2010. We are currently receiving approximately 900 million cubic feet a day of natural gas from the Eagle Ford, compared with 440 million cubic feet a day at the end of 2010. The vast majority of our Texas gathering and processing systems are currently operating at maximum capacity.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2011, we commissioned the expansion of our 30 and 36-inch Eagle Ford wet gas pipelines, allowing us to increase capacity and lower operating pressures. We expect to see a steady increase in Eagle Ford volumes throughout the first half of this year with a significant increase in mid-2012, after we complete first two 300 million cubic foot a day trains at our Yoakum gas processing plant and the commissioning of our Eagle Ford mainline expansion.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines &amp; Services segment increased 157% to $67 million, compared to $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. All of Enterprise's major onshore crude oil pipelines, storage assets and marketing activities reported increases in gross operating margins for the fourth quarter of 2011 on higher volumes and sales margins with the exception of Seaway pipeline, which was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2010. Seaway obviously continues to be impacted by the lack of demand for northbound transportation to the oversupplied Cushing Hub, but increased drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale led to higher volumes on our South Texas system.</p>
          <p>In November 2011, Enterprise and Enbridge jointly announced plans to reverse the Seaway crude oil pipeline that extends from Cushing, Oklahoma to Freeport, Texas. On January the 4th, we began open season for increased commitments from shippers to support an expansion of Seaway and an extension of the pipeline into the Port Arthur/Beaumont refining markets. The initial 150,000 barrels a day capacity on the reverse system should be available during the second quarter of this year and after pump station additions and modifications, we expect to be able to flow up to 400,000 barrels a day by the first quarter of 2013. The current open season is to solicit interest for capacity over and above that 400,000 barrels a day, and again, Jim, will talk about this in more detail following my remarks.</p>
          <p>Offshore Pipelines &amp; Services segment reported gross operating margin of $60 million for the quarter compared to $66 million for the same quarter of 2010. The Independence Hub platform and Trail pipeline had a $2 million decrease in gross operating margin on 8% lower volumes. Overall, our offshore natural gas pipeline volumes were 1.1 trillion BTUs per day for both quarters in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from our offshore crude oil pipelines decreased $5 million to $20 million this quarter, primarily due to maintenance by certain producers on their upstream platforms and wells that impacted volumes. Total offshore crude oil volumes were 282,000 barrels per day versus 304,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>In January, Enterprise and Genesis Energy announced transportation agreements with six Gulf of Mexico producers that support construction of a new crude oil pipeline serving the Lucius development area in the southern Keathley Canyon. This 149-mile 18-inch pipeline will have the capacity to transport 115,000 barrels per day of crude oil and will connect a Lucius production platform to an existing platform at South Marsh Island 205 that is part of the Enterprise-operated Poseidon pipeline system. We expect this pipeline to begin service by the mid-2014. Crude oil from Lucius will be delivered into the Poseidon pipeline, providing yet another source of incremental cash flows from this project.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from the Petrochemical &amp; Refined Products Services segment was $137 million this quarter compared to $140 million for the very strong fourth quarter of 2010. The propylene fractionation business had a $5 million decrease in gross operating margin due to lower sales margins in pipeline volumes. Propylene fractionation volumes were 75,000 barrels a day for the fourth quarter of 2011, down slightly from the 74,000 barrels a day in fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Enterprise's butane isomerization business reported 52% increase in gross operating margin to $32 million this quarter due to increased isomerization volumes and revenues from the sales of byproducts. Butane isomerization volumes were a record 106,000 barrels a day for the fourth quarter of 2011, 22% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The refined products pipelines and services business had a $23 million decrease in gross operating margin largely due to higher operating expenses and a 125,000 barrel a day decrease in refined products volumes being transported from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. Our octane enhancement and high-purity isobutylene business reported 139% increase in gross operating margin to $27 million for the quarter, largely due to higher margin from octane additive sales as well as a full quarter of earnings from our high-purity isobutylene plant that we acquired out of bankruptcy in late 2010.</p>
          <p>We recently announced an increase in our quarterly distribution to $0.62 per unit, or $2.48 on an annualized basis. This is a 5.1% increase of the distribution declared with respect to the fourth quarter of 2010. We've now increased our cash distribution for 30 consecutive quarters, the longest period for any of the large cap publicly-traded partnerships and this is our 39th increase since our IPO in 1998. In terms of consistent distribution growth, we increased cash distributions in excess of 5% for each of the last seven years including during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>After our major capital projects were completed in the second half of this year including those in the Eagle Ford Shale, we plan to do our annual assessment and evaluate the potential for an increase to our distribution growth rate in light of our expected distribution coverage in our growth plans for 2013.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the record results reported again this quarter and for the full year. This success would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees and the support of our investors and commercial partners. Our employees across every part of our organization have worked together to make Enterprise the partnership it is today and I hope they are as proud of their accomplishments as we are of them.</p>
          <p>We have eight locations that have gone more than 20 years without lost time accident and three of those have gone more than 30 years. And we want to thank all of our employees for embracing safety as a core value. Of course we have many other facilities with excellent safety records, but a lot of those have not been around for five years, much less than 20 or 30.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to congratulate the whole Enterprise organization for their hard work that led to the recent upgrades of our credit ratings by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's. Both rating agencies maintained their positive outlook on Enterprise's senior unsecured debt securities and cited factors that contributed to an improved credit profile for Enterprise including an increasing proportion of fee-based income, progress in simplifying our legal entity structure, and lower cost of capital due &#x2013; primarily due to the elimination of the general partner incentive distribution rights. We remain excited about the opportunities available to the partnership and we look forward to another successful year in 2012.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. Today I'd like to provide you with some insight into a few of the major projects we have underway and provide you with some of the Enterprise's observations on NGL supply/demand. Now that an ethane solution has been defined out of the Marcellus, I'll add, it seems like every six months someone starts shouting that the sky is falling where NGL supplies are concerned and we'll address that.</p>
          <p>As Mike's already discussed, we had a pretty good fourth quarter and an impressive 2011. While the income results were impressive, we also had a great year in continuing to implement our major projects, and also in identifying new strategic opportunities for Enterprise. I'm going to echo what Mike said that results like this come from a number of factors; one being well-positioned to capture market opportunities, good investment decisions, a highly integrated business model, but I think maybe most important, the dedication of Enterprise employees.</p>
          <p>Our folks are driven, they are creative, and they delivery results. In short, they make things happen. As mike said, we're quite proud of them, and I know that a lot of them dial into this call, and I think it is important that they know their efforts are appreciated. In fact, we think they are our strongest asset.</p>
          <p>In regards to key projects, needless to say, we've had some very strategic developments over the last couple of months. First, the Eagle Ford continues to beat everyone's expectations. And frankly, our assets can't get up and running soon enough.</p>
          <p>Our pipes, our plants, and our fractionators in the Eagle Ford are chock-a-block full. Our Texas commercial operations and marketing groups are going above and beyond to make sure that our producers' gas is flowing. They come in early and they stay late to make sure that our performance meets our customers' expectations.</p>
          <p>Our Yoakum processing plant, related to NGL and natural gas facilities, will begin coming online with the first train to Yoakum in early May, the second train come in June, and the last train in the first quarter of 2013. Mike stated this but it's worth restating that over 4,300 drilling permits issued, 3,100 wells already drilled, 210 rigs running and approximately 1,000 wells waiting on completion of infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Our new plant &#x2013; our first train will be full from day one. I didn't frankly believe that until the guy sat me down and went through the numbers. And it's hard not to be excited about the need for even more rich gas infrastructure.</p>
          <p>What we have already done in the Eagle Ford is overwhelmingly successful whether we lay another inch of pipe or not, however I don't think we are through. We also continue on schedule for our Eagle Ford crude oil system which includes two phases of crude oil pipeline, running 215 miles through the heart of the Eagle Ford crude window, with an initial capacity of 350,000 barrels a day, and our network of new terminal storage along the pipe connecting to our new ECHO terminal near Houston, which combined will have a storage capacity of approximately 5 million barrels. Again, whether we add another contract, we already have a very successful project; Mark Hurley tells me we are not through.</p>
          <p>Moving next to Seaway; we're quite pleased with Enbridge's purchase of Seaway and our joint project to reverse and expand it, including building that other 85 mile extension from our ECHO terminal to Port Arthur, which will give our shippers access to the largest refining complex in the world. We expect to get the pipeline into southbound service in the second quarter and have the project fully completed by late this year. As is the case with most of our systems, we expect significant integration between the Eagle Ford crude oil projects and the reverse and expanded Seaway pipeline that's going to yield even more benefits for years to come. We believe that Seaway's capacity will be fully contracted. We are in the midst, as Mike mentioned, of an open season, and frankly if we have the shipper interest, we will loop Seaway.</p>
          <p>One of the things that differentiate Seaway is, in combination with our partner Enbridge, we can access supplies from Alberta, the Bakken, and Cushing and then deliver those pipe to every refinery in Houston, Beaumont, and Port Arthur. Through an upgraded barge dock, we can access the entire Gulf Coast. That supply in market position is anchored by 21 million barrels of storage that between us Enterprise and Enbridge owns in Cushing, almost 7 million barrels that Seaway owns, and when fully developed an ultimate 5 million barrels of storage at ECHO, all tied to every refinery on the Gulf Coast. We will have the ability to deliver it to the refinery, not tell the refinery to come and get it. This project is consistent with all our projects; we are offering to producer flow assurance, ratability, and market choices and to consumer, reliability and flexibility.</p>
          <p>Now about some of our major NGL pipeline expansions, of which we have four underway. We have our Eagle Ford NGL pipeline, Mid-America Rocky Mountain expansion, our Texas in Express, and our Marcellus ethane pipeline that we are calling ATEX. The magnitude of these expansions is exciting because of their geographic reach, serving the growing production literally from the Rockies to Appalachia. In addition to being great standalone projects, backed by long-term shipper-payer agreements, all four are going to bring long-term strategic value to our NGL network. But, then Mike has already mentioned that the Mid-America expansion topped out at 82,500 barrels a day. This project and the Texas Express joint venture NGL pipeline we're building with Enbridge and Anadarko are complementary. They assure producers both in the Rockies and in the rich corridor developing in the Mid-Continent that they have a reliable outlet for their production. I'll add we are not slowing down out West; there is more to come.</p>
          <p>Our last project is the ATEX Express Marcellus ethane project that we announced in January. For Enterprise, this is a homerun. It's a homerun for the producers in the Marcellus and Utica, and it's a homerun for the Gulf Coast petrochemical industry because we are going to use significant amounts of existing pipe, we're able to be competitive from both a cost and timing standpoint, and the project significantly increases the value of an existing asset for Enterprise. It adds substantial value to both Marcellus and Utica producers and to the Gulf Coast petrochemicals as these volumes are key to both realizing their growth potential. The project integrates Marcellus, Utica volumes into our NGL infrastructure at Mont Belvieu and all along the Gulf Coast. It provides Enterprise of what we believe is going to be a very strategic access to some of the fastest growing rich gas supplies in the country and it creates a platform for us to seek and develop other opportunities in the Marcellus and Utica, similar to what we did in the Rockies once we acquired Mid-America.</p>
          <p>Last, I'll just touch a little bit on the ethane fundamentals. Now that a definitive large scale solution from Marcellus Utica ethane has been reached, there have been many "experts" &#x2013; and in my script that's in quotes &#x2013; who are projecting an early and significant supply of ethane on the Gulf Coast. At Enterprise, we track supply-demand fundamentals, and I'm not going to ever jeopardize my credibility by saying that there won't be windows or ethane will be over-supplied or for that matter under-supplied. I will tell you that our models indicate that ethane is likely to stay in balance even after Marcellus comes in service. Personally, I think the petrochemical industry needs Marcellus to realize their potential. In a market this big, there is always variables on both the supply and demand side of the equation, each with numerous possibilities and timelines. These include things such as how quickly the reserves can be developed and brought online, how quickly petrochemicals can do to their new conversions and builds, turnarounds play a part, and then how quickly new pipe will be filled. I can tell you they won't be full on day one and they are not contracted this way. This is a fact that many people miss. New pipelines are not full on the first day. For example, our Texas Express with a capacity of 280,000 barrels a day when it comes up and our Marcellus with a capacity of 125,000 barrels a day will neither be full as there is typically a three to five-year ramp-up on these projects. Out of all the scenarios we run, even at very high production scenario, we don't show ethane being significantly over-supplied for any extended period of time and we are talking months, not years.</p>
          <p>As an extreme, I ask our fundamentals group to model the remaining naphtha and gasoil cracking at a time when we are sure in growing ethane use and they found that the naphtha, gasoil cracking was still 230,000 barrels a day of equivalent ethane demand. Now that's probably not likely to be converted but it gives you an idea of the size of the headroom. I said before, don't underestimate petrochemical industry's inability to consume ethane. The economics are compelling to not only crack all the ethane they can, but as quickly as possible and to position themselves to be able to crack substantial amounts or more in the years to come. The wide gas to crude spreads that had been developing in the last few years, the installation of ethane flexibility has quickly moved from being a nicety to being an economic necessity. The answer lies in ethane's price advantage, and we continue to see the laws of supply-demand hard at work.</p>
          <p>Just last week, for our models, ethylene from ethane cost $0.20 a pound less than ethylene from naphtha. On 1.5 billion-pound-a-year plant that is an annualized $300 million in margin. In addition that ethylene made from that ethane is globally competitive. The cost advantage has not and will not be ignored. Further, with ethane as this market's base load feedstock, other opportunities present themselves. There is a greater appetite for reliable supplies for propylene and for butadiene, which is a positive for propane and butane and there are growing exports for propane.</p>
          <p>In short, shale has given new opportunities</p>
          <p>for petrochemicals, refining, midstream and especially for Enterprise. At our company, we know our business, we understand our customers and their needs both on the producing and consuming side and we focus on market fundamentals for the long-term.</p>
          <p>Frankly, we're very excited about where we are and we're very excited about where we're going, to the point at being a 66-year-old, I wish was 50. With that, I'll turn it over to Randy.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jim. I'll take a few minutes to review some additional income items and capitalization items. General and administrative costs decreased to $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $54 million in the fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to transaction expenses related to our merger with Enterprise GP Holdings of approximately $11 million, which were included in G&amp;A costs in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Interest expense was $183 million this quarter compared to $213 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. Included in interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2010 was approximately $31 million of charges related to the merger with Enterprise GP Holdings, including charges associated with their interest rate swaps and the write-off of their unamortized debt issuance cost.</p>
          <p>Average debt balance for the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010 were $15.1 billion and $13.8 billion respectively. Capitalized interest increased by $18 million this quarter compared to the fourth quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>Total capital expenditures were $1.1 billion this quarter, which included $1 billion for growth projects. Approximately 66% of growth capital expenditures this quarter were associated with the Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale related projects. As Mike mentioned earlier, we spent $3.6 billion on growth capital projects this year, primarily for fee-based pipeline and related projects in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford shale plays. Currently we expect to invest approximately $3.5 billion in growth capital projects in 2012, approximately 40% of that expenditure related to the Eagle Ford shale related projects.</p>
          <p>Sustaining capital expenditures were $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $296 million for the entire year of 2011. In 2012, we expect to spend approximately $300 million to $325 million for sustaining CapEx.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 was $4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates plus actual cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates. Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt principal to adjusted EBITDA was 3.5 times for 2011 after adjusting debt for 50% equity treatment of the hybrid securities.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted ratio of debt-to-EBITDA was 3.6 times if you reduce adjusted EBITDA for the $156 million of non-cash gains from the sale of assets recorded in 2011. Our floating interest rate exposure is approximately 8% of the total debt portfolio. The average debt life was 11 years using the First Call date for the hybrids and a little over 16 years if you use the final maturity. Our effective average cost of debt was 5.6% with respect to the quarter.</p>
          <p>Since the beginning of 2011, we have made notable progress in evaluating our portfolio of assets, for those assets that are earning low rates of return on capital and not strategic long-term. The two largest assets we have divested are approximately $32.4 million Energy Transfer Equity units and our Mississippi natural gas storage business. This includes the $825 million of ETE units that we settled on January 18.</p>
          <p>In total we sold these assets for approximately $1.7 billion, which suggests we were earning a unlevered return on capital of approximately 7%. We believe our organic growth project should generate higher returns on capital and generate incremental distributable cash flow without growing our balance sheet. For example, if you assume we can redeploy this capital at a 15% unlevered return, we could generate incremental DCF equal to approximately 6.5% of our current annualized distribution rate of $2.48.</p>
          <p>Assuming a more modest 12.5% return on capital, the distributable cash flow accretion would be approximately 4.5% of our current distribution rate. It is unusual for an MLP to sell assets because they generally cannot afford to lose the associated distributable cash flow. Because of our healthy distribution coverage and a general partner without incentive distribution rights, we have this type of flexibility to high-grade our assets, increase our distributable cash flow and the value of our partnership units.</p>
          <p>At December 31, 2011, we had consolidated liquidity of approximately $3.4 billion, which included availability under EPD's credit facility as well as unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liquidity at December 31 does not include the $825 million of proceeds from the sale of approximately $22.8 million Energy Transfer Equity units that closed on January 18, 2012. You add those two together, that's $4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>With that, we'll turn it over for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for all the color on the kind of macro data points. I guess on the back of that considering the fact that ATEX emerged from the fact that you guys were able with your legacy assets to deliver a low cost solution for Marcellus supply in &#x2013; ethane supply in the Marcellus. Do you think that there is any potential long term to use maybe a similar strategy to provide a propane takeaway solution out of the Marcellus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we look at the production growth up there in that area, I think it will be five to seven years before the propane production will exceed the local demand. So what we are looking at short term is using the network of assets we had to feed the distribution system that's there. And then yes down the road is production growth, we do have the capability to provide new solution <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:02).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And I guess the long-term view that you guys provided, notwithstanding, in the last month ethane pricing has softened pretty significantly, and just because you guys touched so many producers as well as consumers, do you have any thoughts about &#x2013; I guess is the warm winter up in the Northeast displacing propane that would have otherwise gone up to PADD 1, and is that propane getting cracked on the Gulf Coast, or is there other factors that worked in kind of ethane softness that we've seen?</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:41) question. I mean, we talk about softness; we've gone from phenomenal margins to just great margins. We've had quite a few turnarounds. We've lost probably 50,000 barrels a day that's to be expected. We just feel pretty excited. I don't know what has to do with propane. I haven't seen heck of a lot of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:01) propane cracking, or have we, have we seen it increasing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, just two quick questions for me, Jim. With all the emphasis on moving <mark type="ph" /> white grade (35:57) into Belvieu and</p>
          <p>the ATEX line moving more product into Belvieu. How do you guys think about the Conway to Belvieu spread for ethane widening over time and, more importantly, your position to increase that ability to capitalize on that regional arbitrage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well our Texas Express <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:12) this is Jim Collingsworth, but our Texas Express in combination with our Mid-America pipeline system will have the ability to move Midcontinent <mark type="ph" /> wide grade (36:21) into Mont Belvieu. You know frankly, I don't think you can hold these spreads long-term, so it's going to be piped <mark type="ph" /> in (36:28) and built.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; [005VJJ-E W. Fowler]: What I want to add, Jim, what used to balance, it was $0.35 and with the new tariffs all-in you're now [ph] and look at exploration (36:37) over the next three or four years, you're up to $.10 or $12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you get that, Darren?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I did. It's just amazing to me because your Belvieu-Conway ethane spread, your purity versus EP mix was up around $0.60 and &#x2013; which is fantastic and like you said, you're going from fantastic spreads, now it's around $0.30 but it's still pretty healthy and it seems like there would be an increasing opportunity for arbitrage because Conway could effectively be the marginal ethane spot. Would you agree with that, Jim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's the marginal ethane site.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. So just kind of thinking about that with the commitments on <mark type="ph" /> Maple (37:18) up to 82,005, you seem to have the volume to justify Texas Express expanding up close to that 400,000 mark and moving more product to Belvieu and if that's the case, how do you think about additional volumes coming into <mark type="ph" /> Haas (37:32) and the ability maybe to even move more product on either Seminole or Chaparral?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chapparral and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:42) rule the day and have been for several years. So, the only opportunity we've got is to volume &#x2013; move additional volumes is Texas Express and going from 280 to 400 is a very cheap expansion and something that can be done within 9 to 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Jim, just last question to me. As you look at what you guys are doing with the ATEX NGL line, how do you think about officially moving forward with that Gulf Coast ethane header system? I mean it would seem to me like you've got all the places &#x2013; all the pieces of the puzzle in place to do so, and more importantly, the one piece that is lacking is the front end of the system. And in this period of being more vertically integrated, how do you guys think about establishing a gas gathering and processing footprint up in the Northeast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To continue to push the ethane header system frankly is going to be a function of what kind of support we get for petrochemicals. It seems to be growing legs. In terms of the Northeast, you can bet your bottom dollar, we've always said, we don't build and buy what doesn't already fit us." Now, it fits us, we're going to take a hard look at can we develop a presence up there in gathering and processing.</p>

          <p>Okay. And, Jim, thanks for the color on macro. Why does it seem you mentioned sort of the sky is falling predictions that seem to continue to come out the debate rages on and probably will continue to in terms of ethane and NGLs? What do you think the chemical companies are missing, or why do they keep talking about 20% to 50% drops in ethane? Is it certainly a bias on their part to talk like that, or is there something you see that they are not seeing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, it's not the chemical companies, it's some reports coming out from chemical analysts that we think are missing some of the key factors. And I think every time Jim reads one of these, his blood pressure goes up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you have heard from CEOs of some of the chemical companies that have predicted ethane to go down, I mean, late last year they thought ethane will go down 20% to 50% this year, I thought we read that and saw that a couple of places, but...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and they're no different than anybody else they talk their book. And I was with my former friends not long ago in New York and really what I said to them was, you're really advantaged on ethane given the gas to crude, it's not about ethane being cheaper, it's about you being able &#x2013; given &#x2013; it's a relative thing and then if I'm still there what I am focused on is I want to be the guy that can use the most the quickest because that's where the advantage is. I think it took them a while and rightfully so to really determine is this thing real? They bought into that full force right now and they are moving hard to expand.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Final question from me. Appreciate that you guys are in great financial shape and don't need equity relative to the plan for 2012. Is that &#x2013; would that be your goal to get through the year with not issuing equity at EPD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have always said that we want to stay in front of our equity needs and looking at 2012 in our capital spend where we are in terms of liquidity and balance sheet, we are very comfortable that given our current expectation of capital spend we don't need to issue equity. And so we are certainly not intending to do anything before it's needed.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just following up on Stephen's question there on the equity side, is there &#x2013; can you tell us how much of the &#x2013; whether it's ETE sales or if it's just regular asset sales like the gas storage business? How much of that has actually baked into not needing equity? And then just comment a little bit about you said you got the upgrades from the rates and you're on a positive watch. Do you &#x2013; are you looking to get another notch upgrade on your ratings or are you are happy where you are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just talk about our equity expectations. Certainly, if we are issuing units of energy transfer equity or selling those then that's very similar to us issuing equity. As Randy said, if we can take assets, whether its storage or whether it's another third party's common units that yield 7% and redeploy that in 15% projects, it's a win-win all over the place and again that upgrade certainly lessens the need for equity. Randy, you want to talk about Fitch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, very appreciative of the upgrades from S&amp;P and Moody's. As you know, we still have positive outlook there and I think both noted that if we continue to execute in bringing projects on time on budget, execute on what we think we can earn on those projects, keep our credit metrics in good shape, they see a window, what, 12 to 24 months out that will not see another upgrade. So, I think we just need to run our race and continue to execute and let that play out. I know Mike mentioned Fitch. Fitch is still there at BBB minus. I think they have also a positive outlook and I think they are, in their cycle right now, doing their annual reviews also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And, then just on the distribution itself, it sounds like you're going to wait until some of the Eagle Ford projects will come online. Are you implicitly saying that you will stay at the same growth rate that you've been on the last few quarters through 2012 until those come on or is there a chance that you might bump faster sooner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not trying to imply that we're going to do anything. We've always said we look at it every quarter. What we would say is that we've got extraordinarily strong distribution coverage, in part because our business is running on all cylinders, but in part because we've had some asset sales that tend to distort the coverage ratio. We do have, as we said, about $3.6 billion that we're going to spend this year and that's going to be capital that we are spending. That's not going to be returning cash flow to us immediately so we just need to manage through that construction cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then, Jim, I appreciate the comments on ATEX and Texas Express, the volumes, but can you give us a sense of the actual ramp there? You said three to five years. Should we think about it as a pro rata ramp in the volumes? Is it backend loaded? Any more detail you could give us there would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We look at our IRRs, we look at our simple interest in the early years &#x2013; simple return in the early years and that's how we make our decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ted, the producers are going to be pretty cautious about it. Certainly to sanction a project, we need some certainty of cash flow and so there are some demand charges that we are counting on during that ramp-up period, but whether production is actually going to be there or not, we don't know.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. So, in other words, if the capacity is there, you could run spot barrels on those pipelines presumably even if you didn't have contracted volumes coming on them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, if there were spot barrels, then those producers probably will be stepping up for more capacity anyway.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, just a follow-up on the distribution growth rate question, any clarity as to what metrics or specific metrics you'll be looking at post, let's say, your CapEx spending slows down, although that's not really in sight at this point, continues to move up. But, what you will be looking at and assessing in terms of to look at that growth rate? Can you narrow it down a little bit from &#x2013; between coverage, fee-based cash flows, leverage and need for expansions? Any more detail that you can provide on the metrics that you'll be looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, it's all of those and I don't want to describe it as a black box, but it truly is looking at how our assets are performing given the current business cycle, looking at our needs for capital. We've got a lot of assets. They're going to be going into service this year, some of them about $1.7 billion in the first half of the year and then another big chunk in the fourth quarter. So, we want to see how those perform and make sure that our balance sheet stays where we want it to be. We're not planning on funding all of our capital with 100% retained distributable cash flow, but we do still think a piece of that makes sense. And, as we look forward over 2012, just looking at the facts, we expect our distribution coverage to decline throughout the year until those projects come up.</p>
          <p>And so, we really want to see how those projects perform, look what the business climate appears to be for 2013, and what our CapEx is. You're right; it does appear that we're on track to spend $3.5 billion or so a year on capital expenditures and we certainly have the opportunities that we think that's probably going to be the case for 2013, although we haven't identified them. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we wouldn't consider an increase in the distribution rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great color. Any feeling, or does your peers' cost of capital at all play into that decision where you have seen some of the midstream MLPs &#x2013; it is a pretty robust environment where they've ratcheted up their growth rate. Does that play at all into the mind of where your distribution growth is or is that &#x2013; are you really just looking internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not too much of followers and we think that some of those bumps that you're hearing other MLPs talk about or because dropdowns they're doing and things that they really have to do because they don't have the same organic growth opportunities that we do, we're more of a consistent performer and we think that that's going to provide better returns for our unit-holders over time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then, Jim &#x2013; and I'm sorry I dropped off right at the beginning of your comments and then dialed back in. But if you answered this or not I don't know, but on the propane export pipeline or export terminal expansion, when &#x2013; could you get me a quick update on when that comes online. And if it &#x2013; once it does come online, we saw I think peak exports of about 175,000 barrels a day out of the U.S. What could that be, once you get your propane or the NGL export dock expansion up and running?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still on track for completing the expansion sometime in late 2012, and we would anticipate with the capacity we have we could double the exports that we had based on the capacity we have. We'll see if the market will bear that as we go forward. But already we have a significant number of contracts in place for 2012 and 2013, and we'll continue to add to those as the market is accepting of it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On a barrels per day basis, because I know you guys look at it from a loading-hour, I think, barrels that you can load per hour, any kind of kind of clarity on what that means on a barrels per day basis, how meaningful this expansion will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll be able to load at about 240,000 barrels a day when the expansion is up from a pure physical capacity standpoint.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of our constraints is going to supply. We got to produce the LE, low ethane propane, so one of the things we're working on fairly significantly right now is making sure we've got enough supply to maintain the ability to load at that rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yves, we continue to look at our assets and we may have some small rather insignificant assets in the grand scheme of things. We do have some ETE units left if you're interested.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that the Gulf of Mexico certainly has had a setback with Macondo and with hurricanes part of that, we think that the majors are really putting more emphasis into it now. We did announce our Lucius pipeline and that one really is a nice asset where we think that the appropriate parties are bearing appropriate risks. It's not one that we are putting a lot of money into right now, but we certainly don't think that this would be a time to sell it. We think that that Gulf of Mexico area is on the rebound.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my final two questions would be, number one, for Mr. Teague, do you envision or are you still of the opinion that we won't see more downstream infrastructure get developed up here in the Northeast? I'm thinking perhaps an ethylene cracker or any change in your thoughts there given how much &#x2013; how prolific the Marcellus and the Utica may very well be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does seem like the place to build ethylene plants given all the infrastructure and it goes beyond. If you look at the Gulf Coast and you look at the ethylene, there's full connectivity on the front end, there's full connectivity &#x2013; virtually full connectivity on the back end. It's a huge advantage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as you think about the NGL storage, the ethane stores that we've got on the Gulf Coast, that's something that they don't have up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my last question, as you think about this growth capital cycle that you've been on and clearly you're getting much better visibility into 2013, do you have any sense of how long the growth being at an elevated level could go? Do you think you have good visibility into 2014 and 2015 in terms of thinking that you could be spending at this multimillion dollar rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think certainly 2013, just given our existing projects, you know, we said we got $6.5 billion of projects under construction right now. We've got a few others that we are looking at that have not been announced, haven't been sanctioned, but could happen and if they do, they're more likely to be a capital spend in 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>If you look back over the last six or seven years, 2009 was the only one that had a downtick in CapEx, and that was because of our concerns about the financial market, which proved not to be as big an issue as we thought they might be, but I think one of the things to think about Yves, is that with the ATEX pipeline, with the big assets that we're building in the Eagle Ford, we are really building a backbone that we can build off of and develop smaller discrete projects that don't have the same kind of timeline, so we can develop them faster to get them producing cash faster. And I think it just &#x2013; it means even more growth for the partnership.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then I'm just wondering with all the construction, are you seeing any kind of inflation in labor and materials at this point or is it pretty benign?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There has been a slight increase. It's kind of been ramping up pretty steadily over the last couple of years, but I mean we're still nowhere near where we were in 2010 and 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the good thing to note is as we've said a couple of times during this conference call, we've been building assets and coming in under budget. So, even though those costs have been reflected in the AFEs, we've been able to come in under budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then are things staying on schedule? I mean, are you seeing any bottlenecks that would cause any slippage or do you feel really &#x2013; pretty comfortable with construction schedules?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel pretty comfortable at this point in time, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then just wondering, are you looking at a frac 7?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could look at a frac 12, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you listen to our fractionation group, we'd have trains from Mont Belvieu to Beaumont.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. And then, out of the $6.5 billion currently underway, how much I guess is ongoing? I'm trying to figure out, you have $3.5 billion budgeted for this year. How much of that $6.5 billion is built out? Is it just simple math on the $6.5 billion minus $3.5 billion or what's the right way to think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, I think probably, because some of that $6.5 billion was spent frankly in 2011, some has been spent in 2012, some being spent in 2013 roughly, I mean the tail on this maybe a couple of billion dollars in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then so now what's the opportunity backlog you're looking at now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Carl Sagan would say, billions and billions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Seriously, we have a lot of opportunity. It really is a question of what makes the most sense for the partnership and we've got a number of projects that literally could be several billion dollars worth. It's just question of whether it really makes sense at the end of the day and whether we can get the contracts to support it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the bottom line, you're not really seeing a fall off here in opportunities for that at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've never been opportunity-short. It's more trying to be disciplined in the way we spend our capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. That's all I had. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Christie, this is Randy. We have time for one more question, if you have it out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And, your final question comes from the line of T.J. Schultz of RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Any update on your ability to charge market base rates on Seaway? And, then assuming you obtain market base, what's the timing for some of the discounted rates that you said you intend to honor? What period of time would you be able to set the rate at the market price for transportation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Mark. Well, first of all, we feel very good about our applications and the way that we measure the ability to achieve market base rates. We think we have a very, very solid case. The timing on that I think is going to be into the second quarter with the way the FERC process plays out. With respect to when we start with the commitments that shippers already have on Seaway, those commitments officially start in the second quarter of 2013. There is a possibility they can be moved forward if all shippers unanimously feel they can meet those commitments. And so that's an issue that we're working right now.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Jim, just clarification on the naphtha cracking comment, 230,000 barrels a day of ethane equivalent, you said those are not likely to be converted; just &#x2013; some clarification there on what headroom you imply that gives you or what are some of the reasons or limitations for that not to be converted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those crackers are integrated with the refineries. So, you have issues around what does a refiner do with that product that typically goes to the ethylene plant. The point is, within that complex given the cost advantage, there's still economics to do things beyond what we're showing; that's the point of it. That's the point.</p>
