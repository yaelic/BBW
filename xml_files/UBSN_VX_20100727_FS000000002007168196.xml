          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter Results Presentation. My name is Caroline Stewart and I am the Head of Investor Relations here at UBS. This morning, our CEO, Ossie Gr&#xFC;bel, will present the highlights of the second quarter results. And then John Cryan, our Chief Financial Officer, will present the results to you in detail.</p>
          <p>After that we'll be very happy to take your questions and this morning we're going to take questions first from the telephone and then from the audience here in the room in Zurich. After that, we'll have a short break and we'll resume for another session in German.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Ossie, I'd like to draw your attention to this slide, which contains our cautionary statement with regards to forward-looking statements and I'd ask you read it in detail.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over to Ossie.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I notice there are very few here but most of you are probably on the phone or on the internet. Because it's a busy day, we are not the only bank publishing today, but we are very happy in showing you our second quarter. And we think our employees did a very good job actually in the second quarter. Actually so good that most of the analysts already asked if the results are mainly due to proprietary trading. There I unfortunately have to disappoint you because we are not as good as that yet in proprietary trading.</p>
          <p>So but if we look back in the first half of this year we had a pre-tax profit of 5.4 billion and revenues of 18.2 billion which is a major improvement. And as we told you in the last couple of quarters, we are moving ahead with our plan and are on track actually to continue to improve the results of the bank in the future.</p>
          <p>Now, most of you keep asking us about net new assets, clearly because that is still one of the weak points, because we are not yet accruing net new assets. We had some asset outflow as well. But much smaller and at least coming down to numbers which are smaller surrounding area you could say in our case.</p>
          <p>We did tell you before that we believe that during the course of this year, we hope and are pretty confident that we can stop any asset outflow. But also the asset reduction had something to do clearly with the resizing of our Wealth Management and of certain operations and also with our U.S. situation, as you know.</p>
          <p>And in the last quarter one of the more important decisions in our favor happened in Bern where the Swiss and the U.S. government agreed on the agreement, they verified the agreement they made before. And that should lead to the final settlement for us by the latest, we think, October this year in the U.S. case. And then we're happy if that finally it is finished because then we can concentrate more again on our normal business.</p>
          <p>But back to last quarter, the last quarter was quite remarkable and eventful, as you know. Not so long ago everybody was forecasting the imminent demise of the euro. As usual, since then the euro has improved and is instead of one to one with the dollar at 1.30 this morning and probably most likely will go on improving during in course of the year, I think.</p>
          <p>Now where did we make our money and in that turbulent time we had especially in May, it was actually in the flow business as we told you and, as we said before, we want to increase our flow business and there we produce the best results in cash equity trading, in foreign exchange trading and so not, unfortunately, in proprietary trading. We still have to work on that one. But therefore, we think the results, especially in comparison relative to our peers, they look reasonably good and I think we are very happy about that.</p>
          <p>In investment banking we made good progress across all our strategic initiatives, and the rebuilding of our fixed income is nearly completed and the focus is now on execution and how can we increase revenue and client business.</p>
          <p>One strong focus remain in the emerging markets, you might have read that we are re-entering Brazil and we bought a small company there to &#x2013; mainly to get the licenses and now surely you question then why did we sell our Brazil operation in the first place, but I think we answered that question already last year. It was a time where we had to &#x2013; we had other priorities and had to act quickly. And we also said at the time that we are not very happy about such transaction.</p>
          <p>We do believe that emerging markets is, especially for our global business, a focus and where we will generate substantial revenues in the coming years. We also aligned our security businesses across equities and fixed income in research and in client services and what is also very gratifying, I think, it looks like we regained market share in equity in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management Americas, we are delivering on our strategy there. We improved profitability and while slowing FA attrition and but the focus is really on maintaining and building a high quality financial advisor population and which is where we want to differentiate us from our competition.</p>
          <p>Investment and management in Swiss banking, so we were in the last 12 months really occupied with improving substantially our compliance all around and resizing certain businesses as we said before. It looks like the numbers of client advisors have bottomed out in mid year and has potential to gradually grow again.</p>
          <p>We did tell you long time ago that we do want to improve the profitability of our private banking and we have done that gradually now. We have got 95 basis points. We said at the time, we want to go at least to 100 basis points and I think &#x2013; I see that more as a minimum what we have to have and eventually we should be there above 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>There is always &#x2013; trade-off is probably the wrong word, but you have to decide on how you want to run your company and you have to get new assets for growth, but you also have to manage these assets very well. You have to deliver a good service to your clients and when you deliver a good service to your clients, then clearly your margin is improving. And so we have to balance these two initiatives, these two directions, continuously and we have to do a lot of catch up to do actually in serving our clients better and managing the assets of our clients better and therefore also with time increasing profitability.</p>
          <p>In &#x2013; what we also will do and we announced that we make some additional investments here in Switzerland, mainly in our branch network, and we give it a new coat of paint and for 100 million or so to make it look smarter and to make people feel that &#x2013; or make them aware whenever they walk in that that is actually UBS the biggest bank in Switzerland, in case they have forgotten.</p>
          <p>In Global Asset Management we had solid investment performance and that is continuing and has attracted, as we'll hear later from John, some good third-party client flows and that is actually the measurement on how well you're doing so, if you get the third-party money in substantial amounts in, as happened in the second quarter finally.</p>
          <p>Then, otherwise, it is for the time being relatively quite on the regulatory front after lot of discussions internationally, where to go and how to cooperate, and one thing is for sure, we all will have more capital in the future. But one thing is also for sure, I think, that there's very little international cooperation and my point if you &#x2013; I must say that I do think that we will go into era of regulatory arbitrate coming up in the next few years.</p>
          <p>Our world will be changing and &#x2013; but we are not afraid of changing, to the contrary, we like change, because change gives you opportunities. And is impossible to say at the moment how it will be changing, but I think it will be changing substantially. And we're looking forward to it and because of the opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now, John, you are ready for the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to take you through the details of our results for the second quarter of 2010. Here are the highlights of our financial performance. We made a pre-tax profit of CHF2.6 billion this equates to a net profit attributable to our shareholders of just over CHF2 billion equivalent to diluted earnings per share of 52 Rappen.</p>
          <p>We further strengthened our capital base and reported tier 1 ratio of 16.4% and a core tier 1 ratio of 13%. Our annualized return on equity year-to-date has been 19.5%; that's at the top end of the range of the medium term targets we set last year.</p>
          <p>So as we said, the net new money picture improved across all our asset gathering divisions, but in Wealth Management we still have some work to do to turn the flows net positive across the board.</p>
          <p>Investment Bank generated a good return on risk with revenues of CHF4.1 billion and a pre-tax profit of 1.3 billion. Our equities and FX businesses recorded revenues higher than those in the first quarter, with equities performing particularly well and increasing its market share.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the principal quarter-on-quarter changes in our net profit attributable to our shareholders. The widening of our credit spreads over the quarter turned the end credit losses in Q1 into gains of 595 million in the second quarter. In Q1, we reported credit loss recoveries. This quarter we record an expense of 48 million.</p>
          <p>Operating income, excluding owned credit gains and credit losses, fell quarter-on-quarter, around CHF5 billion, principally as a consequence of the market turbulence and the fall-off in client activity in the second half of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our expense base rose in the quarter, largely driven by the UK bank payroll tax and the restructuring charge we flagged we would take in Wealth Management Americas. I'll cover the income tax effects on the next slide.</p>
          <p>This is our usual slide on the overall divisional performance. All of our divisions made a positive contribution on an operating basis. At Wealth Management Americas, we took a restructuring charge of 146 million, mostly related to real estate rationalization, in relation to that division's strategy implementation. Excluding the charge, profit before tax there improved to 79 million.</p>
          <p>The Group tax charge at 311 million represents an effective tax rate of about 12%, and we amortized our Swiss deferred tax assets in an amount of 464 million against taxable profits arising in Switzerland of just short of CHF2.3 billion, i.e. at the rate of just over 20%.</p>
          <p>Current tax payable amounted to around 89 million, in line with the 100 million or so we said we'd pay each quarter; it arose mainly in the APAC region. These expenses were offset by an increase in deferred taxes for prior year losses. Finally, we charged our net income line with CHF 296 million, the dividends on our non-owner equity, i.e. distributions made on our hybrid tier 1 instruments.</p>
          <p>This slide demonstrates briefly the progress we've made over the past few quarters to return to profitability. Last November, we set ourselves the target of making 15 billion of pre-tax profit per annum in the medium-term. This equates to a quarterly run rate approximately CHF 1 billion higher than the run rate we have achieved so far this year.</p>
          <p>Our fixed cost base remains in line with the annual targeted CHF 20 billion that we set ourselves for this year. When we set that target, we excluded our normal variable compensation but included direct financial advisor compensation in our retail brokerage in the USA.</p>
          <p>In our divisional report on Wealth Management Americas, we have for the first time separately itemized compensation between grid-based compensation, the cost of amortizing employee forgivable loans and other recruitment costs and other personnel costs.</p>
          <p>So far this year we've paid over CHF 1 billion of financial advisor variable compensation included in our definition of fixed costs. Also included in other personnel expenses in our report is the charge for the UK Bank Payroll Tax of 242 million. The restructuring charge of 146 million in Wealth Management Americas was partly offset by a release of 25 million of provisions taken last year by the Investment Bank against redundancy costs which are now no longer required. We lowered the accrual for variable compensation quarter-on-quarter on lower operating revenues.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the divisions. Wealth Management and Swiss Bank's revenues were broadly flat on the first quarter result. A small improvement showed through in the net interest income line, but the underlying picture there remains challenging as the Swiss franc yield curve in particular remains low and flat.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management, we noticed a change in our clients' overall risk appetite with a trend to greater risk aversion as the quarter progressed. This manifested itself in lower revenues from client activity and the marginal shift into less risky asset classes. The cost income ratio rose slightly on higher personnel costs though this was mostly attributable to the impact of the UK Bank Payroll Tax.</p>
          <p>The gross margin in Wealth Management was 2 basis points higher than during the first quarter at 95 basis points per annum. You'll recall our medium term target is to raise this to over 100 basis points. The increase was partly technical given that the balance of invested assets fell in the quarter, predominately because of adverse market moves and FOREX moves.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that we by and large charge fees on the quarterly opening balance of invested assets. So this would apply technical pressure to the third quarter margin if the markets in the Swiss franc recover.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we continued to improve pricing discipline and we saw high levels of Lombard lending. Our mandate penetration slipped slightly over the quarter as we continued to see attrition in our offshore business where discretionary mandates are more prevalent. After the flash crash in early May, we noticed a fall-off in client activity levels that impacted our brokerage fee levels.</p>
          <p>Overall net new money flows were obviously disappointing though we continue to see positive contributions from Asia and from our ultra high net worth segment. The bulk of attrition continued to be in the cross-border segment.</p>
          <p>The effective advisor attrition on invested assets in Q2 was more muted than it had been in recent quarters. The impact of our hiring and training initiatives for client advisors should be felt in the second half of the year when we expect to show some increase in client advisor numbers.</p>
          <p>The Retail and Corporate segment turned in a steady performance in the second quarter. Business volumes were marginally up as were revenues, despite continuing pressure on interest margins from the flat yield curve in Swiss francs. The segment continued its excellent credit track record with minimal credit losses recorded in the quarter. Jaws were slightly positive, generating a creditable cost-to-income ratio of just over 52%.</p>
          <p>The driving factor in the steady performance of the Retail and Corporate segment is the quality of its credit books. Only 11% of its credit assets are unsecured, the vast majority of its lending operations are in the mortgage segment. We continue to monitor performance for these markets in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>There are emerging concerns about house price inflation in certain regions, especially around the lakes of Geneva and Zurich, and we'll monitor this development carefully. But the performance of R&amp;C's loan books on the whole remains highly satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Wealth Management Americas grew by 9% on the first quarter, while recurring income was up 12% on higher managed account fees and increased non-proprietary mutual fund fees. Net interest income also improved as a consequence of changes we made to the investment portfolio in the Utah Bank. Recurring income also increased as a proportion of total revenues and non-recurring income increased by 5% on higher transaction and brokerage fees.</p>
          <p>The gross margin increased by 6 basis points to 84 basis points per annum. As I said earlier, we recognized the second installment of the overall charge for personnel related restructuring which is now largely complete. After having charged 21 million in Q1, we took a further 19 million charges in the second quarter. We also expensed 127 million in the quarter as the cost of our real estate rationalization program.</p>
          <p>We also mentioned earlier for the first time this quarter we've broken down the personnel expenses for this division, so you can see the grid-based compensation that is driven by financial advisor productivity. We've also disclosed the balance of our forgivable loans and promissory notes and the rate of quarterly amortization of the balance.</p>
          <p>Financial advisor numbers decreased by 2% in the quarter as voluntary departures were not completely offset by financial advisor recruitment. Net new money outflow is decreased to 2.6 billion from 7.2 billion in the prior quarter. For the second quarter in succession we recorded positive same store net new money. In other words, our net outflows were driven by net advisor attrition.</p>
          <p>And under the convention used by the U.S. peer group, where interest and dividend income are included in net new money, the division recorded positive net new money of over CHF 2 billion. In the quarterly report, we've reiterated the medium-term targets management announced in May.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Global Asset Management were broadly flat on Q1, despite a significant decline in performance fees in A&amp;Q. Expenses grew by 5% in part driven by a true-up related to compensation awarded in prior periods.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we saw positive net new money of CHF 3.4 billion compared with net outflows of 2.6 billion in the first quarter. Strong net inflows of almost 11 billion from third parties were partly offset by 7.5 billion of outflows through our Wealth Management channels. Despite the net inflows of new money, invested assets fell by 21 billion to 569 billion on negative market movements and currency effects.</p>
          <p>I have included this slide, as a reminder of the progress that's recently been made in the Investment Bank. The IB reported pre-tax profits of 1.3 billion in the second quarter, increased revenues in equities and gains from owned credit were partly offset by lower revenues in FICC and in investment banking.</p>
          <p>Net credit loss expense was 39 million compared to the net recovery of 112 million in the first quarter. Expenses were impacted by a 228 million charge for the UK Bank Payroll Tax. This was partly offset by the release of restructuring provisions and lower accruals for variable compensation on weaker operating revenues.</p>
          <p>Equities had a good quarter with revenues up 9% overall and market share improved. Commission income line held up in cash sales and trading despite volatile markets; derivatives and equity linked revenues were marginally up on Q1, despite lower trading volumes and thinner liquidity, partly as a result of effective risk management.</p>
          <p>Prime brokerage saw revenues lift on strong activity in the securities lending and total return stock markets. In exchange traded derivatives, we also saw increased activity levels.</p>
          <p>The run rate of revenues in FICC as a whole fell after the unset of the euro zone debt crisis and its attendant economic concerns in May. In credit, revenues of 464 million compared with 744 million in Q1. We saw marked drop-off in flow volumes in all regions, but especially in U.S.A. where liquidity suffered as the high yield market repriced. Structured credit posted solid results as we executed a number of client-driven restructuring transactions.</p>
          <p>In Macro, ForEx revenues rose strongly on wider margins driven by high levels of volatility. Our interest rate business however, had a relatively weak quarter on very low volumes as clients avoided risk taking. Emerging markets was also marked by widespread risk aversion on the part of clients and revenues there fell to only 73 million as all regions were negatively affected.</p>
          <p>Other FICC revenues were 502 million, 280 million of which comprise positive DVAs and the remainder largely represented the net gain on exiting and risk managing our residual risk positions.</p>
          <p>Revenues in IBD and global capital markets were disappointing. Advisory revenues were down 26% on the previous quarter. In equity capital markets, we held our market share, but saw revenue fall 21% quarter-on-quarter. In debt capital markets, we saw greater reduction in revenues, reflecting thin markets, but also our relatively weak presence in the global high yield markets.</p>
          <p>Overall in Q2, we conducted ourselves very cautiously in the markets. Our average value at risk was down 8% on the first quarter's already low levels. Our trading businesses operated well within their risk limits. And risk-weighted assets fell by a further CHF4 billion.</p>
          <p>We made good progress in exiting our residual risk positions. We completed several trade commutations with a credit impaired bond insurer. As a consequence, our remaining exposure to the monoline insurance sector at the end of quarter was US$1.7 billion and our exposure to it in connection with negative basis trades on US sub-prime RMBS CDOs is now less than $200 million.</p>
          <p>In the quarter we reduced our exposure to student loan auction rate certificates by approximately $5 billion through redemptions, resales and amortization. It continues to be an area of focus, as the overall notional exposure to this asset class remains in excess of $12 billion.</p>
          <p>Also in the quarter, we exited one of our residual impaired leveraged acquisition financings at no incremental cost to the firm, helping to achieve a 17% reduction in our impaired lending portfolio.</p>
          <p>And I should reiterate for those of you who missed it, that our net sovereign exposures to Greece, to Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain are insignificant both individually and in the aggregate.</p>
          <p>Our capital ratios improved in the quarter but we still have some way to go to achieve our desired level of capitalization and to meet future regulatory requirements. Our tier 1 capital ratio was 16.4% at the end of June. This was after taking a reserve of CHF 1 billion out of tier 1 capital as a redemption reserve and we will seek regulatory approval to call a $1.5 billion hybrid tier 1 instrument on its first call date on the 1st of October this year. With permission, we would then intent to redeem it.</p>
          <p>Our tier 1 capital ratio of 16.4% is therefore struck on the effective basis that CHF 1 billion of  the issue has already been redeemed. Our core tier 1 ratio which has been impacted by the reserve, but is not impacted by the planned redemption of the hybrid issue, was 13% at the end of June.</p>
          <p>We continue to seek to improve our net stable funding position. Our liabilities remain well diversified. Our deposits fund 43% of our balance sheet excluding our derivatives liabilities and our loan-to-deposit ratio remains at a healthy 72%. With the &#x20AC;1.75 billion issue of notes earlier this month, we've come close to meeting our replacement funding requirement for the year.</p>
          <p>In addition to our access to the public bond markets, we continue to enjoy good access to medium and long-term funds via our medium-term note program, Swiss Pfandbriefe, and Kassenobligationen. Our aim is to extend further the maturity profile of our liabilities opportunistically through further debt issuance.</p>
          <p>And with that, we now have some time to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, two questions please. Firstly, a terrific performance in equities, I just wondered if you could break it down a little bit for us. Why do you think you did so well in that business in what was a pretty tough quarter for almost all your competitors? And the second question is, on the balance sheet, quite noticeable that you now have a stronger tier 1 and FINMA leverage ratio than your closest peer. Given some of the changes we're seeing in regulation including the slight softening of Basel III yesterday, do you think we're getting any closer to the point where you might start to pay a dividend? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In equity quickly before John goes into more detail there, we have to do a lot of catching up. So we have been better in the past. Right, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a vote of confidence in the division. No, you're absolutely right. The division did slip a little during the course of the crisis and this is it, I think, recovering. The difference I suspect versus the results that have been reported by some of our competitors so far is probably in the derivatives arena. Our cash &#x2013; we've broken down, as you know, in the reports of our revenues. The cash business I think was relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. The derivatives business was also essentially flat, it was up a little bit, but we went into the quarter relatively well risk managed. We didn't have particularly long or short positions in relation to volatility, and that probably differentiates us against some of our competitors. We were not convinced that the markets were going to remain as positive as they had been through the first quarter and into April.</p>
          <p>So I think we probably just anticipated that's like volatility that happened after the flash crash. And that, essentially, I think is the differentiating factor. But as Ossie said, there's still some way to go to recover the levels of revenues that we were enjoying pre-crisis, which were CHF 1 billion higher per quarter.</p>
          <p>On the capital ratios, I think we still adhere to what we said last November at the Investor Day. There was a significant announcement last night, as you may know, from the supervisors, where they clarified a number of the rules for Basel III. And it's very early days; it's difficult to work out what they mean in the context of reading it over the breakfast table this morning. But it looks as though there's been some relaxation, both in the intensity of the regulation that will be applied, but also in the timing of the implementation. And essentially most of the concessions that have been made would be generally positive for us. The biggest issue, for me at least, was the CVA, and not to get too technical, but there was quite a stringent calculation method to CVA including a five times multiplier. The multiplier has been eliminated and there have been a number of concessions which  are not detailed on the calculation.</p>
          <p>So it may be that the pressure on our capital under Basel III will be relaxed a little. However we adhere to the capital requirements were imposed on us predominantly by the FINMA; and they have not changed. We also have a management view on how much capital we think we need and that hasn't changed either. And so our intention is to continue to accumulate capital through retention of earnings for some time to come. And we don't see a point during that period in unnecessarily paying dividends. We'd rather build up the capital base we feel the business needs. And from that basis, then share the profits of the company with shareholders on a cash basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Three quick questions, first of all, equity tier 1 of 16, can you again clarify your position on this number that we're hearing the FINMA is requiring and how you think about any loss absorbing capital or Co-Cos in that in that kind of calculation? Secondly is regarding FICC revenues, it looks like your 2 billion target looks unambitious especially now that you give the breakdown on Macro, which looks still very low. Can you discuss a little bit how you think about this number especially in light of the costs, the fixed costs, that come with this business and where this business run rate should really be on an ongoing basis compared to some of the peers?</p>
          <p>And lastly, holding structure, I don't think your holding structure yet, I read from the regulators that you have to go in that direction, I was wondering what is the impact, and do you need to incorporate somewhere else in the Investment Bank? And what would be &#x2013; outside of Switzerland, what would be the impact? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want me to go first on?  On the tier 1 capital, we still think we should target a core tier 1 ratio, a core tier 1 ratio of 16%. Now, we go back to the numbers that we gave at the time of the Investor Day. We think on a conservative basis, our risk-weighted assets might rise from just over 200 billion to call it 300 billion. The impact of Basel II in the half we still think's 50 to 60 billion. And then we'd allow for some expansion in our business.</p>
          <p>But if we took as a benchmark 300 billion of risk-weighted assets, then the 16% core tier 1 ratio equates to 48 billion of core equity. And at the moment, we're at about 20 billion short of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now within that, Kian you asked about loss-absorbing capital, we would expect all of the capital to be loss absorbing because we'd expect all of it to be equity. If we have a 16% minimum core tier 1 ratio and imposed on us, then if we're at 16, we essentially have no capital. So if we lose any, we have to replace it.</p>
          <p>And so the loss-absorbing capital, the CoCo,  to the extent that we could agree terms for the CoCo, would not be tier 1 capital because it's in the form of senior debt, a point sometimes lost on some people. It would be senior debt that converts into a fixed amount of capital, fixed either in amount or by reference to a formula in the event of a trigger event occurring, but that wouldn't enhance the ratio at the time and we'd expect it never to because we'd expect to manage the business on the basis we never got into difficulties again. So the basis of the core tier 1 ratio would be equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And not Basel III, just to clarify this....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not Basel III three yet. No, because we &#x2013; although there has been a very helpful announcement as I said overnight, it still doesn't have enough detail for us to be able to provide you with much certainty on the impact of it. We will try it at our next Investor Day to give you more information on that, but we may still struggle if the rules are still vague.</p>
          <p>On the question of the ambitiousness of the FICC targets, I think should hand that over the gentleman to my left, who has some views on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, when we announced the 2 billion target, I think most of you doubted that we ever reach that. It wasn't too long ago; it was during the course of last year, but that was just the interim target. And in the meantime, I think, I said publicly and to your colleagues as well that we have to have much more revenues in fixed income. Bank of our size, I think, should be nearer 4 billion instead of 2 billion.</p>
          <p>But we won't make that next quarter and we will try to get better from quarter-to-quarter there. But it is clearly depending on markets and we do not have a fixed target as such. We know we have to be much more active in that market, and know we have to generate much more revenues there. And as you said, at the same time we have to keep control on the costs because very easily, especially in that business, costs can be bigger than revenues.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question of the holding company, putting a holding company on top of the group doesn't actually do anything. The question is then what we do to the Bank and whether we divide up its business along regional lines or divisional lines into separate entities. And there is an emerging body of regulation that appears to want to move banks towards a more regional view of how they manage their affairs. And there's definitely a move towards incorporating branches around the world as subsidiaries and capitalizing those subsidiaries locally and funding them locally. And we'll obviously have to move with that flow; we keep an open mind. We have a team that constantly monitors these developments.</p>
          <p>There may be some profit friction in doing that because there will be some additional costs to maintaining a regional treasury. As you may know, we manage a global treasury book at the moment. As we have to subdivide up UBS AG into it's component parts, whether it'd be regionally, locally, divisionally, we will notice some drag on our profit. But it's far too early to say even broadly the direction in which we'll be moving now. But I think the trend is fairly clear, lots more subsidiaries separately capitalized to local regulatory standards.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Two questions. One, you alluded to the unlevel playing field for regulation at the beginning. And I was just wondering if you could share more perspectives and maybe as a specific, other jurisdictions will be delaying the incremental risk charge to 2012. Our understanding is that the Swiss regulator probably still puts it through in '11. Any clarity you can provide there will be useful?</p>
          <p>Number two, on the Wealth Management flows obviously, continuing improvement, I was wondering if you've seen any particular inflection since the U.S. settlement and whether you continue to have hopes for positive flows by the end of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said before &#x2013; as we said that over the last year that we do think that during the course of this year we will stop outflows. But as I mentioned as well in my introduction, in Wealth Management, you &#x2013; I think the first priority should be to serve your client and to manage the assets of your clients better than the competition and then you automatically will get more assets.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, in the last few years and probably started by UBS, clearly which had a huge influence there, people in Wealth Management especially in Switzerland concentrated on chasing net new assets and sometimes forgot that they also have to manage these assets properly. And so I think it became, yeah, in a way too much a measurement on how well Wealth Management is doing on adjusted new net asset number. And if you look at the Swiss Bank and compare them on the net new asset gains and their profitability and it probably won't be surprise to some to see that, yes, they have net new asset gains, but the profitability is declining. So that should tell you something. We try &#x2013; clearly, our first priority is to manage the existing clients much better than we have done so far and increase therefore the profitability for the clients and for the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the incremental risk charge, Huw, I think where that one may end up is the FINMA will apply it from the beginning of next year in the management of our capital position. But I think they will concede that, for comparability purposes, we can report the standard BIS ratio excluding it for the whole of 2011 and begin to report the BIS &#x2013; the publicized ratio in 2012 in line with other banks.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, on the Wealth Management gross margin on slide nine, I think in Q1 you mentioned a potential one-off that you weren't sure whether it would continue. So the real growth is 91 to 95. I just wondered if you could be a bit more specific on the drivers. I think you said pricing discipline was the main driver. If you could probably quantify it and the four things that you talk about there. And then also I think you were talking about 100 basis points being a minimum. It &#x2013; how far are we along the curve in terms of increasing pricing particularly? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is not so much about pricing, and it is really about bringing better services, bringing to the client more the objections on what to do with the investment. We did give a small warning on the margin, because in &#x2013; clearly in the market where there is very little turnover and the client are inclined to take very little risk then it will be more difficult to increase the margin, but also what we're suffering under here &#x2013; probably all over Europe is clearly the yield curve which is getting flatter and flatter and you have seen that our interest income is dropping like a rock and probably with all banks.</p>
          <p>So that has an impact. But in general I think how we manage on these days basis points gives you good picture of the quality of our client advisors and of the quality of our Wealth Management going forward. And since we are continuously trying to improve that, I am confident that over the slightly longer term, not necessarily quarter-to-quarter, but over the longer term, we will achieve pretty soon the 100 basis points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Mr. Jernej Omahen, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi there. It's Jernej here from Goldmans. I have essentially two questions. The first one actually refers to what Mr. Cryan mentioned before. Now if I quote this correctly, you said something along the lines of UBS anticipated a spike in volatility post the flash crash and hence, I guess the result of volatility trading wasn't as negative or perhaps was even positive when compared to other investment banks. A, did I get this right? B, does the sentence infer that there was a proposition in volatility in fall, so essentially being long haul, because I assume that similar to other investment banks, you would have gone naturally short volatility this quarter otherwise. And thirdly can you tell what the result was on this trade?</p>
          <p>And then finally I think the second question, very unexciting question, is just on your tangible book value per share which was up I think around 10% quarter-on-quarter, so it was up by 80 &#x2013; so CHF 0.8. I think earnings expand 0.5, can you just please give us a very simple explanation for what the residual is? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the volatility position, we sent a lot of options to our clients and as a consequence we're often, as many investment banks are, short volatility. And you have the option to risk manage that or let it run. If you let it run, then you could take the view that that's a prop position but we can cover it. And we thought in May that we'd better cover it, so we covered it. So it wasn't a trade that was intended to make money. It was a trade that was intended to avoid the risk that we lost money if we were short volatility and the value of it went up. So it was just good risk management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the tangible book value per share, there are also two ways of calculating this. The &#x2013; if you added the owned credit to the book value, then you need to look in the details of the report, but you'll see that there have been some foreign exchange and other credits to the capital base that have gone direct to capital. They're shown in the statement of the movement on the equity account.</p>
          <p>And as a consequence, given the &#x2013; and you add the 2 billion of earnings, all of which of course are retained because there's no dividend accrual. You should have seen that the book values went up. The number of shares didn't; it's still stable at 3.8 billion or so. And so you're right, there was a sizable increment in the book value per share, but it's largely explained by the whole of the 2 billion being added. And then I think it was quite a sizable number of 1.7 or &#x2013; it was s quite a significant number that's credited to equity directly rather than through the P&amp;L.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Couple of questions. Firstly, on the Investment Bank market shares, I'm referring to the primary business, where you had a 3.6% market share. Based on Dealogic data, this seems to be steadily eroding actually, and I'm wondering kind of is this a function of business mix or is there a time lag before it stabilizes and improves? Maybe if you could shed some light on that?</p>
          <p>Secondly on the &#x2013; on what you consider as the implications of a potential German double-tax treaty, especially in terms of your cross-border business in Europe? And final question if I may actually, if you had any kind of updated views on whether there was any scope to realize value on the latent gains potentially in the Stab Fund?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I take the first one. The first one I think you are alluding to slide 20?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I will advise there is it's difficult to draw a trend from two quarters, where the volume measured by deal size of transactions particularly in the M&amp;A market was very, very low. And if you compare our share in Q1 versus Q2, all you end up doing is concluding that in Q2 there were couple of very large deals and we happened to be involved in them to some extent, but we are on the losing side, whereas in Q1 we were involved in a couple of big deals and happened to be on the wining side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was actually comparing back to '07-'08-'09 as well, just using the same Dealogic data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But &#x2013; the trend is that we have slipped a little in market share, there's no doubt about that. But I wouldn't take the delta from Q1 to Q2 as indicative of anything that's happening at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the German double taxation &#x2013; double tax treaty that is in flow and I think both sides are trying to come to conclusion there. As we mentioned, I think at our Investor Day, we are relatively little impacted in relation to our overall assets if we should have asset outflows there. And on Investor Day, we said something between 25 and 50 billion in the whole of Europe which might be at risk, but we think they are &#x2013; there will be eventually some kind of agreement within Europe. And I think it will not only be bilateral agreements and so there have to be agreements which are accepted by the main EU states. And but in which direction they are going it is too early to say, and we have to wait till we hear something from our government in that respect.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have two questions. One, I was just tying to get my head around some of the supply demand dynamics in the private banker market. You sort of suggest you're going to net higher in the second half of this year and that could have a positive contribution on net new money. I think historically you've said when you go to the onshore markets you typically look outside of the traditional private banking ranks, and you look to hire investment bankers and people from outside of the financial industry.</p>
          <p>I was just wondering if you're suggesting there would be a change in that dynamic, if you're expecting net new money already. And then also it seems to me that everyone is looking to hire experienced private bankers and everyone only hires experienced private bankers and they get rid of bad private bankers. So, I mean where are these private bankers coming from, if you could just give us some insights there, and may be any knock-on impacts in terms of the cost we should be forecasting as we look out to 2011?</p>
          <p>That's a lot of questions, I guess, but it's all under one category. And then shifting over the Investment Bank, it's great disclosure you guys have given us for two quarters now that helps us understand the drivers of the business and equity trading and fixed income trading. But of course, it does sort of wing around a lot. And I'm just wondering in credit, obviously Q2 was a period where credit markets were basically shut and you were marking down your book every day. We've seen recovery so far in Q3. Is kind of normal run rate somewhere between Q1 and Q2, could Q3 benefit from a recovery of Q2, just maybe some insights into what's your thought are on credit markets, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Wealth Management, yes, you asked some interesting questions there, and they are not so easy to answer. Obviously, as you said, everybody is trying to get the wide of private bankers, and hiring a good private bankers. It's a sign of the times at the moment and not only in Wealth Management; that is happening in Investment Banking. It's happing in all divisions because after markets as we had in last few years, so people rediscover the real value of actually of good people and that is going on Wealth Management as well.</p>
          <p>Prices for a good people are the highest ever and there were a few good people around us usual and prices are going up in all markets. It doesn't mellow if it is in Asia or it is &#x2013; if it is in Europe or in and of the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Now I think, on the other hand, generally Wealth Management has lots of room for improving operational, for using modern technology. And so you will &#x2013; some of the costs clearly will be taking care of that way. And what you also do get is with better people generally that we do get more revenues and which will clearly justify slightly higher costs. But that is the very most important point in the Wealth Management operation. John?</p>

          <p>Okay. Just a supplemental point there, we recognize the difficulty in hiring new people which is why we refer to our training and hiring initiatives. And you may recall that although we've had a training facility in Singapore for some time, we set up a thing we call UBS University here in Switzerland which &#x2013; part of which is &#x2013; role is to train up client advisors private banking coverage officers. So essentially making our own because they're so scarce in the market.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to just to give you some indication of the kind of size and what kind of revenues we are spending on that, so our &#x2013; in term of University we are spending something like 100 million plus a year. So it's not just a little thing, it is something substantial.</p>

          <p>On the IB disclosure; thank you for the feedback on the disclosure. Inevitably in equities in fixed income, you are looking at sales and trading operations and they are inherently volatile and you should expect some of the revenues to bounce up and down from quarter-to-quarter. In the context of giving you the forecasts for the IB's revenues in the medium term, I think we said the component of the fixed income revenues that would comprise the credit business was around about 500 million per quarter. So it's a little bit higher than the 464 in Q2 and 744 in Q1 was even surprised us that it was relatively high now.</p>
          <p>Whether we set higher ambition levels for that business given that we now have it up and running, is different question. But when we set the medium term targets we thought something of the order of 2 billion a year, 500 million per quarter was the expected revenue take from credit.</p>

          <p>Good. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Now we will take questions from the room here. First in English, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Teresa Nielsen from Vontobel, I have a question regarding the gross margin in Wealth Management and in the first quarter you guided towards about 90 basis points which was sustainable. Would you guide towards 95 basis points now to be sustainable or is there part of it which is not sustainable going forward? And so is there a part sustainable non-sustainable and how do you see it going into the third quarter?</p>
          <p>Then there is &#x2013; I have a question regarding the profitability in Asia, do you see a large squeeze and do you believe that it will be squeezed a lot &#x2013; your profitability in Wealth Management in Asia due to the increasing relationship manager costs and increasing salaries here? And then regarding Lombard lending, I've assumed that the Lombard lending has been increasing. Has that led to a material positive effect on your net new money in Wealth Management? Has that been a large impact &#x2013; your Lombard lending? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Wealth Management margin I think it is &#x2013; we can't say that there is minimum we want to hold since we want to get to 100 basis points first and from then when we have done that, I think we would regard probably 100 basis points is more or less the what we should achieve as a minimum, but first we have to get there. These margins are affected quarter-by-quarter, by interest rates, by market activity and lots of other things as well as Lombard lending very clearly. We increased our Lombard lending little bit, but overall, our Lombard lending compared to the assets is marginal at best. And we have to do much more there, because it is a relatively safe business, if you have the right installations in place and the right operations.</p>
          <p>In Asia, there is &#x2013; so far, we can't see any squeeze on margin. Yes, salaries went up there but like in any other market and good people are enjoying the highest pay ever. But they are also producing more and although in Asia we want to increase actually our margin and have done so in the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Can we have next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Torsten Riecke with Germany's Business Daily Handelsblatt. I just wonder whether you could give us a breakdown of the outflows in the Wealth Management side, how much was affected by European customers, for example? And the second question would be about the third quarter, could you give us an outlook on the third quarter? You said that you expected the euro to rise over the course of the year. Are you confident that the market's calmed down and that we'll see less volatility over the next couple of months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't and we don't like to break down in too much detail where the outflows occur, but we did say that the bulk of the net outflows is still &#x2013; the problem area is still the cross-border business. And it's predominantly booking center Switzerland, and it's predominantly European business, but into more detail we don't go. That's the key area of focus, is still on the net new money flows.</p>
          <p>Now on the outlook. It's July and next month is August and half of our clients are probably on holiday, so it's very, very difficult to gauge from current activity levels any particular new trend. So I think the longer term trend is an improvement which you saw Q2 on Q1, and we'd expect that to continue. It will inevitably not be as even as we might like it to be, but we still are confident that we will turn the picture around and have net new money inflows in wealth management hopefully by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think generally in the second quarter of this year, you will &#x2013; after the next few weeks, we'll see less volatility probably and relatively good investor climate. But also I expect that this year more people will go on holidays than ever.</p>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel, how do you charge the resolve and especially the creditability of this banking &#x2013; the bank stress test in Europe? Are you now willing to give any credit, let's say, to a Spanish bank that has passed this test?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We cannot answer specific questions like that. But I think what this stress test did and even if it was mentioned in several media that it was not a real stress test and it was less strict as one had expected. But it did bring some calm into the market and since on Friday the results were announced that euro was stronger and generally I think some calm came into the market. So it did help quite a bit, I would say.</p>
          <p>Next question now.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Elena Logutenkova from Bloomberg News. Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel, UBS seems to be turning the corner in pretty much all its businesses. What is still giving you the biggest headache right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And I think I give you a call when I have a headache. But I think we have done a little bit more than turning the corner and I think we turned the corner already in the fourth quarter last year and we are going now in the normal operating mode and, as you can see, because take second quarter result and compare it, because obviously you have a result you have to see in comparison. And if you compare it with our peers, I think it looks very normal and relatively good. So our employees did a great job in the second quarter and that's how we want to go on going forward. And at the moment I have &#x2013; I never have any sleepless nights, as such, certainly not about the bank since I think I know what we are doing.</p>
          <p>Can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I just wanted to ask you a question on the U.S. Wealth Management business, it seems have improved, but still very costly operation that contributes little or nothing to the sort of overall profit of the company. So I'm just wondering, what is the strategic rationale of staying in this broker dealer business in the long-term for UBS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is &#x2013; it will be a very profitable business going forward and I think we have mentioned before that we have a long-term target to earn a billion a year. And but with &#x2013; like there with any other business, you first have to bring it in shape and that's what we have done in the last few months. And we have solidified our niche where we want to operate in. This niche business there are bigger competitors in that market, so we made sure that we want to be in the higher segment, in the higher client segment. And I think it is becoming very clear and we see signs that we are recognized there and that that strategy is working out.</p>
          <p>But yes, it took a long time and but since Bob McCann only joined at the end of October last year, so and his changes are now coming slowly smooth. But along we think it is a good business to be in, even if it has a high cost base but it is very predictable &#x2013; the costs are very predictable. And if you run it properly and you have run it properly, then it can generate quite some value.</p>
          <p>Can we now take questions in German please? In Deutsch?</p>
