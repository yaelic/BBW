          <p>Good morning and welcome to this press conference for our Full Year Results 2012. There's quite a lot of interest in the room. So if I could ask everybody to be seated before we start, because we also have a webcasted conference.</p>
          <p>I know that there are many questions and some of them may be related to our investment in Uzbekistan. But as you know the report on that will be made public tomorrow. So we will devote the time here today to deal with our full year results.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to hand over to Lars Nyberg to give some introductory words and then Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m, our Head of IR, will be moderating the Q&amp;A session afterwards. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Welcome. I think we had a decent fourth quarter. The whole year turned out also to be pretty good; nearly SEK105 billion in revenue. We actually grew the revenue 1.2% in local currencies. The EBITDA margin pressure is the sign of the industry. We feel the same pressure as everybody else and therefore the margin percentage went down at 1% roughly. Still we have one of the highest EBITDA margins in the industry for a comparable company.</p>
          <p>We had a fantastic cash flow, not only driven by the MegaFon deal. The earnings per share actually is the highest, second highest actually since the merger between Telia and Sonera. It's driven very much by lower minority share. And we increase in Kazakhstan, of course, we pay less to the other owners and that helps our EPS, and also of course the lower taxes helped to drive this SEK4.59.</p>
          <p>This is something we have managed pretty well, I believe. Over the years, the relationship between what happens with the revenue goes up, goes down to manage the OpEx in a similar way. So if the revenue growth comes down, then the OpEx has to come down. I'm pretty proud of this.</p>
          <p>Yes, there is a negative trend in the EBITDA margin. I think it's an industry trend, but it's also driven by the fact that we sell more equipment. We sell more of phones and particularly more expensive phones than before. We also have &#x2013; and this is &#x2013; I'll come back to that in a minute, we have lower billed revenues, which is really the core of our business, and I'll make some comments on the billed revenues later on.</p>
          <p>So we announced already in October that we need to continue to work on our cost structure. Again, I think, this is an industry trend, not only for TeliaSonera. And our ambition is to fundamentally change by simplifying and focusing the product portfolio, how we manage our networks whether they are fixed networks or the mobile networks.</p>
          <p>Our ambition is to save the SEK2 billion we talked about in the last quarter. We talked about 2,000 people at that time. We still have 2,000 people net number ambition. We did manage to reduce our head count during last year by 300 people and we have 1,800 people planned for the Nordic and the Baltics this year.</p>
          <p>The net savings will only be 1,500, because we also plan to hire 300 people, because we have competence shift. The whole industry has a competence shift from analog to digital technology. And we need to have more people with that knowledge.</p>
          <p>And for Sweden that means that the gross number we planned for this year is 900 and the net number is 700, because we intend to hire 200 people with a new competence in Sweden. There's significant costs involved, I call them investments, to do these changes, SEK1.7 billion, but it's absolutely necessary.</p>
          <p>Yes, we did see in the fourth quarter a bit uptick on the billed revenue, which is encouraging, but of course for the full year the billed revenue has come down. And on the right-hand side, you see the challenge of the telecom industry. On the right-hand side, you see the summary of the challenge of the industry.</p>
          <p>Our traditional business, the business we've had for 150 years called voice, is coming down by 10% in revenue. You see the volume is actually up 1%, but the price erosion is such that the revenue comes down by 10%. That is by far the biggest business that we have. And the same thing with messaging.</p>
          <p>And then you have data, gross 21% in revenue, which is good, cannot totally compensate the downturn in voice and messaging, but look also at the traffic volume of 79% and this is of course the whole issue about the business model. Can we capture more of the 79% then only 21%, because the billed revenues when you add it all up is minus 2%. This is the issue for the telecom industry globally.</p>
          <p>I have said many times that the future of telecommunication is not only the mobile network. I believe and I still believe and now I think most people are convinced that the fixed network will be so important in the future, because it's the most efficient way to provide telecommunication services to fixed locations like our homes or our offices; of course, not based on copper, but based on fiber. So when we increase the number of fiber customers and TV customers, we talk about triple-play, that's a very good sign for the future of TeliaSonera.</p>
          <p>Yes, Eurasia remains our growth engine. We had a growth of 16% in the quarter, 14% for the full year. And I like to point out that we have &#x2013; since 2007, we have nearly quadrupled the business in Eurasia. And the three last markets we entered Uzbekistan, Tajikistan in 2007 and Nepal in 2008, stands now for half of the business in Eurasia. And Eurasia has a very healthy EBITDA margin of north of 50%.</p>
          <p>The year also included resolution finally of our Russian situation. I think we invested SEK1.5 billion totally in MegaFon and we realized the value of something north of SEK55 billion that's a fantastic investment. However, we have never seen any cash until last year.</p>
          <p>I was very happy with the yield we did in the beginning of 2012 where we sold out the ownership, we have a minority stake in the end, and Mr. Usmanov has the majority stake. The deal in MegaFon is really several steps. The first step was that we sold shares. We went down from 43.8%. We sold our shares in TCI, total illiquid shares; couldn't be sold unless we sold them to Usmanov. We managed to do that and then we did the IPO, which &#x2013; IPO is very good for the governance of MegaFon. To be listed on the London Stock Exchange is good for the governance, and we have still 25-plus-percent ownership in MegaFon.</p>
          <p>In Kcell we went the other way. In Kcell, like all other entities, we would like to own more than we did. If you remember, for years we owned 51% via Fintur. So in actual fact, TeliaSonera only own 37.9%, but we had 100% of the work.</p>
          <p>So we said earlier, we done it now other markets, still we would like to own more. And we managed to convince the authorities in Kazakhstan to sell their 49% stake in Kcell to us with a promise and agreement with them that we would do an IPO and have Kcell listed in London, and then of course we sold shares for that IPO.</p>
          <p>And we now have 60% &#x2013; well, 62% ownership instead of less than 40% plus that Kcell is now listed in London, which was also good for the governance of Kcell. So I'm very pleased with these transactions. Obviously, they have heavily influenced the cash generation in the company during last year.</p>
          <p>Still, the board agreed or decided to maintain the dividend of SEK2.85. I know there were some expectations maybe you wanted more, or not you, but the shareholders. I want to remind you that at SEK2.85 you have a yield of more than 6%. That's pretty high compared to most other companies. And I also like to point out that some operators during last year in Continental Europe particularly have reduced the dividends or even eliminated the dividend. I feel comfortable with this dividend.</p>
          <p>A couple of words about sustainability; we talked about the Danish Institute and the Human Rights Impact Assessment. We have now finished the collection of data. So now the analysis is being done and out of the analysis comes the action plan. So I think we are making progress on this one.</p>
          <p>The Industry Dialogue, the board approved actually to sign the Industry Dialogue recently and we expect that the other 10 companies will sign together with us very soon hopefully. And we have been pretty active in defining what these principles are which I am pleased with.</p>
          <p>We are also, since the fall of last year, strengthening our anti-corruption processes and particularly the supply chain. And Transparency International is an organization we work with on this issue.</p>
          <p>The outlook, I agree, is a bit cautious. Flat sales, EBITDA margin will go up slightly because of the cost savings and the CapEx-to-sales of about 14%. I agree it's a bit cautious. I think it's time to be a bit cautious, to have a strong balance sheet and a cautious outlook. I feel comfortable with this. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's then look at the fourth quarter and also parts of our balance sheet that has changed slightly dramatically during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>When I look at the fourth quarter today, I feel very pleased with the outcome. I was a bit more worried at the beginning of the quarter when I looked at the numbers, but we actually ended up with an increase of our net sales with 1.8%. We had a decent margin on the EBITDA level, 33.2%. We are increasing our earnings per share with 35%, and the cash flow is up with close to SEK3 billion.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the net sales growth, it ended for the whole year at 1.2%. It has been very sort of uneven distributed during the year. We started the year with a growth of close to 3%. And at that point in time, I think that analysts thought we were a bit too pessimistic about our outlook. But I think we were right after the second and third quarter, where we had flattish growth, and at the end of the year we came up with the 1.8%.</p>
          <p>What has actually happened in the fourth quarter is that we have seen positive trends in Eurasia and also within mobility. Eurasia have growth in all seven entities. When it comes to mobility, we see a good growth in Spain and Sweden. And we remain more or less at the same negative trends within broadband that we have seen during the last two or three quarters.</p>
          <p>If we then take Sweden which has had, I will say, tremendous development over the last, I will say, 24 quarters, we had 22 consecutive quarters of growth. We then had a flattish quarter and now we're back in the growth mode again.</p>
          <p>In this fourth quarter, they actually added on roughly 90,000 customers. They have had growth in billed revenue with 4%. And behind that you have a decline of voice 4%, messaging up with 5%, data up with 19%, and services up with 72%. At the same time, our equipment sales went up with 20%, close to SEK960 million in a quarter. And what is interesting today is that 15% of the phones sold are 4G compatible. So a lot of 4G phones are sold right now.</p>
          <p>We talked about broadband and you can say that it is slightly a disappointment when it comes to the &#x2013; now that we haven't sort of seen the improvement. The margin has also declined both in Finland and Sweden, and it is connected to gross margin compression, but also that we have been a bit slow in taking out the costs that we should have done during the year.</p>
          <p>We are now working with this and try to increase the pace. We have also invested for the future. And as Lars mentioned here, we have close to 650,000 fiber customers we have &#x2013; in the whole area of broadband. We have close to 600,000 customers in IPTV. And this is the base, I will say, for the future growth that will come hopefully during 2014.</p>
          <p>Eurasia, I mentioned that they were growing in all countries. We have &#x2013; except three clusters. We have one cluster with Moldcell, Geocell, Kcell and Tcell where they are growing at 3% to 4%. We have Azercell in Azerbaijan with 8% and then Ncell and Ucell growing with 41.4% and Ucell close to 77%.</p>
          <p>If we then look at Kcell that actually was listed and have been sort of under pressure when it comes to the, especially, the price side, ARPU is going down with roughly 17% in the quarter. At the same time, they are adding on 777,000 subscribers. So they have today more than 13 million subscribers in Kazakhstan.</p>
          <p>When we go to Uzbek, we added on quite a lot of subscribers in the third quarter, more or less flattish in the fourth quarter, and we can now see sort of the volume that we increased on the subscriber base now yielding also on the turnover side. And we are more than 9 million subscribers also in Uzbek, which is also the case for Ncell where we have 9 million subscribers and EBITDA margin of roughly 63%, 64%. So, so far I will say that the Nepal investment has been a fantastic investment.</p>
          <p>Lars mentioned that gross margin is still under pressure and that's very, very true. We have talked about the product mix shift before, which is still evident when it comes to broadband. High connection cost in especially Eurasia, equipment sales, but also now that billed revenue is going down, which is our high margin business actually impacting the gross margin. And we are working with this now going forward to make sure that we can stabilize the gross margin, also to improve the result.</p>
          <p>Given that we have had top line under pressure compression on the gross margin, we have worked with our rest of the cost base in a pretty good way during last year and years. But still it's not enough given the trends we see, and that's why we have initiated a SEK2 billion cost reduction program. And the ambition is that if we then exclude Spain, which has sort of another pattern than the other companies, we started off third quarter with a cost base of SEK27.3 billion. We have taken out SEK200 million now in the fourth quarter and we will go down until the end of 2014 down to SEK25.3 billion.</p>
          <p>We do this because, as Lars said, that we would like to protect our margin. And I would just like to remind you that this is not a walk in the park. It's a lot of people that we should take out. We should make sure that we continue to improve our processes, but we need to do this just to protect our margin. We have said that we will probably slightly increase this, but it will be a tough call. So it will take time and a lot of effort to just protect the margin as we have today.</p>
          <p>Turning into the associates, they have had a pretty solid quarter. Now MegaFon, as a listed company, has also one quarter delayed reporting. Underlying business in both Turkcell and MegaFon is improving. When you look at the MegaFon numbers, you see it's a downward trend. That is depending on lower economic ownership in MegaFon, but also that they have some cost for transactions that we did during 2012, both on accounts to higher funding cost and also FX cost.</p>
          <p>A number of different non-recurring items in Q4, but also during the year; we sent out a press release a week ago to remind you about what has happened. And in the Q4, we had the gain from the sales of the MegaFon shares of SEK5.4 billion. We have done two write-downs on goodwill, one in NextGenTel, given that we disposed that asset, SEK1.5 billion; and in NetCom, another SEK2.9 billion for &#x2013; after reviewing the goodwill.</p>
          <p>So overall, the net in the fourth quarter was SEK189 million plus. For the whole year, it ended up with minus SEK289 million. And the whole gain from the MegaFon deal, that also Lars discussed, was SEK8.4 billion. We have with all the write-downs in the goodwill written down roughly 10% of the goodwill that we have in the balance sheet. So it has been a very aggressive write-down session during 2012.</p>
          <p>We also had some positive one-time effects. The tax, new tax rates in Sweden going down from 26% to 22% meant a SEK1.2 billion gain for us in the fourth quarter. That means that we ended up with a tax rate of 13.6% and in the quarter actually plus 0.2%. That will not continue even though I would like to have it like that, but we would expect roughly 20% in tax rate and roughly 85% in paid tax during the coming year and years.</p>
          <p>We talked about the improved earnings per share and I talked about the tax here as a contributor to the improved EPS. You can see in the quarter SEK0.34 was connected to the taxes, and also the minority interest increase was roughly 10%. So an increase of 34%, 35% Q4, and 9% on the whole year basis.</p>
          <p>And I would say also, given the industry environment that also Lars described, I think is a very, very strong result, and it's very &#x2013; I think there's very few operators that will likely increase their EPS during this year.</p>
          <p>CapEx-to-sales, 14.6%; a bit higher than we have anticipated. When we look at 2013, we will go down to 14%, which means that especially Eurasia will have to sort of decrease the relation, what we call, the CapEx-to-sales. They are today above 20%, close to 23%. They are expected to go down below 20%. And it also means pure mathematically that we will cut somewhat on the CapEx in 2013, given that we are flattish on our plan, but still we're talking about investments around SEK14.5 billion year-over-year, which is a big amount.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, we have had extremely strong cash flow during the whole year, close to SEK24 billion; in the last quarter SEK3 billion, which was connected to less cash CapEx in the quarter and also a positive change in the working capital.</p>
          <p>If we look at the whole quarter, we have, of course, gained by the SEK12 billion in dividend that we got from MegaFon, but we have not received any dividends from Turkcell. So this is also, what I will say, very, very strong underlying cash flow of SEK12 billion that we're actually getting from our operations.</p>
          <p>So I will say, I'm very, very satisfied and I wish we were always this satisfied with the cash flow generation during 2012, which has also meant that we have improved our net debt situation; has come down from SEK65 billion to below SEK60 billion. You can see all the details what has happened during the year. And that has also meant that our net debt to EBITDA has gone down from 1.75x to 1.65x. The ones that are looking at our numbers during the year know that we have also peaked close to 2x during the year. Now we are, as I say, in the range; not below, not above, but we are well in the range of our target range, 1.5x to 2x.</p>
          <p>And that gives us a solid situation as well as if we look at our debt maturity schedule. This is the loans that we have. And the coming year we need to refinance SEK6 billion; the coming three years, SEK23 billion, which is not a big amount given the size of our company. And we have also tried to prolong debt maturities to actually mirror the investment cycle that we have. We are investing in long-term assets, 15 years to 20 years, perhaps even 30 years. And we actually made an issuance in September, 15-year Eurobond and in December a 30-year sterling.</p>
          <p>So summarizing the highlights from 2012, we have defended revenues; we have improved earnings per share, generating a very, very strong cash flow. We made IPOs, I will say, in a pretty difficult market in December in &#x2013; within two weeks, both for MegaFon and Kcell. We also sold and divested our Norwegian broadband business, increased our ownership in TEO, a lot of activities when it comes to M&amp;A during 2012.</p>
          <p>We have launched efficiency programs, and I feel that we have a strong and solid financial position to meet a very tough market the coming year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Per-Arne. You've heard outlook from Lars before. I will invite Lars back to the podium. My name is Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m, happy to be here one last time, Head of IR to guide you through the Q&amp;A session. Quite a lot of people here today both on the phone on the web and here of course in Stockholm. We will start with a few question s here in Stockholm. And maybe I see a hand from Stefan. Please introduce yourself and your company name, please.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Stefan Gauffin, Nordea. Couple of questions. First, with &#x2013; you already stated your guidance was a bit conservative. Just looking at the trends at the moment, Eurasia improving growth from 12% to 16% this quarter and much driven by Uzbekistan and we should see that trend continue. We also see Kazakhstan improving the growth trend.</p>
          <p>So my view is that Eurasia should continue at these growth levels. We also have quite easy comparable quarters in mobility in Q2, Q3 this year, and you also stated that you have seen increased intake in fiber. So my view is that this is a truly conservative guidance. Where am I wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. You sound like some of my colleagues. But I feel a bit uncertain about the telecomm industry. This whole shift of voice going down 10%; you have to realize voice is our biggest business by far. If that 10% becomes 15%, it will have a huge impact on us and how quickly can we change the business model and capture more of the data, that's sort of the uncertainty.</p>
          <p>If we would be able now this year, which I hope we will, to establish a new business model that actually flies, I would be a whole lot less concerned and maybe be more brave. But this is the best judgment that PA and I have &#x2013; and our colleagues have done. It is a bit conservative, but it has good reasons to be conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may add, I think, that we see 2013 as a transitional year. I mean, there's a lot of things that happens here with investment in fiber, new business models et cetera and that's why we &#x2013; I think we're a bit cautious. But remember the first quarter last year we were accused of being too pessimistic and <mark type="inaudible" /> so it's &#x2013; you have to be a bit cautious in this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the question on Turkcell. There was a ruling yesterday, maybe a bit unclear ruling, but you have earlier blocked dividends from Turkcell. Has your position around dividends in Turkcell changed in anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think the issue of dividend is the biggest issue. We have a conflict between the owners of Turkcell and that needs to be resolved. We have a deadlock. In this case we talk about between the Russians and &#xC7;ukurova. And the decision yesterday I view as one step at least forward in resolution. Unfortunately, it is not clear-cut decision as you say, but at least it's a step forward. I assume that we will restore a dividend as soon as possible and certainly no later than when the deadlock is resolved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stefan. We have one question from Sven here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Sven Sk&#xF6;ld from Swedbank. A question on mobility. You mentioned that voice revenues down roughly 10%. If you split out Denmark, which is obviously very weak market, how is it &#x2013; how does it look then?</p>
          <p>Second, it's the second quarter in a row where you actually gained some subscribers in Finland and that has not been the history if you're looking at 12 or 24-month perspective. Has anything changed in your offers in Finland or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We could think that with Finland we have introduced a new offering that could be completed with &#x2013; from the other competitors. You can say it's from the free roaming in the whole Nordic-Baltic area and that has sort of turned out to be very good. So I think that's one of the things that we have changed in Finland.</p>

          <p>Ola Westerberg, Swedish News Agency. Lars Nyberg, could you please clarify what you meant this morning when you said you were not employed, you were not there when the decision was made to invest in Uzbekistan? I mean, the deal with Takilant &#x2013; the partnership deal was closed in December 2007. New deals were made in 2008 and 2010. It sounds like you were employed.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I tried to say was that I am very happy that tomorrow we will get an external report. It's a very complicated transaction in a very complicated legal environment. And a big portion of the transaction was done in a timeframe where I don't know the details, because I wasn't there physically. So at that &#x2013; what I was trying to say was, I'm happy that we tomorrow get an external report from renowned legal firm, who understands the legal aspects of this, who have gone through all the details. And we will talk about that report tomorrow. Tomorrow.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thomas Heath with Handelsbanken. Two questions if I may. Firstly, keen to hear a little bit about the Swedish fiber rollout, particularly take up rates. When you started the projects there was some uncertainty about the return on this investment. Maybe if you could comment a bit on the earlier projects.</p>
          <p>And then secondly on working capital, you discussed earlier this year that you were starting to look into this. It would appear to me that there is some structural headwind there with increasing handset sales and TVs and so forth. So what can you do from a company point of view and what expectations do you have to deal with working capital? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to start with working capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You take them both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can take both. Let's start with the working capital then. Now, I mean, we have been working with sort of dissecting what is actually is included in this and what has driven sort of the consumption or higher working capital over the last few years, higher prices on phones and also that we however shifted from prepaid to postpaid.</p>
          <p>So what we are doing right now is to look into this how this could be mitigated within sort of the offerings. And also just the knowledge of this &#x2013; these all effects has helped us to have a much better control.</p>
          <p>But, of course, over time if prices on handsets will go up, that will affect the operating capital negative from our perspective. But I think we have increased our awareness of how we deal with these issues.</p>
          <p>And went it comes to the fiber rollout, we have been working with that pretty intensely now during 2012 to improve the rollout processes and I've been very deeply involved in this. And what we could see is that we had a very low ambition when it comes to uptake from the very beginning, we talked about 25% or 30% and perhaps we're going up to 50%. In certain areas where we had done a good job, we come up to 60%, 70%, 80% <mark type="inaudible" />. That's why we are a bit optimistic.</p>
          <p>If we do this in the right way, the demand for fiber is, I wouldn't say unlimited but it's very easy to sell with the right pricing and with the right distribution and selling process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Thomas. We have a number of questions on the conference call. We will come back to the floor in just a minute. But operator, could we please have the first question from the conference call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The first question comes from the line of Dominik Klarmann [HSBC]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen. First question on your growth profile and just looking at it without JoyGo, it would look significantly weaker and I'm wondering how you would address that. Would you become more acquisitive and if so would you look for acquisitions outside your footprint, consolidation, or rather small bolt-on and stuff like the recent acquisition in Sweden? Any change in direction there, any new thinking?</p>
          <p>And then maybe on roaming elasticity where you in the last couple of quarters explained that you're quite encouraged by the trends you are seeing. How is that evolving and is that actually maybe a driver of the better trends in mobility also this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars. I think actually running our own business, our current business is the answer to compensate for growth that was generated by JoyGo. And I think the real opportunity is both in the broadband, the fixed network, the fiber, IP and of course the mobile data, which is related to the change with the business model.</p>
          <p>I think that's a bigger answer to the question than acquisitions. Yes, of course, we are always looking at acquisitions and nothing has really fundamentally changed. We haven't done that many acquisitions. We also done some divestitures. I really think that the answer for growth lies in our own current business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Maybe just to follow-up there and did I get that right that you're actually hoping to see broadband or fixed line in Sweden at least returning to revenue growth next year. Is that the --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I wouldn't say next year, but I'm convinced we will see revenue growth in broadband. The question is &#x2013; it's an equation where the traditional voice goes down and the triple-play goes up. And at a certain point in time, I am convinced that the growth in triple-play fiber will be bigger than the decline in the copper base.</p>
          <p>So, yes, there will be growth. Whether it's going to be next year or the year after or the year after, I'm not totally sure. I'm very encouraged &#x2013; like PA says, I'm very encouraged about the uptick and on more professional rollout of the fiber investments that we have done, particularly in Sweden.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three questions if I may. On the Sweden Mobile, we saw quite an encouraging improvement. Is there anything particular area driving this you can see in your business? And secondly, are you able to quantify the benefit to EBITDA in Spain from switch to handset instrument plan, perhaps the year-on-year benefit to EBITDA? And then thirdly, if you could just remind us on how easily do you repatriate cash across your Eurasian market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the mobile business in Sweden, I think the positive sign is driven both by consumer but also business-to-business. And when &#x2013; as PA said, when we entered the fourth quarter, particularly the business-to-business was something we were a little bit concerned about. It seemed that the customer &#x2013; big customers were delaying their decisions. But it turned out, they didn't. So the activity level was pretty high actually in the end of the fourth quarter. So I would write the reasons on both consumer side and the business-to-business in mobile Sweden.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, we could repatriate cash in all countries, I will say except Uzbek, where we have limited sort of possibilities to convert into dollars. Otherwise, there's no &#x2013; not a problem at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Operator, could we have one more question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from line of Barry Zeitoune [Joh. Berenberg, Gossler &amp; Co. KG]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I've got a few questions. The first one is looking at data volume and data revenue growth, it seems that the conversion rate is still about 25% to 30% in terms of revenue growth to data volume growth. My question is do you think that you can improve that from where we are today? And also taking into account spectrum costs, does that mean that data is a NPV positive opportunity for you?</p>
          <p>My second question is if I look at the growth in smartphone penetration and the growth in postpaid data package uptake, it seems pretty consistent in terms of around about 70% of new smartphone customers roughly are taking a data package within mobility services. Is this being driven &#x2013; is this consistency being driven by falling smartphone prices or is it being driven by falling data prices?</p>
          <p>And then my third question is on Turkcell and really whether the political backdrop in Turkey seems to support Turkish ownership. So does this limit your long-term strategic capability in terms of where you can go with your ownership in Turkcell? I'll leave it at that for now I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Barry. We can <mark type="inaudible" />. Do you want to start with Turkcell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start with Turkcell. Yeah. Now, we own something like 37% of Turkcell. And we're pretty happy with that ownership. I think we are good owners. I think Turkcell is an interesting company with an interesting market. We need to get a resolution on the deadlock between the owners. If and when that happen, I think we can go different ways.</p>
          <p>I clearly would like to stay in Turkcell. I think that's a good investment. But exactly how and under what conditions I'm not sure. It depends very much on the other owners and the other regulators and the authorities.</p>
          <p>So our focus has been to try, just like we did in Russia, in Russia we did actually resolve the long deadlock. And we hope that we can during this year also resolve the deadlock in Turkcell. That's at least my ambition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On account sort of the question of how we are sort of picking the data package, I don't think it's a question of either price on the services or the handset. I think it's the questions of &#x2013; we are used to use the handset today. I mean, we need &#x2013; I mean, everyone has a phone and we need to be connected to Internet all the time and I think that's what's actually driving this increase not so much the prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other one I would like to comment on the ratio of revenue growth versus traffic growth, it's about 25%, 30%, which is not too bad. Can we improve it was the question. Yes, I think we can improve it, but also very important is when we move to new technology, to 4G technology, the cost of producing a megabyte is significantly lower than producing the same megabyte in 3G. So it's not an issue only of how much can we catch of the traffic growth in terms of revenue growth, it's also in what system are we generating the services is 3G or 4G.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which means that it's extremely important to have a good control over the production cost in different systems going forward. Of course, then we'll have the margin development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask a quick follow-up? In terms of 4G then are you saying a better volumes revenue trade off with 4G than you are with traditional data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not what I said. I said the cost of producing a megabyte is lower. And therefore, if you have a lower cost, you can off course accept a lower ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's my whole logic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so would you be willing to accept a lower ratio than where you are today? Would that still be profitable with 4G?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to have a higher ratio but &#x2013; and that's is all about this business model. But I just wanted to add the information...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...but I'm not sure you will understand that the cost of producing a megabyte is much lower in one technology compared to the other one and that's not unimportant for the profitability of our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Absolutely. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you said Barry that 70% takes a data package. I think that's quite conservative actually. I think in Sweden at least it's 90%. And as Per-Arne indicated in his presentation, 15% of the phones that we sell today are 4G enabled. And obviously if you buy a 4G phone, you take a data package.</p>
          <p>With that I think then we go back to floor for a few question. We have &#x2013; before Erik, we have the lady here on the second row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" /> Two questions here. You mentioned that you have gained more customers in Finland because of this free roaming in the Nordic countries. How about the &#x2013; in Telia in Sweden, is there any possibility?</p>
          <p>And the other question is, you write here that our ambition is to fundamentally change our business and so on and so forth. But you &#x2013; haven't you be doing this or so what is new?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's very correct. We have been doing a lot of cultural changes in the last five, five and a half years. But we haven't spent that much time on the product portfolio and how we generate our services. So our technical networks, the fixed and the mobile, we've been focusing on other areas. And where this &#x2013; the technology shift now from analog to digital, it's time to really look into that &#x2013; those areas and that's what I'm referring to, because we should have &#x2013; TeliaSonera should have a product portfolio second to none in the marketplace. We don't have that in my opinion.</p>
          <p>We also don't have the traditional pruning the product portfolio. That means for the end of life to certain products. That's not in our DNA. We tend to keep product till the last customer, abandon the product, and then somebody even &#x2013; but we will still keep it &#x2013; maybe somebody comes back. We can't afford that. We have to prune the products so we release money to develop new products and that is fundamentally changed the way we operate our product portfolio management as well as our network management.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean we have not perhaps exactly the same offering. What we did, as Lars mentioned before here, introduced sort of limited roaming cost that you can cut through the cost in different countries where you're roaming in our own network but also other ones. So I think we have a wider offering for Sweden, but slightly different to what we having in London.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Erik Pers, Danske Markets. I have a question regarding the relation between, again, data, revenues and both the traffic growth. It seems to me that in at least the three out of the four Nordic markets, the standard data packages allows for far more data &#x2013; includes far more data than people actually use. And once everybody has the data package then, which is soon the case, then its &#x2013; it becomes very hard to grow your revenues in data it seems. Do you agree this is a strategic question and how do you see that can be resolved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, we agree that's a strategic question. And that is part of the discussion how we change the business model. That is part of how to change the business model. What price plans should we have. It's very interesting. I mean, in the U.S., Verizon and AT&amp;T, they have flat fee for voice. I think the industry is going that way at least for domestic voice.</p>
          <p>And then of course they have another model for data with smaller buckets. So you feel that you do have to pay a little bit more if you use twice as much capacity as you did the year before. That's the business model that they are using and we're going that way or we are all going in that direction I think in the industry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think that's the solution. But I won't tell you what I think the solution. We are working on it.</p>

          <p>Thomas Nielsen, Pareto &#xD6;hman. Could you just remind us or update us on the situation in Uzbekistan in terms of the situation with MTS whether it's <mark type="inaudible" /> or MTS or anyone else would re-launch and how we should think about the, Lars, market share and the penetration in the country going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, it's a nightmare for an operator to lose its license and MTS did lose its license. And I understand they've also filed for bankruptcy with the local company in Uzbekistan. I think we should assume that this will not stay a market with two players. I cannot believe that in the medium-term at least. And whether there it's MTS who comes back or somebody else, I don't know. I don't know more than you do. But our assumptions is &#x2013; so our assumptions are that there will be a market in Uzbekistan with three players.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Johanna Ahlqvist from SEB Enskilda. Two questions. First of all, the broadband business, we saw, you mentioned also that there was quite one-off effects in the quarter related to the poor margins. But how should we view in general broadband margins going forward in 2013 given the cost cutting program? How much was one-off effect and how much can be done?</p>
          <p>And secondly, Norway, you divested the broadband business and also took &#x2013; I think it's two goodwill write-downs related to mobility side. What is your strategic view on Norway going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, Norway, I think Norway is it's very important market for us. We are number two obviously and behind the incumbent Telenor. I think it was right analysis and the right decision to divest the broadband business, because I believe in broadband, but only if you have your own network, we didn't have our own network. If you want to be fixed network provider of triple-play, you better have your own infrastructure, especially if your name is TeliaSonera. So I think that was a natural divestiture.</p>
          <p>In mobility, NetCom is doing a good job. And I think we absolutely have a place in Norway. I don't think we ever going to be number one, but &#x2013; and healthy number two, it's okay for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the margin, I think that the ambition is in the first phase actually to stabilize it. I mean, we have lost close to 2% units during 2012 within broadband. And &#x2013; but if you look at the phasing of the cost cuts, I will say that for broadband they are a bit more backend loaded during 2013. And you would &#x2013; so you &#x2013; I don't think that you would expect to see this improvement in the first quarter. It will take a bit more time than for example for mobility.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions. The first one was on the gross margin stabilization. I wondered &#x2013; given a lot of the pressure is sort of outside of your control regarding higher interconnect and equipment costs, what measures do you think you can actually take to stabilize the gross margin?</p>
          <p>And then the second question was on your leverage &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; is this going to come down toward sort of very low end of your net debt to EBITDA range? So by the middle of the year, would you consider a sort of special dividend or buyback I guess in the second half of the year once where &#x2013; once the Uzbekistan investigation has concluded? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I start with the gross margin stabilization, quite a bit of the $2 billion savings program is actually not on OpEx but on COGS, cost of goods sold, which will help stabilizing the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think what you have there is sort of the effects from interconnect and that's of course if that's stabilized, we will automatically have the stabilization. But we're also looking at sort of how to &#x2013; sort of look at the hardware pricing. It's a lot of different issues that we are working with right now. And I don't think that we should really expect the stabilization to come next quarter. This is the work that it will take time. So that's why we are a bit &#x2013; as I said before that it's &#x2013; it's not a walk in the park, it's pretty tough here in front of right now when it comes to the cost side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions, please. First one, Lars, your comments a few minutes ago about you know the NextGenTel and the lack of a sufficient infrastructure. May I ask you how do you view your current fixed line infrastructure in Denmark?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if I may, and I'm sorry, I don't mean to ignore Per-Arne, but I guess for you as well Lars, the 2009 agreement with Altimo related to MegaFon and Turkcell, is that still valid at least as regards to Turkcell or if not has it been replaced by another agreement sort of between yourself and Altimo? Any update on the status on this will be appreciated. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one. I mean, the agreement we made with Altimo has actually expired and the whole structure that we agreed upon has been turned out to be very different in reality, because we were going to resolve MegaFon and Turkcell and put them into an holding company. Now we decided at the beginning of last year that Altimo sold its share, its ownership in MegaFon. So they are out of MegaFon. We are now partnering with Usmanov in MegaFon.</p>
          <p>We are still &#x2013; I feel we still have a partnership with the three when it comes to Turkcell, but we don't have a written formal agreement and nobody &#x2013; I don't think any side feels a necessity of making that. We are jointly on the board and we do communicate and we do talk to each other and we will see how the resolution comes out. I think we have a good relationship with them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, after we sold Stofa, we have very little left on the fixed line side. I think it's 1% of our business. But, Per-Arne, do you want to comment on fixed line strategy in Denmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we should &#x2013; I mean we are a very small player and I don't think that we could expand very much of that and it's &#x2013; I think that's the part of the annual review that we do on different markets and for us it's important to be able to combine perhaps fixed with &#x2013; especially when it comes to the corporate clients.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys. Couple of quick ones. On the SEK2 billion cost saving plan, Per-Arne you referred to it as not a walk in the park. I was just &#x2013; just as clear to see the extent to which is your ambition or if you actually have a clear plan with 10, 15 items lined up to which you're going to get towards that SEK2 billion number?</p>
          <p>And the second question, it looks like the marketing expenses actually went down in the fourth quarter despite of being a big handset quarter. Just curious as to what's going on there. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When it comes to the plan, of course, we have a plan. We obviously can't announce SEK2 billion just by coincidence. So I mean, of course, we're working with that. But it's still, I mean, taking down SEK2 billion cost net given that you have underlying inflation is not the walk in the park for other company. But of course we have detailed plans to how to reach there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much and morning everyone. A couple of questions just kind of pushing for a little bit more color on questions that have already been asked. Firstly, question maybe for you, Andreas, given your new role, I have a question on M&amp;A policy earlier. I wonder if you give us a bit more of an update on what your M&amp;A policy specifically is at the moment? Is there anything on the horizon or you're now just putting your feet up?</p>
          <p>And then on Turkcell, it seems lot of visibility on the outcome and the timing of any resolutions here is almost more uncertain than it's ever been. I wondered if you'd agree on that. On how to go from here, would you ever consider merging <mark type="inaudible" /> with other assets owned by your co-owners? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to answer the first one, you can do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think actually, the decision in the privy council was maybe a bit less clear than I had hoped. That's obvious, but I think it was a step in the direction of coming to a resolution. I have experienced now five and half years of discussing Turkcell and different kinds of aspects of it, so I'm pretty used to that if we take two steps forward and then we take a step backward. I think this was a small step forward.</p>
          <p>And I don't know why you mentioned merging. I don't even think about merging anything in Turkcell. Turkcell is a great company and we need to resolve the deadlock in the board among the owners, because I think it's hurting Turkcell that we have a deadlock now for years in the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may then comment upon the M&amp;A side, it's the same strategy as we had before that we obviously remained within our footprint that we have today and we have tried to increase ownership in the entities where we have sort of the majority holdings there. So that's &#x2013; it's not changed. And we did not look at India.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can I just have one just quick follow-up question. Lars, apologies if it's an impersonal question, but could you just clarify your expected tenure in the firm? I mean, will you definitely not be extending your contract pass this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a lot of people are thinking about that. I have a contract. I'm already overdue that date has passed. By the end of this year, I'm supposed to retire. I think whether I retire 31st of December or another date would be dependent on the board's ability to find my successor.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's actually following on from an earlier question from Andy. Just &#x2013; could you maybe just given you had the dividend flat this year, could you just talk a little bit about your priorities for use of cash flow going forward? Is it still mostly deleveraging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can start. We decided that when we have the peak at 2.0 or 2.1 whatever it was, and we knew that we had the ability and the big possibility to deleverage, we clearly meet with the board that we should deleverage.</p>
          <p>We are now at 1.65 and we can also calculate and at one time we will be like 1.5 and even below 1.5. At that point in time, the board will have to have a discussion and we have &#x2013; they have &#x2013; we have a track record, a very strong record, of surplus cash being returned to the shareholders either as an extraordinary dividend, raising the dividend or even buying stock back, but it is too early to talk about it now. Let's get to the 1.5 or the 1.4 whatever the number should be when the discussion will have to take place and it will have to take place then.</p>

          <p>And I think there's also some other factors. I think you have to start view us with the range as such I mean we have to look at other things like how much underlying free cash flow we do have, it's SEK12 billion. So it's won't even count sort of the SEK12.3 billion that we even payout, so that's one issue, doesn't have to work with them. And I personally think also that yield of having 6% is very high. And in this sort of environment that we are today, also where we are taking out 2,000 people, I think it's a political sort of block directly to increase dividend and also actually going forward extraordinary dividends.</p>
