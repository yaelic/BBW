          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first quarter 2011 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator. It's Doug here. I'm going to be taking you through the earnings presentation. It's available on our website, as you know. We'll take questions after walking through the presentation. And with that, let's turn to page one.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, we generated net income of $5.6 billion, $1.28 a share, and that was on revenues of $25.8 billion. As we've done historically, we're highlighting several significant items in the quarter right up front. I'm going to try and cover them in some detail here, but they are included in the numbers for the lines of business.</p>
          <p>First item is a $0.29 per share increase in earnings, and that comes from a reduction in the credit card services allowance for loan losses. I'll talk you through the specifics of net charge-offs and our delinquency rates when we get to credit card later on.</p>
          <p>Second item is a $0.16 per share decrease in earnings. That's from a fair value adjustment to our MSR servicing asset. And this adjustment really represents the impact of the actual and our anticipated increases in servicing cost, including the compliance with our anticipated requirements that are going to be imposed through the OCC and Fed through a consent order that we anticipate receiving later today.</p>
          <p>The third item is a $0.10 per share decrease in earnings and expected costs for foreclosure related matters. And these costs are really our best current estimate for affidavit related delays as well as certain legal expenses. We don't view these costs as run-rate expenses. But to be clear, there could be further costs around this matter before we're finished.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with Tier I common of $120 billion, strong Basel I and Basel III ratios of 10% and 7.3% respectively. You see those on the page, an increase of about 20 basis points quarter over quarter. You also see on the next page ROE of 13%, ROTCE of 18%, also strong results. And broadly speaking, we had solid performance across our businesses, but I'll dive into those.</p>
          <p>I've covered all the items on page two. So if you skip to page three, we'll start talking about the Investment Bank; circled net income here on the page of $2.4 billion. That's on revenues of $8.2 billion. Investment Banking fees in the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 23% year on year. We continue to be ranked number one, but it remains a very highly competitive market. The results this quarter reflect record debt underwriting fees. And if you go to page 19, you can see our league table results.</p>
          <p>Markets revenues this quarter, $6.6 billion; that really reflects very strong client based revenues. And it was generated in part through the volatilities that we experienced in the first quarter in the markets and us helping our clients manage through that volatility. While these numbers are slightly down from a record first quarter 2010, still very strong results.</p>
          <p>$5.2 billion of revenue you see on the page in fixed income. There was strong performance across all of our asset classes there: rates, FX, credit, securitized products, and strong performance in commodities. $1.4 billion in revenues in equities this quarter, and that also represented strong performance across cash derivatives and prime services.</p>
          <p>DVA for the quarter related to the structured notes both in fixed income and equities was not a material number. It was a positive $20 million, and it really didn't change quarter-on-quarter performance.</p>
          <p>You see here, CPG reported a revenue loss of $190 million. And just a reminder, there are three items in that number. Typically, NII and fees on retained loans are going to be about $200 million plus or minus in a quarter. And then you have the market impact of hedges on the loan book, which were negative this quarter; and the impact of CVA and DVA, which were also negative in the quarter. And that led to the result.</p>
          <p>Credit cost, $429 million benefit; and that really reflects a reduction in loan loss allowances, largely related to loan sales and net repayments. And just a reminder again, here as we approach a more normalized credit environment, this item is going to return to being an expense item on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>Expenses in the quarter you see were $5 billion, up 4% year on year. That's really due to higher performance-based compensation, and that has partially been offset by lower non-comp expense. Comp-to-revenue ratio you'll see on the page is 40% this quarter. And just a reminder, it's going to vary slightly quarter on quarter based on business mix. But we continue to expect our full-year guidance to be consistent with what we shared with you at the end of the fourth quarter, which is 35% to 40%.</p>
          <p>One final note here, you see the loan balances in the Investment Bank up 2%, modestly. And you'll see that uptick to the extent that we continue to have active participation in the investment banking market, particularly the strategic advisory business, and you'll see that in an uptick in our loan balances.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn to page four, RFS. Just a moment on this page; this is a consolidated view. RFS for the quarter lost $208 million on $6.3 billion worth of revenue. And let me jump into the details really on page five.</p>
          <p>At the top, Retail Banking had solid performance, net income of a little under $900 million on revenues of $4.4 billion. Revenue was up modestly year over year, and that was net of an impact of lower deposit related fees. There were some key drivers on the prior page. I'd highlight deposit growth of 4% year over year, investment sales revenues up 11%. We built 33 new branches in the quarter. Expenses in the quarter were up 9% year over year, and that's really the continuing theme in investment. Our branch builds, our sales force build-out; we're up a little under 4,000 sales force year over year in the branches.</p>
          <p>Mortgage Banking, Auto and Consumer Lending, there was a net loss of $937 million here on revenues of a little under $700 million. And the results here were impacted both on the revenue line and the expense line by the two significant items that I covered on the first page. I'm not going to talk about those.</p>
          <p>Revenues of $1.9 billion excluding the MSR risk management results really reflect $36 billion in mortgage loan originations this quarter, higher volumes, wider margins than the first quarter of last year, but lower volumes and lower margins than the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues here also reflected solid performance in the quarter for our auto business.</p>
          <p>The other number that's included in that $1.9 billion, you'll see, is repurchase losses of $420 million for the quarter. That's a contra-revenue item. The repurchase losses here are really slightly above the trend line this quarter, and it's primarily related to some refinement of certain of our repurchase estimates. But I would say going forward, we continue to expect repurchase losses to be on a quarterly run rate consistent with our $1.2 billion plus or minus for the year.</p>
          <p>I've covered really the significant issues in MSR risk and expense. And other than those highlighted issues, the other line items for costs and servicing really reflect our production and volumes in the quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, I really want to turn our attention on page six to the real estate portfolios. I'll talk briefly on this page. Net income loss of $162 million, that's on revenues of $1.2 billion. That's down a little under $400 million year over year. The lower revenue number is really a decline in NII, and it's a result of the portfolio runoff. Balances declined year over year a little under $32 billion, $7.5 billion quarter on quarter, and we've told you about that. Consistent with that, you'd expect full-year NII to be down around $700 million. NII was also down on some spread compression.</p>
          <p>On the credit side, what I'd like to do is go through the details on page seven. So if you turn to page seven and the Home Lending update, you see circled net charge-offs on this page for the quarter were $1.1 billion. They're modestly improved our prior quarter, but they're certainly in line with the delinquency trends that we saw in Q3 and Q4. If you exclude the one-time adjustment that we talked about in the fourth quarter, you look at home equity and subprime net charge-offs are relatively flat. And you see the prime mortgage net charge-offs actually improved quarter on quarter.</p>
          <p>And then if you took a look at that graph we put on page 16 in the appendix, what you'll see is delinquency rates have really declined modestly across all of our portfolios. And all other things being equal, that should have a positive impact two quarters out on our future charge-offs.</p>
          <p>The other comments I'd make on this page is you'll see we didn't make any changes at all to our reserves in either our non-credit impaired or our purchase credit impaired portfolio in the quarter. And we continued, given some of the uncertainties in the market, to maintain our net charge-off guidance of $1.2 billion plus or minus in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Page eight, let's shift focus to Card Services. Circled net income on this page was $1.3 billion, revenues of approximately $4 billion. Credit cost, really the focus in this quarter; they were down significantly to $226 million. And if you look first at the bottom two circled numbers on the page, you see 6.20% is the charge-off rate for our Chase portfolios. That's an improvement of 88 basis points quarter on quarter. That follows a 98 basis point improvement from Q3 to Q4.</p>
          <p>And then you see the 30-plus day delinquencies decline to 3.25% in this quarter. That's down 41 basis points quarter on quarter, and we'd expect to see modest improvement there in the second quarter. The result of that improvement is the reduction in our future estimated losses; and as a result of that, the $2 billion pre-tax loan loss reserve release that I covered on page one.</p>
          <p>Just one other moment here on our guidance for the second quarter, we'd expect the charge-off rate for the Chase portfolio to be 5.5% plus or minus; and we do hope there's some modest upside in the ultimate rate for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On the revenue line of $4 billion, it's down 10% year on year, 6% quarter on quarter. And again, there's a consistent theme here on revenues. The lower revenues are driven by a $23 billion lower average balances outstanding year over year. And also, we had 100% run rate impact for the CARD Act in this quarter relative to the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>A positive note here, if you look at sales volumes, Chase volume was up 12% year over year, a little over $75 billion of spend from Chase cards. And as I mentioned last quarter, we really believe we continue to outpace the industry sales growth data. And that reflects itself ultimately in improved market share, which means when customers are going to stores, they are taking out their Chase cards more often than any other. It also does reflect some underlying positive sales trends for consumers in general.</p>
          <p>One other quick note before I move on; on January 1, you'll see on this page and in the supplement, we transferred our Commercial Card business from TSS to Card Services; a modest increase in revenues, increase in loan balances, and actually a reduction in margin as a result of all of that.</p>
          <p>Page nine, Commercial Bank; you see circled net income of $546 million. That's on revenues of $1.5 billion. Revenues are up 7% year on year. That's a function of growth in loan balances, growth in liability balances, actually some wider spreads year over year, higher Investment Banking fees year over year. And that's offset by continued spread compression in our deposit taking businesses.</p>
          <p>Credit costs in the quarter, $47 million; you see that on the middle of the page. That really reflects stable to improving credit trends in this business. Losses really continue to be weighted towards our real estate portfolio, but the losses in real estate also declined in the quarter. And again, I'd just caution that we will expect this portfolio over time to trend towards the normal through-the-cycle net charge-off rate of about 50 basis points that we talked about at Investor Day.</p>
          <p>Circled EOP loan balance, as you see on the page, of $100.2 billion; that's up modestly again this quarter, but I want to dig a little deeper. Loan volumes for the C&amp;I portfolio have increased now for four consecutive quarters. Middle market loan balances, the average balances are up $4.3 billion or 13% year over year, which is quite substantial. And balances have been up now for 12 consecutive months. And while we know that our loan growth in that area is a mix of market share gains and demand, this type of trend speaks more in part to what we believe is increasing demand in the space. Utilization rates in the first quarter have begun also to show the first signs of modest improvement, and it's the first time we've seen uptick in several quarters there.</p>
          <p>And then one last comment, you see the growth in liability balances, 17% year-over-year growth. We've got $156 billion of balances. Clients continue to generate cash, and we hold that cash for them. And I think that speaks, again, to the quality of the customer base.</p>
          <p>Treasury &amp; Securities Services on page 10; circled net income of $316 million in the quarter; that's up 13% year on year, 23% quarter on quarter. Revenue of $1.8 billion, that's up 5% year on year. And if you dive into WSS, revenue was up 9%. That's really driven by net inflows and higher market values of assets under custody. You see the other circled number on this page, $16.6 trillion of assets under custody. That's a record number.</p>
          <p>TS revenues were up 1%. But if you exclude the move of Commercial Card to Card Services, revenues were actually up 7% in the quarter. And you'll see in our supplement, the build-out, as we've talked about of our international businesses, it's really reflected in trade loan balances. Those are $25.5 billion in the quarter. That's up 86% year over year. It's up 21% quarter on quarter, and we hope to continue to grow that business.</p>
          <p>Expenses continue to be up 4% year on year, and that is a function of the discussion we've talked about in terms of investment, particularly around international. Although this quarter, it was offset by the transfer out of the Commercial Card business.</p>
          <p>And then one other quick item here; you see this credit allocation income expense. The details are in the footnote, but we're basically trying to capture the sharing of the economics associated with the Corporate Bank credit book. That's actually a net benefit this quarter of $27 million. And this line item is going to be a little more volatile than what we've done historically, which is charge through the credit cycle charge to Treasury &amp; Securities Services.</p>
          <p>Page 11, Asset Management; you see circled net income of $466 million in the quarter. That's up 19% year on year. Circled revenues, $2.4 billion; that's up 13% year on year; and revenue growth was really based on a few factors. We continued to have strong net inflows into products with higher margins; record asset under management inflows actually into long-term products this quarter of $27 billion. That's the eighth consecutive quarter of long-term flows. And that was offset by outflows in liquidity products of about $9 billion. We also had the benefit of higher market levels this quarter; and on a quarter-on-quarter basis, lower mortgage production, but higher year over year.</p>
          <p>Expense growth, the same theme we've talked about, up 15%, largely reflecting higher head count. We've added a little over 1,100 people to our front office in the last year.</p>
          <p>Page 12 now, Corporate and Private Equity; you see the top number, $383 million worth of net income from Private Equity in the quarter. That's really reflecting gains in the number of realizations, also improvements in the market value in our positions in the quarter. And you just remember here, financial results are going to vary based on the timing of those realizations, market valuations, but you should expect to see an appropriate return over time for this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Corporate net income reported, $339 million; this line item is also going to be lumpy, but over time, trending to $300 million plus or minus. CIO/Treasury will contribute to that. It's consistent with the guidance that we gave you this quarter, but it's going to be volatile based on timing of our investments and gains in our positioning. As you'll see when we release our Q, we continue to be positioned with the portfolio to take advantage of a rising rate environment, and that's reflected in our NII in this quarter. Also, there are going to be a number of one-time items in the quarter. This quarter, we had litigation expense of $350 million in Corporate.</p>
          <p>Page 13, fortress balance sheet; I think I've really covered most of the points on this slide. What I will remind everyone that hasn't focused on it is we did, as you know, increase our annual dividend to $1.00 a share, up from $0.20 a share. And we also authorized this $15 billion multiyear share repurchase program, $8 billion of which we can repurchase in 2011.</p>
          <p>Page 14 is the outlook page. I think I've covered all of this in the discussion.</p>
          <p>And so what I'd like to do, operator, is open up the line and have Jamie and I available to answer questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question on the Investment Bank, first of all. Obviously, revenue was very strong relative to, I think, probably what a lot of people might have expected. But you had a little bit of negative operating leverage in that your expenses moved up more than your revenue. And in fact, revenue was down ever so slightly. And your comp ratio, in particular, was 40%. That's an accrual, I guess, for this quarter versus 35% a year ago. Can you give us a little color? Is that a mix shift? Are you trying to be a little more conservative on bonus accruals? What's driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit of each.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And to the extent that is a mix shift, can you describe it to us a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just more client related business. We accrue higher in client related business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And there has been some concern, I think, over the last few months in the marketplace that large dealers like yourselves, given some of the uncertainty about capital costs, Basel III, et cetera, are a little bit reluctant to put long-tailed derivative positions on. Is that being reflected at all in your results, and might that have something to do with the decline in the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So essentially, the capital and the risk-weighted already represent, in effect, Basel very close, or at least our best estimates of Basel III. And while it's possible that some people are doing less long-tailed derivative stuff, I would not put it in the material category. There's a lot of client volume, a lot of client flow, a lot of activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. Your balance sheet shows a really significant increase in your deposits, both year over year and sequentially, $65 billion, $70 billion. Can you give us a sense for what the big drivers are there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer this question, but you've got to let someone else ask a question. Okay, Guy? So first of all, if you look at the deposits, middle market &#x2013; I mean Commercial Bank deposits are way up. TSS deposits are way up. Private Bank deposits are way up. Retail deposits are up. Clients have a lot of money, and they're investing a lot. And as you know, we keep on saying, there's a lot of money wash around the world. And obviously, we're a beneficiary of some of that. You can see it by business if you go in deeper in the supplement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll step aside. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to &#x2013; you gave the credit card guidance of improved losses going down to 5.5%; yet you're still carrying a 7.25% reserve. I guess ultimately, where should we see that number go to, and how much does it lag the improvement in NCOs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reserve &#x2013; look. Obviously, the reserves are coming down over time, precisely because of what you mentioned. The reserves are based on a forward-looking view of charge-offs. As charges come down, the reserve will come down. And eventually, they will be the same. If you're reserving effectively for 12 months of losses and things are steady, eventually they will be the same. A normalized charge-off ratio will eventually be 4.5%. That's through the cycle. It can obviously be lower than that or higher than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then, Doug, on just one of the comments you made going through the one-time items, you mentioned that some of those foreclosure costs should continue. With respect to the MSR adjustment, is that, I guess, one-time and we shouldn't expect any other change go forward once we get this consent order?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jason. The $1.1 billion is both our existing and our anticipated costs. That's the net present value of those changes, and that's a one-time item. That's not to say the MSR asset we're going to constantly revalue. The $650 million we don't believe is a run-rate item. But what I did say is there can clearly be further costs associated with the foreclosure and affidavit issues before we're finished.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And then just lastly, in looking at &#x2013; you give the Basel I and Basel III Tier I common ratios. And it looks like the spread between the risk-weighted assets on both those numbers is about $400 billion this quarter, but it was also about $400 billion in the year-ago quarter. Through mitigation and the like, would we expect a further reduction in &#x2013; or for that spread to narrow? Or how should we just think about it in terms of &#x2013; it doesn't look like there has been much mitigation on the RWAs for Basel III.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because a lot of things went through RWA, but I think we said last time was that mitigation, most of which, not all of which, most of which will happen by the end of this year, was $150 billion of risk-weighted assets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I would say it's towards &#x2013; in fairness, Jason, you would expect to see more of that towards the back end of the year as we get closer to market-based &#x2013; market risk rules.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. My question is really regarding capital again. You talk in the release about managing, at least in the near term, to perhaps a 9% Basel I based Tier I common equity ratio versus your 10% level currently. And obviously, the Basel III based ratio of 7.3% continues to build. So I'm wondering if you can give perspective on what that means in terms of how you're thinking about driving excess capital into buybacks each quarter. It looks like you could literally drive all of your retained earnings into buybacks and still be very adequately capitalized. Are you thinking that you could do that much? If you're not willing to buy back that aggressively, how else would you consider soaking up excess capital? Or would you indeed let those ratios just continue to build? I'm just trying to get some perspective because capital seems to...</p>

          <p>We can only buy back $8 billion of stock, according to the guidelines from the Fed. We are going to buy back, regardless of price, $3 billion, which is what we issue, or approximately what we issue every year for stock-related compensation. And the other part is discretionary; we're not going to automatically do it. It will be price sensitive. And if we build up excess capital, so be it.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Hi there. Doug, just a quickie. On the average rates on the balance sheet on page six, looking at the trading assets. And it went up like 45 basis points, a pretty big jump on a one quarter basis. Is that just duration extension on the mortgage assets or hedging related?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem. And sometimes this next one is just an allocation thing, but leverage at the IB, if you just look at average assets to the equity allocated, is creeping up a little bit. And I just didn't know if the high teens to 20% range is an okay resting range, if regulators have any commentary on that lately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've said the $40 billion anticipates the IB being at 8%. We're assuming some mitigation here in the IB by the end of the year on a standalone basis. So remember; that balance sheet where that $250 billion or so is very, very short-term liquid stuff. So the adjusted assets are like $600 billion and the equity is $40 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's cool. Last one is, Jamie, you made your points well in your shareholder letter on why the 7% is enough and your thoughts around the SIFI buffer. But I guess my question is with Switzerland going at 10%-plus and now the UK coming out this week at 10%-plus, how much, if any, impact do those markets have, to your understanding, with our regulators? And do our regulators take into account, say, risk-weighted assets to tangible assets or total assets or bank assets to GDP, other metrics that might not make this an apples-to-apples comparison?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the baseline Basel stuff is attempting to be a global agreement to have a level playing field for everybody. There are some flaws with that, which are also in my letter, because there are different laws now in the United States regarding derivatives, Volcker, the uses of preferred dividends, et cetera. But I think it's an attempt by regulators to have a global agreement.</p>
          <p>Each country is going to set its own &#x2013; they call it SIFI or global SIFI surcharge. So each country can do something in addition to the 7%. But I personally don't think that because the UK or Switzerland does it that the United States should feels like it has to do it. Each country is a slightly different thing. In Switzerland, their banks dwarf the size of their economy. That's not true here. I also have a chart in my shareholder letter about that. So there are other reasons why other countries might go to higher ratios.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks; two questions, one just a follow-up on the SIFI question. Does the size of the SIFI charge change how you think about allocating capital or how you would think about doing M&amp;A?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, if it's just a little bit more, no. If it's a lot more, probably; and we're going to have to wait and see. I also think it's very important, if you think about it a little bit, the market is going to price things. Just because a bank holds 10% doesn't mean the market is going to in effect use 10% to price something. So your competitive market is going to be based upon something different. So it's hard to figure out exactly what that means. My attitude would be we'd run the businesses at a 7% or 8% Basel III and hold the excess at Corporate.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually think it's an intelligent thought about having different performing versus defaulted loans. It's far more expensive to do a defaulted loan. So look, the devil is in the details. It's a good thought, a good concept. And in general, it would eventually reduce the size of the MSR, which would be fine with us too.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that the skin-in-the-game concept is a good idea. We think it would be fine with us. It has a lot of consequences, but we'd be fine with that. And the QRM, either way can work as long as it's all properly designed. So we really don't have an axe in this fight about how it's going to take place.

          <p>In fact, if you look at IB comp, back that out, and you look at the overhead, overhead is largely, it has been consistent as a percentage of revenue. The nature of those expenses are different because we're investing a lot in various business to grow them over time, and you're going to see some of that in the revenue items.

          <p>I object to how they went about that, and so there will be more conversations about how those charges go through. The FDIC was supposed to be deposit insurance. And remember, we pay for the deposit insurance. JPMorgan will have paid &#x2013; it's a government program paid for by banks. So we'll have paid through this crisis about $5 billion in FDIC.

          <p>Okay. And the card NIM, net interest margin, was up even as the balances shrank. I'm just wondering how is that happening. Is that less suppression going on, are there some repricing benefits also in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a lot of different things. But remember, there was some repricing, but it's also runoff of low return balance transfers, so there are a lot of things in there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember also, John, in the NIM you get the reversals from declining charge-offs, and so you're going to see that benefit. We're going to &#x2013; that number is going to move around a bunch.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks. I was just wondering. Doug, you had alluded to the fact that the trading profits had been driven by the facilitated client activity. Was that activity uniform during the quarter? Was it lumpier? And if you would, did it continue into April?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just maybe a little more broadly, just as it relates to the mortgage business and all of the related issues that you're going through with the servicing, can you relate that to the administration's plans for Fannie and Freddie? And could there be &#x2013; are they talking to one another in terms of those two sets of issues? And is there some way that this could be &#x2013; the banking industry could help out and perhaps get either assets or assets and revenues out of this over some period of time?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wrote about this a little bit in my Chairman's Letter. Look, the government laid out three baseline ways to set up the GSEs and the mortgage markets. One of the points we've made is whichever one happens, we all agree it should protect the taxpayer, that we want a healthy mortgage market, but it has be designed properly. Any one of the three can actually work to do those things. And I think that's one of the reasons the Treasury laid it out is so you can have a conversation and response and think through the effect in the markets, how quickly you can do it. Obviously, there's a lot of politics around the GSE. So hopefully, we'll have a really good healthy mortgage market when it's said and done. But a healthy mortgage market means it's got to be good for consumers and it's got to be good for investors. Otherwise, you will not have a healthy mortgage market.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Could you guys share with us? You had great success in your market share numbers on the merger and advisory role in the Investment Bank in the U.S. I think it was over a 40% market share. How did you guys get such a great market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those market share numbers are going to move around. Large deals are going to move it. We really do focus on longer-term trends. And we also focus on the revenue line because folks can be involved in things and they're not making a lot of money, so I would focus really on the revenue line. Generally speaking, we had a number one share in fees. That's because we've got a great client franchise across the Investment Banking platform.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we were in most of the big transactions this quarter, but that will move quarter over quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at our total relationship with clients. And the ability to actually provide them financing is clearly one of the benefits that we bring to a client, and it works in significant transactions. The AT&amp;T transaction is a good example of that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And some of the smaller <mark type="ph" /> transactions (41:20), not having a balance sheet is helping them. So I think it's both.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you share with us what you think the process is? If you wanted to raise your dividend again later this year because your earnings are stronger than expected, do you have to go through the formal process that you just went through, or is it less formal with the regulators to raise the dividend sooner than a year from now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't be looking for a dividend increase, if I were you, in the next couple of quarters. But the regulators have made it clear that &#x2013; which I think is a reasonable thing that you have quarterly stress tests and stuff like that. We would have permission to do more on the dividend if we wanted to, a little bit more. But at one point, we would obviously go ask them in this environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And then finally, recognizing your business has changed quite a bit in the last 10 years, if we get to normalized net charge-offs, possibly 75 to 100 basis points, similar to what JPMorgan had in the late '90s, do you think the loan loss reserves to total loans could come down to 200 basis points or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, the answer is yes. But you also have all these new accounting laws and rules and stuff like that. So we believe in strong reserves. We think it's a good thing to have an unquestioned balance sheet.</p>

          <p>So who buys a lot of this paper? The AT&amp;T deal was clearly in the news, but you were able to offload it pretty well. What's the demand for buying and who is buying it?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of the covenant-light deals, it seems like you're doing a lot more of those. Do you feel good about the quality since you had more covenant-light deals in the first quarter than you did all last year for the industry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I wouldn't say we're doing covenant-light deals uniquely. I think deals &#x2013; covenants have gotten lighter as lending has eased a little bit. But again, if you you're looking at the country, it's probably a pretty good thing. I don't think it has gotten to the point where you would look at it as what it was like in the summer of '07.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys; a couple of things left. One, when I look at the Corporate segment, and I know the guidance is to Corporate net income of plus or minus $300 million over time. One of the things that really drove that higher was the spike in the investment securities portfolio in the second quarter of a couple of years ago. We're seeing that investment portfolio start going up again sequential quarter. Is that a function of just there's no loan demand out there on the consumer side, so that's where you're putting capital? Or is there something else as far as &#x2013; I guess I was expecting the size of that portfolio to be declining, not increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but you've got to look at both sides of the balance sheet here because we have a lot of deposits, which when we get the deposits, obviously, we invest it. So I would say it's largely related to both the deposits and then our own, how we want to manage the interest rate exposure of the company. And remember, it's costing us money how we're managing the interest rate exposures of the company. And some of that product that's in the CIO portfolio, a lot of it, I forgot the exact number, a lot of is it what I call spread product. It's like zero duration but it's got a spread in it to protect us from rising rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you talked some about &#x2013; I mean with middle &#x2013; I guess what I'm going to try and get at is the trend in commercial clients outlook or confidence. We see utilization rates up in middle market. The Investment Banking backlog is still pretty good. Trading volumes are up. Have you noticed any change in how your commercial clients are maybe looking at the world over the last six months with some of the volatility and events we've seen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at corporate, mid-corporate, middle market, and even small business, they're generally across the board stronger than they were. And that's, anecdotally, surveys. It's capital. It's cash. It's deposits. It's lending conditions, financial conditions. So you're seeing confidence come back. Obviously, laying on top of that a little bit is some of these things happening around the world, from Europe to Middle East and Japan. But it's not clear that that's going to derail these companies going about their business, hiring people. And even small business demand, small business loans were flat for our total company quarter over quarter. But this quarter is generally a very low quarter, so it's a very good sign, in our opinion. We're starting to see real small business loan demand.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>We pointed out mortgage losses were &#x2013; we were losing $2 billion a quarter in charge-offs in mortgages. It's now down to $1.1 billion. And remember, the early signs of delinquencies will drive foreclosures six months, 12 months from now. In other words, those are going to start coming down at one point later in the year or early 2012, not go up. That's a good sign, not a bad sign, even though they're still very elevated right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned some of the strength in trading or the bulk of the strength in trading was client driven. And I guess specifically on the FICC revenues, they held up quite nicely year over year. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color from a product mix point of view. There's the Sempra deal in there, and I think you have maybe a little more commodity...</p>

          <p>Matt, it was really &#x2013; in fairness, it was across the board. Almost every asset class in fixed income had very strong performance. And commodities was one of those asset classes that had very strong performance. Part of that is we've made a number of investments in that business. That commodity revenue, like all of the other businesses this quarter, was predominantly client flow.</p>

          <p>And then I was debating. We hosted a dinner the other day, and there was some debate on the FICC fee pool over the next several years. And some were debating that it would be a lot higher. Some were debating that it would be a lot lower. And obviously, this is something that's virtually impossible to predict, but you do have to have some view as you think about staffing levels. As you think about a continued macro recovery, higher interest rates, maybe some leveling off of commodities, what does the FICC revenue pool look like a few years down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you just put aside for a second spreads, and put aside for a second how good you are at trading, the underlying growth is going to be pretty good. If you look at global capital flow, global net worth, global balance sheets, the growth of multinationals, the need for FX, the need for trade, the need for &#x2013; the underlying numbers are actually pretty good over a decade. You can, any one quarter, those could be dramatically different because of spreads, how you're actually trading them. But I would say it's a pretty &#x2013; the needs of investors are going to grow a lot over the next 10 to 20 years, not a little.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Page six of the supplement. And I guess that's a line item that doesn't fluctuate all that much unless you're repositioning the securities book. I'm trying to get a better sense of maybe what's going on there. And then obviously, we're all trying to figure out what the overall NIM might look like going forward as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so the portfolio we have, it's obviously moving around. It's also global. And I think I just mentioned, we went to more of a spread product, and we invested more money, and we have a lot of mortgages. So 2.89%, you can go buy mortgages at far higher rates than that. We also put on some prime, about $2 billion of prime jumbos coming out of the Private Bank at much higher rates there. So we can give you a better answer than that, but I think it's just those things I just mentioned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just following up on the NIM, you said there may be a little pressure in the second quarter. And then you also said, Jamie, that it's expensive protecting against higher interest rates. So do you think the NIM will keep going down, or will it stabilize now that market rates have stabilized? What's your thinking beyond just the next three months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Doug answered it. The underlying trend is down a little bit. But obviously, we could make good decisions to change that very quickly. And if rates go up, our NIM can actually stand a little bit, which is not, if you look at the implied curve, it's not going to happen right away. But if does happen, our NIM will actually go up, not down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And then you also referred, Jamie, to the valuation reserve, loan loss reserve eventually matching charge-offs. But right now, the reserve was up, let's say in round numbers, about 200 basis points higher than the charge-off rate in the quarter. And with the new accounting proposals, will we really see that match, or do you think that we'll have provisioning and reserving over the cycle that will be less volatile and have a bigger difference than just the matches that you were referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know yet because these are all just proposals out there. And the proposals are different for consumer, for defaulted, for wholesale. But I hope when it's said and done, we have a better matching and less post-cyclicality. It will be more countercyclical; that would be my hope.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we all share that opinion; and just one other question. In regard to Private Equity, you noted in the outlook comments that it's likely to be volatile. But with the private equity shops looking for exits and trying to monetize their investments and being pretty successful, it would seem like there's a possibility that you could stay at that high level for well into this year and maybe longer. So I'm wondering if you have any elaboration on that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think Doug mentioned is it will be lumpy, but we like lumpy as long as it's 20% average. And I think our folks, particularly in One Equity Partners, have done more than that over time. So yes, we hope. We're optimistic, but we don't count on it.</p>

And the SIFI buffer, obviously, would be targeted at companies like you and Bank of America and so on. And I'm wondering about those plain vanilla, middle-market, retailing banking, small business lending businesses. If at the corporate level, you're forced to have 1% or 2% extra capital, can one still price effectively in those business? Or does it really...</p>

          <p>I guess have you to, right? You're not going to price to lose. You're going to price to win the business, and the market sets the price.

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. I just wanted to follow up on the level playing field issue. One of the things, Jamie, that you that pointed out in your shareholder letter was the less conservative calculation of RWA for some non-U.S. banks. And I was wondering if you could drill into what you think are the most harmful aspects of that.</p>
          <p>And then also maybe you could comment on what we were hearing yesterday about Deutsche Bank separating its non-commercial banking businesses in the U.S. away from its bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to comment on that because all I know is what I read in the paper this morning too.</p>
          <p>The other one is, I guess you've got to look at regulation. We always believe in higher cap and higher liquidity. And the regulators are talking about a level playing field. And they understand that the risk-weighted asset calculations aren't done the same everywhere. So they say that they'll make sure that they incorporate that in their thinking.</p>
          <p>That's not the only &#x2013; you've got to look at all of it. If American banks can't have tax deductions for deferrals and overseas banks can, that's one thing. If American banks have to demand margin from end users, which I'm not sure is going to be the case, if <mark type="ph" /> a non financial end uses (1:03:30) derivatives, the business will go elsewhere. And so we just want to make sure it's fair in total, including SIFI charges because if every country does that differently, that may not be fair either.</p>
          <p>So to me, I think the regulators and the government officials do say they want to have the level playing field. But why was MSR deducted from capital? It's a perfectly good asset. Why would that be a deduct directly from capital but not plant and equipment or some other assets or highly liquid loans? Why is the Ex-Im [Export-Import] Bank treated differently than supranational banks are treated overseas? So when you dig into it, there are a lot of things in here that just &#x2013; they need to be clarified and cleaned up. I think people want to do that. And obviously, the banks have to run a good business.</p>
          <p>I would also point out, by the way, that when America was still in Basel I when the rest of the world was in Basel II, it didn't he hurt us to be in Basel I. So you don't have to have exactly the same stuff either to be able to compete.</p>
