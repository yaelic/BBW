          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to SAP's Full Year 2008 Financial Analyst Conference here in Frankfurt. My name is Stefan Gruber. I'm Head of Investor Relations, and I would like to give you a brief overview on the agenda for today.</p>
          <p>We have three presentations. First, you'll hear from Henning Kagermann, Co-CEO of SAP, about our performance in 2008, both from an SAP perspective, but also relative to the competition. And Henning will also comment on some medium-term and long-term metrics. Then Werner Brandt, our CFO, will talk about the 2008 financials in detail and will also comment on our 2009 outlook. And then L&#xE9;o Apotheker, Co-CEO of SAP, will talk about the current business environment, the macroeconomic environment, the challenges due to this, but also the opportunities we see for SAP in 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>This event today is a webcast event. We also have some people participating by phone. We will not be taking any questions by phone, only by email. So for the Q&amp;A session later on, please send us questions by email to investor@sap.com.</p>
          <p>And finally, I think we have some Safe Harbor language, which I always have to read. Please note that except for certain information, matters discussed during today's conference may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. The factors that could affect the company's future financial results are discussed more fully in the company's most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>These were all my intro comments, and with that, I hand it over to Henning Kagermann. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Welcome, after a short Safe Harbor statement. I think we can report a set of good results for 2008. I would link this to the right strategy, and I would say a very quick and agile execution after our surprise in Q3.</p>
          <p>We are not immune against the economic environment; you know that. A few remarks. I think the crisis can be categorized by scope; it's a global one, and that means we cannot compensate a shortcoming in one sales region by extended effort in others. It's the intensity, nearly all clients spoke about suddenness. The same happened to us and continues to happen. And the third one is the complexity. And we felt this complexity is a opportunity for us. Complexity partially because we are really in a networked world.</p>
          <p>There will be more requirements for compliance solutions, which is one of our key strengths. We expect much more demand for transparency, business intelligence solutions where we were lucky to make the acquisition of Business Objects last year, so it's another key strength of SAP.</p>
          <p>And I also believe that we have highlighted some of the key topics from a business point of view, which will be on top of the agenda of many CEOs. You remember we have spoken two years ago about business model innovation, the key topic these days. What happens in a networked world, transparency and how to manage it, and last but not least, strategic agility. So I think we are well equipped with the topics we highlighted to address these needs.</p>
          <p>Now I said already, we are not immune against cycles. The last one was seven years ago; do you remember 2002, it was a similar one. And we reacted at that time with a two-fold strategy. So first was to improve our financial health, focusing on margin, and then later on, once it was established, we went and embarked on a very strong growth strategy. We had double-digit growth for five years.</p>
          <p>So therefore, if you compare 2008 with the performance of SAP in the past, I think it might make sense to just compare it against the average of the last 10 years because these are years in good and bad times. We could see that our product revenue on average grew by 12%. We reported for 2008, 16 &#x2013; yes, I know it's including a large acquisition, but that is I think part of a growth strategy of a mature company.</p>
          <p>If you look to the operating margin, in the 10 years, we added 7.3 percentage points, we added 90 basis points in eight. So we did better than on average despite the integration of Business Objects, which came with a much lower margin than SAP. Net income cash flow was more or less in line.</p>
          <p>And I just want to highlight that we added in 2008 a huge number of new customers: 26,000 we got through the acquisition from Business Objects, and jointly, SAP and Business Objects, we added another 10,000 in 2008. So we are now at 82,000 customers. Head count is a similar 10% per year on average; through Business Objects 17% this year and therefore, it's not a surprise for you that if we look to the growth expectations in the future, let's say, we have to adjust the average level of head count for the years to come.</p>
          <p>Now for the entire year, and I will go later on to the seasonality, but for the entire year, again, we were able to outperform the market in terms of product revenues, roughly a factor of two, always our objective over the last years. If I look to market share, for the entire year again, market share gains, 4.4 percentage points, 3.5 from acquisition, 90 basis points organically.</p>
          <p>If you look to the details, we lost 90 basis points in Q4. I have taken this time the entire year because the market share gains and losses are heavily impacted by the currency. The euro was extremely strong in the first half, was weak at the end, and I think here it's better to take into consideration a period where we can more or less balance these out. Three-year gains, you'll see 10 percentage points. And yeah, we are lucky that we are now amongst the top 100 most largest companies in terms of market cap.</p>
          <p>If we look to the regions, the expectation is that the U.S. was hit most by the crisis that came from there. Which is true, by the way, that Americas reported 20% plus is because the U.S. benefited more than the other countries from the acquisition of Business Objects because Business Objects had a strong business there, but also because the American customers always ahead of the curve. There is a huge demand for these type of solutions, and we expect the spillover to the other regions as well for this demand.</p>
          <p>EMEA more or less was 19% on a same level, and largest growth from Asia Pacific, 24%. But you can see, it's our growth area, but we see the impact of the economic crisis in Asia as well, and you will hear more from Werner later.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, it's in the interest what happens in the industry, it's more or less not too much. I can highlight two sectors. Discrete Manufacturing was far below average in growth. Not a surprise, automotive, high tech, these are aerospace and defense part. You know the situation in automotive. On the other side, public sector, surprisingly high. Not so much. Everybody knows that the public sector is there in these times to buffer a little bit the demand. SAP is extremely strong in the public sector. You have heard a few announcements in the past about large deals.</p>
          <p>Now it's more important if we want to prepare for 2009, and my colleagues will do it, to look really a little bit into the seasonality, and you see it's a polarized performance. It was, I would say, an exceptional good first half of the year, which is 28% and half Business Objects, half organic growth. It went on significantly already in Q3, and we see now in Q4, we ended up with 8% software and software-related services revenue growth. So extremely tough market outside.</p>
          <p>I think we can all be lucky that immediately after Q3, we initiated this very tough cost saving program which paid back. We saved about &#x20AC;220 million out of it, and you can see that our non-GAAP operating margin was highest in Q4, much higher than in the past. So I think this pays back, and helps us if we can say today, we achieved our guidance and our promise to protect the earning health of SAP.</p>
          <p>Now this has implications. It was announced this morning, L&#xE9;o will go into this. It's how we will bring these program forward into 2009. We will see more in detail. We have and will do this with the same, I think, clear focus.</p>
          <p>I would close in just saying we are well prepared. It was a big debate, in particular amongst the financial analyst community and investor community. Is this right to invest so much in good times? I feel it's a waste of time where you should invest into your product portfolio and innovation and into market share. We see it now. Now is not the time to invest.</p>
          <p>We can make the harvest from what we have done in the past. I want to remind you that we had always three goals: one was the transformation of SAP from a one product company to a multi-product company, and in particular the transformation of the entire portfolio. We did it in two steps. We wanted to double the addressable market, and we wanted to build the three pillars of growth after successful organic, also growing through acquisition. Just to remind, you see short slides.</p>
          <p>The transformation was done in two steps after 2003 where we added to ERP supply chain management, customer relationship management, et cetera. It was a big decision in 2003 to say, okay, it's time now to replace client server, which helped us for more than 10 years to be successful with a next generation architecture, SOA. We were one of the first in the market doing it.</p>
          <p>I can tell you that's not an easy decision. It's not an easy execution if you have to transform the entire product portfolio to a new architecture with such a large customer base. We were lucky that we can do it without disruption to our client and without disruption to SAP. We are through that. I think this will pay back.</p>
          <p>And you also know that we have tried to invest into three new strategic areas with the technology platforms that we also sell, technology, more products for the mid-market segment, and the highlight was a business user where we have seen this year the highest growth and expect it in the future.</p>
          <p>The second promise was doubling the addressable market. In 2005, we painted this picture. If I look now to 2008, and when we enter 2009, we can say with the product portfolio we have, we can address roughly a $70 billion U.S. dollar market. All our market share figures are still related to the old, let's say, level because of consistency. We can might be change this in 2009, but it's important to say we are there, it's doubling.</p>
          <p>Then we look to our revenues. Where are we with revenues from new products from the three new areas I mentioned: mid market, the platform and the business user, and indeed, in 2008, already 40%. You can say we were lucky that we invested that early because if you look to the second half might be already even more. So we will achieve this 50%. Customers, 100,000, I think with the acquisition now easy, we have 82,000. We added 10,000 in 2008. You can extrapolate. I think this goal will be achieved in 2010 as well.</p>
          <p>The acceptance amongst our client base is huge for the new technology. We have now more than 50,000 productive net user installations. You'll see the increase year-over-year, 47%, 10,000 productive ERP 6.0 based on SOA, 84% more. So this is well underway.</p>
          <p>If you look to the mid market, we focus on Business All-in-One more from a revenue point of view. This is where we get the revenue from. We added more than 2,000 clients. Business One is more about new names, we added 5,000. And I said this morning in terms of innovation, ByDesign is leading. We had to, let's say, some difficulties with ByDesign; we'll not hide that. On the other side, if you look in totality, we are the only company in the world in our industry who ever has built an entire suite from scratch, like we did it. This suite is running productive today in four countries and in an on-demand mode. So from that point of view, I would say it was right to make these investment decision in good times. It will pay back in other times in the future, and it protects SAP against disruption from the market.</p>
          <p>Now the key success story was, as I said, the business user segment, fueled by the acquisition of Business Objects which was the largest in our history, the fourth largest in the software industry. It was exactly to the point. It fits very well into our portfolio, in particular in these times. I have to admit the integration went even better than I expected, went very well, and there was a strong contribution of Business Objects to our growth in 2008, as you can deduct from the figures.</p>
          <p>More important, our clients like this product portfolio. It's well aligned to the SAP one. We can continue with our two-pronged strategy in selling into new accounts, but also upselling much larger into the install base, and we will do so.</p>
          <p>And with that, I think we have proven now, and we promised a year ago when there was a big debate, is this a shift in strategy and can you do it and should you do it? And our only answer was okay, we'll prove it to you. Now I think we have proven that SAP in the future can grow through organic growth, which we have done five years through co-innovation and also through big acquisitions, which I think is important for a market leader of our size. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hello, everyone. That's the agenda for the next session. When I finish with the outlook, I would like to make some remarks with regard to our IFRS financial reporting. And finally, I want to make a general comment. As you know that all of these results we present here are preliminary, and I want to highlight this at the end of my presentation.</p>
          <p>If you look to the financial highlights for the year, you see that on the software revenue side, we have an increase of 10%. This increase is driven by 11% increase on a full-year basis in EMEA, 3% in the Americas and 23% in Asia Pacific. If you look to the fourth quarter, we have a minus 6% on the software side, and we will discuss this later.</p>
          <p>Due to the stable revenue on the support side in Q4 with a plus of 8% on the software and software-related service side. We achieved on a full-year basis non-GAAP 20% increase in software and software-related service revenue. This 20% increase is driven by a 16% contribution of Business Objects, so the products we acquired with the acquisition of Business Objects, and the contribution of SAP products was 6%.</p>
          <p>If I look to the margin side of the house, you see that we increased our operating margin by 110 basis points on a non-GAAP basis at constant currency and achieved 28.4%, so clear overachievement of what we previously announced when we announced our revised guidance for 2008 back in October.</p>
          <p>If you look to this performance, you have to take into consideration that we have one-time expenses related to the Business Objects integration at an amount of roughly 35 million, which represents 30 basis points. And in addition, we have to acknowledge that we have settlement expenses incurred in 2008, in the range of 32 million, mainly driven by the settlement with i2 which we reported about in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>If you look to the free cash flow, operating cash flow increased by 12%, and free cash flow increased by 19% and I will give you and to provide you some more details.</p>
          <p>If you look to the income statement, then you see that I only want to highlight here one thing. If you look to the operating income side, US GAAP versus non-GAAP, you see a difference of 463 million. And this is &#x2013; are the acquisition-related charges mainly coming from the Business Objects acquisition. On the cost side, 297 million, and on the revenue side, it is 166 million coming from the reversal of the write-down of acquired maintenance revenue stream.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, I only want to make one comment. You see here a clear shift towards the product revenue for software and software-related service side. It is now 73%, and I think the acquisition of Business Objects strengthens our SSRS revenue, the relation of SSRS revenue to total revenue quite nicely.</p>
          <p>If you look to the regional breakdown of our software and software-related service revenue on a non-GAAP basis, you see that we had a 19% increase year-over-year in EMEA. Germany grew 6%, and the rest of EMEA, 27%, and EMEA has a rate now of 54% of our total SSRS revenue.</p>
          <p>Then if you look to the Americas, 20% growth there of 19% coming from &#x2013; the growth in the United States is 19% and the rest of the Americas, 21%. If you look to this region, it contributes to 33% of our SSRS revenue, and finally Asia-Pacific, where you see contribution of 13% to our overall SSRS revenue with a growth of 24%, Japan growing 12% and the rest of Asia-Pacific strong 31% at constant currency.</p>
          <p>If you look to the operating expense side, you see here we bridged it from 2007 to 2008. The total spending was &#x20AC;7.5 billion in 2007. And we added through the acquisition, mainly Business Objects, 953 million to our base. That's an increase of 13%. Then we have our organic growth in our operating expenses at SAP; it accounts for 4% growth. Then we have currency working against it, so overall a growth of 13% to &#x20AC;8.4 billion.</p>
          <p>And you see the fourth quarter here. Henning indicated already that we took out of the P&amp;L -- compared to what we intended to spend beginning mid of September in the fourth quarter, we took out &#x20AC;220 million. And if you also take into consideration the savings we realized in Q3, then the total savings compared to what we had in the plans mid of October before the financial crisis hit the real markets, we saved 290 million.</p>
          <p>Now this 290 million cannot be transferred into 2009 right away, as we had a positive impact in the quarter coming from expense savings measures which will not continue one-to-one, impact of the equity program which will not continue one-to-one. I only want to highlight that the total amount of savings cannot be transferred to 2009 on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>By the way, the impact of the equity program in the fourth quarter was a positive fund of eight million due to the share price development. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had still expenses of 37 million. And if you look to the total number of stock-based compensation expenses in 2007, we had 95 million, and in 2008 it was 63 million.</p>
          <p>Now if you look to our financial income, I would like to highlight here the decrease to negative 63 million. Of course, this is a result of the financing of the Business Objects acquisition where we initially got a finance guarantee of five billion. You will see later on the balance sheet we still have 2.3 million in that. But consequently, this had a negative impact of our interest results. And in addition, as a consequence, liquidity decreased. 2007, the average liquidity was 3.2 billion. Now we have two billion in '08, and the interest also decreased 100 basis points to 3.5% on the asset side.</p>
          <p>Now if you look to the effective tax rate, I think here we have a nice decrease to 29.5%, 270 basis points reduction. And that's mainly driven by the tax reform we have in Germany on the corporate tax side and on the trade tax side. So we fully benefit from this reform in Germany.</p>
          <p>If you look to the &#x2013; this slide, the gross margin analysis only to illustrate if you look to the software and software-related service cost side, we have here between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP difference of 190 million. And that exactly the amortization of the acquired IP whether it's customer-related or technology-related, that's the difference here.</p>
          <p>And if you look to the evolution of the non-GAAP margin, you'll see 10 basis points increase. So from that perspective, it's going in the right direction. A better improvement as you see on the service margin side is 50 basis points non-GAAP &#x2013; that is non-GAAP. And this is mainly coming from the consulting business and our hosting business which significantly increased its profitability.</p>
          <p>Now on the &#x2013; on the expenses to total revenue, you'll see a decrease of 40 basis points to 13.8, that's going in the right direction. And I think that's the first fruit we are seeing from our programs in driving efficiency in R&amp;D under the leadership of Jim Hagemann Snabe, together with Erwin Gunst.</p>
          <p>If you look to the sales and marketing ratio to total sales, you'll see a minus of 20 basis points. That's mainly coming from the marketing arena. And you'll see a strong increase year-over-year here with regard to G&amp;A expenses as percent of total revenue. And that's mainly driven by the acquisition of Business Objects.</p>
          <p>And the next slide should highlight the fact that especially with regard to G&amp;A as percentage of total revenue, we will do everything to decrease this to a reasonable level being above 4%, but definitely of about 5%. You see these, all the ratios now full year, half year, one half year, two and also the fourth quarter. With all the carve-out I mentioned before that you cannot simply take all the savings in Q4 and transform them into the next year.</p>
          <p>Next area is the balance sheet. Here I would like to highlight four areas. First of all, accounts receivable. We undertook a very thorough investigation of our accounts receivable, the collectability. We increased our general individual bad debt reserve, our sales allowances and feel that we are covered here quite nicely.</p>
          <p>If you look to the goodwill, it's now five billion, thereof 3.3 billion is coming from the Business Objects acquisition. All the impairment tests we did, did not reveal any sign for impairment with regard to our entire goodwill.</p>
          <p>On the intangible side, you see also a strong increase, and that's driven by also Business Objects acquisition. We acquired customer-based technology, and this accounts for nearly the entire difference you see here between 400,000 and 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>On the liability side, you see the debt resulting from the Business Objects acquisition. Here we have 2.3 billion debt, and as we already said, we will pay this debt by the end of the year according the contracts we have with the financial institutions. And remember, we &#x2013; this is a very attractive interest rate we have here, it's over about plus 25 basis points.</p>
          <p>If you look to the balance sheet and the cash flow analysis, first of all, net liquidity is clear. We have liquidity in our books as you saw a minute ago of 1.6 billion. We struggle a bit here with our DSO. It increased by five days. That's a consequence of the overall economic environment we see in all of the countries we operate in. We will ensure that it doesn't further deteriorate, but we have to respond somehow to the business we have in these countries and see that we manage this professionally.</p>
          <p>The equity ratio went down, but I am sure starting this next year we will increase this equity ratio again. Cash flow was from an operational prospective 2.2 billion, that's an increase of 12%. Cash flow conversion rate also increased as we put a lot of effort in managing our working capital better than in the past. And we will have a continued focus on the cash flow conversion rate in 2009.</p>
          <p>The capital expenditure decreased by 50% to 339 million. And I think here we show a number which is significantly below our own plans for 2008. So we have really also, if you talk about expense saving control, we also control our capital expenditure as capital expenditure, as you know, results in expenses, amortization expenses right away through the amortization of the investment.</p>
          <p>Now the group liquidity here is a bridging between December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2008. You see the operational cash flow coming in the capital expenditure. You see the money we spent for acquisitions, nearly five billion. We also have here the 2.2 billion net proceeds from debt, cash acquired, dividend paid, and you'll see all the other elements from the bridging.</p>
          <p>Share buyback activities. I think we announced in October that we would not buy back shares in the fourth quarter. We didn't buy back. We have now bought back in the full year of 2008, 14.6 million shares, roughly 490 million we spent for this share buyback. We have now 38.5 million in treasuries share, average price is 35.43, and the average number of outstanding shares came down to 1.2 billion. And that also was the reason why you see a difference in that key income. There's EPS but of course EPS benefits from a growth rate perspective from the reduction in the number of shares.</p>
          <p>So going into 2009, we will not buy back shares. We only would reconsider this statement if we see an improvement in the overall economic environment, meaning that if we grow again, and that's something we have to decide. And so we go into the year, no share buyback in 2009.</p>
          <p>However, the management board will propose to the Supervisory Board, and this finally has to be approved by the annual shareholder meeting that we pay a dividend that we would keep the payout ratio stable to 2008 or '07, if you will, the dividend which was paid in 2008 for 2007, and that 30% payout ratio on the &#x20AC;1.64 euro we realized in earnings per share on a U.S. GAAP basis.</p>
          <p>Now the head count analysis, that's very easy. And I think that &#x2013; think that we achieved this. We limited the increase to 7,700; thereof, of course, 6,500 came via acquisitions to SAP. But as you know, we have stopped hiring very early during the course of 2008, and that's the reason why after Q1 with 1,200 additions organically, we really had only minor additions to the company in terms of new employees, and on a net basis and you even see the fourth quarter with a reduction here of 327.</p>
          <p>If you come to the outlook, first of all, I would like to make a comment to the business environment and the cost containment measures we have in front of us. We expect that the operating environment will remain challenging. In addition, in 2009, we will not see the positive impact coming from the Business Objects acquisition because we closed this transaction on the 21st of January of 2008.</p>
          <p>And the next point is very important that the 2009 first half year results will be a difficult comparison to strong results reported in the first half of 2008, which was prior to the economic crisis and disrupted the global market in the third quarter. And that is especially true for the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now if you look to the financial outlook here, then you see that it includes the financial impact of the following measures. The first one is that we continue with tight cost control, mainly related to third party expenses, but not limited to third party expenses. So we continue to address every area in the organization, whether it's travel, personnel expenses and so on, and of course capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>What we will do in 2009 is that, and that's the second point, that we will freeze our salary on a worldwide basis. There might be some exceptions in countries where we have to increase salary due to the layer regime, the regulatory environment. But it's limited to this, the rule for the SAP globally salary freeze for 2009.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, as you have seen in the press release, a reduction of our workforce globally down to 48,500 positions by year-end 2009, taking full advantage of attrition as a factor in reaching this goal. Now the objective behind this, having 48,500 employees at year end of 2009 is that we decrease our personnel expenses in 2010 by 300 to &#x20AC;350 million. That's the objective behind it. And if we are successful in bringing down the positions we have today, 51,500 down to 48,500, then we will see a decrease in our plans for 2010 on the personnel expense side by 300 to &#x20AC;350 million.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I would like to provide the outlook, which reads as follows, and I think you understand that I'll read it, it's too important because we have a lot of participants via the web. Due to the continued uncertainties surrounding the economic and business environment, the company will not provide a specific outlook for software and software-related service revenue for the full year of 2009.</p>
          <p>The company expects its full-year 2009 non-GAAP operating margin which excludes recurring deferred support revenue write-down from the acquisition of Business Objects of approximately nine million, and acquisition-related charges to be in a range of 24.5 to 25.5% at constant currencies. This includes one-time restructuring charges, and we will report on these charges on a quarterly basis. Between 200 million and 300 million expected to result from the reduction in workforce, which negatively impacts the non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5 to 25.5% by approximately two to three percentage points.</p>
          <p>And it continues. The 2009 non-GAAP operating margin outlook is based on the assumption that 2009 non-GAAP software and software-related service revenues, which exclude a non-referring deferred support revenue write-down from the acquisition of Business Objects will be flat to a decline of 1% at constant currency. And you see the number for 2008 here, it was &#x20AC;8.6 billion. Finally, we project an effective tax rate of 29.5 to 30.5% based on the U.S. GAAP income from continuing operations.</p>
          <p>So far the outlook, and now I would like to enter into two topics. The first one is this one, the information on the &#x2013; on our SAP, our financial reporting framework. Since 2007, we prepared consolidated financial statements, as you know, under both U.S. GAAP and IFRS. IFRS has been mandatory for SAP since 2007, but focus of communication has been based on U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP numbers.</p>
          <p>The U.S. has allowed foreign filers as SAP to file IFRS since 2007 and has approved a roadmap to help to migrate U.S. filers to IFRS by 2014; that as it stands today. However, SAP has voluntarily also provided U.S. GAAP numbers. At SAP, differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS have not been significant. And I will show you the difference between our U.S. GAAP financial statements and the IFRS financial statements in a minute, and you will see that the difference is completely immaterial.</p>
          <p>And the consequences are following. During 2009, SAP will continue to report its financial according to both IFRS and U.S. GAAP. So we will not only provide U.S. GAAP financial statements; each quarter we will provide to you also the IFRS financial statements. That's the first bullet point.</p>
          <p>The communication, the outlook will be based on non-GAAP measures derived from U.S. GAAP numbers as we just did. The outlook we gave is based on U.S. GAAP numbers, no change there.</p>
          <p>The press release for Q4, 2009, will be the last document providing U.S. GAAP financial information, and our annual report for 2009 as well as the 20-F for 2009, then we'll only provide IFRS financials. So this means, beginning with 2010, we will then provide IFRS only information to the capital market. It means we will change our reporting standards to IFRS, the only &#x2013; and then the guidance in 2010 will be based on non-IFRS &#x2013; on IFRS and non-IFRS numbers.</p>
          <p>Now if you look to the difference in revenue and in operating income between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, you'll see first, if you look to U.S. GAAP software and software-related service revenue, there is a small difference. And this difference is simply coming from the different way how the TomorrowNow business is presented. Under U.S. GAAP, it's discontinued operations. Under IFRS this is not possible; that's the only difference. But if we use non-IFRS numbers, we extract the TomorrowNow business. And if you compare the non-GAAP versus non-IFRS, there is no difference.</p>
          <p>That was one of the most important decisions in connection with implementing IFRS for SAP that from a revenue recognition perspective we would use and continue to use also under IFRS, the U.S. GAAP rules. That's very important. From that perspective, there shouldn't be any difference except the one I just explained from a revenue &#x2013; from to our topline to our software and software-related service revenue and other revenue in SAP.</p>
          <p>Now coming to the operating income, you see there is a difference between the U.S. GAAP and IFRS operating income by 111 million only. And this is driven by the discontinued operations I mentioned before. That's roughly 70 million, and the remaining, I would say, 40 million is related to the different treatment of acquisition, certain acquisition-related charges which under U.S. GAAP can be charged against goodwill and under IFRS have to be expensed.</p>
          <p>But as we exclude all acquisition-related charges from our U.S. GAAP IFRS numbers anyhow to come to non-GAAP numbers, you will see here that on a non-GAAP versus non-IFRS side, there is one million difference only. So from that perspective moving in 2010 to IFRS shouldn't be any issue for the capital market. We have in between one year of education where we show you on a quarterly basis the impact from moving from U.S. GAAP to IFRS.</p>
          <p>And after this, I would say in quotes, please don't take it wrong &#x2013; and after this educational sessions, especially for analysts not located here in Europe, I think they might &#x2013; and I am sure that they will feel comfortable with providing &#x2013; with SAP providing IFRS financial statement.</p>
          <p>Now I come to the final comment I have to make. You all know that what we present here at the end of January are preliminary numbers. And I want to reiterate that our final numbers will be presented by the end of March in our annual report so the 20-F is a key for our &#x2013; for closing our books from a timing perspective.</p>
          <p>Subsequent events that may occur until then are to be reflected in our 2008 financials as far as they provide additional evidence with respect to the conditions that existed by the end of the fiscal year, so by the end of December 31.</p>
          <p>And here is one point I want to make, and that's among others. This applies to the legal proceedings that Oracle has instituted against TomorrowNow, Inc. SAP has recorded a provision for these legal proceedings as far as a loss is probable, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We talked about this several times, and by the way it hasn't changed as of December 31, 2008.</p>
          <p>For this case, another case settlement conference is scheduled for February. There is a sequence of different dates in February, and the 23rd of February is a date where a settlement conference will take place based on the request from the judge in California. And we cannot exclude now that this may &#x2013; event may provide SAP with additional information that might impact SAP's assessment of the appropriate loss accrued. So we have to see what will come then to the table.</p>
          <p>Both U.S. GAAP and IFRS would require us to reflect such updates of our loss assessment in the financial statements of &#x2013; for 2008. As the litigation results from the activities of TomorrowNow, such change in loss assessment would most likely only affect operate &#x2013; would only affect income from discontinued operations under U.S. GAAP. We do not anticipate any impact on continued operations.</p>
          <p>What we are talking about today, what we presented is our results from continued operations. And impact on our U.S. GAAP operating income would only occur if a loss became probable that does not result from the activities of TomorrowNow.</p>
          <p>That was my final comment. I think it's prudent that I make this comment, that there is no surprise due to the subsequent events we have to take into consideration. L&#xE9;o?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Werner. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for being here in Frankfurt or on the web with us.</p>
          <p>I'd like to give you a little bit of a perspective on what's going on out there. And in fact, as Henning already indicated very clearly, 2008 was a year with two very distinct faces. We started very well, we had a very strong start. We had healthy organic growth. We had excellent traction regarding Business Objects.</p>
          <p>And in fact, as you will probably remember, at the end of Q2, we adjusted our guidance slightly to the higher end of the range, because we rather felt very confident. In fact, I think we can talk about this today. We were on the trajectory at the end of Q2 that would have delivered the best year in the history of SAP. No question about it.</p>
          <p>Then you know what happened from that point onwards. The financial crisis accelerated dramatically as of mid-September with Lehman going under. And as we came into end of Q3 we had a chance to talk about that during the earning call. We were basically facing a totally frozen, panicky customer base. Many companies were actually first to panic. A large number of them were truly shocked, and you know the results of Q3. In Q4, the situation somewhat normalized. People got out of their shock and out of the freeze. People became again more rational but of course at a significantly lower level of activity.</p>
          <p>The good news is a good number of the slipped tiers in Q3 actually closed in Q4. In fact, as we sold for more than &#x20AC;1.3 billion software in Q4, which if you look at the absolute number is a pretty staggering amount of software. We signed important deals, people like ITT, Merck, Enel in EMEA, Sharp and APG. But still the environment has changed. And of course, it has also affected buying patterns from people.</p>
          <p>You will not be able to sell any software project today if it hasn't got an ironclad business case, a demonstrable, ironclad business case. In fact, not only do you need a business case, you need to have an ironclad delivery model to deliver the value that you're talking about. It has to be a very tangible and a very short ROI; time to value is as important as the amount of ROI. And therefore you have to deliver short, quick time to value, and that requires a significant approach change.</p>
          <p>And of course, as a big appetite, or a significantly large appetite out there for limited scope and limited duration of projects, because people are managing their liquidity and their expenses very tightly.</p>
          <p>SAP Business Objects had a very good performance during the entire year, in particular in the second half of the year. By the way, that's very logical if you look at their product portfolio or at our product portfolio, I should say.</p>
          <p>And the analytical part of it can be implemented very quickly. They go on top of any existing infrastructure. Of course, the data will be better if they're using SAP infrastructure. You can very rapidly get from those things a very visible return on investment. So that was one of two reasons, by the way, why we actually wanted to acquire this company.</p>
          <p>As you know, and both Henning and Werner talked about that, we implemented very rapidly a rather stringent cost containment program immediately after Q3. We were all of us convinced that we were not facing a temporary event. We saw that we have to do something rather quickly. We can have a long debate if the communication around that was good or bad factors. It was a very effective program, and it helped us significantly in Q4 actually moving forward as well.</p>
          <p>I don't think that it is prudent to expect that the macroeconomic environment will improve in 2009. In fact, we don't. And in fact, at least from our perspective, this is the most challenging environment that SAP has ever faced. All of the economic indicators, as you can see on the graph, are signaling severe downturns. And this is the OECD composite, a leading indicator. It shows clearly that for all major economies, we are going significantly downwards.</p>
          <p>I believe that the crisis is deeper than in 2001-2002, and it has a different characteristic. 2001-2002 was about IT, it was about one bubble that had burst. In fact, not all the geos in the world were affected in the same way. And this time and as the first really true global crisis that we are witnessing, what we are seeing is, is the interconnection of very sophisticated networks; therefore, it spread so fast and therefore it goes and reacts so quickly. The disconnect between Asia and the rest of the world was obviously a pipe dream. We are all living on the contrary in a very connected world, and therefore, we are seeing what we are seeing.</p>
          <p>All of the GDP forecast therefore are not very optimistic. The last one that came out from IMF indicates contraction in all of the major markets. And you know this as well as we do, there is a very strong correlation between IT spending and GDP and GDP growth. And no surprise therefore that Forrester in its latest research report, January '09, is indicating or talking about a 3% decline in global IT spending compared to an 8% increase the year before. And by the way, if you read some of the CIO spending reports that are published by major investment banks, they all seem to be going in the same direction.</p>
          <p>Many companies are downsizing; therefore, there are less people there, or they're postponing some planned investments. The good news is, though, and it's very important to indicate here as well, the good news is that there are still a significant number of companies who actually take the right decision, who actually believe that it's in hard times that you have to make the necessary changes so you can drive the infrastructure or the capacity to change your business model and are investing into IT. I have seen a very clear example of that with a very large deal that occurred in the end of last year in the United States of America.</p>
          <p>But the environment is what it is, and as we can't predict how deep and how long this crisis is going to be, we decided that we have to respond in a very clear and a very decisive manner.</p>
          <p>As Werner has already told you earlier on, we based our plans on the assumptions of a flat or slightly decreasing SSRS topline for 2009. And therefore, we decided that we had to take further cost containment measures in order to ensure the long-term competitiveness of SAP. So all of the cost controls measures that we have implemented in the fourth quarter are remaining in full force. We will also adjust the number of positions that we have in the company to the current market conditions, and we will reduce the positions to 48,500 positions by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now it's important that we quickly talk about that, and I'll give you some perspective on it. You saw already in Henning's presentation how much we have been growing our head count over all of these years. The reason for that is very simple: we have been growing organically over all of these years. And because we want to attract good people and train them in depth, you always have to hire ahead of the curve. We have done that very successfully over all of those years.</p>
          <p>I think we had the opportunity to discuss this in meetings like this on a regular basis, and the same thing happened actually beginning of 2008 as well. You saw the number that Werner indicated. That was already to fuel some of the growth that we were expecting for this year. Therefore, we need to make that adjustment in order to rebalance the number of positions we have out there with the growth expectations that we have.</p>
          <p>From this, as Werner has already indicated, we expect an annual reduction of personnel expenses in 2010 of about 300 to &#x20AC;350 million on a continuous basis. However, it goes without saying that we will continue to invest in the development and into training of our employees. They are at the end of the day the most important asset that any software company can have.</p>
          <p>We want, therefore, to make sure that SAP will remain a very attractive employer. And at the same time, we will make sure that we keep a focus on shareholders, and we want to be a very strong and reliable partner for our customers. These are our three main stakeholders, and we actually believe that this is a triangle that we have to keep in good balance.</p>
          <p>Henning has led a very strong, a very impressive drive to take SAP from a single product company to a dominant multi-product company. That was a major effort; it was a hard journey. But we now have the deepest, the highest quality portfolio that we have ever dreamt of. We cover all aspects of a business. We can support the work of every employee in every company, in every industry, never disregarding if we're talking CEO, or if we're talking about somebody in the warehouse. We can cover the needs of every person in every company, disregarding its size, in every industry in every location.</p>
          <p>We cover the core processes and industry specific solutions for companies of all sizes. Efficiency is provided out of the box through process automation, through insight and through transparency. We have taken the company all the way up to its mobility. We provide access to mobile devices; for example, CRM and the BlackBerry. You have probably read about the announcement we have made with IBM concerning a product called Alloy, where through Lotus Notes you have full access to SAP as well.</p>
          <p>So you can see we have a very broad spectrum, and through this environment, we can actually generate significantly new demand from our customers, be it by bundling certain parts of it, or be it by actually generating demand for the entire staff.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly elaborate on SAP Business Objects. I think we have already said before that it was a very successful acquisition. Fact is from a market perspective, by combining SAP and Business Objects, we became the instant leader in a very rapidly, very important growth markets for business intelligence; it's a $20 billion market.</p>
          <p>We helped Business Objects through our sales methods, and we made a commitment to you when we acquired the company that we would increase their average deal size, which happened in a significant way. We put in place our cost management capabilities in Business Objects as well. And therefore, we had an outstanding contribution from Business Objects, both on the revenue side, but also from a cost perspective. We helped Business Objects to boost their margins and bring them close to the SAP level.</p>
          <p>Business Objects in the meantime continued to innovate. We have major new product launches coming up. On top of that, what we did for our customers is that we consolidated the portfolios into one and made it a lot easier for an SAP customer to up buy instead of always upselling. They were up buying to the Business Objects capabilities.</p>
          <p>We have announced a certain number of new products. I don't want to take you through each one of them, maybe a couple. Most important platform launch is SAP Business Objects XI3.0 and XI3.1. And we will also be launching some new additional capabilities, but I'll talk about that in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Because of all of these efforts, we were capable of upraising a certain number of competitors' implementations on SAP installed base with the Business Objects &#x2013; SAP Business Objects products. And actually we overshot our own target, and we're very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we want to continue to implement a vision that we have been talking about since quite some time. You will remember that the key vision that is moving us forward is the seamless integration and the seamless flow of helping companies take a strategic decision, gain the insight, execute in the platform and get automatically back the insight of the quality of that decision and create a closed loop between insight, execution, business user transaction so that you can drive a company from end-to-end process from that perspective as well. That is one of the key reasons why we acquired Business Objects. It's also one of the key reasons why this acquisition is so impressively successful.</p>
          <p>We will be also launching a new Business Suite, a new release of the Business Suite, next week in New York. Stay tuned for that. I think it's going to be a very important announcement. It is completely based on our enterprise service oriented architecture. And we are very confident that we can deliver through the new Business Suite a certain number of very important innovations.</p>
          <p>Maybe the most important from a pure business perspective is the end-to-end capability that we will be providing. We will start to forget about three letter acronyms that come from another age and actually were invented by some market analyst companies. And we are going to start to talk again about true end-to-end business processes and the metrics and the KPIs that you can use to drive this. And through our new Business Suite that is going to be the backbone of the way we want to proceed.</p>
          <p>We will also increase the number of enterprise services that come with it. We will find some of the technologies that go with it in order to create more composition and combination capabilities.</p>
          <p>From a Business Objects perspective, we will push EPM, Enterprise Performance Management and GRC, Governance, Risk, and Compliance, significantly forward for two very obvious reasons. These are products that are in high demand given the environment we are in.</p>
          <p>There will be also a new product that will be coming out in the BI space, very important. There will be a release of Polestar, and we will start to combine Polestar with our BIA capability, our in-memory database, so that we can really talking about analytics at the speed of source and that can be provided to everyone within the company.</p>
          <p>We'll continue with our very successful approach of SAP Best Run Now packages. You probably heard about that in Q4, where we create specific, very quick, very easy to implement, very fast to consume, software and service packages that address specific pinpoints in the company. Example, liquidity management; example, supply chain transparency; example, purchasing so that they can really just address a specific area in the company so they pinpoint very quick return, and it's in very high demand these days as well.</p>
          <p>And our mid-market focus will continue to be centered around our two very successful products, SAP All In &#x2013; Business All-in-One and SAP Business One.</p>
          <p>Henning already talked about ByDesign, and I'd like to add a couple of comments there as well. We will continue our work on Business ByDesign. There will be a new release in the near future that will give another jump in functional scope. We will continue a very, very, very disciplined and a very focused approach on the rollout of this product.</p>
          <p>The reason for that is quite simple. If you compare our margins that we just demonstrated to you to the margins that you can see from even the best on-demand providers, you will see there is a significant gap there. If we would bring this product now to the markets, and that would be very expensive from a margin prospective.</p>
          <p>We do believe, however, that if we continue our focused approach, and if we continue doing the efforts as we are doing right now around TCO of that product. And I mean TCO from an end-to-end perspective, we can actually be in a position &#x2013; if we continue to do this very well that we can bring this product gradually more and more to the market and actually avoid the pitfall of that significant drop in profitability.</p>
          <p>So, maybe one last point that has made some headlines in Q4 as well, Enterprise Support. I'm sure you'll ask me a few questions about that. So let me anticipate. Enterprise Support, this might come as a shattering surprise to many of you, will be a competitive differentiator for SAP, not a handicap, a competitive differentiator. We will impose a new standard when it comes to support in the market.</p>
          <p>We will be and are going to be, this year already, the first vendor in the market who is going to make support KPIs publicly. And is going to get itself the measures according to the support KPIs. And I challenge everyone else in the industry to do same thing.</p>
          <p>And if you think about it, if software is indeed mission critical, and it is mission critical for 82,000 of SAP's customers, then Enterprise Support is the only support that goes logically with mission criticality. So, therefore we are firmly convinced that it will become a competitive advantage for us. Actually more and more customers are getting on that bench going in again as well. So, you'll see that that topic is going to start to have less headline news from the perspective that you've read about it in Q4. And you'll hear more and more about Enterprise Support as a competitive differentiator.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at how we will act in the market itself. Clearly as we are the company that has the capability to offer the entire bandwidth of capabilities from a sales perspective, we can take everything to the market from small projects with great tangible ROI but also strategic transformations through big projects, such as global enterprise agreements, that's a huge strength for us. We combine this with the broadest solution portfolio in SAP's history, and we have retooled again and again and again the sales force to turn it into a sales force that is totally value based.</p>
          <p>So we can talk the language of the customer. We can engage at any type of project. When people don't want to talk technology to us, that's great, we will talk business to them. And we are very capable in identifying all of these pinpoints and deliver ROIs through very, very, very stringent business cases to our customers.</p>
          <p>And because this crisis was actually created through a financial meltdown, we decided that we would also help customers in financing. And therefore we have an agreement with a large financing provider, and we arrange third-party financing for software projects, for customers. By the way, this is very successful in the SME arena.</p>
          <p>We are well prepared as we move forward as a company. If you look at us, we have a high level of protective recurring revenue; that's a very important thing. We have a diversified revenue stream across geos, across industries, across customer segments. We have the broadest and strongest solution portfolio in this industry. We have an unmatched domain expertise in &#x2013; as the dominating vendor in 20 out of 25 industries. We have a very skilled, a highly motivated workforce.</p>
          <p>Our brand's equity is the highest ever. We have almost doubled our brand equity since the year 2000. Therefore we have a very good reputation in the market. We are &#x2013; we have a unique ecosystem and combined with our own workforce we have a very high capability of innovation.</p>
          <p>We continue to have good win rates, very strong competitive win rates against the competition. We are very proud of the fact that &#x2013; now that we have 82,000 customers, we also have the highest customer rating satisfaction in the history of SAP, which makes us feel very, very good. We have strong cost discipline in the company. We have a very healthy cash generation and a solid financial posture. And at the end of the day, I think the strongest currency in 2009 is going to be trust, and I believe many companies have a high degree of trust in SAP. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Two questions, if I may. First of all, if I look into 2009 and to the cost situation there and the drivers for profitability. First of all, on the maintenance, enterprise maintenance side, can you give us an idea about the uptake, when you heard some numbers in Germany, 25% and a much higher number outside, just to give us a feeling how the acceptance level is in reality? Also, Business ByDesign costs, I believe that's an item that shouldn't really happen 2009 and give a strong benefit, but maybe you can go into more detail on that one.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on the Q4 savings of 220 million, I remember in the last session, Werner, you were able to give us a bit of a breakdown to get a feeling where the savings were coming from and hence how sustainable they were in terms of travel, third-party services, maybe that's possible this time around as well. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question related to Enterprise Support, and I understood it in a way that you are interested to see how this will impact our ability to increase support revenue in 2009, is it correct? Yeah, I think we said that the contribution on the topline of Enterprise Support in 2009 would be roughly, we said at that point in time, I think 150 million. That's still the case. All the discussions we have in specific countries might result in the fact that it's around 10 to 15% less, but definitely not more. And we have embedded this in our plan for 2009 already.</p>
          <p>The second question was related to ByDesign cost. I think when we announced the changed adoption in our go-to-market strategy for Business ByDesign back in April, we said that we would stop accelerated investments for Business ByDesign. So for the rest of 2008 and going into 2009, this is part of our overall R&amp;D spending we have in our company. And as you know, we do not break this down to different areas in R&amp;D, and I hope you understand that we are not going to do this for Business ByDesign going forward. So we show no accelerated investment. It's part of the overall R&amp;D budget of SAP.</p>
          <p>Now if you look to the 220 million, I tried to make clear that you cannot extrapolate these into 2009. We have one-time expense items included, or non-expense items, if you will. I'll give you some examples. Some of our AEs around the world haven't made the quarter at all because at the end of the day, didn't deliver on the threshold, say 8% of the budgeted of the quarter and therefore didn't receive any compensation in 2000 and &#x2013; every compensation, their commission in 2009.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we know that this very restrictive no travel for internal purposes cannot behold throughout 2009. We have a lot of projects ongoing, and we have to also travel for internal projects, internal purposes. So I would say that, and that's the reason why we were so cautious that you cannot take the entire amount, and I cannot give you an indication what the overall amount will be. We tried to package all of this into the guidance we have. And if you go through your model, you should come to an operating expense number if you stick with the indications we gave you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We do take the second question from Elizabeth Buckley [Arete Research] please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, just going back to the Enterprise Support question, you were talking 150 million in potential revenues minus 10, 15%. But just to understand the policy here, to what extent are you seeing clients in other markets ask for, let's say, a maintenance reprieve for 2009, and do you plan to offer them equal treatment when indeed they ask?</p>
          <p>And then you've talked about the revenue impact. Can you also talk about the margin impact because clearly, you are adding costs to provide this additional selling point. And so how do you see the impact on margins for 2009? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I will just give you an answer to the first part of the question. And maybe we should explain what happened exactly in Germany so that you understand why it's not an issue anywhere else. For historical reasons that go way back into the history of SAP, it so happens to be that some of the support contracts that we have in Germany and in Austria have a different language than those that we have anywhere else in the world. That's for historical reasons, we don't need to elaborate on those.</p>
          <p>When we decided to introduce Enterprise Support, the only way to do this legally in Germany was to withdraw, was to cancel the contracts that people have here and give them new ones. That was felt to be a little bit of a unilateral decision by SAP. We did not have the same situation anywhere else in the world; I insist on that. Therefore, we decided we would reset the clock in Germany and do it in a different way. I want to be very clear, by the end of 2009, once we enter to 2010, everyone is treated equally around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the investment in the support organization to deliver Enterprise Support we invested already in 2008. We will continue in the first half of 2009. I hope you understand that I cannot give you the precise margin number for this one. But if we start into the year, it might be lower than the average support margin we have, but throughout the year, it should come to this level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I do think we take one question from the web which we got from several analysts, among them Sarah Friar of Goldman Sachs; Ross MacMillan, Jefferies; and Rajesh Balasubramanian from Credit Suisse. It's again on the topic of the operating margin. Can you give us further color on how we should think about margin sensitivity? Is your guidance built on flat, declining or even increasing revenue expectations? In other terms, should operating expenses be flat or actually down in 2009? Not sure whether we can provide more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we cannot provide more detail as we provided with the guidance itself. But we make a strong indication if you look to software and software-related service revenue, we've said to achieve this 24.5 to 25.5 we assume that the increase or the SSRS revenue is flat or up to minus 1%. If this happens, we achieve our guidance on the margin side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. See a question here from Mr. Steffen [FaiResearch].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the Business Objects effect in &#x2013; or impact in the last year. It was around 6% revenue increase in software and software-related revenues, and in the fourth quarter it was around minus 6%, the impacts of Business Objects. And if my calculation is correct, in the whole year, license revenues including maintenance of Business Objects declined 36.5%, and on the other side, in the fourth quarter, it increased by around 24.5%. I already calculated these figures in euro, not in U.S. dollar. So maybe you can shed some light on it?</p>
          <p>Second question is in respect to the workforce reduction. You mentioned that you will reduce workforce by 3,000 people in the current year. Can you give us an indication in which areas? And second, you also mentioned in the press release it would be done by attrition. Why should I have then additional expenses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me maybe address your second question first. We will do the reduction in positions globally, everywhere, to all countries, all board areas, all departments, all divisions, all businesses. Of course, not as a haircut; it will be done by distinguishing the various needs, where we're coming from. But we should assume it will be happening everywhere.</p>
          <p>Now what we said also in the press release is that we would be using, first of all, primary attrition and combined with a very stringent hiring policy, very, very limited hiring policy. We also said that if this will not achieve our objective, then we will take some additional measures. We will always try to go for the socially most acceptable ones.</p>
          <p>And now like any prudent CFO would do, knowing that you can't really forecast on the attrition rate, we only have historical attrition rates. We have to make an assumption, and therefore you have a range of restructuring cost that are there to cover what might happen if we can't achieve that objective through the normal fluctuation. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question with regard to the Business Objects contribution. I couldn't follow you, I give you my perspective on this, and then we can have a chat on it. I do not want not to answer the question. But if you look to the increase in software and software-related service revenue, we said 20%, thereof 16% is coming from Business Objects products.</p>
          <p>We increased by 1.5 billion, this is 20%. So we can calculate what does it mean, the 16% out of this 20%, that's Business Objects on the product side. We have not disclosed anything on the service side. So from that perspective, I cannot follow you that you see that Business Objects in Europe decreased its revenue since it was bought and with SAP. That's something we can work on all together. But I cannot answer this question with all the &#x2013; with the limited information I have with me right now. Yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. We have another question, or two questions actually from the web again from various analysts: Mark Bryan, Deutsch Bank; Michael Briest, UBS; Adam Wood, Exane BNP Paribas; Jonathan Crozier, West LB; Gunnar Plagge of Nomura.</p>
          <p>The first one is cash flow conversion rate in the fourth quarter 2008 seems to be down a lot year-on-year, what is behind that? Also is this a result of a back-end loaded quarter? And DSOs went up five days year-on-year. I think Werner, you mentioned this in your presentation, can you please explain why?</p>
          <p>And the second part of the question is on the services business. Services revenue were a lot stronger in Q4 than analysts expected. Does it mean that you are taking more revenue back from the channel? How is this sustainable as service over the years? And can you give us more color on the pipeline for consulting projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then let me start with two. Clearly we are not taking revenue back from the channel, that's not our strategy, not our policy. In fact, there's a very logical explanation for the service of the consulting revenues in this case, they are trading. They are trading the software numbers that are generated one or two or three quarters before we actually start to book for service revenue. And that's a normal phenomena. People buy the software, we launch the projects, people come in to implement it. And therefore if you have a big head wave of software revenues you will see a trading effect on the service revenues. As we are coming off 19 quarters of double-digit growth in software revenues, actually the analysts would have expected something different. All right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look to the cash flow conversion rate, could you repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cash flow conversion rate in Q4, 2008 seems to be down a lot year-on-year. What's the reason? Is this a result of a back-end loaded quarter? And the second one was an explanation on the development of DSOs, which went up five days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cash flow conversion rate for the quarter or for the full year? Because for the full year, it increased, as I showed from 102 to 160. If you look to Q4, of course, we had a completely different situation in Q4 compared to Q4 of 2007. And definitely many factors play into or have to be taken into consideration here, that's number one. The accounts receivable side, it was definitely a much tougher environment as we headed in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>The working capital came into play, and I do not &#x2013; and I'm not so worried about the performance in Q4. For me it's more important to look to the full-year performance of 2008, and I think there we had a very positive development, saw a positive development on the cash flow conversion side.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I think the environment is tough, and I think, often there's a question, is it a part of a deal to extend the payment terms? And if it's &#x2013; we have then the choice, neither to close the deal or to look for the DSO. And I think we are trying to manage very carefully the DSO, but definitely is this a must for a customer. We would also accept an increase in DSO here on an exceptional basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If anybody in Frankfurt &#x2013; Mr. Wolber [Independent Research]?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And I would like to ask a few questions. One, on the 2010 cost savings statements that you gave, I was just wondering whether you wanted us to think along the lines, we take 2009, adjust it maybe for the &#x2013; it's quite a range but two to 300 million one-off costs to get to the cost savings. And then, which is about 1.5 to 2%, say, of revenues, and then add for 2010, what would be another 2.5 to 3% of margins, or whether there is any conceptional error in that thinking? Everything else obviously would be assumed the same and unchanged.</p>
          <p>And the second point, I know we've spoken about Enterprise Support, and I'm not going to call it a price increase but let's call it, a mandatory upgrade for a lot of customers outside Germany and Austria. Did you experience in the fourth quarter any pushback in other areas like people also wanting to have the choice not to take it, perhaps arguing a bit more about the license payments or anything in that order? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me pick up on your last question first. I've been doing this business for quite some time. I cannot remember a single customer decision with Enterprise Support, without Enterprise Support, with whatever, without whatever, where there wasn't a pricing discussion. So are we almost there, without wanting to sound cute, we always have said so what else is new, right?</p>
          <p>The fundamental point though is a slightly different one. The real question is, can you demonstrate value? If you can demonstrate value, really demonstrate value, it's actually a very &#x2013; pretty easy discussion to have. If you can't, it gets a little bit tougher, which is why I'm insisting so much on these KPIs for Enterprise Support because these are demonstrable value points for a real customer.</p>
          <p>It might sound a little bit arcane to you, but if you're running a 24/7 IT shop, it's mission critical. It contains SAP and non-SAP software. It contains custom codes. And one half an hour downtime might cost you hundreds of millions, adding this value discussion and demonstrating to those customers that through Enterprise Support, he won't be &#x2013; or she won't be in that discussion is a pretty important one.</p>
          <p>So that's the point I was &#x2013; wanted to make on this. Now, of course, we are living in hard times. And of course, everyone is trying to get a better deal, but that was the case in good times as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And to your first question, it is our clear objective to decrease our personnel expenses in 2010 by 300 to &#x20AC;350 million. To achieve this, we anticipate to spend between 200 million and &#x20AC;300 million for restructuring in 2009. And what you said is absolutely correct under this set of perilous condition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We take one question from Jochen Klusmann, and before that we have a question from the web. It's a question asked by Gerardus Vos, Citi, and James Dawson, Morgan Stanley.</p>
          <p>The first one is on the small and mid-sized enterprises business and the BRIC countries. Can you provide some color on the current market dynamics in the SME and BRIC markets? Did the financing offering for SME customers have any impact? And finally is Russia open for business?</p>
          <p>And the second part of the question is on Business Objects. Can you help us to understand why Business Objects grew so well, and how we should think about the future Business Objects' growth rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try to answer first the SME/BRIC question. Answering the question, if Russia is open for business or not, is a politically loaded question. Of course, Russia is open for business, but there is less business to be done in Russia than before. In fact, Russia is a pretty well example for what you see in the BRIC countries. And if you go back in time for SAP, you could have seen how much BRIC grew faster than the so-called developed world. And the economic crisis has hit the BRIC countries really hard. And therefore there was an adjustment effect that was equally brutal on the other side of the pendulum.</p>
          <p>That will smoothen out. That's just a question of time. Of course, it goes without saying that if oil prices and gas prices drop the way they dropped, raw materials dropped the way they dropped, and if you're in an economy that is depending significantly on the extraction of raw materials, clearly, there has to be an effect. And among the BRIC countries, there are some prominent ones that have this in their business model.</p>
          <p>SME, that's a bit more of a nuanced picture. In the beginning, right after Lehman and the credit freeze over, SMEs were hurt really badly. The liquidity crunch happened on SMEs immediately, and for reasons that you understand better than I do, the financing did alleviate that to an extent. But it takes some time for the financing machine to really gain traction in the SME market. I think it's now running at a satisfactory speed. Did it compensate for the entire effect of the credit crunch? No. But that takes some time, and we will be a very good long-term partner to our SME customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We take the question from Jochen Klusmann [BHF Bank].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a couple of smaller questions. First, on the two, 300 million restructuring charges for this year, can you give us an idea of how we should split that over the quarters? I mean from what I understood is you're probably going to ask first to see who is going anyway, so should we think of that more back-end loaded towards the end of the year, all these charges?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you give us an idea how much of acquisition-related charges we should expect from BOBJ in '09? You mentioned in nine million in maintenance write-down. I guess we're going to see more on the cost side.</p>
          <p>And lastly, according to your cash flow statement, you had allowance for doubtful accounts last year of 76 million compared to nil the year before. That's a little bit of a high number. I mean has there been anything major happening, especially in Q4, or is it just bits and pieces, reflecting a little bit the economic uncertainty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me &#x2013; I take these points and start with the Business Objects-related charges. I think also in 2009, we will see roughly 290 million on the expense side coming from the amortization of all the assets acquired. This year it was 297 million, so this will not change. On the support revenue write-down, we had 166 in 2008, and I think we said that it will be nine million in the first quarter of 2009. So I would assume here roughly 300 million also in 2009.</p>
          <p>The allowance for doubtful accounts is 76 million, was it this year 2000 &#x2013; the increase &#x2013; yeah, and I think this reflects the seriousness in the market we see, that we have a lot of customers who struggle. We had a lot of bad news beginning of the year with many of our customers simply going under Chapter 11, if you look to the U.S. So this was the reason for the increase. And I would say we have to keep a very close look to our receivables also going forward throughout this year.</p>
          <p>And the question in the middle, if you could -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The two, 300 million restructuring charges -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the phasing of the restructuring expenses. I think if you listen to the way, how we want to achieve it, let me say, we reduce or we ensure that by the end of 2009, we have 48,500 positions within SAP and that we use the attrition to achieve this shows that, first of all, we have to see how the attrition works throughout this year. And this is an indication that it's probably not front-end loaded here that we have a more balanced expense &#x2013; restructuring expenses throughout the year. This is not a guidance as we are just going through all of these programs. This might change, and we will speak about this when we release our Q1 earnings in April.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I do see one other question here in the room in Frankfurt, Mr. Knut Woller [UniCredit].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. Just one question regarding the restructuring program. I think if I remember correctly in the last downswing, you said you won't make any significant reductions due to the use of growth opportunities if the crisis was over. I think basically the same rationale should apply then from 2010, maybe onwards. So what is the rationale behind the restructuring? Is it that SAP is going to head towards a leaner, more efficient organization, trying to be &#x2013; to do things with less cost or what is the rationale behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rationale is actually only limited to the economic environment. At the end of the day, no one really knows how long this thing will take. If you're optimistic, you might believe that we will see an uptake in early 2010. If you're pessimistic, you might have to wait until 2011. We don't know if the uptake is going to be steep or shallow, and you don't even want to start speculating about that because it's too dangerous speculation. So the measures that we have taken are only in relationship to our goals that we see or that we kind of expect in 2009, and we want to be prudent from that perspective.</p>
          <p>You should not read into this anything concerning anything else. If you look at the textbook cases about agile or lean management, you will see that these are long-term measures or long-term processes that you need to put into place over many, many years. And it's not &#x2013; and lean has nothing to do with cost cutting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Might be I can add something because I was responsible for the measures in the last crisis. It was a completely different situation. We are just in a better situation. At that time, it was not a global one; it was an IT one. And honestly, the situation for SAP was not that good because our customer satisfaction was not very high and people were questioning at that time our ability to compete against the new kids on the block, Internet, et cetera. In such a situation, you feel, you feel it's not the environment, it's yourself. Now let's face a fact: we are very well, let's say, prepared, and the environment is the only factor I completely agree. At that time, it was really different.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My question relates to R&amp;D expenses. Henning, you show us an impressive numbers at the beginning, the transformation of SAP and respect and thanks from investors' side for his entrepreneurship. And my thoughts are going to &#x2013; this was connected with high R&amp;D expenses, and we saw some decrease in R&amp;D expenses in '08 to 13.8. What will be the direction of R&amp;D expenses in the coming years? What's your thinking about this?</p>

          <p>Well, that's a very good question, and let me make a few statements on that. And it shouldn't come as a surprise to you because we've been saying this now for quite some time. You cannot be in this business if you are not an innovative company. Innovation doesn't just happen. You really have to do the best you can do in research and development. And therefore, SAP will continue to be a innovative company, will continue to invest in research and development.</p>
          <p>I think it's true for the last 10 years, and it will be true for the next years, at the end of the day, you still want to do it as effectively as possible. It's not just about how much do you spend, it's also about how well do you spend it. And we have invested a lot into core competencies.</p>
          <p>Let me give you an example. And we invested into SOA, if we now assume that SOA is the core architecture that is going to drive this industry for a few years, then you don't need to reinvest into SOA. Now it's about making it better, extracting more value out of it. It's a different type of investment.</p>
          <p>That doesn't mean that you won't hear about new innovation, new avant-garde sort of SAP, but it's a different approach. So we will continue to have a significant portion of investment into R&amp;D, we'll try to optimize it. But you can rest assured that SAP will continue to drive its business model first and primary around innovation.</p>
