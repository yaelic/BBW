        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to our 2008 Interim Results Presentation. We know it's an exceptionally busy morning in the market and we understand we are with 15 other companies' results this morning and I think we appreciate you being here. I'm very pleased to welcome Tidjane Thiam to his first results meeting. And also joining us are my executive colleagues to assist in the question-and-answers at the end.</p>
          <p>I am delighted to be presenting a strong set of results this morning. The first half of 2008 has been a very good period for Prudential both in absolute terms and I am sure, after this reporting season, relative to our peer group. And our figures show a continuation of the growth momentum that the Group has now sustained over the last three and half years.</p>
          <p>This morning I'm going to talk briefly about the strategic growth drivers that underpin our successful performance and explain why these will remain appropriate for the long-term. I'll then take you through the Group's headline new business and profit performance followed by the top line commercial development in our individual business units. Tidjane will then go into much more detail on the financials and then I will conclude with some comments on outlook.</p>
          <p>But first I want to remind you briefly of our strategy. At Prudential we are focused primarily on the enormous opportunities offered by the rapidly growing pre and post retirement market around the world. Quite simply that's where the major growth opportunity in our industry is to be found. We remain confident that we've got all the key ingredients to continue driving sustainable value for shareholders. And those ingredients include our focus on a retirement led strategy, our international business mix and an un relenting emphasis on  generating profitable growth and excellent delivery.</p>
          <p>Now we're all well aware that these times of great uncertainty and volatility and of course that makes for an extremely challenging environment, but in spite of that you can see that we have delivered a strong performance. It's being driven by our clear strategic positioning and the advantages of our business model.</p>
          <p>So the headlines, growth in new business across the group was up 12% and new business profit increased by 11%. Our asset management businesses performed exceptionally well in a highly volatile environment with net inflows of &#xA3;4.1 billion. EEV operating profit increased by 7%, and IFRS operating profit by 13%.</p>
          <p>The cash profile for the group continued improve and overall the capital position of the group remains very robust. We estimate the IGD surplus at the half year stage was 1.4 billion, a cover of some 1.7 times. Naturally, there is a great deal of focus at the moment on the credit environment and as I said back at our prelims in March we came into this environment in a defensive position.</p>
          <p>Indeed we have been actively managing upwards the quality of our credit portfolio over the last couple of years. Because of that and because of our defensive positioning it's had no material impact on our results. Tidjane will update you further on the credit position in capital and in some detail later.</p>
          <p>As a reflection of our continuing confidence in the business and in our balance sheet we are proposing a 5% increase in our interim dividend. I used this slide at the 2007 year-end presentation and said then that the geographic diversification of earnings and risks are absolutely fundamental to the Prudential model. They give us a hedge particularly in times of economic volatility. We operate businesses in different cycles of maturity and in economies of varying growth and affluence, so you would expect us to deliver stronger overall performance due than we could achieve if we were overly dependent on any one market.</p>
          <p>And I think today our figures demonstrate the success of this diversification. Without doubt, Asia is our core driver of growth and profit providing 56% of new business profit and in fact nearly 80% of our total new business profit is now generated overseas. If you look at Life EEV operating profit and the scale of our achievements in Asia that I have just mentioned, you can see that the region now accounts for around 40% of our business on this measure.</p>
          <p>On an IFRS basis, the UK business remains a very significant contributor combining the continued strength and success of the With-Profits Fund with a growing contribution for the shareholder and annuity business. Finally, the rapid growth achieved in our asset management businesses means that they now account for around a quarter, around 25% of our IFRS profits.</p>
          <p>We've achieved that performance by maintaining a clear strategy and by delivering excellence in the implementation of our plan across all of our markets. Let's move on to look at the businesses and firstly in Asia. In the first half Asia continued to perform strongly with new business up 14% and new business profit ahead 15%. It's important to remember here and Tidjane will go into more detail that we achieved significant growth in Taiwan in the first half of 2007, that's over 100% growth that we saw in the same period last year. Excluding Taiwan which gives you a better sense the true underlying growth in the region, new business across Asia grew by an excellent 29% and new business profit increased by 26%.</p>
          <p>With that mind we remain confident of achieving a doubling of 2005 new business profit by the end of 2008. That's a year ahead of our previous stated target for 2009. One factor that continues to differentiate us from the other life insurers operating in the region, and one that gives us a great advantage, is a unique breadth and depth of our operations. We are not over reliant on any one market; we've got more top three market positions than anyone else in Asia, around seven now. And we truly have a Pan-Asian business.</p>
          <p>There were a number of very strong performances. Let me highlight a couple of these. Indonesia was up 96% driven by growth in agency numbers and increased productivity. And those of you here who were with us in Jakarta a few months ago would have seen it firsthand the power of the agency model and the depth and professionalism of the training in place.</p>
          <p>Additionally <mark type="inaudible" /> products are a significant growth opportunity and accounted for almost a quarter of our new business in the period. And the regulatory and political environment is stable and the market offers a huge opportunity for us as a market leader.</p>
          <p>And Hong Kong was up over 50% really an outstanding result given this is one of the most competitive markets in the world today. But underpinning our growth across the region is the strength of our multi channel distribution model. Across the region we now have over 420,000 agents and the profile of these men and women from the crew vary by market and vary by country. For example in Korea it's typically a 35 year old male graduate, whereas in Taiwan it's a 40 year old women with secondary education.</p>
          <p>Our focus on AGT management training on productivity and on our processes, reinforce our positions agency employer of choice for all of these people and that's been fundamental to our success. It protects the quality of the business we write and our market reputation, all together a virtuous circle.</p>
          <p>We are also unique in the breadth and depth of partnership distribution we have. We've got partnership relationships with over 80 financial institutions in the region. And I was particularly pleased to announce on Monday a deepening of our very successful relationship with Standard Chartered Bank. We are extending that relationship to new markets to Thailand and Japan, and that puts the number now in total markets to eight. And we are broadening our product offering to include health.</p>
          <p>The proportion of linked business and this is clearly a critical driver has remained in line with previous years despite the current market conditions. And also what has remained inline is the level of regular premium new business which accounted for about 86% of Asia's APE in the first half. Both these elements demonstrate that we are very much on track and this is very much business as usual.</p>
          <p>These two factors give us very good indicators of the powerful underlying trends and of the savings and of the strength of the savings culture in Asia. We also see an increased proportion of health and protection business which is up 56% this year in line with the work that Barry and his team have been doing and our strategic push in this area.</p>
          <p>There's been a lot of debate about the Asian economies in recent months and I want to give you my perspective on that. The table on the left gives a view of forecast GDP growth in the main Asian markets. As you can see there is no expectation of a significant or worrying  slowdown. And deep cooling is desirable in some places to avoid inflationary surges. Asia's clearly not decoupled from what's happening in the west but by and large it's becoming more and more capable of supporting growth internally.</p>
          <p>In April, Barry and his team talked about the significant growth drivers that we see in the region including rapid urbanization, a growing mass affluent class, changing family structures and increasing self-reliance for financial well being. These are all dramatic and unprecedented changes that give us a tremendous opportunity to provide a range of financial solutions given our experience, breadth and depth of operations, and importantly our proven track record. Prudential is exceptionally well placed to capture a large share of the value that will emerge. We remain very confident in the long term growth dynamics in Asia.</p>
          <p>Moving to the US. The environment in the US is exceptionally challenging but our performance there has been resilient and indeed picked up in the second quarter. As we expected at this point in the economic cycle, risk averse customers are moving from variable to fixed annuities and some of the competitive pricing behavior we're seeing from others is clearly unsustainable.</p>
          <p>As we have said before it is very important to have a set of products that means we can deal with varying economic conditions and the Jackson model being top ten in fixed, fixed index and variable annuities has held up very well. We've responded to changes in customer behavior through product innovation including UGNWBs and investment options in the BA range, as well as expansion of the fixed annuity product offerings.</p>
          <p>Total new business in the US was &#xA3;356 million and that made it a record first half. Retail new business of &#xA3;274 million was down 4% and new business profit was down 5%, affected by the change in product mix, the switch clearly from the variable to fixed. But importantly at the net flow level we are continuing to see very good performance across the annuity books; indeed the second quarter, the last quarter was one of the highest quarterly net flows in JML in the last five years.</p>
          <p>As we look into the second half we expect the VA market to remain challenging. as conditions should remain positive for fixed annuities. VAs will remain our largest product by some distance but to return to growth will need to see some improvement in the equity markets and even then there will likely be a lag in consumer behavior as we have seen before with previous market dislocations.</p>
          <p>But with the breadth of our product range we believe our performance will be resilient. We will also maintain our pricing discipline and as we have shown before we are prepared to lose share if the economics don't work. We will not pursue volume over value. In the current conditions there are an increasing number of sellers of life-back books, with pricing we see at more realistic levels.</p>
          <p>As we've said before the back-book bolt-ons are a particular target for us where we can take advantage of our scalable platform to integrate and reduce costs as we did with the Life of Georgia acquisition. There is no material updates here we are still clearly looking at this market.</p>
          <p>Then we'll move onto the UK. The UK has performed exceptionally well in the first half. We've seen an 11% increase in retail and new business APE and an overall increase including wholesale operations of 18%. New business profit was up 19% and the internal rate of return on new business was 15%. These figures demonstrate that the discipline and focused delivery of our UK strategy is producing the anticipated and positive financial results.</p>
          <p>As you know our strategy has three key themes. First to capitalize on our strength from the retirement income market. Second, to reshape our approach to retirement savings to improve returns and take advantage of our with-profits capabilities. And third to reduce the cost base which as we all know is essential to generating adequate returns.</p>
          <p>In retirement income our leading position in the retail annuity market continues to be supported by the strong internal flow from maturing pensions and that's contributed approximately 50% of individual annuity sales in the first half. That combined with our partnership business gives us a very, very strong base.</p>
          <p>We're also continuing to build successfully in the lifetime mortgage market and that's a strategically important market for the future. We believe at the end of the first half we are market leader with a market share of about 25%. Our approach in wholesale remains consistent and value driven. It's clear that in the bulks markets pricing differentials have narrowed, creating opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>And during the period we completed a bulk annuity re-insurance contract with Goldman Sachs for the re-insurance of just under 300 million of Rothesay Life's nonprofit annuity liabilities. This is an interesting development for us in terms of bringing alternative risk management solutions to the defined benefit bulk market. However, we'll continue to be selected and will only commit capital when returns meet our demanding criteria.</p>
          <p>Moving onto retirement savings where we targeted as you know major change and we've worked very hard to improve returns. In the current market conditions the Prudential brand in particular as well as the cautiously managed profile of with-profits makes us very attractive to more conservative customers seeking capital and income guarantees.</p>
          <p>Across the retail product range in the UK, 46% of new business was with-profits related. And there was particularly strong growth of with-profit bonds, which almost trebled. We also remain the clear market leader in with-profits annuities. We have continued to make excellent progress in delivering our cost savings target. The latest milestone was the commencement of the outsourcing deal sign late last year with Capita and which went live in April.</p>
          <p>We've also been in the process of establishing a group wide data center based at our facilities in the US. And during the first half of this year the UK business completed the migration of their data center to Lansing. And as you already we announced in June that we will not be proceeding with the reattribution of the Inherited Estate. Having concluded that the current operating model was better suited to the long term interest of shareholders and policyholders.</p>
          <p>Turning now to asset management, where, as I mentioned earlier we achieved excellent net inflow to &#xA3;4.1 billion. Energy in particular performed superbly across both the retail and institutional sectors of the market. They had net inflow of &#xA3;2.4 billion in total and good flows across all asset classes with exception of property. I would expect energy to have significantly outperformed the market. Critically in terms of investment performance this is fundamental to the basis of the success of M&amp;G is that we seen this year that half of M&amp;G's branded retail funds measured by funds under management had performance in the top decile. These flagship funds such as Global Basics, Recovery Fund, Optimal Income Fund and American Funds were strong performers. And over three quarters of our funds were actually in the top quartile which again gives you the underlying investment performance begins that virtuous flow. You have the performance. You'll get the inflows. You'll get the profitability.</p>
          <p>On the institutional side there was again excellent performance with almost 70% of mandates exceeding benchmark. Operating profit was &#xA3;146 million slightly ahead of that reported in the first half of last year. In these market conditions, investment performance is more important than ever and M&amp;G's exceptional track record is serving it well. Their outstanding performance was recently recognized by Investment Week when it named M&amp;G Best Global Fund Management Group 2008.</p>
          <p>We had a successful half year in Asia as well with net inflows of &#xA3;1.6 billion. An excellent performance given the 20% plus aggregate fall in the local stock market indexes. 900 million of those net inflows owing to longer term equity and fixed income products. We continue to extend our product range including major fund launches in Taiwan, Korea and Japan at a third new fund in China.</p>
          <p>And the significant fall of the equity markets had a modest effect on operating profit which fall just &#xA3;4 million to 29 million. We have continued to develop the breadth of this business. In Vietnam we have gained both new ground with the launch of the country's first institutional property fund. In Japan, where we have the second largest foreign asset manager we established a new distribution relationship with Nomura, our third mega distributor relationship. And lastly in our more recently established Middle East operations we have already secured 14 distribution agreements.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do at this point, to let you hear about our performance, is hand you over to Tidjane.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. There were suggestions by some of my colleagues that we should provide you with simultaneous translation in English. But we decided against that, so you're just going to have to put up with my accent.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased to be here today and to present to you my first set of results as Pru's CFO. Since I started four months ago now I have had three clear priorities. The first one is to deliver strong performance on our key financial metrics. We have made a number of commitments on which we will deliver. The second one of course in these volatile times has been to manage capital. And the third one is to over time provide you with you enhanced disclosures.</p>
          <p>I have had a chance to go around the group and familiarize myself with our businesses and my challenge is to make you as enthusiastic about them as I am with better and simpler disclosures.</p>
          <p>So let's start with how we have delivered on our key financial metrics. Mark has already given you an overview of this page so rather than to cover it exhaustively, I'll simply focus on a few select items: EV new business profits, IFRS operating profits, holding company cash flows and finally EV shareholders funds.</p>
          <p>So let's start with new business profit. On a constant exchange rate basis, new business profits have increased by 11% over the same period last year. Looking at our key markets, new business profit in Asia is up 15%, a very strong performance given the exceptional level of the 2007 comparative and I'll come back to that. The US experienced a decrease in NBP of 5%, whilst maintaining an 18% IRR, which I consider a resilient performance in a difficult market environment. And finally a truly exceptional delivery in the UK across the board, with NBP up 19% and a strong IRR of 15%.</p>
          <p>We are in a strong position in the UK with a very good set of results which stand out in this <mark type="audio gap" /> context of the UK economy. Retail new business profits grew by 10% to &#xA3;124 million and the &#xA3;5 million new business profits achieved in wholesale reflects the bulk annuity contract that we completed with Goldman Sachs. An average new business margin of 30% was achieved consistent with the same period last year. I'd like now to cover in more depth both the US and Asia where there have been some significant evolutions in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning first to the US, as you can see from the top end of the slide we have experienced over FY '08 a shifting product mix between variable annuities, VA's and fixed annuities, FA's. In the VA segment we are staying true to our value over volume philosophy. This contrasts with some of our competitors who are pricing their products, notably the living guarantees, at what we believe is an uneconomic level. Going after volume growth is not a strategy we want to follow when there is limited appetite from customers for these products. As a result VA, APE and new business profits were down respectively 20 and 15%. In the FA segment we have experienced some good growth as customers have turned their interest towards this product which is typical at this point in the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>APE was up 121% while NBP grew nearly threefold. Overall Jackson's margin's evolution reflects product mix changes. I want to say that we manage our businesses to generate a strong return on capital and that we're pleased that in spite of all the changes observed in the US market this year, we have been able to maintain our IRR at 18% from '07 to '08.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn our attention to Asia. Mark has already highlighted the strong 2007 sales comparative for Taiwan. What you see on this slide which I borrowed strenuously from Barry is the exceptional impact of our "What's your number?" campaign and of the launch of our new VA product in the second quarter of 2007. Barry and his team generated &#xA3;113 million of APE in Q2 '07 more than three times the average quarterly '06 sales.</p>
          <p>Please also note to your right that the Q2 '07 results are good, some of our best results, with an increasing market share from 3.2 to 3.7%. So, with this exceptional comparative in '07, it is easy to miss the real strength of our current performance in Asia to which I would like now to turn. So as you can see if you exclude Taiwan our businesses in Asia delivered 29% growth in APE, while new business profit grew 26%. I would like to highlight our achievements in a number of key territories.</p>
          <p>In Hong Kong the success of our two new linked products has driven NBP of 63% on the back of a 53% growth in APE and of margins moving up from 62 to 66%. In China, we are also progressing strongly, both volumes and margins are up on a comparable basis, remember that we shifted in '08 to a 50% basis versus 100% before. So volume and margins are up driven by a 45% increase in the number of agents and an 86% increase in agent productivity.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to have obtained a preparatory license in the Fujin Province one of the wealthier regions with a population of over 35 million people. India another important country, had an excellent semester with sales growing 45%, supported by an increase in the number of agents, which now total over 280,000 and a10% increase in their productivity.</p>
          <p>Margins, which were down to 12% you remember at year-end, are back up at 16%. Finally our Indonesian business continues to thrive with volumes up 96%, NBP up 80% and strong margins. This is an another demonstration of the value that our common platform and capabilities in Asia allows us to generate when we are a first mover. Our sales force has reached 54,000 an increase of 62% while productivity improved by close to 10%. These results should help you understand why we remain confident in the quality and the profitable growth potential of our activities in Asia.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to IFRS profit. Group IFRS profit, sorry, operating profit before tax increased by 13% to &#xA3;674 million. Our performance in Asia within this is worth highlighting with Asia life IFRS operating up 28%. We are understandably pleased to see our IFRS life profit in Asia grow. All of this NBP growth IFRS profit growth is very good to have especially in today's environment.</p>
          <p>But at the end of the day I firmly believe that what matters is for all of these to translate into cash, so let's talk now about cash flow. Holding company cash flow is &#xA3;86 million positive, up &#xA3;52 million. This is the balance between net inflows of &#xA3;511 million and net outflows of 425 million. Both the UK life fund transfer and the M&amp;G transfer have increased, so has the scrip dividend.</p>
          <p>Asia has contributed &#xA3;11 million net as a result of remittances of &#xA3;148 million which I think is a good number, and investment of &#xA3;437 million. Overall the group is on track to achieve positive holding company cash flow this year. I would like now to finish the section on financial metrics by reviewing the evolution of our EEV shareholder funds.</p>
          <p>You are all familiar with this slide I believe as you can see our EEV shareholder funds have moved down from 14.6 billion to 14.0, 13.977, if you round up, &#xA3;14.0 billion over first half, which is &#xA3;5.61 per share. This reflects both a strong operating performance and the impact of current market conditions. You can see in columns B new business profits, C in-force profits and D asset management, the strength of our business performance. In column F the &#xA3;1.949 billion negative short-term fluctuations are a function of current market conditions which had the following impacts.</p>
          <p>A negative &#xA3;959 million in the UK reflecting lower than expected returns on the with-profit funds. We had minus 6.8% versus 4.1% in our assumptions. So that's a difference of 10.9%, and when you do the math, it just gives you the 959, it's quite straightforward. The negative &#xA3;400 million in the US resulting mainly from reduced investment returns on Vas and from the impact of our bond impairments and I will come back with more detail later to the impairments. And a negative &#xA3;546 million, &#xA3;546 million in Asia reflecting primarily adverse market performance in Taiwan and in Vietnam.</p>
          <p>So let's move now onto capital, it is important to take a balanced and holistic approach when managing capital across a group as large and as diverse as ours. Therefore we focus on a series of different measures all of which we believe are important. You can see here that we are in a strong position on each of these measures. We take solvency capital we estimate our IGD surplus to be &#xA3;1.4 billion down slightly from the 1.6 we had at the end of '07.</p>
          <p>We are rated strong by S&amp;P. Only two of our peers are categorized as excellent; it's AXA and ING. There was a bet on this. I lost. AXA and ING. We have a strong economic capital surplus, &#xA3;2.8 billion and our EEV and IFRS shareholder funds are strong. In today's environment it is more important than ever to remain solvent. So I'd like now to cover in some more depth our IGD position.</p>
          <p>I've already mentioned the strength of our IGD capital position. It is worth taking just a few moments to describe the main drivers of IGD for us, Prudential, got that one right. The first important point is that UK with-profit funds are ring-fenced form an IGD prospective. And there is no pass through to the group IGD position. When you see the size of the with-profit fund setting that aside is an important consideration.</p>
          <p>Now if you move onto equity markets, evolution in equity markets impact IGD capital through two channels. The direct shareholder equity exposure and the value of equity linked guarantees already embedded in our products. In our case direct IGD exposure to equities is limited as most of our equity holdings, as you know, outside the UK with-profit funds are for unit-linked and VA accounts. Also in the US our hedging program significantly reduces the impact of adverse developments in equity markets.</p>
          <p>Another important consideration is credit spreads. The impact of an increase in credit spreads or in deferred losses will depend upon the size and quality of our asset goods. And finally, exposure to interest rate risk from an IGD perspective is dependent on the extent to which liabilities are duration-matched with the assets supporting them and you know that IGD basically if you have the ability and intend to hold the assets to maturity doesn't penalize you for movement which is actually I think correct and quite useful.</p>
          <p>Interest rate is also the level of interest rates guaranties of course embed in our product which are an important driver. So, in this context changes in interest rates mostly impact our Asian and US businesses as our UK annuity book is mostly run on a match basis. In Asia our exposure results mainly from guarantees on traditional shareholder-backed life products.</p>
          <p>In the US where most of the debt security portfolio is made of assets held to maturity, the main impact on IGD of interest rates is stemming from the mark-to-market of the FA derivatives. So that's the logic. Let's look now at the sensitivities and we run them at the half year. Our regulatory capital position is resilient as you can see with stresses on equity, credit or interest rates.</p>
          <p>All sensitivities here are assumed to take effect on June 30 2008 and no management actions are contemplated in this analysis. And of course results are estimated as mutually exclusive events so these numbers are not to be added. I think the numbers speak for themselves. We have a strong and resilient positive from an IGD perspective and which allows us to really withstand any set of circumstances, we can reasonably imagine today, including a 40% fall in equities from today's levels.</p>
          <p>The next area I would cover is our debt securities portfolio. The overall shape of our debt securities portfolio has seen minimal change since year-end. Out of the &#xA3;84 billion in the portfolio &#xA3;37 billion is within the UK with-profit fund. For the rest of the UK where we have about &#xA3;20 billion which corresponds mainly to assets backing our annuity book. The remainder is mainly unique things.</p>
          <p>Asia's portfolio is mostly invested as I said earlier for unit-linked and with-profit funds and those two areas unit-linked and with-profit present more than two-thirds of the portfolio. So the focus of this conversation should really be Jackson. The quality of Jackson's overall investment portfolio is good, having benefited from the actions implemented from the management team lead by Clark and Tidjane over the past years.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some more color on how we manage this portfolio. Jackson, as you can see, has increased overtime the quality of the securities it holds. Diversification has also been significantly increased to reduce concentration risk. The top 20 high yield holdings represent now 36% of our high yield holdings versus 50% eight years ago, in 2000-2001. So we've changed things quite a bit in that respect.</p>
          <p>Also, PPMA has adopted a modified total return approach which has allowed them to move from the buy-and-hold strategy used previously which could lead to large losses on lumpy positions, a much better approach to risk management. In addition since the middle of last year PPMA has repositioned its portfolio more defensively reducing the impact of the subsequent widening of credit spreads. PPMA has gone from four analyst a few years ago to 21. It has strengthened all its processes, relying on its own ratings and putting in place with credit committee as well as strong peer reviews on all ratings.</p>
          <p>So let's just have look at our residential mortgage back security exposure. The RMBS bonds represent 3.1 billion, 3.141 billion in assets at Jackson, a little more than 10% of the overall portfolio. Of these 3.141, &#xA3;254 million are subprime, 723 billion Alt-A, &#xA3;2.164 are prime. We hold 510 RMBS', 21 are considered prime at this point in time. Out of those 15 are Alt-A, and six prime. Therefore we have provided you with some more detail on the Alt-A portfolio for your reference after this meeting.</p>
          <p>So let us now turn to our impairments. These, bear with me because this is going to take a while, I'm afraid. Under the group's application of IAS 39the majority of Jackson debt securities are classified as available for sale, AFS, and are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. Movements in unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities are recorded directly in shareholders' equity. However, impairment losses are recorded as a charge to the income statement.</p>
          <p>Under IAS 39 is impaired only if there is objective and  analytical evidence but the net present value of future cash flow is likely to be the less than the principal. If the cash flow analysis identifies an expected loss under principal the short fall IAS 39 requires the write down to include the full mark to fair value of the security in addition to the expected economic loss.</p>
          <p>On this basis our decision to write down the bond is therefore based on detailed cash flow modeling. The model used begins with the current delinquency experience of a collateral pool that supports the bonds. By applying assumptions about how much of these currently delinquent loans will eventually default and by multiplying this by an assumed loss severity, we've calculated the magnitude of the expected loss for the collateral pool. Additionally to account for the loans that are performing the main item becomes delinquent and default we add 1% of the currently performing loans to the default. So the total estimated collateral pool loss is then run through a model of the specific bond structure to calculate the expected future of cash flows of the bond. It is this cash flow simulation which indicates where there is a shortfall on the principal on them. As an additional step we then benchmark what we've done against the fixed rating of both to confirm that our assessment is correct.</p>
          <p>We therefore believe that our practice on impairments is rigorous. Here are the figures from left to right, the 21 bonds I mentioned, the 15 Alt-A and the six prime RMBS bonds impaired in 2008 have first half, total expected economic losses of &#xA3;38 million. So the result of the cash flow simulation is &#xA3;38 million. In addition considering the market value today we had to mark those bonds to fair value and that triggered a loss of &#xA3;44 million. Another 21 million additional write downs in other securities with most of this 18 million arising from the corporate bond portfolio. With the additional impact of losses on sales of impaired and deteriorating bonds, &#xA3;5 million here, this takes us to a total of 108 which we've seen in your papers. So on the other side out of these losses, &#xA3;23 million impact on the operating profit through the risk margin reserve the RMR charge to allow for our estimated long term average defaults. The remaining 85 are recorded within short term situations in investment returns.</p>
          <p>A final and important item is the development overtime of unrealized losses which we show you here. What you see is that the total unrealized losses stand at June 30 at &#xA3;989 million versus 794 when we updated with Q1. So, you see the slight deceleration in the volume of the unrealized losses in Q2. And if you look at our breakdown of the 989, 719 are for securities where fair values are 80% or more. So, quite a high proportion of that is above 80 today.</p>
          <p>It is also interesting to note that if you take the below 80, the 270, 89% are of investment grade. The value of the bonds that have been below 80 which we show in the bottom part at this date of June 30th for three to six months, &#xA3;168 million and for less than three months, &#xA3;82 million, gives you some indication of our pipeline and the value at the end of June '08 of what is expected to fall into the more than six months category later in the year.</p>
          <p>But I'd like to stress one thing about that is that number, the 270 you see there, is very volatile. I cannot say that enough times. It is determined by the market level, it's the pricing of the bonds, whether they are 75, 60 something, that number will move you are aware, but July was a very difficult month. So this number will move up and down and this is a snapshot at a given date so you shouldn't grow too many conclusions from the number itself. But it gives you an indication of where things stand at a given date. So, as we close the section on capital I would like to stress once more Prudential's financial strength.</p>
          <p>Our capital position is strong by all measures and we've a clear view on our exposure to credit risk, which we believe remains limited at this stage. To finish my presentation I only have three more slides. I would like to talk about our disclosures. From the meetings I've had with investors since starting in my role, it is quite clear that there is a significant appetite for an increased emphasis on IFRS disclosure.</p>
          <p>I personally believe that it is important to achieve a better balance between our key metrics and how we value IFRS and cash. Let me now take you for a few examples of the kind of disclosures I'm thinking about. The first one is a slide presenting the development of pre-tax IFRS operating profits of our US business over a few years. This breakdown of IFRS earnings between underwriting, spread and fee income we believe is insightful and very useful in terms of strategic thinking.</p>
          <p>Clark and his team use it as a valuable tool to manage our US business and you can see the evolution over time as our VA business is built, the fee business, and a better balance you should see. You should expect to see more of this type of analysis in the future. Now moving on to Asia. I've been working with our teams there with Barry, Sandeep, <mark type="inaudible" />, they're all here, to develop more in depth cash flow analysis at a country level.</p>
          <p>For every year what we're trying to do is look at cash flows that are post-tax, post-solvency margin and thus correspond to distributable cash. So in dark blue you see here our projected fee surplus. In light blue we have a variance against our projected fee surplus, which is important to track to see if your expected infrastructure are growing steadily over time with only small adjustments from expected to actual. These two elements together make a fee surplus emerging from the policies in-force at the end of each year. And it is good to see it strong and growing.</p>
          <p>So in white, we went from a new business trend for each year as this illustration is for a rapidly growing business. As a consequence these things are of course larger than the in-force profits. The total net cash flows for each specific country are represented then by the red grids. The red cash flow profile generally leads to concerns, as regards the value of operating in a given market.</p>
          <p>However we are confident that as the business reaches maturity and the growth rate abates, the infrastructure will cover new business trend and the business will move into cash positive territory. With this type of analysis and disclosure,  we will able to make more explicit the value created by many of our growing businesses. And I will come back to you in future meetings with more information along these lines.</p>
          <p>Now if we step back and look more broadly at Asia, back in April we gave you a breakdown of our IFRS numbers by country and said that we would increase our IFRS disclosures. IFRS is complex, as you know, it is a mix of, particularly in Asia, of grandfathered rules, US GAAP, etcetera, etcetera. And what we have here is a new disclosure, this slide shows you the IFRS operating profits of the total Asian business for FY '08 and '07, split between the profit from the existing business and the new business trend, which we disclose here and which represents 10% of the APE sales on average. Although significant variations will exist between products and countries of course. This indicates clearly that we are growing our IFRS profits in Asia net of new business training. We will continue to develop and refine this type of analysis.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Mark to talk about our outlook I would like to share two final thoughts with you. We are facing a tough environment, however I believe that our strengths, our strategy, our geographic presence, our brands, our strong and diversified distribution, our capital, and, most importantly, our people will allow us to outperform in this challenging period. The second thought to gain is of a more personal nature. As some of you may know I had an interest in this company well before joining it. One thing I have discovered since I joined is that our businesses are even better than I thought. My challenge as a CFO is to find clear and compelling ways to communicate that value to you. It is a challenge I very much look forward to.</p>
          <p>So, Mark over to you now.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tidjane. Let me just spend a couple of seconds on the outlook. This is obviously an extraordinary challenging time with a range of distinct factors creating uncertainty for both markets and economics. The macroeconomic environment will doubtless continue to be difficult for some while. I expect Asian growth to remain relatively strong, but beneath the peak levels of recent years. And I believe that the region is now less reliant as I've said before on the west than it was a decade or so ago.</p>
          <p>But importantly, and that was the macroeconomic picture, the fundamentals underpinning our Asian growth remain highly positive. Jackson will continue to show resilient performance in the short term and I remain confident will outperform over the cycle. And in the UK you can see from this morning's figures and from the figures from last year that we are clearly delivering on our strategy. And in asset management we are exceptionally well placed to capitalize on the strength of our operations. Overall I would expect to outperform all of our competitors. We have a clear agenda and a retirement-led strategy in our business model with its geographic mix and diversification are extremely robust. And as Tidjane has just taken you through our balance sheet, capital and cash position have been very resilient. Overall we believe the prospects for the groups remain positive.</p>
          <p>With that point in time we just end the presentation and, what we'd like to do is begin the Q&amp;A. So let me hand over to you guys. Andrew?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew Crean at Citigroup. A couple of things I was just thinking about. You've raised the dividend 5% off quite a low yield. I mean the company yesterday raised it 10% off double the yield. You've got growing and strong cash flows, you've got a strengthening balance sheet, an increasing amount of your UK business coming from the with-profit fund which doesn't need shareholder financing. Can you give us some idea as to when you are going to accelerate this dividend from a 5% level?</p>
          <p>The second question was on, I'm not quite sure -- doubling agent new business profits in 2008 means you got to do 490 million of new business profit in the second half versus 336 in the first, which either means you've got a rabbit in your house  or there is something about &#x2013; whereas by the end of 2008. And how, if it is, you're going to go for that defense, how do we cross check, given the fact that you don't give quarterly new business profit figures, are we going to cross check whether you actually hit that the target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think -- let me take that in reverse order and let me give two seconds on Asia, before handing over to Barry to give you some detail. I think we will would view we have a couple of hatches in the hat rather than necessarily just one or two habits. But I think the nature of the business there, I think what you see is continued growth even over a 14 year period. I don't know of any other companies that have grown at 26, 27% top line for 14 years. That's per annum growth for 14 years, and we don't believe anything is in place to stop us doing 20% perhaps can give you some more color on why we're so confident about that</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Thanks Mark. Two or three things first of all specifically on the NBP if you look historically over the last five years we have generally done around 40 to 41% of the full year NBP in the first half. So there is a seasonalisation to the NBP flows. So, if you do the math with that we're actually getting pretty close so it does require that we continue to run fast as we have in the past but let me talk about that a little bit.</p>
          <p>To really understand what is happening in Asia you really do have to look at the results with a little more granularity, you need to look at this Taiwan effect that happened. If you look at our growth rate in the first half of 2007, without Taiwan we were 29%. If you look at our growth rate in the first half of 2008, without Taiwan we grew 29%. So the fundamental underlying growth rate in the business is what it was. Again Tidjane showed you the slide so it's graphically depicted, but I think it's really important to understand that. Also important to understand that one of the effects of this Taiwan phenomenon was that you might get the impression that May and June of 2008 must not have been very good months in Taiwan. They where the two best months in the history of the company save for May and June of 2007 which were sort of off the charts. So there is nothing fundamentally wrong here; this is still an extremely strong story.</p>
          <p>Agents, agency growth, is 37%. That's the average number of agents which is the principle metric you should be looking at. Productivity in that agency force as was mentioned continues to improve. You saw our good news earlier this week on SCB. I think that's really good news indeed not just because of the extension of the existing very successful relationships but the expansion into new lines of business and into new territories. You've got Hong Kong, China both growing over 50%; you got India that grew at 45% within an accelerating growth rate in fact in the second quarter over the first quarter. You've got Indonesia approaching triple digit growth, Vietnam is doing well, Korea we picked up market share. Again, all these things I think you may have seen or heard of already today, but you amalgamate all that and I think what it should say to you is this continues to be a very, very strong story. There are headwinds that are there now that were not there a year ago, but in spite of those headwinds this is still a very, very strong story.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the second part the dividend I think Andrew as you are aware we came out with the dividend policy a couple of years ago to say that we would get to two times cover to feel comfortable. We're not quite at two times cover yet. We're pretty close, but we are not there. I think the dividend history of the company again we want to be absolutely certain in our own minds about sustained growth and we are. And I think the cash flow is coming out of that; we're confident of cash emergence but we didn't think it was appropriate at half year to &#x2013; we were conservative on that and we'll look again at year end. But I think again we are very much focused on the dividend policy which we set at two times and we'll look again in those circumstances.</p>

          <p>Hi, Andy Hughes, JP Morgan. I just wanted to clarify something on the US business. I think there is no animal analogy like you said but hopefully can clarify some on US business without using any animal analogies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But basically when I look at the VA margins you report, they seem very high, comparable with actual about 40% of APE, and obviously if I look at the other guys <mark type="inaudible" /> and ING, their margins were a lot lower for 2007 more like 10% of APE. And that is a huge difference and obviously the concern is in the current market environment one of the different reasons could be explained by things like distribution. But also it could be described also described by the quality of the hedging that's backing these assets.</p>
          <p>And how long does the bear market have to continue before you have to start revising take up assumptions or some of the options in the US? And also VAs elsewhere, for example Taiwan I remember that Old Mutual recorded losses on their agent and international business because it couldn't hedge the Asian element of the VA. Could you also talk about how you're hedging that as well please? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...animal analogies... As far as the margins on the business go as compares to competitors, I can't tell you specifically what the differences are between our margins and their margins because that's very difficult to untangle from the information that's out there. What I can tell you relating to the topics that you raised is that all through the last cycle and all through the last calendar year or last 12 months is the financial problems in the US market that rolled out. We have taken a very hard line that we needed to price the benefits that we were giving particularly to guarantees at a level where we could hedge them. We've not backed away from that in the face of what has been very intense price competition in the US, as I think people are trying to hold the dollar volume of the VA sales in the face of a market that is just not accommodating to that.</p>
          <p>As a result if you look at the hedge results that we have on an economic basis we had a gain on our hedging in the first half of the year of about $50 million and the reason is that leading up into the end of the second quarter of last year when vol was cheap and we were concerned about the valuation of the market we bought a bunch of options, we basically over hedged our position. We over hedged vega and we over hedged delta and that served us well.</p>
          <p>From an accounting standpoint you get a bunch of plusses and minuses between our economic hedge results and what flows through to the accounting statements, but I think it was about a $45 million positive result that flowed through the IFRS statements and we had a positive effect of cost guarantees in the EEV statements, And so while the comparisons are hard to do, and I certainly I won't talk about any specific competitors it's very competitive over there right now, with people trying to hold volume.</p>
          <p>We are not playing there, we are not walking away from share we are not happy about the share we've lost. We've added wholesalers and our activity levels for those wholesalers are at all time highs. But what we have not done is compromise pricing in any way and what we have done on the hedging side is remained fully hedged and that's what we going to do. That is our response to the market that will be the response as long as the market remains in its current state of turmoil. So...</p>

          <p>The VA product that you sold in Taiwan was essentially a very stripped down product, a very simple product, not unlike what's sold in US. So there is effectively virtually no guarantee of hedge. Steve, I don't know if you want to add any more detail but I think...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning all. Raghu Hariharan, Fox-Pitt Kelton. Just two questions if I may please. First on the IGD capital position, I was a bit surprised that the capital requirements are static at 2.1 billion sterling despite such good growth. Can you give us a sense of what the drivers are and if there is any capital efficiency or if regulatory requirements have come down because of product mix? Secondly, the cash flow run rate or targets for Jackson for the full year if that's possible. And the third one I was wondering on the US, how does the regulator look at impairment of the bond portfolio and how does that impact your regulatory capital? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clark will be happy to take in reverse order the regulator view and the regulated capital and the cash flow, and the clearly, talk in generally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I get to set my own cash flow for the year is that what you said? In reverse order, right now the US regulatory standard is that you don't write down a security until it is cash flow impaired, effectively until the expected yield on the thing drops below zero. There is a proposal, SOP 98, that'll probably take effect this year end would be my guess. That's the latest draft of the thing. That would require a recognition of losses prior to something &#x2013; we'd put in place something similar to an OTTI standard, although it doesn't appear to be an OTTI standard exactly. We expect that to happen, we model it carefully as far as far as its impact on our expected cash flow to the group; this year it has no effect, and our capital position is very robust. As far as our cash payment to the group within the constrains that Mark would probably put me in, it is projected to increase over last year, a moderate rate of increase, I think reflecting the development of capital within Jackson. but beyond that I don't know. Tidjane?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The two things driving the required capital is fundamentally the business mix as you said and FX effects. So there has been no change, it's just the rounding, the rounding doesn't show, but you get the same number. The numbers are slightly different, we have a detailed brief of that and we can provide you with the balances for the year.</p>

That's question one. The second one is market consistent EV &#x2013; two of your competitors actually are on record saying that UK annuities and US fixed annuities will take a haircut.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There was one with two points -- and getting onto the third question. I notice you did an assumption change in your US VAs and a positive assumption change on your -- something to do with higher future margins on VA products. I just thought in this environment that seemed to be odd. I would have thought it would have gone the other way. I wonder if you could just explain that.</p>

          <p>The change was the recognition of the dividends received deduction on the VA. It's something that we put in there, it's always been in place, it's something that should be reflected in the assumption so we made that change.</p>

          <p>That's exactly right and in terms of when the new territories will come online given our model which involves identifying, training and putting pretty experienced FSCs in the branch, it takes a few months to get new territories up and running. So it's not the sort of thing where we would see a dramatic impact. I think, even in the second half of the year, you'll probably see more going into next year. The thing that would be more likely to have more immediate impact would be the introduction of new health products through the existing territories where we already have well trained sales people in branches.</p>

          <p>Jon Hocking for Morgan Stanley with a very croaky voice. Two questions. Can you just put some scale on the standard chart options in Japan please?

          <p>The scale of opportunities in Japan can we put scale around that? No, I think you wouldn't expect us to. In terms of bulk annuities, I'll let Nick talk about that but I think the important thing Jon and I think important myth first of all to dispel there is we were never out of that market. We've always been in that market, we've been selective, but we've been in that market and I'll let Nick talk to you more through that and particularly what's happening.</p>

          <p>You've stolen my first line Mark. We have always been in the market we've been active and looking at deals. We've chosen actively not to look at many deals. The rate of activity in the market of the movement is significantly higher than it was in the first half last year. So, in terms of our pipeline if you are interested in the pipeline, the pipeline much, much, much larger. I could put what I as regard as a meaningless value on it. The reason why I think it's' meaningless is just because deals are potentially in the pipeline doesn't mean you're actually going to write them. So I could give you a number, you could get very excited about it and we could land up writing no business in the second half of the year, or we could land up writing a significant amount of the business in the second half of the year. Our approach in that market has not changed one iota. We will continue to look at deals, we will continue \to maintain our financial discipline in looking at that, looking at there's deals and we will either write them or not write them on that basis. But the team is extremely active in that environment, whether that activity turns into actual business we'll see.</p>

What are the differences, why are you not having problem with their MVAs and that kind of thing that soured the with-profit market five years ago?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll answer those in reverse order. With-profits, Nick, if you want to say a few words or you happy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I'll say a few words about that. I think your grouping all with-profits products into one size fits all category when you talk about their performance in the last bear market, actually our products performed pretty well through the last bear market and I think what's attractive for customers and advisers at the moment is the combination of smoothing and in the cash of our equity fund product that's a transparent smoothing mechanism, there are no market value reductions in the equity fund products.</p>
          <p>But also the capital guarantee which in the first half of the year about 70% of customers took. So, it actually what we're finding is that customers and advisers are extremely attracted to those features of our with products' product and I would also I guess make the usual observation that our with-profits performance has been the best, with-profits performance on a 1,3,5 and 10-year basis. So, outstanding performance, strong product features, very attractive in current market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the reattribution, I think it was the perfect set up for that, which I think Nick's first line was a one size fits all or one size doesn't fit all and that's exactly the same position. There are different types of funds, our fund is an open fund, is a growing fund when you look at the amount of the Inherited Estate as a percentage of the fund, ours is around 10% whereas Aviva's was double of that. The fact is all of these different factors and the history of the fund just makes it a very different proposition. And it was our very clear view that it was in the best interest of share holders and policy holders the best long term interest not to go ahead with the attribution. Did you want to add anything to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one other point that's pivotal to our conclusion about the Inherited Estate was the fact that we don't believe that we have a surplus for distribution within the fund so we believe that fund is necessary to support the activities of the with-profits, with-profits fund and to support the investment performance and security there that's so attractive to our policy holders that's attractive to our policy holder it's also important to our shareholders as well.</p>

          <p>Trevor Moss from MS Global Three questions please. Having not written much fixed annuity in recent years, I was quite impressed actually by the way you almost seamlessly switched into selling FA from VA during the first of half of this year and particularly in the second quarter. Could you talk a little bit more about how easily that was achieved and what the outlook might be there?</p>
          <p>Secondly you majored on health insurance little bit at the Asian Conference. I wondered if Barry might give us an update of the rollout of that program and how we progressed in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, a slightly different question. I think your shares are trading quite a long way below your sum of the parts, Mark. And I was wondering how long you might be letting the shares trade so far below this number before considering taking some action to address the discount and indeed what measures you might consider in that regard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the shares are trading materially below the sum of the parts and they have been for some while and I think the way we look at this I think is particularly in the insurance side is quite interesting compared to the banking sector, because if you look at the two they are increasingly differentiated. In the banking sector you are seeing sort of almost winners and losers in terms of the share price you're seeing the RBS's and HBOS's at 55, 60% falls and you're seeing the Standards Charters and the HSBC and the other end 5,6,7% falls and have been quite resilient in this market.</p>
          <p>In the insurance sector you're seeing almost no differentiation and I think it's interesting when you look at the factors that are behind Standard Charter and HSBC, we have exactly the same ingredients when you look at the openers to emerging market and the emphasis of emerging market in different solution mix and the non reliance on any one country. All of these factors to us almost the same as the bankers as the Standard Charter and HSBC having increasingly you see there will be differentiation as again markets being to see the value of our businesses and our franchises.</p>
          <p>So I think we, in this market place, I think what we are determined to do is continue to deliver. I think we clearly have the number of ideas and things would be may or may not during the future, but the focus has got to be on delivery. If we don't have delivery, we have nothing and our view is &#x2013; that is the focus -- to watch share price every day I think you can get seriously &#x2013; I think the basis of what we do is the must concentrate on what we can control. I was PA to a Group Chief Executive here many years ago who said to me two things, he said if any Chief Executive thinks they can control the share price with the media or the analyst community is delusional and those words ring absolutely true. In terms of health insurance, Barry.</p>

          <p>In short it's going very well. I think Mark or Tidjane, one showed you the 56% growth rate number. It's becoming a larger share of our overall premium production which is really good news. We are moving very strong and steady in terms of getting product launched in different territories. I've got a couple new products in Taiwan, one just launched kind of early to say what the result should be but we're very optimistic and that help product is launched Japan about a month ago, very optimistic about that. We are mind of the impact this has if you go back and look at Singapore where we launched our first sort of new generation product which is now about 14 &#x2013; 15 months ago the margins coming out of Singapore had moved up materially. In a very significant and helpful way so we're on a steady course and so far that's just all good news.</p>

          <p>You're pushing your luck, but fixed annuities -- we almost all of what we sell in the US is fixed annuities, so annually resettable products. So we can reset the credit rate every year. As a result what we compete against typically short term certificates of deposit. Over the last several years with the flat yield curve we could not be competitive with say one year CDs and as a result we didn't sell much. As the curve has steepened the sales naturally flow into the product. It doesn't want to flow into equity product right now because the perceptions of equity market volatility so it wants to flow into fixed. We left the wholesaling force in place, we kept the relationships intact. It was a very frustrated wholesaling force for several years. But we held everything together and so the sales just naturally flow into the fixed annuities in this sort of the equity environment with this shape of the yield curve.</p>

I wonder if you could perhaps update us on that. And secondly I'm thinking vis-a-vis your arrangements in Standard Chartered bank, given where your share price is, if there was another bank which was capital strong and wanted to have a go at you, is there financial penalty in breaking the Standard Charted agreement and that is a large penalty?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the latter I think we don't talk about the details and I'm not going to give you any sense of the commercial terms you would expect us as you would expect Standard Charted to protect the position and I think what I can say is we have an exceptional relationship that's been going on, this is our tenth year of this relationship and we see this continuing as we've announced well into the future, with commercial terms I don't think that you would expect us to give.

          <p>Well there are going to be enormous opportunities and in fact there is already a lot of work going on to pursue those opportunities no big announcements yet but there is absolutely no doubt that there is going to be, not just in China, but in a number of Asian markets there's going to be some large scale Asian opportunities and we've got a very highly qualified and experienced team on the ground that's pursuing opportunities now. So we are very optimistic about that.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Blair Stewart from Merrill I've got three quick question perhaps can you give us an idea of how far you are away from the market MVA right of pricing and in terms of what your charges are relative to the average in the market you talked about some of rational pricing. And secondly I think, Mark, you were quoted on the news wires as saying you expected the margins in Asia to finish the year around the current level. I don't know if that was a misquote or if you were referring to product by product margins. If you could perhaps clear that up, because I think there was an indication that margins are seasonally stronger in H2. And thirdly you talked about the impact on your solvency from a certain level of defaults versus expectations could you comment on that in respect of what happened last time, particularly in the US and what your expectations are going forward for that?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The benefits will differ slightly, so I can't say this product, this identical product we're this much different but when we run our pricing models against some of what are the current part benefits out there, we're generally 20 to 40 basis points of those. Sometimes in a couple of instances more, but that's kind of a good general range. And that wouldn't be off of every benefit in the market it's off of some of the hot ones right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I wouldn't be the first Chief Executive to say I was misquoted during the conference call, I think I said at or around current levels. You're right there is a seasonal factor in the second half we would expect that to kick in again. There's no reason why that wouldn't kick in. And in terms of solvency Tidjane are you happy to...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've done is quite stringent because we've applied those defaults across the board, across market and you'll see they vary between the long term trend and the worst of a cycle, credit cycle you'll get three to five times the credit default you had before. So I think three to five times is  comparable with what we have in the US at this time. Clark is it correct? Went from 2 to 10% numbers I have in mind. So it's a pretty extreme event.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Standard and Poor's. I'd just like to come back on the bulk purchase annuities here in the UK where you mentioned you had a very busy pipeline, but it may turn out to be no different. Are you finding you're sort of getting to the second round of these bulk transactions more frequently than the say six months ago? I think the noise in the industry is that you are. And I wonder if you could perhaps give us some color on that. And I was also going to ask if there are maybe any opportunities, if you could give us some color on fixed index annuities in the US and perhaps whether the possible requirements for distributors to be registered with the SEC may, for example present any opportunities, thank you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the FIA market in the US in context, there were in first quarter the last statement of industry statistics available, there were $63 billion worth of annuity sales, fixed indexed annuity were 6 billion of that, variable annuities is really where it's at, at 42 billion. Fixed index annuities are under a lot of market conduct pressure in the US rate now. There was a Dateline show, Dateline is one of these news magazine shows, and you have the camera crew busting in on an FIA sale and that's really-really bad for perceptions of the product.</p>
          <p>And the SEC is responding to that and some of the pressure coming from the attorney generals of some of the states related to that product type. I think we have seen this coming. And we have talked about some kind of event like just coming. Our focus has been in the broker dealers and in the banks selling product that is more straightforward than the products sold in the general agency segment of the market. And as a result in our position has been we are number one in the broker dealers and right now we're number two in the bank. We're bouncing back and forth between number one number two in the banks. And so we like those positions given to us we have been filing all of our sales material that material with FINRA to get it reviewed by them so that it basically meets FINRA standards. We have been holding seminars with broker, dealers about how they would properly supervise FIA sales in light of the bulletin 05-50 in which they advise broker dealers to strongly advice broker dealers to supervise fixed index annuity sales by registered representatives. So, we positioned ourselves I think very strong on this and have good positions in what is really just a sliver of the FIA market.</p>
          <p>What will happen as a result of this? My guess would be the market will shrink, the business that's being written non registered today, I don't see just flipping over to be written registered because of the reps that write it while they may be registered can they really write similar products through a broker dealer? I'm skeptical there, that's not what our strategy is built around. So if I had to guess my guess would be it's going to take a couple of years but this requirement for registration will probably go through in some form and that would be good for our position and the banks and then the broker dealers and we'll have a larger share in a smaller market but it's not our primary focus.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Reiterate the point that we haven't changed our return criteria and so nothing's changed in terms of what we're doing. I guess what's happened is partly good old fashioned supply and demand. If you look back to the first half of 2007 there were an awful lot of people who had capital they wanted to deploy and there weren't actually that many deals to write whereas now there are a significant number of deals out there. And some people have rather hastily deployed their capital and I think perhaps we're reaping the benefits of that in that some of the competition may be now looking at the returns that they achieved on the deals that were written during the course of the last year. And so inherent orders. I mean I think we've been very cautious in this marketplace and then maybe that caution is been rewarded. We are reaching the second round of more transactions and that isn't as I say because we changed our return criteria. I think interestingly what's happened we've seen in a number of situations there is real appetite to do business with the Prudential to do business with a strong brand that is saleable to pensioners and also a business that has very strong financial security.</p>

          <p>Got you. I just wanted to clarify, Tidjane, you talked about margins on an MCV basis and US fixed annuities being negative. I don't think you answered the UK annuities as part of Greg's question. Just going on from that, I notice that since the year ago your assumed corporate bond spread in the UK has now grown up from 70 to 170 basis points. Liquidity premium in swaps is probably only 50 to 60. What would be the impact and I assume also it will be a problem in the US that where you are assuming spreads of 175 basis points. What will be the impact of market consistent on your EV as well as on that UK annuity pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a very interesting question. I think the liquidity premium went from 84 to 101. But any way the point is we are committed to disclosing the MCV numbers in due course. What we have done as you know a 25 basis point increase in the spread and we've considered 75% of that 17 basis point as liquidity, 25 as credit and value the EV 17 to 84, which is one to one. That's what we've done. It's in the papers. But the point is we will communicate in due course the impact of CE . But you wouldn't expect me to go any further here today, but in due course we will present all these impacts but as a whole, because I think it's not really productive to pick at individual products and try to have that discussion now, but we will in due course talk about it in an adequate level of detail.</p>

Dave, was there anything else do you want to add to that point? No?</p>

          <p>It's Matt Lilley from Lehman. Just on the margins in Asia you showed the year-on-year comparison and they're very similar but sort of as Blair mentioned down a bit county by country from the full year, so Hong Kong was down 7 percentage points, Korea down 4, Taiwan down 7. If that is seasonality, what is it is it level of volumes or different products? What will happen in the second half of the year?</p>

          <p>I think there is a mix. I think that is one of your questions that you sent out this morning, so I'm glad you asked it and we were of course prepared to answer it. But I think, as Barry said, Matt, it is a mix. You've seen margins in the UK, in Hong Kong go up and there is general movements throughout the portfolio during the year. Overall at that 46% margin, we expect that to be at or around I think it was the terminology not to sort of recommit myself to anything but I think we expect to continue to move up. And we manage I think we manage in each of the individual countries we don't manage their overall margins. Andy?</p>

          <p>Hi. Sort of a follow up question Andrew and Greg's questions on MCV. I mean you mentioned that the economics are important, and not the accounting, but obviously if you look at your current accounting treatment it looks as if there's not a lot going on in terms of the US credit impact because you have got a buy and hold strategy in the US. If the market value of the bonds fall it does not impact the EV at all. When you move to MCV and potentially when these new regulatory changes implemented in the US, things will change and will that change your appetite to buy and hold, will you then become more sensitive to managing your embedded value or will you just tolerate spread movements and the impact on the embedded value.</p>

          <p>Clark, are you happy to take that, or..?.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the US the regulatory accounting is book value accounting, so MCV per se won't do anything on it. The SOP-98 will have some impact on surplus from the OTTI marks. The OTTI marks look, let's say it's not clear that fair value is going to be the standard in the US though right now. The SOP-98 doesn't appear to be moving towards fair value as the standard just a tighter standard than recovery of principle.</p>
          <p>But that will have some impact on surplus, but if you look at our current surplus position, current surplus RBC ratio, risk based capital ratio is 535, if we look at our largest competitors their average RBC ratio is 450 and their median RBC ratio is 383. If we disgorge a billion dollars out of our surplus, our RBC ratio is 419. So we have a very strong capital position in this. So if we have to absorb some of these losses ,fine. As far as the appetite for fixed annuities in US, if the accounting conventions became so awful that you had to start carrying a buffer on regulatory capital to take into account just surplus swings.</p>
          <p>Well at the end of the day true economics were cash flow and cash flows is defined by regulatory accounting and so that what will have an impact. Right now the accounting is such that we're able to look through that what we think the economics are and that will be our position. And stuff that is on the table right now I don't think it really changes our posture towards our various lines of business. Okay.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was an outstanding question. Mine was just a point of clarity. If I not mistaken on the US statutory result regime even if you do and pay under this OTTI don't you only smooth it over a number of years into the surplus number and hence it's quite a significant buffering effect, am I correct in that understanding?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on the characterization of the loss whether the characterization of the loss is as credit or interest rate related. And if you take a credit impairment on a bond that you hold my understanding of and again SOP-98 isn't anything but a proposal right now. So we're speculating about speculation but as is right now is I understand that if it's credit impairment you're market through your asset valuation reserve which is typically accounted as capital &#x2013; you normally look a capital in the US on a regulatory basis it's capital surplus and asset valuation reserve. If you sale a bond if it's not been downgraded more than two NAIC categories where that would equal a notch two notches from rating agency category like from single A to double B. If it's gone down two notches at least then it goes into AVR and if it has not gone down to losses it goes into IMR, Interest Maintenance Reserve. Interest Maintenance Reserve is amortized over the remaining life of the security as if you would continue to hold it. AVR is a charge. An AVR charges a time specific charge through that reserve.</p>
