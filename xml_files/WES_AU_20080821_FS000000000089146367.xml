        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm joining with by John Gillam, Ian McLeod, and Terry Bowen and Stewart Butel from our Resources Division, Keith Gordon who runs our Industrial divisions, and Gene Tilbrook. And John and Stewart, myself and Gene will run through some competitive presentation. As most of &#x2013; some of you know, we're trying to reduce the number of businesses with presenting on the number of presenters we've got. That's the case is relatively disciplined in terms of time, I know it's a busy time for you all and so then we've got time for questions as well.</p>
          <p>If I just talk about the highlights of the year, which is slide 4. We got the slide here, thank you. It's obviously have been a pretty significant year for the growth with the acquisition of the Coles Group, lots of other external challenges, and a very busy year for everyone in the Group. In that context, we are very pleased to report a profit of $1.05 billion, up significantly from last year.</p>
          <p>Importantly as a time when we were progressing the acquisition and then the seven months since when we've being doing a heck of a lot of business, heck of a lot of work on that business, what's really important is that the businesses we own for the full year performs very well. And John will talk about his business, Gene will talk about his, and I'll talk about some of the others later on, but I think that was very pleasing.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally, we think that the Group is in good shape financially. Dividends, as you'll see we've declared a final dividend of $1.35 per share in line with previous guidance. Importantly the Coles integration team has dismantled. And that team was in place, it's longer a couple of weeks before we've completed the acquisitions of the business. We've now setup each of the Coles businesses as divisions in their own right or a part of divisions within the Wesfarmers Group, responsible for the things they should be responsible for including IT, Human Resources, Supply Chain and the like. We've dealt with a lot of legacy issues that has been in Coles, and we've facilitated the businesses getting on with things, and one of the things we've said earlier on is judge us on pace of change, and I think there's been a lot of change because that is required of the business, and a lot has happened.</p>
          <p>We have now got the new Coles team on the ground and in place. I think that's a world-class team and we'll talk about how he's seeing the business shortly. Stuart Machin who is the Operations Director arrived last week. He thought it was pretty poor performance, he stopped in to see one store on his way from the airport to the hotel rather than any more but he's well on things. So we've got that team on the ground and in place and I'm confident, it's a very, very good team.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to dwell on slides 5 and 6 in the packet in terms of the Group performance summary. You've all &#x2013; can see that information.</p>
          <p>If I move to slide 7, which is non-trading items. It's a bit slow &#x2013; just to highlight that there's about $100 million of non-trading items, significant part of that is obviously through Coles and details of the other areas including the sale of Unigas, the sale of Koukia and any impairment against our investment in the Centrepoint Alliance in insurance. We gave &#x2013; previously gave guidance on the Coles that non-trading items would be up to $200 million, so you can take from this that there is some remaining and we would expect less than $100 million of non-trading items still to come through.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, in terms of divisional performance, we had talked about eight of the businesses but just a couple of comments, obviously the performance of Bunnings has been outstanding, or Home Improvement has been outstanding again, and that continues a long run of very strong performance of that business over many, many years and it's a combination of improving our offer for customers and continuing to grow our footprint in the business.</p>
          <p>The Coles, Ian will talk about Target, a strong year, Kmart improving, but a lot to do; the Resources division, a good run home. The reason we've gone backward in terms of return on capital in Insurance is because we've got a full year of new businesses in that business and we had a tough time in the underwriting business, as I'll come back to that a bit later. Clearly industrial and safety performance continues to be strong and that's a credit to very good management in that business.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with performance of CSBP and Energy, they would have been better if it hadn't been for Varanus oil and gas explosion, but we had improved earnings there &#x2013; return on capital in both of those businesses is down because of, in the case of CSBP, the AN plant, which early started production left in the financial year. And in Energy due to the LNG facility and our investment in Coregas coming through in each working capital. But as I said, we were pleased with the performance in those businesses.</p>
          <p>The next slide, which is return on shareholder's funds, I just want to talk about this one and I'm sure we'll have discussions about it later. Our objective at Wesfarmers is to provide a satisfactory return to shareholders and it's been that since 1984. Key measure of providing a satisfactory return to shareholders we think is total shareholder return and that involves improving our returns on invested capital and growing that invested capital.</p>
          <p>The ROE for the year is pretty much in line with where we expect it to be when we acquired Coles and our task is to improve that and we'll do that through improving the return on capital in all of our businesses by doing what I just said by improving the operations in our business and investing in them. We've done that very successfully in the past with Bunnings, we've done it with our rural interest, we've done it with Curragh, we've done it with the assets we acquired in Howard Smith through BBC hardware, and Blackwoods, and we did it with the <mark type="inaudible" /> Group and I'm very confident we will do it with the Coles business.</p>
          <p>We have targets for each of our businesses for the next 12 months and over this next five years. And obviously, we've put in place the Wesfarmers systems, our Wesfarmers processes and we have management in place in each business now that I'm confident will deliver on these things. And this focus on return on capital and ultimately return on equity is supported by incentive arrangements and that's twofold: management in the group all have shares and a significant amount of their personal wealth tied up as investments in Wesfarmers. And secondly, a key part of executive remuneration is return on capital and return on equity and that continues.</p>
          <p>The slide 10 is just a chart which shows you the movement in shares on issue and obviously, two big factors there were the acquisition of Coles which was substantially opposed through consideration in our issue and the subsequent equity rising. The final slide I talk to is our earnings, cash flow and dividends per share which we begin to outline in the information pack and happy to take any questions on that later on. So with that all, I'm happy to handover to John, who can talk to you about the Home Improvement and Office Supplies division.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Richard. I'll start with slide 14 that speaks to about &#x2013; and I'll comment firstly on those Bunnings results. Bunnings finished the year strongly as far as targeting market conditions in the second half. Trading revenue grew by 12% within our grow listing earnings of 11.6%. Trading earnings which we adjusted exclude our property activities grew by almost 17% and our overall trading margin strengthened to 10.8% for the full year. Return on capital improved to 31% despite a strong investment program. We got to continue to focus on inventory productivity and property portfolio management which contributed to the improved ROC. We have a significant slightly focused in the business as placing the three factors all going to trend in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Turning on to slide 15, as you can see retail sales growth for the year was 13.9% with store on store growth of 11.3%. The growth had slowed in the March to June period. Trading is holding out well given the current economic environment and strong returns are being generated from our existing networks through good merchandising activities, improved operational disciplines and a continued reinvestment in our stores, 17% of the network was upgraded during the year.</p>
          <p>We're particularly pleased with the 6.3% lift in trade sales given the continued weakness in most of the housing markets and this improvement shows the traction of strategies put in place in our trade business over the last two or so years. During the year we opened 11 warehouse stores and two small format stores as well as expanding our place in the network and details of the network movements are contained in the supplementary pack at slide 23. There continued to be a strong focus within Bunnings on efficiency backed by enhancements to our systems and supply chain. Good progress and outcomes are being achieved by this work.</p>
          <p>Turning to the outlook for this financial year, slide 16. Trade and retail conditions are likely to constrain growth relative to the past few years. However, we expect to deliver continued sales and earnings growth from a focus on improving service, providing a stronger offer, network investment and efficiency and effectiveness work. Further gains are also expected in the trade business.</p>
          <p>Moving through now to slide 18. In terms of the Officeworks result, trading revenue grew 1.6% for the seven months to June 30 with earnings of 36 million and an EBIT margin of 4.5%. Earnings included one-off acquisition and restructuring costs as well as significant catch up expenditures to address past neglect. Trading was impacted by product consumer spending, greatly reduce small business confidence and rigorous competition. Combined with disruptions from business operation and integration activities and work, we're steadying the strategic agenda, it's clear the business had dealt with a lot in a short period of time.</p>
          <p>Turing to slide 19, our focus since the change of ownership has been on reinvigorating Officeworks as a category killer, with strategies underway to reestablish range authorities, supported by stronger in-store service and a transition to everyday lowest prices. Internal activities are being rapidly aligned towards supporting and delivering these outcomes. There is now a single buying team in place focused on driving effective merchandising strategies across all channels of the business and eliminating past channel conflict.</p>
          <p>New branding has been well received while the new in-store look has been trialed with very pleasing results. The transition to EDLP has been challenging but we're encouraged by the good level of transaction growth we're enjoying. In terms of outlook for '08, '09, the distraction of integration is now diminishing and the focus on <mark type="inaudible" /> is now firmly on executing the business reintegration strategies. Economic conditions remain challenging but the expectation is for moderate sales growth. And with that I'll hand on to Ian.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Turning to page 21, revenue for the period 23 November to 30 of June 2008 was $16.87 billion and delivered EBIT of $474 million. Food and Liquor revenue was $12.8 billion delivering $422 million of EBIT. And revenue from convenience stores was $4 billion, delivering $42 million of EBIT.</p>
          <p>Move to slide 22. During the last quarter total sales were 4.2% and comparative store sales were 2.4% which was encouraging at this early stage in our redevelopment given the heavy deflation experienced in fresh produce. Coles Express sales grew by 8.1% overall and 4.4% on a like-for-like basis. Its early days in the turnaround and sustainable business improvements will take time but we are beginning to see market share and earnings stabilize which is reassuring.</p>
          <p>Move to page 23. Meaningful and sustainable improvement will take up to five years involving hard work and commitment across the company. Following the acquisition, Rich and his team put a series of integration programs in place to start improving the business. In the short time I've been here, I've met with hundreds of store managers and team members, visited numerous stores across the company and listened to our customers. The initial programs were the right ones and we are now developing them further.</p>
          <p>New Coles management team is now in place with the arrival of Stuart Machin a few days ago as a new Operations Director. We have streamlined the central operating model with over 1,000 non-store roles being withdrawn. Through a combination of absorbing cost increases and lowering prices, we've invested a $100 million in improving value to our customers. This will be an ongoing challenge as global food prices continue to rise and consumers become increasingly value conscious.</p>
          <p>We're also releasing much needed capital for basic refurbishment of our stores and transition of our distribution network remains on track. 33 distribution centers have been reduced to 26 so far with the final network position of 23 to be achieved by the end of the year. Inventory control and capital expenditure have been tightened to apply greater rigorous decision making and our competitive position has been enhanced through the introduction of multi saves improving promotion flexibility and delivering further value to our customers.</p>
          <p>Moving to 24, in addition to the short-term changes highlighted, we're beginning to develop a number of key strategic programs overtime within the supermarket division. We'll be looking to improve our in-store value messaging to a better promotion policy as well as further investment in price where appropriate to ensure our competitiveness continues. We want to simplify product ranges to make it easier for customers to shop and improve availability in-store. We need to improve the quality of our fresh food to better supply chain controls and we aim to pile our new store format to develop and improve customer proposition. And later we will review our brand strategy to ensure it's relevance to our consumers and we will continue to roll out an improved convenience store for Coles Express.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 25, in terms of outlook, we anticipate softer economic conditions, further pressure on household spending, and a greater value focus by consumers as a result. Produce deflation is also set to continue. For our part we'll continue to develop a strategic program guideline, improve our focus on product availability, and apply greater weightage on investment decisions to optimize our store network over time. There is much to do to technicals turnaround over the coming years, I'm just picturing the basics will take time, but I am greatly encouraged by the attitude and commitment of Coles team members that I've met across the country, and their desire to make the turnaround happen.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand over to Stewart to talk about Wesfarmers Resources business. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. Now if we turn to slide 27, the Resources Performance Summary. Operating revenue of $1.3 billion or 15.6% above last year. This is a result of higher export in coal prices and a 5.7% increase in metallurgical coal sales volumes.</p>
          <p>Earnings before interest and tax of $423 million, was 25% higher than last year. This increase is due to record prices for export coal and a 51.7% decrease in the Stanwell rebate. Upwards the exchange rates movements during the year and industry cost pressures impacted negatively. The margin cost was slightly up on last year. This is a reflection of the continued rail and port congestion impacting on our ability to export. Depreciation &amp; amortization excluding the Stanwell rebate increased as a result of full year depreciation of the Curragh's overland conveyor, and the impact of additional capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>Coal production for the year increased by 4.1% from last year to 14.3 million tons. This increase was due to Curragh's total production increasing by 9.1% following a strong recovery from the January 2008 floods. This was offset by reduction in production from Premier, down 7.3% due to lower demand from Verve Energy resulting from plant outages at the Muja power station and plant failure at the Collie A power station. Coal production has Bengalla remained at similar levels the last year. Disappointedly our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate at 6.4 was up on last year.</p>
          <p>Slide 28, Resources Highlights. Total coal production for the division increased to 14.3 million tonnes on the back of Curragh's record coal production. Curragh's production of metallurgical coal for the year at 6.89 million tonnes was an increase of 7.8% on the previous year. Our sales volumes for power metallurgical coal at 6.54 million tonnes was an increase of 1.4%.</p>
          <p>Curragh's production recovered strongly from the January 2008 flood event particularly during this last fourth quarter. This allowed us to increase stocks ahead of the planned 10 day shutdown at our coal handling and preparation plant in July. The earnings at $423 million was 25% higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the market, the export market remains tight with strong demand from our customers and ongoing constraint infrastructure in Australia continuing to impact the ability of the supply side to respond to that demand. Record coal prices for metallurgical and export steaming coal are currently being experienced by the coal industry. These abilities to expand our Curragh and Bengalla mines continue. Timing on these expenditures is dependent on infrastructure constraints.</p>
          <p>Next slide, slide 29 the outlook. The outlook for the Resources division remain strong. Annual price negotiations and high coal prices were concluded by April 2008. The Australian dollar does remain volatile, and we have a hedge book in place to minimize this volatility. Strong demand and constrained infrastructure in Australia will continue to impact the supply side response. And we see that high demurrage costs are expected to continue into 2009.</p>
          <p>The cost in mine inputs remains high and the industry continues to face capital and operating cost increases. The federal government has issued its climate change policy with its green paper. The impact of the introduction of the admissions training scheme will be known later this year.</p>
          <p>Exports of metallurgical coal from Curragh are expected to be in the range of 6.5 to 6.9 million tonnes for the year ending 30th of June 2009. Obviously subject to satisfactory mine rails import performance. Sustainable payment for 2008 and '09 is predicted to be in the range of 140 to $150 million depending on export volumes and sales mix items.</p>
          <p>Recent legislation changes from the Queensland Government has seen a change in the royalty payment regime for Curragh moving form the flat 7% royalty to a two tier royalty regime. This change will negatively impact Curragh by additional royalty payments this year. A significant increase in the Resources division's earnings in 2008 and '09 is expected on the back of Curragh's high export coal process.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Richard to cover the other divisions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to quickly cover off how the business is and we're happy to take questions on these. Our Target and Kmart various trading conditions, we saw quite a bit of variability around sales particularly in the last quarter, although Target's performance has remained pretty strong.</p>
          <p>Pleasingly, we've been able to quit with the stock well in both businesses and we're satisfied with the inventory positions we've got in both of them. Both Target and Kmart looking to accelerate store rollout and refurbishments and we've asked Target to and they are going to do a lot more refurbishments this year. That'll have some impact on profits for this year but we just think it's for the long term interest for the business to get the store look and feel right. Kmart had a path line of new stores and is just starting to commence them. We opened our first new store in over a year in South Morang recently.</p>
          <p>So it's obviously a challenging environment and discretionary spend at the moment in both businesses, particularly Target we figure it's a well positioned for that. On the insurance business as I said earlier it's been pretty tough in insurance and particularly in the underwriting businesses in Lumley Australia and Lumley New Zealand. Lumley New Zealand had a disappointing year for us impacted by some weather events but nonetheless we've effected some change in that business to look for improved performance.</p>
          <p>The broking businesses really did pretty well last year and we're pleased with how they performed and the performance of both the OAMPS' and Crombie Lockwood's broking business is very much in line with our acquisition classes for those business which we sold. Koukia, during the year which was a good transaction to complete, we found this federation had another record year which is really an outstanding performance given the market that we're in and it just shows the quality of that business and I've talked about restructuring a Lumley New Zealand.</p>
          <p>On the industrial businesses, we've had the gas issue impact CSBP and Energy that both of those businesses I think had a very good performance for the year. Industrial and safety as I said earlier was terrific and its return on capital continues to grow and so things continues to strongly. And there is some commentary on that slide on Energy and CSBP which as I said we replaced with the performance but happy to take any questions later on. I'll hand over to Gene on Capital Management and then I'll come back on outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Richard. Slide 35 shows the following the $2.5 billion dollar equity raising that we completed in June. Our net debt to equity ratio is down at 47% at the end of the year. And more important measure of our cash interest cover ratio is 4.9 times, if we measure the cash over interest expense that would come down to the low fours. Working capital up by $660 million don't read too much into that, that's largely around the timing of the completion of the Coles acquisition mid month there was relatively low working capital in that business. And it does fluctuate a lot during the month in each retail business across the rest of the businesses resources working capital increased as it's building it's inventory. The risks are controlled pretty tightly.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure, I'll talk a little bit more later about our prediction is about $2 billion of CapEx up from 1.2 billion this year. Our dividend investment plan continues we underwrote to 75% for the interim dividend we won't be underwriting for the final dividend to come, we will be issuing it at a 1% discount.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows our total debt averaged $9.4 billion over the year that varied with first of all when we acquired Coles and then came down with the arrears. We project an average level of net debt for this year 9.5 to $10 billion. It will run up in the first half of the year as we're building the trees across the business. We expect the interest rate in the mid to high 8% and that's including fees. Fees are becoming higher as we tap various capital markets and the overall debt market continues to be pretty tight, and I don't think that anyone would be predicting that that will ease rapidly. Pleasingly interest rates have come off and we're able to do some further hedging and bring down our overall hedge costs going forward. I mentioned bank fees they were $11 million of additional borrowing costs amortized or written off during the period as we refinanced into new packages.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital expenditure, the next slide shows the breakout by division that was largely inline with the guidance that we had given with the capital expenditure programs in the various retail businesses have beginning to pick up over that six months period. Through financial 2009, we project capital expenditure at about $2 billion, you can see on the next slide how that capital expenditure have increased over the years. And that $2 billion again is inline with the guidance we've given which was 1 to 1.2 billion across the former Coles businesses, and in the other businesses, it assumes some new capital projects commencing later in the year. And of course the timing of those is as yet uncertain. With that I'll turn back to Richard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; okay, just quickly on outlook, there's a lot of work going on in Coles at the moment. And I'm sure someone will ask what's going on and he will allude to that when he talks about that. We've talked about a more challenging environment in &#x2013; particularly in discretionary retail. The group, the value of diversification obviously comes through this year. It's a great time to be a miner in Australia and we'll benefit from high prices and very strong demand prospects for coal. We do see continuing strong demand for our industrial products businesses, that's chemicals, fertilizers and industrial safety division and our energy business. And there are some signs of some serving a break from insurance particularly in commercial might have which is positive. And Gene just talked about the ongoing investments we're make in all of our businesses to continue to grow and improve each of them.</p>
          <p>And with that we're happy to take any questions.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question on just clarifying the interest, there was a nearly a 100 million of costs in the P&amp;L related to discount adjustments and amortization of debt establishment costs. Gene, are they over and above the fees that you talked about being the sort of 8.5 to 9 high 8?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, the debt establishment costs are included. They are other bank fees and I noted that there was some accelerated amortization on some of them when we refinanced but they are incorporated in that overall rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But the discount effects are separate that they are within interest but they are in fact not interest, they are a separate accounting effect. They relate to the adjustments to the provisions on contracts and to some extent to the Stanwell rebate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. And then a question on Coles. I mean the profit was about just under 350 million in the second half for the Coles business, which, broadly speaking, gives you about 700 million, if you want to annualize it. I mean, is there anything unusual in doing that that we should be aware of? In thinking about it that way? And then I guess looking forward to the fiscal '09 year, you talked about a number of head count reductions. I mean should we be anticipating those savings start to flow through in the fiscal '09 year?</p>

          <p>I think what you got to do is look at the overall net possessions and one of the things I mentioned was that, we're seeing a stabilization effect on the business. If you look at '06, '09 &#x2013; sorry -- '06 to '07, EBIT was actually down about $70 million. And now, from where we are, it's probably more of a stable position. In fact on a like-for-like basis we're probably about $10 million up. So, we're reasonably encouraged by where we are, but we shouldn't be under an illusion that there's going to be any major changes anytime soon.</p>
          <p>There have been a number of changes with regard to streamlining, and I think those have been the right things to do, and essentially been done to bring about the flatter structures, reduced layoffs, reduced bureaucracy. And there will be some efficiency gains coming through that. But at this stage they have only recently occurred in the last three to four months really. And we've got further investments, I mentioned as well, in relation to the stores and indeed pricing as well. So, in that respect I think that we're not going to be able to make forecasts on EBIT projections for the next six months or so. But we are stabilizing the business, but it's still going to be tough.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I just follow-up then in terms of the amount of disruption that must have happened in the '08 year, I mean, is that stepping up again or should &#x2013; I imagine that would had a profit impact. How should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me make a quick comment before Ian comments on that. I think any comparison is pretty &#x2013; we'll be very careful on any comparisons, because Coles was doing all sorts of things to put a positive light on its performance 12 months ago, where we're just getting in and getting dirty and fixing the business up. So I'd be very careful on any comparisons. Ian, do you want to take over from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that there are various changes. There were a number of costs in the previous business which were held at a corporate level, which may have been allocated back into the businesses. And some of those allocations, of course, were around things like finance, marketing, office facility, even paid allotment costs. And those kind of charges, arguably, should have been held within the business unit anyway, but they were held on a corporate level. There's a much cleaner methodology of accounting been applied now. And even with that we're seeing some improvement.</p>
          <p>So, I think that the costs are one thing, but driving the business is another. We shouldn't forget that this business has been lacking investments both in terms of stores and infrastructure for some considerable time. And there are a number of basics that we have to get fixed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if I could get one last one, just have you got any comments you can make in terms of across the retail businesses sales since &#x2013; into the early part of this fiscal year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know I always have. And let me make some broad comments. In July, you had tax cuts coming through, you had a number of sales in businesses, and they've had an impact. John talked a bit about how he felt, how things he was seeing at Bunnings. And he might want to talk a bit more about that. But, I mean, I think it's pointless looking at one month, say July, and say, "well, things are a whole lot better, because there is a few one-offs that have come into July." We think it'll be a bit bumpy for a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, do you want to add any more?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Richard, the point about there, one month is a very difficult thing to predict on. We had, in Bunnings we had some significant weather impacts in New Zealand, Queensland and New South Wales, but as for July, gets a bit of a touch up from that, but we get a small <mark type="inaudible" />, because we think that'll be very good for us when spring comes around. So, by the time we've got a few months under our belts, and around the time of the briefing, we might be able to give a little bit more color on how the current trading is going.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Woolford at Citigroup. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Richard and team.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question, now that Ian is onboard, if I could ask about the strategy. We've heard from Archie Norman late last year about some of the turnaround opportunities within Coles' food and liquor, but can you just give us a high level view about what the strategy is for the business, and how you expect &#x2013; or why you expect more shoppers to frequent the Coles' food and liquor business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the focus has been on a number of key areas, I think, as I outlined in the presentation. I mean essentially we are looking at a range of tailorings, to better meet local needs and improve our overall availability. We were looking to rationalize the promotion sale, so there is greater clarity and visibility to our customers on the provisions that we have, and it'll also improve the execution in stores as well.</p>
          <p>There has to be a greater consistency of improvement in quality in our fresh food departments as well, and that'll improve availability. And also we're trying to improve the knowledge base as well. And you have to remember that in the last two years there's basically been no training, as such, in any of the Coles stores. And therefore we aim to, as a start, just get 2,000 team members between now and Christmas, basic knowledge training in food and vegetables. And obviously, we have had to streamline the effects of over a 1,000 central head office positions coming out to try and improve communications and reduce bureaucracy.</p>
          <p>So in terms of driving range, driving value, you're looking at better operating model. These are all combined, including a better focus on fresh food, to kind of start driving out some key programs. But this business has been &#x2013; when you start looking at the basics, you got to try and build from a basic foundation. In the short time I've been here and been around a number of stores, I mentioned earlier on, there are some fairly significant infrastructural problems that we're addressing now.</p>
          <p>So, half the stores have not had any investment in them for the last five years. Things like deli scales and slicers are that old that you can't even get parts for some of them. The cash registers have been heading the same way, 50% of them go down at some point during the course of last year, which doesn't exactly help your queuing. It's been culturally slow and bureaucratic, with strong top down commanding control. You've got store managers running multi-million dollar businesses, who have to ask for central approval to change a light bulb.</p>
          <p>The previous five-year strategic plan didn't even mention the customer once, because stores pay for the renovation service, and focus on cutting costs rather than improving overall efficiency. And there has been a lack of confidence and headwind in the business to make decisions. And it is the high focus of administration and dealer willingness to innovate and take risks. And yet, despite all of that, in other areas there's been pretty peripherally controlled and capital mismanagement.</p>
          <p>So, these are some of the basic things that we've come into and we're starting to address. And we are starting to deliver a number of things. Maintenance and repair budgets are now being held at store operations, so they can make their own decisions. We've just signed off several multi-million dollar programs invest in scales, I mentioned, and registers to improve customer service. I've also met with most of the CEO's and sales directors of the top 60 suppliers to see what they think of Coles and how they might help us improve.</p>
          <p>One of them mentioned it is the first time a CEO from Coles have been inside their building in the last 40 years. We met all the store managers and start beginning to evolve a strategy, as I mentioned. So, we are seeing some fresh fruit and vegetables improvement. But it's all going to take time. There's regular grassroots feedback that we're getting from stores as well. So, I've had over 400 separate suggestions from stores, which is great, as team members are actually telling me how they think we should be improving the business.</p>
          <p>And we've got distribution changes complete as well, so there's a number of different things that are taking place. We're trying to energize and motivate the stores use do the best of what they've got. And we are seeing some improvements coming through and driving more sales on the back of it. And as I said, I kind of underestimate the scale of the challenge that we face, but there's a lot of confidence in the business that these are big opportunities that we can take and overcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so it sounds like from all from all of that there is certainly a huge emphasis on improving execution in the store, which is understandable, but there doesn't seem to be a huge change in the positioning of the Coles business. Is there any view of that where you need to position the business on price relative to where it has been? And or &#x2013; is it &#x2013; does it make it even more differentiated from your major competitor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you got to look at what level of differentiation you want to put in place, and you got to remember that I've been in place for eight weeks, and the last member of our new management team arrived three days ago, so this is very early days. There are ideas and opportunities to improve the business over time and seek to differentiate. We believe that our position is pretty price competitive, as it stands. But we'll seek to invest further in price where we need to do so. But it's that driving basic change and improvement for the customer now and over time, the strategic development that we talked about, will actually evolve into a much better Coles and further development of the programs will see a drive, I'm sure, for increased foot fall and higher basket spend in the stores over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so given the comments, so, is there any change around the CapEx requirements for the Coles food and liquor business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's going to be any material change. I think that before we start spending loads of money on capital investment, we've got to be sure that we're going to get return from it. So, as I mentioned, we are looking at developing further our store formats. When we've got something that we're happy with and we can start to rollout with confidence, and we're going to get return for our investments then that's when we'll actually start spending the money.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, the money can be very well spent early on, as I mentioned, in just fixing some of the basics where there has been no investment in the stores for a number of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just lastly, a question for Mr. Gene on operating cash flow, probably distorted from the acquisition. Can you just give us some clarity about the, I guess, the underlying growth in operating cash flow for the group, maybe on a like-for-like basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A like-for-like? Well I -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just maybe an explanation as to why cash flow growth was only 12% compared with net profit growth of about 40%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's largely around the matter that I mentioned in the timing of the acquisition, when we acquired Coles with a relatively low level of working capital. So that working capital increased substantially across the year, because of that timing issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, yeah &#x2013; I think that that was what I was getting at. If we look to the underlying businesses with good cash flow growth being close to -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you can probably add back 3- or $400 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Grant Saligari at CommSec. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, just a couple of questions. I guess, first of all, on the Coles business, the previous management team spent a lot of time and money, apparently, fixing the supply chain, both, physical and systems. I was just wondering, first of all, from Ian's perspective, you having been here short time, whether he thinks that supply chain is now in sort refining shape, and you can move on to the front of store issues, or whether there's substantial work still to be done there; and if so where?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'm &#x2013; again, as I mentioned in the presentation, the number of DCs has come down from 33 down to 26, now. And the target there is to get to 23, and then the transition will be complete before the end of the year. We turned on a couple of fairly strong and effective composite warehouses in Australia in recent months, and then we can start leveraging the improvements that they can deliver in terms of availability in the stores, and we're actually already seeing that. So, we'll be focused further up the line in terms of making sure that we've got suppliers delivering what we want, when we want, and ensuring that we get that to stores in an efficient and timely way.</p>
          <p>So, I actually think that the supply chain changes that have been made in terms of the infrastructure are one of the positives that we can build on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you happy with the quality of the systems, and also the current outsourcing of fresh supply chain to third parties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean, as I say, we're looking at all areas of the business, and how we can improve. I think there are definitely improvements that we can do to systems. Auto-replenishment is still, in a very much an embryonic phase, and we're going to have to develop that over the next two years as well to improve overall ordering and availability efficiency. And as far as the third party buyers are concerned, we've got a combined effect of some of our third party running and some of them are run by ourselves. So that isn't a fundamental priority for us at this stage. It's running pretty effectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe none of the front-of-store issues, I'd be interested to know your view on how reliant you are on putting through major store refurbishment programs across the business and recruiting and changing personnel at a store level toward big change? Because it strikes me that in terms of the pace of change that you're going to be able to implement be against the constraints.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said earlier, before we start moving into refurbishment and development program, we need to develop a format that we're comfortable with, and that's what we're working on behind the scenes now. I think when we get to that stage we'll ensure that there is a sufficient infrastructural support and people in place. There is a talent and commitment to deliver on the ground. Certainly, from what I've seen, one of the pleasant surprises I've had is that across the store base, the managers that I've met are actually pretty effective in the main, and actually are looking at welcoming change. So, I think they'll embrace it.</p>
          <p>What the trouble that we've had in the more recent past is that he has been locked in a straitjacket, and basically not been able to make effective decisions on the ground. I think with the right level of guidance and leadership and support, we can actually turn these guys into a pretty effective team. So in that respect, I am quite confident.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple on the numbers. The &#x2013; just on the acquisition accounts, the PP&amp;E on transition went down by about 160 mill or so, and then obviously the provisioning went up. Just curious to know where the adjustments occurred in the PP&amp;E and trying to understand where you're provisioning a little bit clearer than perhaps explanation to-date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might handle that. It's Terry. In terms of PP&amp;E, we had a look at all of the assets right throughout the business, including some, if you like, historical IT systems. So, it was a mixture of plant and equipment throughout the store network, a mixture of perhaps all Bi-Lo equipment that hadn't been, if you like, addressed in number in stores that have been changed over from Bi-Lo. And also, as I mentioned, some IT equipment.</p>
          <p>In terms of provisioning, the major provisioning is in relation to the restructuring provisions that we're carrying as we look forward into the next 12 months of the work that we've still got to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, are these combination redundancy then also store leases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be correct, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally on the numbers, can you give me some clarity on the inventory closing position for, across the business, particularly the discretionary businesses, because the inventory move that you had is enormously large, so it's really hard to get below the service on that. But <mark type="inaudible" /> in terms of inventory compared with say the F '07 closing position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't compare it to F '07, but certainly for Target and Kmart. At the end of July, they're in pretty good shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I can comment on food and liquor in general terms. We are &#x2013; with the work that Ian mentioned in relation to better controls on inventory, we managed to move a pretty large overstock position on acquisition to a level that's consistent with the beginning of the previous financial year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm conscious of time, so I'll leave it there for now. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaun Cousins at JPMorgan. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I've just got a few questions on your capital position. Historically, Wesfarmers have been conservative on their CapEx. What do you think about that 2 billion is the reason that you actually come in below that or is that likely to be a number that you get?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the key thing there, Shaun, is there's a couple of big projects in Stewarts' division, the Resources Division. So, a big difference on the target of those projects. The rest will probably be plus or minus <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I don't think there's much upside risk on that. The risk is &#x2013; we would understand it a bit because of timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that's good. Because I guess my next question is coming &#x2013; the 9.5 to $10 billion of net debt. I mean, how long will you persist with that? When do we start to see free cash flow generation for this Company start to attack the debt balance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We won't see free cash flow generation attacking the debt balance for some time, particularly if we achieve, as we hope, expansion in the resources area and indeed in other areas as we find projects in which to invest. So, we will be looking to maintaining our balance sheet over time through things like the dividend investment plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess, I mean, are you guys comfortable in regards to your capital position in terms of having sufficient access to debt &#x2013; I mean the equity raising did a great job, of sort, of resolving that issue. Do you think that is resolved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we're as comfortable as one can be in markets &#x2013; where debt markets continue to be turbulent. There are still some debt markets that we would like to be accessing that are pretty much unavailable, so that means that margins in some other areas are perhaps higher than what otherwise be the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at your one-off costs of $102 million &#x2013; in regards to redundancies, was that like two-thirds of that, three-quarters of that? I guess, I mean, we've seen your employment costs go from 1.4 billion to 4.5 billion. You've taken on a lot of staff, but I guess, we're trying to get a handle on how that is on a go-forward basis and where we're at with that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, Terry again. In terms of that number, it was in the order of 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And really, just two final questions. Just on the food and liquor business, I know in your August presentation last year you said you'd get to market rates of like-for-like sales growth in fiscal 2010, is that something that is still a target for the Company or is that a little more flexible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't really comment on what we said before. I think at this stage we've got a like-for-like performance that is actually moving from a positive to negative, so that's encouraging &#x2013; sorry, negative to positive &#x2013; better get that the right way around &#x2013; I'm from Scotland, you know, different hemisphere here. So, that's actually encouraging in its own right. I've mentioned earlier on that the market is going to be tightening, I think that's going to be true. I think we feel economic conditions are going to get tighter, but we are focused on delivering some improvements now on the ground and fixing a number of the basics. And then we'll start to evolve the program beyond that, so certainly over time we'd expect to see a stronger performance evolve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the &#x2013; I've got another question, Ian, what's the Coles' competitive advantage? In terms of &#x2013; previously, it was range, and that's something that Archie indicated under Wesfarmers' stewardship you'd be moving away from. I guess what's the competitive advantage vis-&#xE0;-vis Woolworths' or Audi or independents?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that across the Company, you've got a strong network of stores that goes throughout Australia. It's a fantastic brand and it's one which people still have a strong affinity for and it's got some strong people working within it. What we intend to do is leverage that and overlay differential changes, which we will do to the strategy in time, which is now starting to evolve, we'll maximize some of those changes that we are going to develop in order to make sure we do have competitive advantage in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, just there has been some confusion. I think there was a three to five year turnaround. Could you just confirm that that's the case and maybe if you could talk about when the start date is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, let me, Ian can confide, but we said at the time this'll take three to five years. We acquired the business late last year and that stand. That is to start getting acceptable performance within the business. We'd expect the business to continue to improve over a longer period than that, and if you look back at turnarounds of this type of business, then those sort of things have extended for some period, but just to be clear what we said was three to five years from last November. That's what we're still saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as I'm concerned the turnaround has started now. We're not going to wait three years before we begin to get going. There is a significant amount of activity going on behind the scenes, and I kind of, outlined some of those earlier on. And we continue to do more. I mean in the short-term I've been here, we've appointed a new team. We're stabilizing the business. There's focus on stores which includes the people in the fabric, who're levering the supply chain to service levels available, the freshness and quality. We're streamlining the organization. We're devolving accountability back into the stores as well, and we're considering new formats.</p>
          <p>So there's a significant amount going on behind the scenes, and we've got to get these basics right to build an effective foundation to make sure we can drive forward and effect a very successful and sustainable turnaround over that three to five year period. And the thing with retailers is that, it's not as if you're going to get five years and be done. It's a dynamic business. It's going to be changing all the time. It's competitive and it's going to continue to be that way. So what we ought to be doing is building now for something that's not going to be for the next three to five years but for the next 10 to 15.</p>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Dring at Macquarie. Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yeah. Good afternoon, Richard and team. Hey, can we chat about how you're going to break out of this doom loop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I knew that was coming, Greg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And thank you, Richard. And &#x2013; so you hopeful got the answers at hand. Can we just chat about the role of price? I mean all of a sudden we see price news splashed across your communications to customers. The traders talking about better quality at lower price, they're talking about resistance to trading up strategies. Are you willing to occupy the low price point and get all the volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're going to try and do is develop a strategy which delivers to our customers: quality, choice and value. And value is a combinational effect of price and quality. As customers have said to me, it's pointless having cheap tomatoes if they're rotten by the time you get them home. So what you got to do, is you got to deliver something that the customer is going to be confident, and terms of that overall, <mark type="inaudible" /> the shopping basket, and it's going to encourage them to come back and drive footfall again.</p>
          <p>For sure you've got to be competitive on price, and we all make sure that we are. I think in many instances we have been, but we've not been very good at shouting about it. I think that there'll be a very &#x2013; a strong very more clear message about our value both in the stores and in our marketing communications that's going to come through in the forthcoming months. And we'll continue to drive that forward, so clearly you've got to be competitive in improving your offering value, if you're going to encourage the broader level of Australians to come to your door. And that's something we're continuing to develop, but also we want to add something more over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you want to occupy the low price point position. That's the perception of the minds of consumers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you got to be in a position where you're going to compartmentalize consumers. We've got a position here where we've got stores throughout Australia. And what we want to do is to make sure that we appeal to a broad cross section of consumers. If consumers are after strongly placed products that offer good value, then we'll provide that. If they want broader ranges, then we'll provide that as well. If they want service opportunity in the stores, then that's what we're going to build and develop on also.</p>
          <p>So, what you got to do is understand the broad consumer base, understand where your stores are, and actually define an effective change in your strategy to make sure that you can deliver that effectively in each of those catchments. That's what we're endeavoring to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also can you do that without invoking a price response from Woolworth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's about a price, volume, message that we've got in place. I mean, I think we've just gone through <mark type="inaudible" /> that talked about competitiveness in the marketplace, and determined that there isn't clearly competition between the two key retailers here. It's not for me to determine what a competitor strategy is. I'm just focusing on what's going to be right for the Coles' consumer going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given that Australia is somewhat isolated, there's a finite number of packaged grocery manufacturers, and it's very difficult to airfreight in fresh. How do you create a differentiated merchandise also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, you got to work on it over time. I mean, it would be great if we have the freshness now that we really require. So, we got to focus in-store now with our existing suppliers to deliver freshness to a more effective supply chain. And better care of the quality of the products, and we'll change effectively the stores themselves. We're already starting to see some improvements in that, and it's very early days, but we're already getting some positive feedbacks in terms of improving quality in our fruit and vegetables, because we put some fair amount of effort into that in the recent weeks. But it's the early start. Over time we'll develop programs, and develop broader supply relationships, which we'll hope to see that develop and go further.</p>
          <p>At the moment, I am going back to what I said earlier on, it's about building a very effective and solid foundation. And that's what we aim to achieve in the early days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we look at your total costs for the second half of this year, recognizing that it's a combination of cost effectiveness and Coles, is that the cost base that's in the business that we should go forward with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't answer that, Gregory. We've got &#x2013; in terms of our costs, as we've mentioned, we've got some redundancy &#x2013; some restructuring above store that's really only a couple of months old, so we haven't seen the full effect of that coming through. We've also got &#x2013; if you like &#x2013; a fairly intensive maintenance period that we've been running in the last couple of months as well to try and freshen up the stores. So there's definitely some positives, but then to keep picking up on this point, we've actually got to build a strong foundation for the business, and therefore we'll be reflecting, over the next six months, in particular, around where we have to continue to put, if you like, re-invest back into the stores and back into the business to ensure that we've got stability going forward.</p>
          <p>So, I think, it's probably too early to say that we've got, if you like, a set cost base. There's still a lot of movements, and a lot of activity which is causing one-off costs, and, if you like, changes to regular flows of costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But directionally the cost base is going to drop or rise. Just ignoring re-investment and price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you would think, over a period of time that we'll get efficiencies out of our cost base, and so as a percentage to sales we'd expect over a period of time that it will reduce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a final question from me, the 77 million fair value adjustment, Richard, I think this 60 million that you were referring to a couple of months or six months ago, they were going to start coming through for five years or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just confirming the 77 million is in fact a credit and will come through over five or six years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but there's an offset for this discount effect that Gene talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's at the finance level, isn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, just being a little harsh, and forgive me, if I take 77 million out, the trading margin looks like about 2.3%, not 3.4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, I don't think you can do that, Greg, because it relates to contracts which are under commercial.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the comment is correct on a cash profit basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, based on what we're paying for those contracts, that's right.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there are fewer sales on the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from David Errington at Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Richard, I'd like to follow-on with that question that Greg asked, with the 77. I just want to confirm that I'm reading this right. I don't want to jump to any wrong conclusions, I mean parish the thought. But, your full year EBIT for food and liquor, seven-and-a-half months, was 422, and in the first half of '08 you did 118, meaning that you're round about 300 for the second half. But in that second half, there was 77 million, as you say, to which we could probably take off, but then you've got to add back the 44 million of overhead. And then you've got these pre-non-trading items, which irrespective of whoever's interpretation it is, one may expect that those non-trading items will probably be sustainable for sometime, as you'd have to try to improve the business, you going to be spending money within the stores on a lot of issues that are defined as non-trading.</p>
          <p>So when you cut that, so if you take 422, take off the 118 that you made in the first half, take off the 77, add back the 44, and then take off the 101 of the non-trading item that you've excluded, and all of a sudden your EBIT in the second half looks pretty ordinary. And that is a like-for-like on what Coles did this time last year. Now, even though you've answered Greg, but &#x2013; so that 77 was out of the market, it was part of Coles performance last year. And on my analysis your EBIT, compared to what Coles did under the Coles management in this second half, has gone backwards, and gone backwards a very long way. Now, am I reading that right or am I missing something logically there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Terry take you through it, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David I think that the 101, it would be incorrect to take that forward as something that you're going to see period after period. I think Gene and/or Richard referred to the fact there may indeed be some more one-offs over the next little while, potentially up to the 100 million, we don't know that at this stage, but clearly it's not something that we consider would be an ongoing costs. So I don't think taking that off the result is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There could be the other costs, Terry, because you're going to have to be improving the business. There is going to be other costs that you're going to have to pump into stores, so there is going to be areas there, so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there is going to be cost increases, David, there is going to be cost reductions as well, because you got redundancies, that obviously occurred in only the last couple of months, is do going to flow through the results. And you've got other efficiency areas we're looking at. So, I think, if you want to our summary, which I think Ian gave is, on our best like-for-like basis that we've been able to come up with we think that we're operating marginally ahead of where Coles was for the same period last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Geez, Terry, I get that with these numbers, I am sorry, but the numbers that you've presented, given that it was 422 less 119, that's 300 million take off the 77.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then &#x2013; sorry, David &#x2013; then consider that you're comparing &#x2013; when you're looking at a six-month period, you're comparing January &#x2013; you're comparing February to July -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but it's linear in food. Food and liquor is pretty linear, I know January is a little bit softer, but it's not much difference between January and July. Discretionary, yeah, but not food and liquor, Coles did 293 &#x2013; and I reckon you guys have deteriorated a long way since &#x2013; and don't forget that the second half of '07 of Coles, was a dreadful performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I guess you can &#x2013; you'll do your numbers as you will them. I think if we telling you that we think we've gone about $10 million in front of where Coles was the same period last year, I don't know what else I can tell, and keep on saying that. And I think it's &#x2013; so, I guess, the next six months will probably bear that out on &#x2013; as to what our run rate starts to fall into.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, sorry, just one other thing, without going into great detail. On those provisions that you talked about, there is some things been going on in Coles that shouldn't have happened. And some of those &#x2013; for example, there are some, I won't go into how many, but there are a number of stores that have been operating at loses, and shutting stores down, actually, will improve the profitability of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just trying to do a very simple mathematical exercise, Richard where Coles is 293 for the back half of '08. And on the numbers that you've presented, I recommend you've gone back with &#x2013; on that, and that's only my point and Terry said, he disagrees so as far as I'll have to accept that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll back, Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now that's fine, that's fine. We've disagreed on many things before and I'm sure we'll disagree on many things in the future. But the next one I'd like to ask is on the cash flow. Now I can remember vividly and after the first half results your cash flow was very strong and I can remember Gene saying that when you bought Coles you had inherited a very strong inventory position to which &#x2013; that built your inventory levels running into Christmas and then obviously you experienced the Christmas period, you sold down those inventories, but you're actually inherited very high inventory position running into Christmas.</p>
          <p>Now you're saying because your cash flow, I'm looking at your cash flow statements. And your cash flow was very poor for the second half because your cash operating profit was only 1.4 billion whereas after the first half it was 1.2. So you've only generated 200 million of operating cash flow in the second half and you've reported 450 million of net tax. Now my conclusion from that would be is that in the second half you've built up a significant amount of inventory to which you haven't sold yet and you're sitting on a lot of winter inventory to which you're going to potentially come up stuck with.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll comment on that David. There certainly was a significant build up of inventory at the time that we acquired Coles. There was an even greater build up of creditors. The creditors are paid at the end of each calendar month, it was very close to a full months of creditors. There has been some build up in inventory overall as I mentioned particularly in coal, where we've built a much stronger position there with -</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> 20 million Gene, because you would have build up about 300,000 tons and of that 70 bucks a ton you're kind of talking about 20 million bucks. We are talking about a shortfall in cash here of about 250 to $300 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the figure &#x2013; the increasing working capital in the resources business is significantly greater than 20 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But how could it be, how much inventory did you build up in coal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's no just coal out of the ground it's a large amount of pre-stripping.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but still you told that the cost is only 70 bucks a ton, we are missing here 250 to $300 million of cash in the second half and that's what I'm trying to work out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see where &#x2013; how we are missing 2 or $300 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second half profit was $450 million net tax and your operating cash flow only increased about $200 million. So by definition your cash, you are missing 250 million of cash, that's straight out of your 4E. I suppose that we'll take that offline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I'll have to come back to you on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is, is that have you built up inventory in the second half that you haven't sold back at this point of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the only answer that, David is as I said earlier is Terry has given you an inventory position in Coles, John can talk about the inventory position in Bunnings. As it may have been high inventory positioning in Target, and Kmart at the end of June but that's been assuming at the end of July we are very comfortable with both businesses in terms of the &#x2013; with our inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very, very comfortable.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Richard, most retailers are saying, I mean, you bought Coles at this time last year &#x2013; or before this time last year, most retailers are saying that you effectively, the conditions are a lot worse than anyone expected. I mean, most retailers are saying that. Your return on invested capital has significantly been diluted when you're buying an acquisition right at the peak of the retail cycle and retail conditions would have to be a lot worse than what most people would have expected. Debt markets are a lot worse than you've expected, interest costs are a lot higher, I mean they're about $100 million higher than what most people expected, and you are still speaking to the plan that you believe that this will be IRR positive and you are going to make your returns on invested capital at the same time timeframe that you said you were this time last year, I just don't get it, I just don't see how you are going to make your returns in the same timeframe that you're expecting this time last year given that the markets are significantly falling away at the time of the acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me, Dave, we didn't have the business this time last year, we had the business from November.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but you'd already committed to the business this time last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Yes. We &#x2013; I mean there is always things, we read about some things, there are some aspects of the business and they're valuable than we thought they were. There are others that are more challenging as you indicate interest rates are higher, and conditions are harder. But one of the things we said last year is not withstanding, the economic cycles, supermarkets tend to trade to reasonably well through the cycle, that we would really expect that to continue with Coles. And we expect Target and Kmart to be profitable through the cycle. Target is a very good business, I mean, I hope you that acknowledge in any case. And Kmart, there's a heck a lot to do, and I hope that we can do to improve that business from where it was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I could just remember the Mike Cheney saying, Richard, a good business becomes a bad business when you pay too much for it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Once again, we paid, most of what we paid for was our <mark type="inaudible" />, David.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's a good call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so we think this business will give us growth, earnings growth on our returns on invested capital over many years to come.</p>

          <p>Hi, Richard.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a couple of questions for Ian primarily, I was going to ask him, now that you are here, you've been 8 weeks into the job, is it worse than you expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that there are elements of it that I would &#x2013; I have been surprised by. I think I knew the challenge that has being taken on when I came here to visit before I actually took on the role. I think there are other elements of it, that I think quite positive. I keep mentioning the people, I think we've got great people, and we've got opportunities to build on it further. I think certainly the challenges some of the things surprised me, I mentioned. I didn't expect to come in and find that half the tills wouldn't be working during the course of the year and I thought we might have benefit of getting slices from either of that might be working. And so we can resolve that fairly quickly, a program in place. So it isn't materially more challenging than I expected it to be but that doesn't underestimate the scale of challenges that we do face.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Some of the feedback I get from different suppliers is that when they compare that the calibers from head office people with that of Woolworths they see the Coles people as being a little bit substandard? How do you rate the quality of head office personnel relative to people you've worked &#x2013; or worked with in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we have started to make some changes there and I am confident we'll see that improve. I see things that particular within the Bunnings team at the more junior levels and middle manager levels, there is actually some quite strong talents just waiting to become, come through and be directed effectively to meet some of that change, certainly from some of those suppliers when I spoken to them, they mentioned that we met with 50 or 60 of them in the last two or three weeks. They are actually pinpointing to me individuals in the organization that they like very quite strongly, so I'm actually quite encouraged by that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and how, are you able to give a bit of feel for, but food traffic and baskets size relative to this time last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that in overall sales as I mentioned we are actually seeing a positive spend in overall performance. And that's encouraging as well, and in terms of overall comp sales they have moved forward. So I think on the basket size in transitions we are now seeing some improvements overall, but as I have said I wouldn't read too much into short-term trends at this stage, but just it's going to be important over time to see those elements, those metrics improved. At the moment we are stabilizing the shift. I think we are doing a reasonable job of doing that. And we are expecting programs over time that are going to build improvements into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you expect in as conditions tighten up a little bit, shoppers might move away from top-up shopping and go to big malls, more of the traditional weekly or fortnightly shop, the fewer shops but bigger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's always a possibility and it depends upon the offer that you have got available, I think that there are a number of people who are in this area that will shop on a more frequent basis, but I can't believe that around, you know, customers out there they want to try and get as much of the shop in one figures account. I think, that's something we could offer a total level of appeal to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And should we be expecting more supermarket closures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are doing is looking at the portfolio and realigning to best effect around individual cachements. So we opened 17 supermarkets during the course of period that we're reporting on. We are building more besides as well, so there will be some store opening, some store closures but the resize of individual stores as well. We would be looking at our refurbishment program going forward as well and looking at store extensions still, within the mix there will be a combination of those factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And have you made any decisions on the future of Bi-Lo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No yet, I think that we've got to look at how the value end of the portfolio performs, and that were elements of the Bi-Lo changes that were in transition that really didn't work, and that's an area of improvement that we got to address.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Gene hi, I just want to ask a little bit about the bank's facility and the covenants therein. And from there I also want to ask the budgeted capital expenditure is 2 billion, will that result in higher debt. I believe you said that would be from 9.5 to 10 billion so I can see about 500 million up there, but looking at cash flow now I think the debt might go up a little higher. Could you please comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all yes the various components of the debt packages do have a typical cover ratio covenants in them. And they are priced on a, most of them are priced on a ratings metrics. And we're in those covenants. In terms of and under the debt packages ranked pari passu. And in terms of levels of debt, yes debt into a year &#x2013; into financial year we expected that debt will increase. We have a capital expenditure program of indicatively $2 billion although as we noted it may come in a little low below that as against depreciation and amortization of the order of $1 billion. At the same time we have a dividend investment plan that we've taken up in the last two without the underwriter's been in the 20%. So this is a better contribution for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And so if I assume, let's say 25% take up on dividend return to the &#x2013; you would still have to pay out roughly 5 to 600 million cash out and if the operating cash flow of the business is say 1.5, 1.6 billion you payout 600 million, you only have one billon left for CapEx. And if the budget is key, so should I assume that the additional 1 billion of debt in the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well ultimately we will fund the balance sheet as we go forward on an effective way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we have &#x2013; we have said that we may underwrite the dividend investment plan from time to time.</p>

          <p>Thank you and our next question comes from Emily Behncke at Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just a quick question probably to Stewart, just around the coal business. I am just looking at the cash production costs that you have on slide 60 of the information pack, 14% for this year that was 10% last year, just wondering if you can give us a feel as to whether or not you think that those cash flows are going to decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a lot of the increase in cash costs for Curragh last year was clearly increased volume. We came in considerably higher in terms of production volumes of this year compared to last year. The volume was up about I think 9% year-on-year. So that clearly impacts on the total amount of cash that we spend. But I suppose <mark type="inaudible" /> that in terms of total costs per tonne costs went up by about 5%. If you look back a couple of years ago, looking at 2005 and '06 compared to 2006 and '07 costs went up about 15%. And have come down from that 15% increase down to around about 5%. This last year which is very favorable compared to what else is happening in the broad &#x2013; much broader mining industry so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So given the production volume increases next year, therefore do you think that 5% is a reasonable number for us to think about for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I wouldn't give you an estimate of what that will be next year because clearly there is this costs that are coming, that the industry is currently seeing coming through, such as our energy costs, diesel, power, labor, and parts, but with that sort of environment last year we will avail &#x2013; that we were able to keep our unit rate increase down to about 5% and we'll be certainly targeting that sort of number going forward.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, probably more of a question for Gene. I was just interested to know what the headroom is on the current debt facilities, and also what the plans are for rolling over debt, and does it run about 3 to $3.2 billion maturing over the next 18 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we ensure that we've got headroom, we are looking at the fluctuations. I mean I have a pretty good handle on the interim months and periodic fluctuations in working capital. So we are looking to maintain the headroom around that. And that will involve some new facilities. As I see there are some markets that we are not able to tap. We would hope that within the timeframe you are talking about there to next year, things like MTN markets in Australia will become liquid again. And we are &#x2013; at the same time we're looking at going into other markets, for example, euro bond or sterling markets. We're keeping there &#x2013; watching closely all of the markets in order to move into their domestic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Have you got any more detail I noticed &#x2013; I noted that it's sort of 1 billion in October next year, 0.8 in December next year, but is that 1.2 billion of banks securities maturing at various times over the next 12 months. Can you give any more detail on when those maturities fall?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're typically part of borrowing portfolio from pre the Coles acquisition. They're relatively small amounts maturing at various times, a lot of those we would expect to simply roll over. And some of them we'll replace with other facilities, for example with the medium segments.</p>
