        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for participating in our call. Before transferring the floor to Mr. Trabuco, I just wanted to inform that we also have Mr. Marco Antonio Rossi, CEO of Bradesco's Insurance Group taking part in the call. Mr. Trabuco, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for all. Good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call. First of all the Brazilian economy continues to recover throughout the third quarter, with a gradual improvement in the construction, employment and the earning indicators, fueled by a gradual reduction in companies idle capacity.</p>
          <p>The inflation figures allowed the Central Bank of Brazil to reduce <mark type="inaudible" /> Brazil's basis rate, even further leading then the real interest rate to one of the lowest ever levels. Our currency continues to appreciate and thanks to the country's solid fundamental in the economy.</p>
          <p>The sovereign risk fell from 284 points in June to 234 at the end of September. Just to give you an idea of the significance of this. The sovereign risk reached 331 points in September last year. Within this scenario, Bradesco posted a net income of R$5.8 billion in the first nine months of this year, very close to the same period of 2008 with a very strong contribution from our insurance group.</p>
          <p>The net income in the third quarter totaled R$1.8 billion. Adjusted net interest income in the last 12 months move up by 33.7% due to a high volume of loan operation, which offset the lower spreads.</p>
          <p>Total assets reached R$485.7 billion, around 15% in a year-over-year comparison. Loan volume went up slightly along the quarter with the total portfolio climbing by 1.3% over the second quarter of 2009, and 10.2% over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>As we had predicted in April, the delinquency rate for loans overdue by more than 90 days increased slightly, closing the third quarter at 5% of the total loan portfolio, due to the economic slowdown. However, we are optimistic of the future given that the pace of delinquency gross amount our client is declining.</p>
          <p>Our coverage ratio remained  an equated level reaching 166.5% in the quarter. The Basel ratio is stood at 17.7%, indicating the high level of capitalization which is demanded in a scenario of future credit growth.</p>
          <p>The efficiency ratio of the 41.7% also improved reflecting our constant commitment to maximizing the revenue and costs control. However, the insurance groups combined ratio worsened, because of the higher number of health claims entered basically due to the effect and increased frequency of the swine flu, as well as the increase of vehicle claims aggravated by the exceptionally heavy rainfall in the south and the southeast regions of the country.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the importance of the health insurance business association between OdontoPrev and Bradesco Dental, which will unite the group, we recognized expertise with a group that has an incomparable distribution network.</p>
          <p>Now I will -- now hand you over my friend Abreu and I will be at your disposal during the question-and-answer session. Thank you all very much.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone. As Mr. Trabuco already mentioned, net income in the first nine months of 2009 surpassed R$5.8 billion, slight above the previous quarter in the same period of last year. In the third quarter itself, net income stood at R$1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that this quarter, Bradesco reported a non-operating gain from the sale of the supplementary lot of VisaNet shares in the gross amount of R$410 million. On the other hand the net income was also affected by: 1) additional legal provisions especially for economic plans totaling R$387 million, and 2) increased personnel expenses due to the collective bargaining agreement, which reached R$145 million.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that last quarter's net income also benefit from other non-recurring reasons as the divestment on the main lot of Bradesco's VisaNet shares in the gross amount of R$2 billion and the conditional offer of additional allowances for loan losses in the gross amount of R$1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Our 12-month operational efficiency ratio recorded yet another quarterly improvement. This time we move into 41.7%, thanks to the performance of the net interest income and fees.</p>
          <p>Slide number five, total assets amounted to R$486 billion, 15% up over the same period last year. Return on assets totaled 1.6% and the return on average equity reached 21.8% in the period. Certain ratios were very strong given the prevailing economic environment.</p>
          <p>The Basel ratio also improved, reaching 17.7% in September. This ratio would allow us to increase loan portfolio something around R$231 billion, leaving us in a highly comfortable position, capable of sustaining expected growth in the coming years, without depends on additional needs of issuance of equities.</p>
          <p>Also in September, Bradescos conclude the issue of US$750 million through subordinated notes abroad, categorized as tier 2 capital.</p>
          <p>Slide number six. In this slide, one can see the breakdown of net income, which shows us that around 66% derived from financial activities, and 34% from insurance. In the financial area, one can see that the loan portfolio, relative participation increased in this quarter, basically due to reduced provisioning needs, as will be explained further on.</p>
          <p>However, when comparing the first nine months of 2009 with the same period of 2008, the relative participation spreads over the net income, suffered a reduction due to the higher provisioning needs, while the relative increase in the Securities line was due to good performance of our  proprietary treasury debts.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven. I would now like to draw your attention to our unrealized gains, with sub &#x2013; substantial amount of R$10 billion, helped by more than R$1.5 billion in this quarter, due to the recover of market conditions affecting positively both, equities and fixed income securities.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight. On this slide, we'll show our historical interest earnings and non-interest earning results. As you can see the non-interest earnings portion has done exceptionally well in the last three quarters. Many thanks to the increased gains from treasury operations. Also, it is worth noting that income from interest earning operations increased by solid 18% in the period, mainly due to the higher volumes of loan. In the quarterly comparison, the interest earning portion moved up by around R$120 million, due to the increase in average volumes and the change in the lower book-mix.</p>
          <p>Slide number nine. Our net interest margin improved again reaching an annualized 7.6% in the third quarter compared to 7.3% in the previous one and 7% at the beginning of the year. This performance reflects improved conditions in terms of bonds and interest rates, as well as the increase in loans to  individuals. However, we understand that in the mid and long-terms these ratios tends to fall due to addition of operations with lower margins.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10. This slide shows a breakdown of the net interest income. In the year-to-date comparison, net interest income from loans increased strongly by around 24% mainly due to as we just mentioned the growth and the change in the loan portfolio mix. In the same way, the quarterly increase can be explained by the R$171 million jump in income from loan from operations. Thanks to the improved portfolio mix and a reduction in the base rate facility.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11. The highlight here is the improvement in the net margin from loan operation in this quarter, the blue part of the graph. Due to the growth of the gross margin and the reduction in provisioning expenses. However, in the nine months comparison, the net margin fell by more than 13%, indicating that gross margin growth was not sufficient to absorb the increase in provisions.</p>
          <p>And even given the exceptional positive outlook for Brazil's economy and the consequent impact on employment, we are confident that the worst period in terms of provisioning needs was in the second quarter. From now on, therefore, we expect these margins to record a continuous improvement.</p>
          <p>Slide number 12, Bradesco total loan portfolio stood in September at R$215.5 billion, 10% up over the last 12 months and 1.3% higher if compared to the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The lower large corporate loans growth was partly due to depreciation of the real <mark type="inaudible" /> against the U.S. dollar, which impacted dollar-index loan which account for around 15% of total loans in this segment. Loans to SMEs moved up by 9.3% of over the last 12 months and by 1.5% in the quarter. Individual loans had a year-on-year increase of 8.2% and a quarterly growth of 1.7%.</p>
          <p>Consumer financing continued to move up, especially payroll deductible loans, which increased by 6% in the quarter and by 22% in 2009. Our collateralized loans and mortgage also recorded significant performance in both case. We notice that demand for loans has increased over the recent months, not only for individuals but also for companies which began to expand investments. Once again, we therefore believe our 2009 guidance for the loan book growth between eight and 12% to be achieved. For 2010, although we have no detailed guidance yet, we believe a floor of 20% for loan book expansion to be feasible, given the expected GDP growth of 5.4%.</p>
          <p>New borrowers in 2009 who are people or companies who had no loans with Bradesco in September 2008 accounted for R$19 billion of loan deriving, therefore that was the loan growth over the last 12 months, underlying thus Brazil's capacity to expand with quality and diversified issues.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, as we have already been anticipating, our delinquency ratio for loans overdue by more than 90 days deteriorate this quarter reached around 5%. However, we believe delinquencies having reached their peak in this quarter as we expect them to stabilize and even record likely adoption in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, we showed the ratio for short-term delinquencies between 61 and 90 days. Both that the individual delinquency ratio has fallen since June while the corporate ratio has remained literally flat since the peak of February 2009. Thanks to this behavior plus improvement in the economy activities, we are confident that the worse is now behind us.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 intends to show our level of provisioning and our real level of excesses of provision for bad loans. If you look at the historical figures for the allowances for loan losses in a given period and effective losses over the subsequent 12-month period, we can see that write-offs has a strongly correlation with the line of E to H rates non-performing loans. Thus making us feel comfortable as to our provisioning level.</p>
          <p>This trend allow us to assume that our effective losses a year for now will be close to 5.5%, indicating a real excess of provisions of 2.8% over our <mark type="inaudible" /> portfolio, equivalent to around R$5 billion, giving us a very comfortable portion to pull over any possible difficulties that may arise.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows the coverage ratio of the allowance for loans losses in relation to loans overdue by 60 and 90 days. As you can see these ratios resume to our historical of coverage as is second quarter '09, which is a very comfortable one. Therefore, a constitution for the additional provisions will not be needed in the near future and also the provisions already constitute do not have to be reworked because as we already mentioned an improvement on the delinquency is expected from now on.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, as one can see fees moved up by 5.5% over the last 12 months and fell by 1.9% over the last quarter. The decline in card fees was due to the reduction in our stake in VisaNet as we now consolidate only 26% of VisaNet's revenues, compared to 40% before the IPO. The decline in the "Other" line of fees was caused by lower underwriting fees which stood at higher level in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>It's also worth remembering that IBI numbers have not been integrate into Bradesco's results yet since the shareholders meeting only took place last Friday. A reduction in the Checking Accounts line was due to the elimination of the fees for renewal of forms as of July of this year. It's also worth emphasizing the good performance of fees from Asset Management, Consortiums, custody and Brokerage, all of which moved up substantially.</p>
          <p>Slide 18, in the quarter comparison the upturn in personnel expenses was due to the full provisioning of the impact of the collective bargain agreement. It's important to note the approximately R$80 million of this amount can be attributed to the two previous quarters, given that the result of the collective bargain agreement was slightly higher than the amounts provisioned in those periods.</p>
          <p>The year-on-year growth was basically due to the effects of the 2008 and 2009 bargain agreements. In the case of other administrative expense, both the quarter and year-to-date upturns were due to the higher number of points of service and increased business volumes.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows our revenues from insurance premiums, pension plans, and savings bonds which increased by 9.7% in the quarter, reaching R$6.7 billion. I would particularly like to draw your attention to the performance of the life insurance and private pension plans, which reported a quarterly growth of 11.9%. Based on the last figures from <mark type="inaudible" /> as of August '09, the Bradesco's Insurance Group maintained its leadership position with the 23.5% market share.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 shows some of the main figures of the Bradesco's Group. The combined ratio, which measures the operational efficiency of the insurance group was affected in this quarter basically by higher claims in health insurance mainly due to the swine flu. The financial assets, which guarantee the technical reserve totaled around R$80 billion, of which 62 billion corresponds to the investment portfolio of the life insurance and VGBL segment.</p>
          <p>It's also worth mentioning as we start to adjust our provisions for pension plans in order to make them even more in line to the current environment. We adopted the assumption for asset return of 4% per year in real terms plus the 4.3% assumed until death. However, the actual table of mortality 82,000 with improvement of 1.5 per year -- 1.5% per year, is adopted by Bradescos as it is considered as more appropriate to guarantee an adequate provisioning level.</p>
          <p>Slide 21. On this slide I will just like to talk a little bit about the recent association agreement Bradesco has with OdontoPrev, which we'll integrated our subsidiary Bradesco Dental into its business. At the conclusion of this operation, Bradesco will have a 43.5% stake and a shared control on the combining company along with <mark type="inaudible" /> and his current team will be in charge of the business. We expect the association will benefit us from obtaining substantial gains in scale and synergies from the combination of best management practices over claims and mainly from the consolidation of space in a market that is growing around 20% per year.</p>
          <p>Taking June 2009 as a base, the new company will be in charge of around four million lives and the net income of R$533 million. It is also worth mentioning that the estimated matter of fact capitalization of the new company will stand at around R$2 billion, according to the current stock market. What it means that our stake would reach R$870 million, much higher than the book of R$220 million.</p>
          <p>On slide 22, one can see our economic department's projection for 2009 and 2010 regarding GDP, interest rates, inflation and the foreign exchange rate. In 2010, the reduction in the idle capacity of the economy and the increase in commodity prices will impact inflation. Consequently, we expect the consumer price index CPI of 4.6% next year, in line with the stronger economic upturn.</p>
          <p>As the economy becomes stronger the pressure over inflation becomes higher, thus forcing a response from the monetary policy. We therefore believe that the basic rate, the SELIC, will increase as of April 2010. Although this should not harm the economic growth as we expect a GDP expansion of 5.4%.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to say that given the challenges we face this year, we have record an excellent operation performance and generate solid results, reflecting not only our strong market position but also our capacity to adapt to different scenarios and challenges.</p>
          <p>We are also optimists over the future, thanks to the health outlook. That this economy has been showing strong signs of a recovery, with an improvement in both the consumer and corporate confidence indexes. We have invested heavily in technology always aiming at research optimization, and focusing continually on improving operational efficiency. We are also continue to expand our distribution network, client base and business volumes. All these actions make us believe that Bradesco is very well positioned to benefit from expected economic growth over the coming years.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention and let us open now the floor for your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Jason Mollin with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone. My question is regarding the expense line. You gave us guidance for the full-year 2009 that administrative and personnel expenses would be up in the six to 11% range, and I think, nine months on nine months you are up about 10%. However, the other operating expense line was up 30% quarter-on-quarter and 125% for the nine months this year versus last to about 2.15 billion. How should we think of the recurring level of this line item going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, actually we have in this quarter, the provision for economic plans and what is expected to happen on a conservative way would be instead of having R$387 million as we posted in this quarter and 416 million in the first half of the year probably we should see next quarter around up to may be 90 million or maybe a little bit less. These are events that should not be repeated next year because from next year on we actually just have the caller plans which basically we believe that are not substantial amounts and would be basically cleared in the lower chamber judges lawsuits. Nothing as relevant as we have, as we had this year.</p>
          <p>So probably you should consider for this year a level which is basically non-recurring for next year this would not be repeated. We don't have the guidance for 2010. So it's difficult to give you a better guidance. But at least in terms of the other operating expenses and revenues basically you -- we should consider next year not repeating in any way what we had as expenses this year, which was a hefty amount of money like R$1 billion for the year.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez with JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning everybody. I have questions on the insurance and pension and certified saving plan business. If I look at the run rate earnings across your business segments over the first three quarters of the year. You've seen reductions across a number of businesses, including the life, and the pension, the health business, even the certificate savings plans business. And I know you mentioned swine flu, the heavy rains really impacted the results this quarter, but I am wondering how you are thinking about this business and whether you think that there could be any issues in terms of the pricing of this business being incorrect, especially in the health insurance business where your earnings run rate seems to fallen off quite a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Saul, <mark type="inaudible" /> trying to hear you again. Saul, in terms of the results of health which is impacted that the provision was we made in terms of the swine flu. The reason is basically is because we look in that time I would say to you around July, August a movement and the increase in terms of the frequency and the ambulatory and the hospital attention. It was a lot of movements.</p>
          <p>It seems what we did in that time in September in the third quarter we make the provision a little bit more conservative because we -- for us would be better -- would be worst than we produced and anticipated that in the first quarter of the 2009, this is the reason why we increased a little bit in terms of 3.6 in terms of claims as a provision specifically for H1N1 flu. This was the reason why the results of health a little bit gone down. But according our perspective of October because we finish October and the claims related to the swine flu was a little bit lower than we produced and anticipated. You know the reason why I told you -- I tell you that our combined ratio for health would be getting better in the last quarter of the year. Was really -- was our perspective at that time was worse than the reality now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and if I could ask just follow-up Samuel . If I look at the earnings for the group, it was over 700 million in the first half -- in the first quarter and second quarter of last year, since then the earnings run rate has fallen considerably, 607 million this quarter. It's been ranged from 550 to 650 million, how quickly -- do you think that you get back to an earnings run rate that is comparable to what you saw in the first and second quarter of last year or should we think of this business as being -- or do you think that sort of earnings levels is not achievable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as I tried to explain you very interesting thing in terms of our business. As I mentioned to you many times -- I mentioned to everybody always that investment income for us is a part of operational of the insurance. As you know -- you know so much about the insurance business is a very -- you'll see their debt, the investment income really is part of our price. It is part of our operational result. There what happened, it relates to the last year. The stock market would be better than the -- 2009 would be better now in this second semester of the year. This is the reason why I told you that will be -- if you continue in the same perspective of the shares -- our results from the equities. I'll say to you, would be a little bit the same as in the last year. I would say to you that would be better than the last fourth quarter in 2008. I would say 2009 would be better than 2008 in terms of fourth quarter in general and I think to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you I mean -- so you expect on that front you would expect obviously as interest rates to rise, your yields to improve. And you would also I would assume you would also expect your basic combined ratio to fall versus the levels you've had in the third quarter as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say to you not in terms of interest rate I would say to you -- the results from the stock market would be better in 2009 in the last quarter of the year -- last quarter of 2008 -- 2009 would be better. Plus would be combined ratio in the last in 2008 last quarter I would say in 2009 would be similar of this 2008 in the last quarter. In another words, the results, the particular results of insurance group in the last quarter of 2009 would be better than the last quarter of 2008.</p>

          <p>Let me use this just finishing what Saul is -- actually just to respond to question of Jason, I didn't get so much the point if it was other operating administrative expenses or other operating expenses and revenue. But if it is in terms of the guidance for other operating expenses we have a guidance for expenses, operational expense that are personnel plus administrative expense. We don't have a guidance just for the line of administrative expenses. But we are basically in line to our expectation of expenses growth for the year, that is adding the two lines, personnel and administrative and if I didn't understand your question correctly I'm just sorry. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel Abut from Citi, good morning. Couple of questions related to revenues. If I look at your guidance for 2009 which you remind us in page 41, for net interest income top-line income you have guided 18 to 22%, which seems to be coming along nicely and this was a complicated year because you were expecting and right we saw very little volume growth and you also had the effect of low interest rate, but you did prepare for it I mean and just took the positions in your treasury to compensate for that. How should we think about the outlook for this line for 2010 even if you are prepared yet to give official guidance because you haven't finalized the budget and if we take into account that you're going to expect much more vigorous volume growth loan growth and that you said that you are expecting 200 -- 250 basis points hike in SELIC rate started in April but that you have much lower treasury gains next year, should we expect overall net interest income growth much much lower than this year? How much lower?</p>
          <p>Help us elaborate on how should we think about this line for next year? And second is on fee income because it's coming this year barely at the low end of the range you had guided. You said six to 10% and for the first nine months, it accumulated, we had a 5.5%. Headed into next year should we see a rebound because of the impact of the higher business and clients? Or is something structural going on in pricing that we should prepare for another year of -- kind of low single-digit fee income growth a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Daniel, just to tell you that when we are giving the guidance on the page 43, we are not taking into consideration at all the treasury gains. Basically we had a very strong expansion of net interest income during the year and we don't have the guidance again but probably what is going to happen in 2010 will be more along the gross but probably less net interest income which would be a little bit of the opposite of the net interest margin expansion we saw during the year. Probably we should see, although it's not a guidance please, but we should see maybe a little bit lower net interest margin for next year. And in terms of the fees, we were impacted by some R$50 million, five zero million real.</p>
          <p>During the year third quarter basically because of not being allowed to be charging these renewal form fees that we were basically when we gave the guidance. We made a revision by the mid of the year, when we disclosed the June 2009 numbers. And at that time and no one was talking about these fees not being existing anymore. So we continue to be focusing on the 6 to 10% fee income growth for the year. I know it will not be easy but probably the last quarter should be a little bit better in terms of the economic, the economy of the last quarter should probably be a little bit better.</p>
          <p>And on the top of that when we had the guidance actually, it was not so clear what would be happening in terms of the IPO of VisaNet. And it was a major success, and by having sold some 13% of our stake in VisaNet moving down from 39 to 26, you actually end up with a little bit less fees in the line which is the most important one, which are the card fees. So altogether we continue to be focusing on that and obviously we wish to give the guidance for 2010 but we are finishing the numbers in order to present to you I believe in the beginning of next year when we are closing the 2009 numbers exactly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi everyone good morning. I have a question on provisions. If I look at 2006, 2007, and 2008 provisions to average loans were 5%, pretty much 5% in every of those years, so two questions should we think about 5% as a normalized level? And second you are now heading to probably 6.5% in 2009. I guess that's the run rate for the year. How fast can you go back to 5% if that is indeed the normalized level? Is it something that we could see in 2010 or does it take a couple of years to get there? Just help us understand the little bit about the movement in provisions to what is a normalize level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jorge. Basically this metric -- we like to present this metric of provisions for loans which is in our presentation on the page number 11. If you look at the page number 11, you would see that usually in historical levels, our level of provisioning it represents some 40% of the net interest income. With the increase in delinquencies moving from 3.4 to roughly 5% which was basically what we have already guided since April of this year. We had an increase in the provisioning level to a level of close to 60% or little bit more than 60%. Probably we are going to see over -- in beginning already we're already beginning to see a little bit less provisioning needs in this quarter, probably it should improve a little bit more in the last quarter. But definitively we are should -- we should see coming closer to the 40% line slowly but continuously more by the middle of next year on. It takes sometime. We say -- we saw a very sharp deterioration in asset quality even more with some specific clients for example the FMEs which were very affected, the delinquency ratio doubled which this type of customer.</p>
          <p>We still have some companies that are beginning to improve in the margin. All the clients are improving but still we need to be cautious about what is going to happen overtime but probably -- responding to your question I believe that's more from the middle of next year on to the end -- up to the end of the year we should see a level of provisions that we calculate as a percentage like we have on page number 11, we should be probably closer to the historical levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That helps. And let me just clarify something about the way you measure it. You look at provisions as a percentage of interest income -- I'm assuming only the interest income from credit, right. It doesn't include interest income from securities there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Excuse me our next question is from Mr. Mario Pierry with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Let me ask you -- my question is related to expenses and fees also. As we are seeing expenses growing at a faster pace than fees, I think you look at your year-on-year growth; expenses are growing about 10% while fees are growing 6%. At the same time over the last like three to four years you have made significant investments in technology and when do you expect, some of these investments to start paying off for you? When do you expect to see a reversal here to see fees growing faster than expenses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look Mario, it's very difficult because it's not like a magical quarter that we just push the button. We're already benefiting today from these IT improvement program. Definitely we always recommend for the analysts to look at our site. There is a very good presentation of <mark type="inaudible" /> focusing on that.</p>
          <p>It's true that fees have been growing more, basically by growing our distribution network and growing also investments in IT. Fees were impacted since the beginning of 2008 by some different measures to restrict banks to charge some specific fees which affected checking account, credit card fees. That definitely we will believe they are not going to be repeated going forward. So we believe that most of the fee income growth we are going to experience will come from client base growth and from higher cross-selling. And part of this IT improvement program depends, is focused on the increasing the cross-selling ratio from some five products per customer to closer to eight products per customer. Definitively a big improvement. What we are saying is that like in 2015, approximately, we should be running in a cost-to-income ratio at some 37 to 38%.</p>
          <p>And definitively not this year of 2010 but probably from 2000 -- the IT improvement program will be ending by the end of 2011. So probably from 2012 on, we should see a little bit more improvement in our cost-to-income ratio, moving closer to the 37, 38%. We have nowadays --  we have nowadays at 41.7%. So slight improvement for next year probably by the end of the year, we should reach around 41.5% cost-to-income ratio. So we already begin to improve our cost-to-income ratio but definitively from following years on we should see more of improvement both in terms of revenue and in terms of expense.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Ian Bochsky.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just wanted to confirm a couple of details. The first one, in terms of the other OpEx with the civil contingency provisions, am I might right in assuming that you are saying that a billion expenses are being incurred this year, will not be incurred next year. And could you just explain the basis of why that might be? And then just secondly in terms of fee growth, if -- just to get a better idea of how 2010 might look, can you give us a sense of what kind of client base growth you are looking at? And what kind of timeframe you are looking on that cross-sale ratio to get from five to eight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ian. Just to first question you asked about the civil contingencies, when we look at this year approximately a billion real, if we suppose that we had 416 plus 387 is already some 900 plus the 90 rounded billion. Why are we expecting this not to be repeated next year? Because all this, these economic plans and they have possibility to be questioned by customers in general during 20 years. And from next year on, basically you will have the possibility of the caller plan. The caller plans are little bit different because it was already classified as a constitutional plan the others were not. So, basically these give -- these gave a possibility for people to file lawsuits against the banks. In this case it's already like there is a certification or guarantee that the bank didn't make money with this.</p>
          <p>So basically the potential of people asking and having accepted in lawsuits some proceeds with the banks are much more limited. This is the reason why I was answering the question of Jason that I believe was another one, but I was basically responding the question that these actually will not be repeated going forward and these would be ruled by lower chamber courts which are much more agile and usually -- basically its not classified at something that is &#x2013; it's constitutional, so basically the potential is much lower for that to be impacting the banking sector at all for next year on. The other plans will all ready be due for the 20 years of people filing lawsuits.</p>
          <p>In terms of the client base expansion, we are targeting to grow next year around 1.2 million new customers and what happens is that we have a lot of people that are moving into our operations into Bradesco because we are much more retail oriented that have a lower income. And basically its very difficult for them to buy more products because they begin the relationship by opening an account, making a saving deposit, making a loan. So basically over time, if you look at middle income customers and more and more Brazilians are getting middle income, half of the population nowadays is middle income. Middle income they have like eight, nine products each, so if I have five, I trend to go closer to eight to nine but it will take time and it's a question of not only of cross-selling of Bradesco systems, but also question of the economy growing by some 5%, the real wages, the unemployment rate moving down and at the end we should be should be reaching the goals that we have for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And can I just follow up by asking in terms of the customer growth, are there any particular regions as a country where there's a particular focus or certain regions or is it a pretty broad based effort in terms of where you'll be proportionally growing your customer base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The growth that we are expecting for our client base would be in Brazil as a whole. We &#x2013; it's difficult to precise if it is just in one region usually it's on the regions that have lower income. But basically we are seeing a massive growth in our client base also in large cities like Sao Paulo. So definitively throughout Brazil.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone, most of my questions have been answered, but I have two questions. The first one if you look at in terms of your perspective of your whole product portfolio, what are the areas that you think you are lagging behind or where do you see room for higher growth going forward. And looking to the insurance segments, I mean do you think looking in 2010, do you think you might be able to grow maybe double digits next year or maybe a level closer to the growth you are seeing in the loan portfolio and what are the areas within the insurance that you think, would have the biggest growth potential? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will respond basically we have been in our presentations talking about some products that we believe should be growing the most like mortgage, the operation of payroll deductible loans, cards and insurance. I would say overall we see very huge potential to grow on those lines double-digit definitively and maybe I would be just asking someone to focus on some project that he believe in insurance could be growing mostly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Monteiro Samuel speaking. In terms of insurance I would say to you that the line is related to the personal lines like of life and dental for instance and I would say it to you for instance that insurance and debt would be the small ticket like <mark type="inaudible" /> that's people talking about recently would be the best lines which have been increased so much, because the insurance as you know in Brazil seven years continuous stay increase in two digits. I think it would be repeated in last -- next three year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Just one follow-up question on the insurance. I mean looking at a more concrete metric what is -- I mean what is the percentage of your client base currently -- I mean in the -- on the banking side that has insurance with Bradesco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To that -- in terms of bank client penetration as I understand your question, it would be increase so much in terms of PNC because of is not too effective, is not -- and not higher. I would like to try to make now and the end of this year and the beginning of the next year a very strong policy to penetrate more in terms of PNC. In terms of OI too, we have a very good penetration, I'd say more than 95% is the same as the patient plans, the same as in dental would be getting better which is new as we have jointly to <mark type="inaudible" /> would be better to penetrating our clients, like mainly in corporate clients. <mark type="inaudible" /> would be getting more penetrated in 2010. Would be our achieve for 2010 has increased so much that the penetration of the insurance and client base of the bank.</p>
