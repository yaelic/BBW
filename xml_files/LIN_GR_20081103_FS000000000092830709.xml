          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Linde Group Q3 Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode until we conduct the question answering session and instruction will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand over to the Mr. Eisenlohr, Head of Investor Relation. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Pia . Hello and good afternoon, everybody, it's Thomas Eisenlohr. Thank you for joining this conference call for our nine months results today. Georg Denoke, Member of the Executive Board and CFO will be hosting the call and as usual Aldo Belloni, Member of the Executive Board is also available for your questions.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Georg and we will open the line again for your questions at the end of the presentation.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Thomas and good afternoon, everybody, let's turn to Page Three of the presentation. By looking at the highlights of the figures for the first nine months of the year you will see that there was no major impact of an economic slowdown on our business.</p>
          <p>Group sales posted growth, excluding currency effects of 11% to 9.392 billion euro. On the same basis, Group operating profit increased in the first nine months by 12.9% to 1.910 billion euro. This strong performance led to a 16.6% improvement in adjusted EPS from 3.55 to 4.14 euro.</p>
          <p>Cash flow generation was also strong with an 11.2% increase in operating cash flow to 1.301 billion euro for the nine months period. All in all our business has kept the momentum of the first half year and shown a third quarter performance in line with our expectation and plans.</p>
          <p>The credit crisis has not been impacting us in this nine months period. That said we are well aware of the profound crisis on the financial markets and the signals given by lead indicators, economic forecasts and some of our end customer segments.</p>
          <p>With regards to the uncertain market environment, I would therefore first of all like to draw your attention today once more to our very solid financial setup. We have the best direct long-term financing in place and our refinancing schedule is fully covered. I will come back to that in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Looking into our business development we are convinced that there are numerous stabilization factors within our new setup that will help us to resist relatively well the more challenging macroeconomic environment. For 2008 our guidance hence remains unchanged with a sales increase and an over proportionate growth in operating profit.</p>
          <p>Our medium-term targets of an operating profit of more than 3 billion euro and a return on capital employed of at least 13% for the financial year 2010 remain achievable in the weaker economic scenario supported by a new efficiency program, HPO. I will come back to the full detail of this outlook later on.</p>
          <p>Let's have the usual look through our numbers first. Turning to Page Four, Group sales of 9.392 billion euro are up 4.8% on a reported basis. As said, excluding the adverse currency effects, this represents an 11% increase, better the nine months figure of last year.</p>
          <p>The Gases Division has posted a comparable sales growth of 8.7% to 7.157 billion euro. This growth figure is as usual cleaned of all currency, natural gas price and consolidation effects. If we include the organic style bolt-on acquisitions, comparable growth was actually 11.6% per end of September. The third quarter comparable growth rate was 9.2% compared to 8.5% in the first half year.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering Division project execution and revenue recognition progressed fully in line with our expectation, leading to sales growth of 12.4% to 2.063 billion euro after nine months. For the full year we are hence on track towards our guidance for an eight to 10% year-on-year sales growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to Page Five, Group operating profit of 1.910 billion euro again outpaced sales growth in a reported growth rate of 7.9% and a currency adjusted profit increase of 12.9%. Despite the upward pressure on input prices and the dilutive effect of our pass-through clauses, we increased margins year-on-year by 50 basis points. Besides contributions from price increases, profitability is supported by the successful implementation of synergies and efficiency initiatives.</p>
          <p>The Gases Division posted an 11.8% currency adjusted increase in operating profit to 1.819 billion euro. The improvement in the operating margin is here 50 basis points as well. The margin is up from 24.9% to 25.4% on a reported basis. To gauge the full impact of our efficiency and synergy measures let's for one moment isolate the natural gas price impact.</p>
          <p>Escalation clauses contributed around 160 million euro to nine months sales, but as a pure pass-through item, these generated no additional operating profit. Hence, at constant natural gas prices our Gases margin would have been increasing 60 basis points higher with a 110 basis points year-on-year increase to 26%.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering Division operating profit improved by 14.4% to 183 million euro. With an operating margin of 8.9% our Engineering business has once again fulfilled its margin target of above 8% and keeps posting industry-leading profitability. This strong performance reflects our focused technology portfolio and the hard work and discipline of our engineers with regards to project management and execution.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to some more performance figures of our Gases Division starting with a sales bridge on Page Six. As usual, the comparable growth figure is isolated here from its external influence factors. As discussed earlier, price and volume effects combined have delivered a strong comparable growth rate of 8.7%. Currency still had a major negative effect at minus 6.2% after nine months even if the US dollar comparison has improved over the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Natural gas prices kept contributing to year-on-year growth with a positive impact of 2.4% by the end of September after 2.2% in the first half year. Consolidation effect on a divisional level do not play a major role anymore. The negative contribution of minus 0.4% still reflects the net effect of disposals and acquisitions closed in the first half of the year 2007.</p>
          <p>Page Seven shows the key figures of our Western Europe operating segment. Sales of 3.131 billion euro are up 4.5% on a reported basis and 5.9% on a comparative basis. Operating profit increased 4.7% on reported basis to 854 million euro, driving the operating margin to a slight increase on an already high level to 27.3%.</p>
          <p>This positive development was driven by volume increases and upward price trends in the cylinder gas segment, in particular for specialty gases in our core markets Germany and the UK.</p>
          <p>In the operating segment Americas on Slide Eight, the reported figures still reflect the US disposals closed in the first half year of 2007 and also the adverse translational effect of the US dollar. On a comparative basis, nine months sales of 1.652 billion euro are up 6.9%. The main drivers of this underlying growth are hydrogen ramp-ups in North and South America, as well as strong pricing.</p>
          <p>The operating profit of 320 million euro represents a strong margin increase of a full percentage point from 18.4% to 19.4%. Taking into account that the US business incurs sizable dilution from the natural gas price increases, this strong improvement in profitability reflects mainly the new structure of our US business.</p>
          <p>The operating segment Asia and Eastern Europe posted a reported sales growth of 27.4% to 1.459 billion euro. Besides the contribution of our strategic acquisition in Asia in the last year, this high growth rate reflects a strong underlying performance in all three main regions.</p>
          <p>The 12.4% increase on comparable basis is indeed driven by double-digit underlying increases in Eastern Europe, Middle East, Greater China, as well as in South and East Asia. Operating profit in the region increased by 26% to 470 million euro. The operating margin remained with around 29% at the high level of the previous year.</p>
          <p>Please turn to Page 10. Reported sales growth of 2.3% in the operating segment South Pacific and Africa is still impacted by the significant weakness of the South African rand. With sales of 969 million euro the underlying growth stands at 12.7%.</p>
          <p>The cylinder product area and especially the LPG business are the main growth drivers in the region. Operating profit improved by 2.7% on reported basis to 228 million euro. At 23.5% the margin reached the previous year level and was thereby negatively impacted, especially by energy price increases.</p>
          <p>Looking at the split by product area on Page 11 I can just reiterate that there was stable growth momentum in all distribution channels. The growth rates shown here are as usual on comparable and consolidated basis. The bulk business showed a very stable growth at 6.2% to 1.761 billion euro.</p>
          <p>Growth in the product area is, as you know, driven by a very wide range of end market and the regular flow of new applications. Cylinder growth remained strongest with a year-on-year increase of 11.6% to 2.843 billion euro.</p>
          <p>Strong pricing and the specialty gases segment were once again the main contributors to this good performance. In the tonnage segment we have seen in the third quarter a slight acceleration driven by the gradual start and ramp up of the project in our pipeline.</p>
          <p>Therefore, sales increased by 6.9% on a comparable basis to 1.818 billion euro. The third quarter was impacted by a shutdown of the Texas facilities because of the hurricanes and the shutdown of our hydrogen plant in Italy.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you, however, that due to the joint venture structure of some of the projects, as well as embedded finance lease accounting the full impact of project ramp ups out of our pipeline does not always flow through the top line growth rate.</p>
          <p>The healthcare business is expected largely independent of any economics swing. The product areas posted the comparable growth of 8.2% to 735 million euro in the first nine months.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at where we stand in our project backlog of the tonnage and large project business on Slide 12. We have 59 projects of a minimum investment size of 10 million euro in our pipeline that will deliver new revenue streams in the period 2008 to 2010.</p>
          <p>We are still in many discussions regarding new project signings and have actually signed the first project with on stream dates in 2011 as we. The list of potential projects remains strong with emerging markets and energy applications topping the list.</p>
          <p>As indicated earlier, please be aware that tonnage projects run in a joint venture structure contribute to EPS and cash flows, but do not generate sales recognition as long as we do not have control.</p>
          <p>Therefore, as usual, we give you the overview of the joint venture performance here on Page 13. Proportionate sales not recognized in our top line figures were 515 million euro ex-share after nine months. The reported growth rate of 15.7% and the currency adjusted figure of plus 21.7% reflect the underlying growth momentum in our joint venture portfolio.</p>
          <p>The share of net income that is contributing to our operating profit was with 43 million euro just about on last year's level. The net income contribution out of the very strong sales growth in our joint ventures was distorted by some tax issues over the course of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's move from Gases to Engineering with the overview of key figures on Slide 14. As I said earlier, project execution is fully on track and after the strong sales recognition in the first half year we are progressing in line with our plans towards a full year sales growth of roughly 8%.</p>
          <p>Our margin performance remains strong and we once again exceeded the industry-leading target margin of 8%. We also see further support from the demand side.</p>
          <p>Order intake is with 2.1% increase to 2.295 billion euro, well on track towards the full year figure around last year's level of 3 billion euro. We had as of end of September more than 4.6 billion euro of orders on hand, so our order backlog is covering around 1.5 times expected full year sales.</p>
          <p>Turning to Page 15 we come to the key elements of our cash flow statement. Cash flow from operating activities increased by 11.2% from 1.170 billion to 1.301 billion euro. Cash generation improved quarter-on-quarter by 14.1% to 485 million euro as we had indicated earlier. This is again based on our strong operating performance.</p>
          <p>As you can see, investing activities increased by 15.6% from 771 million to 891 million euro. This development reflects the good project situation in the Gases business.</p>
          <p>Please turn to Slide 16. In these days you better have a sound liquidity provision and a balanced maturity profile in place. As you know, we have refinanced a significant portion of our debt in April 2007. The result of this is a rather long-term financing profile. The total gross debt is 7.5 billion euro, whereof more than 70% of the debt is beyond 2010.</p>
          <p>For the remaining debt until the end of 2010 we have a two billion euro committed facility with more than 50 banks in place and have more than one billion euro of cash. Of course we have ongoing market access. We have bonds and MTN issues in August, September and October and I can also confirm that we were currently in the market facing commercial papers on a frequent basis.</p>
          <p>So in a nutshell we have the long-term debt structure in place and short-term debt is already backed up by liquidity reserves and the committed credit facility.</p>
          <p>Before I finish with the details of our financial guidance let me give you some more background on our new program HPO. With the ambition to be a high performance organization we are implementing the next step of the continuous transformation of our company towards a leading global gases and engineering company.</p>
          <p>With the BOC acquisition and the KION disposal, we finally transformed our company into the pure gases and engineering play. At that point we did more than change our name; we defined one vision and one culture along our new operating model.</p>
          <p>The synergy program we have implemented since then is getting closer to its end. We are fully on track here and plan to reach our 250 million euro target in 2009. Let me remind you that the main part of the synergies was integration related in the field of G&amp;A procurement, R&amp;D, production and supply and that the 250 million euro we're hence at the bottom line target.</p>
          <p>Since the start of this year we have been preparing what will be the next optimization phase, HPO, and the key attribute will be to define, develop and leverage best practices throughout our organization. And given our acquisition-based history you can expect that there is still a lot of efficiency improvement to harvest. The focus of this program is mainly on productivity improvement, process excellence, as well as people excellence.</p>
          <p>HPO will deliver 650 to 800 million euro gross cost savings over a four-year period starting 2009. This program is a next step of our long-term strategy to leverage our strong setup towards sustainable profitable growth. Moreover, the contribution in the first two years will help us with regard to our 2010 target.</p>
          <p>Let's therefore get back as promised to the details and assumption of our guidance. Please turn to Slide 18. We have a very stable setup under many aspects and we can cope with some economic headwinds. Therefore, there is no doubt that for the year 2008 we will post, as planned, an increase in Group sales and an over-proportionate increase in operating profit.</p>
          <p>Our medium-term target of an operating profit of more than three billion euro and a return on capital employed of at least 13% for the 2010 financial year must now be seen against a background of a more uncertain and significantly weaker economic environment. With the support of the synergies and the new efficiency program, and assuming that the exchange rates on average stay at least at their current levels these targets remain achievable.</p>
          <p>For the Gases Division our ambition remains to increase our sales above the growth rate of the global industrial gas market. Furthermore, we expect an over-proportionate increase in operating profit. Our capital expenditure is obviously closely linked to the project pipeline. As always pointed out, the 13% CapEx to sales ratio is an average figure over the cycle.</p>
          <p>For the Engineering Division we still expect mid-term sales growth of eight to 10% based on the still positive market environment and our strong order backlog. Our target margin for this business remains above 8%.</p>
          <p>This concludes my overview of the key figures from our strong nine months figures and our confirmed outlook. I will hand over to the operator now and we are very happy to take your questions. Pia , please.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Laurent Favre. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, it's UBS in London. I've got three questions really, one for the past, one for the present and one for the future. On the past could you help me to understand the Q3 margin improvement in the US? I think there was only a small top line growth and I have to say I was quite surprised by the magnitude of the improvements. There was a divestment during 2007, but the divestment of lower margin businesses was already out in the first half of 2008. The second question is for Q4 with the low cost announcements on production curtailment in chemicals and other key end markets could you help me to understand the impact of these production curtailments for your volumes? And then the bigger picture question, it's really on deflation. We've seen the oil price going down, lack of project financing, could you maybe give us your latest view on the so-called mega trend? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for your questions. I'll start with the US and as you assumed, it's a structure, first of all of the business after the disposal of our cylinder gas business in the first half year of 2007 and on top of this, this is of course synergy-related because of the overlap of G&amp;A functions in the US. And then in the course of this year it's driven by the pricing and the additional pass-through of, for example, energy-related portions to the customer. I think we had one problem to fully understand your second question. It was on chemicals, but could you please repeat your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've heard a lot of announcement from chemicals companies on Q4 production curtailment, so I was just wondering if you could give us an indication on the volumes impact for you all the production curtailment in the chemicals industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I hand over for this question to Aldo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, this is Aldo Belloni. So far our accounts in the petrochemicals business have not been significantly affected. We have got some indication especially from China that some of the final sites are curtailing their capacity and throughput, but so far nothing alarming and well above take-or-pay obligations. I think the third question was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The mega trend, third question was the mega trend in energy I understand and I think here we see from a price level in gas and oil, for example, that first of all we believe that this is a short-term impact. From an overall perspective we assume that there's s a long-term trend supporting these new applications as we have implemented for the Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation, the enhanced gas recovery scheme. On top of this we see on the energy side a lot of environmental-driven solutions like the solar industry, which is moving aggressively into our books in the next year and the years to come. So from an overall perspective we do not assume a deterioration of the business in the mid or in the short-term from that perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Wesley Brooks. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, it's Wesley Brooks from Morgan Stanley in London. Thanks for taking my call. Two questions just on the cost savings, that's a pretty big number, so just if you could talk a little bit more as to where you'll be getting these efficiencies and the process excellence, just a little bit a more color on that please? And then just in terms of what you see in the fourth quarter in your negotiations particularly in the Engineering business, but just what your customers are saying, are having any more difficulty in your negotiations or any cancellations or delays? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you for this question. I mean I refer to the slide where we have presented the HPO program, which is on Page 17 of the presentation. And it is really driven through our ambition to drive further productivity improvement down to the bottom line and here we have, of course, still things in the G&amp;A area where we see improvements, for example, from an IT perspective. We have a very heavy routine IT landscape through our acquisition setup, so we see here further improvement, but also of course we see for the main part of our cost structure in the distribution and production area further improvement which will support a 650 to 800 million gross cost savings over these four years period.</p>
          <p>So if you compare this with our synergy program, which was front-loaded mainly with the organizational change in the G&amp;A and then the organizational setup, this numbers here is in gross cost number and not a net number bottom line. Especially when you look into the future we assume that economical development is more uncertain that we talk about the gross cost number. With our experience we have seen in the past when we look backwards into our legacy programs of BOC and Linde that we have seen in average something between 30 to 60% achievement levels from a gross cost perspective in areas where we have or periods where we had more headwind from an economical perspective, it's rather below 50%. Where we had a positive environment it was above 50%, so this for your orientation of this efficiency improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very useful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to your second question, I mean the negotiations or price negotiations are definitely not going to address the changed financing environment. So basically what we see is that some of our customers, of course, are struggling to get to their feasibility validated for their projects and some of these projects, of course, will not survive, will not make the cut, but it is not our task in price reduction to make projects feasible which are not feasible. On the other side we see some negative creep in the cost of raw materials like carbon steel or stainless steel and of course these savings can be factored into our price calculations, but it is not a matter of negations, as I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Peter Clark. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Clark, Soc Gen in London. Two quick ones, well maybe quick, the UK business, obviously one of the core gases business. I know it held up pretty well in earlier recessions. I'm just wondering what your confidence is this time given that we're clearly going into something pretty awful over here and perhaps a feel of how the manufacturing split of the business is now, if you exclude on-site in the UK? Perhaps against that maybe something like the hospitality business where again it's been a fantastic growth story, but of course the indications for some of the hospitality business might not be so good when we look ahead in the UK. The second one, Eastern Europe still going very strongly, you mentioned the cylinder business there as well. Just wondering what your feel is going into 2009 for that business given that some of the lead indications again suggest that Eastern Europe might slow quite sharply? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well the Sureserve business, which is the <mark type="inaudible" /> hospitality business in the UK has seen some slowdown during the year, that's correct. We are making up this with an increase product offering, expanded product offering to these pubs basically. We are doing a lot of work for instance in qualifying these pubs for environmental compliance of these operations.</p>
          <p>So we are adding services to our portfolio of customers in the hospitality business. In general you're right, of course, the economy forecasts for the UK are not very exciting. I just remind you that in the course of 2008 we have concluded a very important tonnage contract with Corus at Scunthorpe, which will give us effectively another 15 plus years of sustained operation at this site and we are going to build a very large gas separation plant. And the forecast of Corus for this site are still very, very positive. It is one of the most efficient steel sites of what is today the new TATA Group. With regard to the financial projection I pass over to Georg.</p>

          <p>So when we looked into the structure of the product areas on Page 11 on the nine months basis we assume for a more mid-term oriented view that on-site becomes stronger because of the project pipeline we have signed up here. There are more than 50 project in the pipeline to move into the years or second half 2008, then 2009, 2010 and of course we assume a lower growth rate for the cylinder business. Bulk here was around 6%, healthcare above 8%. I think it's from an outlook perspective in the right range.</p>

          <p>Yes, thanks very much, Andrew Benson from Citigroup in London. On the cost savings can you just give an idea of the total and cash costs of those savings and how that costs may be incurred? Financial charges seem high in the third quarter, just if you could explain that and what we should look out for in the coming quarters? Aldo, you talked a little bit about whether some of these, I can't remember your precise words, some of these contracts may become unviable or lack viability. Is this sort of pipeline negotiations or are you saying some of the contracts you've actually signed may cease to be viable and may drop out of the system, just to clarify that? Then the tax rate was a bit lower than I expected as well, if you can give some guidance on that please?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I hope it works now. So thank you for your questions. Starting with the financial charges, I mean we have one structure in place for our disposal of our Japanese business beginning &#x2013; this was beginning of 2007. Here we have the closedown of the corporate entity where we still have one hedge on a yen entity. This will be end of the year, this will come back into our year, full year number, so it's an impact only on the quarterly basis. Talking about the tax rate, tax rate is down significant because of our debt pushdown in countries where we had let's say rather higher tax rates in the previous years like Germany, like UK, which have lowered their tax rates.</p>
          <p>And the other main argument is of course the debt pushdown, which was after the BOC acquisition and main achievement for us into countries with lower tax income and reducing there the level of earnings like US, like Australia, like UK again. So from that perspective we see still our target in place with some tax rate of up to 30%. Of course this year we are significantly lower with around for the full year at 27 to 28%, I think this is something we see here. On the project pipeline I hand over to Aldo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrew, to answer your question with regard to project cancellation, first of all, we have no cancellation at all so far of any signed contract. In the signed contract we have one project only which has been put on hold by the customer who is ready to revisit the numbers then he told us that he most likely will resume the execution about a year from now. The majority of this project which was &#x2013; I was addressing in terms of feasibility hurdles, these are proposals, projects at proposal stage, for petrochemical companies or steel companies. But in general I can tell you that the pipeline is still very good, robust, especially in countries or regions like the Middle East or India, for instance where the financial crisis at least for the time being is not visible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, can I just go back on the interest line then, if you can perhaps give us some guidance as what you think the underlying quarterly rate will be. I didn't quite understand the Japanese situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, again for you, Andrew, so when we disposed the business in Japan to Air Liquide, right, we have implemented and structured for tax reasons to shutdown this entity over the course of this year. This is now happening end of the year and we have hedged the structure which we will receive in yen over the years and over the quarter. This year or this quarter we'll see a strong improvement of the yen. Of course this derivative was again put-off, but when we get the money out of the local entity in Japan this will be fully covered then end of the year deposit coming back. That is the reason.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right, so what's a quarterly run rate of interest roughly speaking?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking now about the interest expense, but still the rate we said, we're seeing roughly 6% pre-tax interest rate for our debt structure.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Norbert Barth. Please go ahead with your question and announce your name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, it's Norbert Barth I think I mentioned from WestLB here in Frankfurt. Also three question, perhaps is it possible to get a sales split of the Gas Division by clients or by industry saying like for example it's in the chemical area or the steel area or food and so on to have a little bit or at least an indication to have a little feeling who are the clients?</p>
          <p>Secondly general question also with the current situation and looking forward is there a change in your CapEx strategy, you mentioned that the 13% is over the cycle. Have you already thought about perhaps focusing a little bit even more on debt production than perhaps on CapEx payouts or how do you think the next especially two years? And also concerning the business in emerging market, everyone is at the moment looking how especially also in China and Asian market perhaps that the growth rates will come back, can you elaborate a little bit more, what do you expect especially for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Norbert, for your questions. I think we have not given guidance on the structure of the different market segments we are operating in. Nevertheless, you can assume that of course we have a very broad reach from a customer perspective, so I only give you some indications here. So, for example, chemistry and energy-related applications are probably roughly 15% of our customer base, metallurgy and glass is slightly above 10%, food and beverage is below 10%, manufacturing industry I would say is between 15 to 20%, electronics is around 5%, medical is 15%. So these are the main, I think the main parts of the structure. You'll see us here very spread through the different channels and I think this is also an important part when it comes to an economical downturn.</p>
          <p>The parts where we have a strong cylinder business in place you also should know that we have a very strong market share and I think this is very, very important to understand if we can manage in downturn when it comes to volume reduction. If you have market shares of above 50, above 60%, as we do have in Scandinavia, in UK, Ireland, in Australia, in many countries in Eastern Europe, we have better control to manage in downturn. Coming to your CapEx question, it's of course the fashion of this impact year of the crisis, when we've said we have an average investment of 13% CapEx to sales ratio over the cycle we were always asked up to now if we'll report a higher CapEx to sales ratio above 15%. At that point of time we always said, yes, we are prepared to take these investments because we have the financial structure in place to do this, if this is available for us.</p>
          <p>Now when we go into the other direction we also can say of course we only take profitable projects, we will not make risky investments when we see a counterparty risk which is not in our favor. At that point of time we definitely can say that when we look into our onsite pipeline where we have the signed contracts we definitely have very strong players as counterparties, so from an overall perspective we have from the 13% CapEx sales ratio roughly half is allocated for future growth in onsite. So that is at least, when it comes to a downturn, one flexible part that we see a reduction.</p>
          <p>The other half is the growth in the cylinder business, so it's for distribution equipment, for tanks, cylinders, trucks and one-third of that half is related to maintenance and repair. So you see also here the opportunity to rather have short-term actions when you see volume take outs in that market place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But so far for the time being no decision made because you don't see at the moment volume declining?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is a point I think. We can act when we see a change, but at that point of time I think we have not seen the change. So it's a mid-term guidance over the cycle, but definitely we have the springs in our hands to steer the business here. The third part of your question was growth related and I hand over to Aldo.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I hope I have correctly understood your question, which was considering emerging economies and more particularly what our growth strategy would be there if the economy is slowing down. I think first of all our strategy especially <mark type="inaudible" /> is very much cluster driven. So we have started up the number of clusters in different countries, but especially in China and definitely we hope we are going to follow through the expansion and completion of these clusters. I think this, as far as I can tell now <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>UBS in London, good afternoon and thanks for taking my three questions. The first one is turning to the mix of the Engineering order book, 58% currently for air separation unit. I was wondering if you could give you a little bit of, again, flavor as to which end markets those air separations cater to? Is it diversified, is it again a cluster risk? If you could give us some qualitative or quantitative insights it would be helpful? The second question is a financial one, you've answered Andrew's question on the interest line, but I wanted to come back to the entire financing line. Could you quantify what your finance lease income and your pension credit or debit for the quarter was and also give guidance for run rates for those financial line items please? And then the third question is a bigger picture. You've obviously announced the cost cutting program this morning, which looked like that comes handy in terms of time, but has been planned for quite some time, it's not necessarily a contingency measure. So I just wanted to ask what other contingency measures you have in case things go horribly pear-shaped? For example, some of your CapEx projects must be directed to the liquid merchant site, not dedicated onsite. Would you be prepared to step back from those to maximize capacity utilization of your existing emerging facilities if that happens and is that at all possible and where? Thank you very much, if you could talk around that it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andrew, this is Aldo. I will answer the number one and number three questions and Georg is going to do the second question. First of all, your question regarding the abnormally high order intake for ASUs in the course of these years and which industries are driving that. Answer is very simple, steel and energy. Steel, of course, as steel maintained quite a momentum, I mentioned discount of contract a few minutes ago, but there has been a number of other contracts. Those are from third parties, not gas-related contracts especially in Asia, India and China notably.</p>
          <p>But then on the other side, energy, which is not a very let's say numerous population, it's just one of two contracts, but they're really very large and the Abu Dhabi contract of course, which is energy driven is very, very, very significant, so these two industries. The third question was related to the adjustment of liquid capacity in the vision of HPO. Of course as you know our policy in the past has always been to limit the number of pure liquid plants. We definitely prefer invest liquid fraction capacity attached to tonnage plants and of course all future investment will be carefully considering that. We can redistribute loads across these facilities to a certain extent. If we see that the liquid market is creeping negatively, definitely we will refrain for investing new liquid production capacity, but in general actually our experience has been the other way around, that the tonnage business is reacting first and sometimes we will have some problems in maintaining liquid production if the tonnage business is slowing down, especially in the argon production. So we have a full set of tools how in order how to react to the changing liquid demands.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon, Jean de Watteville from Nomura. First question, actually a quantification of points that have been mentioned during the presentation, you talked about the impact in North America onsite from the hurricanes. I wonder if you could quantify this as well as quantifying the impact of the shutdown in Italy?</p>
          <p>Second quantification, actually you made an interesting clarification about the fact that some of the pipeline you have of new tonnage project may get into the joint-venture line of whoever did leave. Can you just separate what will be consolidated, fully consolidated and what number of projects that will not be visible getting into the joint-venture line of whoever did leave. Those are for the clarification.</p>
          <p>Now the second point is going back on the Engineering outlook, I really understand that the long-term trend is intact and very much the new mega trend will continue to support the industry longer term. However, since the last quarter obviously a lot of things changed, price of steels went down, access to capital, as you mentioned, is getting significantly more difficult, price of energy prices are significantly lower and I'm just wondering if you could update your guidance that you gave in Q2 saying that you're very confident to grow your order intake by 10% or 10% plus next year and the following years? It seems to me more difficult to believe and when you answer this question if you could give some highlight on some of the sub-texture what's the reason you see continued growth in one overall, it means that your overall order intake continues to grow?</p>
          <p>And sorry if there's too many questions, the very last one is lower steel prices, I'm just wondering if you're in your already signed contracts in Engineering will you enjoy higher margins, are you passing through the lower steel prices? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you for your questions, Jean. I think on the onsite question related to the operation and performance in the third quarter it was an impact in North America because of the hurricanes and also a shutdown in Italy. So the combined issue is a double-digit million figure, but significantly below 50 million as a guidance for you. Related the joint venture business and the activities, I mean you will see here and I think we are not prepared to disclose this in the nine months conference call, but we are working on that for the next year guidance. There will be one change which is through our Elgas acquisition in Australia. This is in joint venture in the LPG business, which is a 50/50 joint venture where we are taking over the other 50%. So we have now 100% of that businesses will fall now into the subsidiary business, so we'll be fully affected top line and bottom line, so there will be one change. The 2007 sales number for that business was roughly 250 million euro.</p>
          <p>The other part is more an indication for you. I mean you happen to back up the number for embedded finance lease for this year and when we talk about, for example, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company joint venture in the Middle East, that's just, for example, a business which is joint venture driven and will be joint venture driven because as a foreigner you are not allowed to take majority. So to give you this indication, a split of this more than 50 project, which is top line, which is bottom line, we are not prepared to give you this at that stage. Related to the Engineering outlook I think it's very clear that our guidance was always related to sales, eight to 10% growth in sales and not in order intake. I think that's important to understand. Overall we still see structural positive trends in the Engineering business which were not happening before. That is mainly related to the energy applications and of course, as we discussed earlier, energy prices are down, but they are not down that far that they are back on the level of $30 per barrel.</p>
          <p>And therefore I think it's a question how far they will come down, but at that stage I think there is still an enormous need also in the emerging countries for additional product. Lower energy prices also support, for example, the petrochemical industry. I think that's also important to understand that we can see their positive development of the business. The other part I think of the different segments is that in the natural gas part of our business we also believe that there is from a mid-term perspective an additional need when we look into the natural gas consumption at markets like Japan, for example, which definitely need a product and the other emerging markets. I think I would like to stop here with just answering your questions because there's bad noise in your line and I hope I have answered all of your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry for the noise, thank you for the answer. If I can just follow-up on the last answer on Engineering outlook, actually if you look at the sales guidance for next year and I appreciate the book-to-bill is still very high at the moment. But with the sales growing about 10% next year at the end of 2009 assuming no growth in the order intake you will have a book-to-bill close to one in my estimate. And I asked the question in Q2 and the answer was we are very confident to grow the order intake by 10%. In my view since the last quarter there has been a series of factors that could lead to the question of a different view of the order intake, particularly the change in petrochemical demand, and the access to capital and I was just really wondering if you're still confident to grow the order intake by 10% next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to give you here an understanding, we have no guidance on the order intake at that stage. I think it is clearly that way that you are right, that there is a downturn on the financial support of projects and it would be very unwise to assume that there will be no change in investment projects related to our activity in the Engineering business. Therefore, there is no guidance for the order intake at that stage. I think what we have seen up to now is a very high order intake in 2008 which is on the same level as last year which was historically high. So from an overall perspective I think I do not want to argue against your calculation. I rather think that we haven't seen yet this deterioration when we go into the market, but overall we assume of course that there will be an impact when we look into our Engineering business.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very clear, thank you. Can I just re-ask the last question I asked and really sorry if I'm asking too much questions, is the lower steel prices margin benefit or it's passed through?</p>

          <p>Jean, this is Aldo, of course you know that the vast majority of our contracts are lump sum turnkey. So once you have signed the lump sum turnkey contract then it is your prerogative to capitalize savings or bear loses, so I think this is the environment. Depending when we have signed these contracts for let's say contracts signed in the first part of this year, that will see we will enjoy some cost relief, okay?</p>

          <p>Yes, it's Peter Testa from One Investments. Thank you for taking my questions. I have three please. On the first one I was wondering if you could help remind us in these certain times of the degree of support you get from the take-or-pay contracts and the base rent on cylinder? And secondly in this third quarter I saw the Americas and Western Europe noticeably slower. I was wondering if you could give a bit of background upon that please? And then the last question is just on the HPO program, if you can give some sense of the timing of the savings and cash costs if any? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm starting this with the second question, third quarter impact on the economy and the different regions. I think what we always said is that we have seen already in the second quarter volume issue in automotive, for example, in textile industry. In the US that is continuing. We also have seen industrial production in UK coming slightly down, compensated both by healthcare in the UK and pricing in the US. Overall if we look into the third quarter we have seen more factories shutting down their activities, but we also have to admit that September month was not continuing that trend. It was rather the opposite that we have seen and some composition of a weaker August. So from that perspective at that point of time this is the main description of lower activity in UK and US.</p>
          <p>The take-or-pay contract in onsite, I think this is more a structural question. It is, as we always said, the main character of an onsite contract is that this is with a base facility or take-or-pay where you have mainly the profit take out of a scheme. It's independent or largely independent from volume take out, some differentiation between the different segments of the electronics business, for example, it's more aggressive when it comes to invariable take out. You know that we have lower activities here in the electronics part, but the main character of onsite is take-or-pay where you have the full coverage of your cost and the profit contribution over that 15 years, normally 15 years contract period.</p>
          <p>HPO, as I said earlier, I think we have started that program end of this year. We estimated gross cost number is 650 to 800 million. Because of the structure of the program it's very much about standardization and process optimization. We see a stronger ramp-up at the end of that period when you have implemented structured interest. On the other hand, we believe that we do have some compensation for the earlier years, we do have some cost advantages when we go into the overall structure of our business, which was very much driven by the acquisition and the new setup of our model. So we assume that we have an equal distribution let's say or at least an equal potential for the distribution of these cost savings over this item.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to be clear please, you said on one hand it ramps up more towards the end and then you just mentioned there be more equal potential. Can you maybe hazard a guess as to let's say first half of the program, second half of the program how the savings might split?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Peter, the reason for that answer is that we have a range of 650 to 800. Of course when we go to the upper end of that range then you have a higher take out at the end through the standardization and process optimization and when you take the lower number of that then you have a more equal distribution.</p>

          <p>Yes, Marcus Diebel from JPMorgan in London. Thanks for taking my question as well. I've got some questions on the minorities and joint ventures, given the exchange rate is there any intention to buyout the minorities in the South African business? And the second question if you could elaborate on the tax issues that held back the net income growth in joint ventures, and if you could guide us how long and these issues might stay? Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> so it's fully consolidated as a subsidiary, but when we talk about our other joint venture activities on the Coast of Malaysia, for example BOF and take also into 1% positive outlook we are looking at definitely at our opportunities and on the one hand, but there's no clear guidance that this is now the date that all joint venture majorities out or minorities into majorities.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alexandra Hauser, LBBW, Stuttgart. I have two questions concerning the pricing policy, do you see any price pressure in your negotiation so far because of the economic downturn in special sectors? And possibly I didn't understand with regard to your program HPO what amount do you plan for restructuring charges up to 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions, Alexandra. Into the nine months period I think as we described earlier it was rather overall a very tight market when we look into the demand supply balance. So overall we were able to rather increase prices from a gases perspective, as you have seen in specialty gases, raw gases. That is a trend as it is at that stage and up to this moment of time, so no change here that we get additional price pressure. On the HPO part I think I indicated a little bit that we will have from an investment perspective for the standardization, for example in IT or process optimization for productivity-related areas, we will have here some investments which are roughly between 100 and 200 million euro I would say over this four years period. But we will give you a clearer indication at a later stage, thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Rhian Tucker. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name and location.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, it's Rhian Tucker from Credit Suisse in London. I've still got a couple of questions left, I'm afraid. First of all, I calculate you had 12.5% organic cylinder growth in the quarter. Can you give us a split between price and volume of that, please and can you just talk us through which one of those you see slowing, if either, going into Q4 and into 2009? The second question is on the restructuring effort, the new restructuring program. Will there be any associated costs with that and which year will you take those costs in, can you give both the P&amp;L and the cash flow answer for that one? And then the third question, obviously a lot of your gases products are indexed to both energy, electricity or natural gas. Can you tell us how you see those costs and therefore your pricing progressing in each of the regions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, Rhian, it's impossible for us, <mark type="inaudible" />. To the volume increases of the last quarter we were participating by the higher natural gas price and this price is now coming down. We will pass through this to the customer, so there is no influence  on value from our side. When we go into the question of volume and price, I think overall volume and price is from overall structure is roughly half-half. When we look into cylinder here we see oil prices and volume growth as a guidance. And there was another question related to the HPO one-time cost, I think I refer to my previous answer when Alexandra was asking and no further update on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if you saw like 4% volume increase in cylinders are you seeing that spill into Q4 or are you are seeing some slowing of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I indicated, we have seen a slowdown from an industrial perspective in the UK and -- from a previous quarter and this quarter's development. We saw of course, as I answered in one of the earlier questions when we look mid-term, right, <mark type="inaudible" /> cylinder is coming down here if we look for 2009, and on-site is participating in the growth because of the backlog of the new projects which are coming on. So that is the general guidance we see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just for your information, there's still a very bad line when you speak, so I don't know if the operator can sort that out any.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm as close to the microphone as possible, so sorry for the line. <mark type="inaudible" /> the wrong equipment here. So I can repeat the other answer I have given. It was related to your question the development of the different businesses, growth rate of cylinder, for example. And my guidance here for 2009 is that definitely cylinder will be not on that level and we rather have on-site taking growth because of the project pipeline we do have in place <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
