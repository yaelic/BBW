          <p>Dear analyst and investors, welcome to the first quarter earnings conference call of Deutsche Telekom.  With me on the call are Ren&#xE9; Obermann, our CEO, and Dr. Karl-Gerhard Eick, our CFO and Deputy CEO.  As usual we'll start with a presentation on the quarter which was sent out this morning and also can be seen on our website followed by a Q&amp;A session.  Please restrict yourself to two questions per caller <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Let me now hand over to our CEO Ren&#xE9; Obermann.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stephan.  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  I would like to start with 2008 first quarter highlights.  As you will have seen from the figures we announced this morning, the year has started well and we are on course to meet our 2008 guidance.  Although the headline figure shows a slight decline in revenues, this is impacted by adverse exchange rates and by changes in consolidation.  If exchange rates had remained constant, revenues would have increased by 0.7% and on an organic basis that is adjusted for consolidation and constant exchange rates by 0.4% to &#x20AC;15.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA was stable at &#x20AC;4.7 billion.  With constant exchange rates, however, this translates into growth of 3.1% and on an organic basis of 1.1%.  Free cash flow more than tripled from the 2007 figure to &#x20AC;1.6 billion and net income more than doubled to &#x20AC;924 million.  We have made considerable progress in reducing our cost base.  At the Group level, adjusted personnel expenses are down by 6% to &#x20AC;3.3 billion and bear in mind that this is against a back loss of increasing personnel numbers in the United States.  Both through growth and through the integration of SunCom, the net Group head count reduction amounted to 9,400 employees year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly inform you on the status of our negotiations with the Greek government regarding OT.  We are making good progress but the process has not yet been concluded.  As we have stated agreement is dependent upon us achieving our primary objective of management control and full consolidation of the asset.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the operations specifically starting with Germany.  The fixed line business has maintained its momentum of 2007, with both strong growth in DSL retail net adds of 539,000 equivalent to a net add share of 43% and good cost savings with a net cost base reduction of &#x20AC;0.3 billion in the quarter.  Adjusted EBITDA for BBFN Germany increased by 0.5% year on year with a margin improvement from 32.2 to now 34.5%.</p>
          <p>At T-Mobile Germany, the adjusted EBITDA margin went up from 35.9 to 36.7% along with robust contract customer growth of over 200,000.  A range of attractive new voice and data tariffs have been introduced over the last few months.</p>
          <p>In the domestic broadband markets, we achieved 539,000 DSL net adds, equivalent to a retail net add market share of 43%.  At the end of the first quarter, we had 9.6 million DSL retail customers, up almost 2 million from the end of Q1 2007 of which 88% are in either 12 or 24 months contracts now.  We were also able to reduce our DSL churn by 13% year-on-year.  The decline in line losses slowed to approximately 460,000 in the first quarter excluding all IP migration.  In addition to the 460,000 we estimate around 120,000 line losses were caused by resale DSL customers, or by customers who were anyway beforehand with resellers, who were moved to all-IP connections.  In total, we lost 500 &#x2013; if we include both &#x2013; we lost 582,000 lines in the quarter.  We expect the impact of the all-IP migration however to become a bit more significant in the course of the year.</p>
          <p>On next slide, T-Mobile Germany, there has been a material improvement in financial trends compared to the position in the first quarter 2007.  The decline in service revenues is now at 2.2%.  That compares to 3% in Q1 and adjusted EBITDA has improved from a decline of over 11% to now in the last quarter just over 1%.  We achieved contract net adds in the first quarter of 210,000 and we had an excellent low contract churn rate of 1.1%.  Minutes of use per contract customer were up in Q1 by about 6% year-on-year which translates into an increase of total contract minutes of use of 13%.</p>
          <p>International growth on the next slide, T-Mobile has continued to show significant growth internationally.  Because of the exchange rate movements it is important to focus here on the organic development.  This shows international revenue growth of nearly 8% and adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 13%.  Year-on-year this translates into increases of 1.7 and 5.8% respectively in terms of reported figures.  Excluding SunCom in the US, there were total international contract net adds in the quarter of 1.2 million.  This strong contract growth performance was seen in both the US and in Central and Eastern Europe.  Let me go through each of these in turn and I'll start with the US.</p>
          <p>T-Mobile USA on the next slide continued its strong growth despite the economic slowdown in the US.  Service revenues grew by 14.5% to US$4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA by 18% to more than US$1.4 billion, accordingly, the adjusted EBITDA margin improved by close to 1 percentage point to almost 28%.  Supported by lower contract churn, the company had almost 1 million net adds in the first quarter of which three quarters were new contract customers.</p>
          <p>In addition, the consolidation of SunCom as of February added 1.1 million additional customers resulting in a total customer base of close to 31 million at the end of the quarter.  This means that we have more than tripled our customer base in the US under the T-Mobile brand in the last six years.  The strong customer growth is a reflection of successful products such as myFaves which now has more than 5.5 million customers and also a result of FlexPay.  The consolidation of SunCom increased total revenues by $86 million, but did not have a significant impact on EBITDA.  We continued to see remarkable growth in messaging in the United States.  The total number of SMS, and also picture messaging, more than doubled to almost 33 billion messages in the first quarter of 2008.  In the context of mobile data, I would like to highlight the recent 3G launch in New York City.</p>
          <p>On the next slide you see Central European countries, our Central and Eastern European mobile businesses continued to be a major success story, delivering double digit reported growth in the quarter.  Comparing Q1 2008 to Q1 2007, total revenues increased by nearly 11%, service revenues by nearly 12%, and adjusted EBITDA by 14.5%.</p>
          <p>The margin improved by 1.4 percentage points to over 42%.  This growth was supported by exchange rates developments.  Organically, assuming constant exchange rates, revenues grew by 5.5%, and adjusted EBITDA by approximately 9%.  Contract net adds in Q1 were over 400,000, and the contract churn was generally very low, frequently below 1%.  The growth was in both voice and data.</p>
          <p>Non-voice revenues were up by over 28% to &#x20AC;256 million.  Without messaging the growth and data revenues, was over 86%.  Overall, the cash contribution of the Central and Eastern European businesses came in at &#x20AC;371 million.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we talk specifically about PTC.  This is something we're particularly pleased with because of the development of that business.  It has proved to be a major turnaround story in the last 18 months.  Here, there were significant increases year on year in total and service revenues of over 17 and 19% respectively, while adjusted EBITDA rose by over 25% with a margin of over 35%.  Organically assuming constant exchange rates, revenues grew by 8.2% and adjusted EBITDA by 15%.  Contract net adds in the first quarter of 2008 were 190,000 and the contract churn rate was a low 0.7%.</p>
          <p>Growth in non-voice revenues was particularly strong with non-voice as a percent of ARPU increasing 2 percentage points to now 20% year on year.  The cash contribution of PTC in Q1 was &#x20AC;93 million which was slightly down on last year because of higher CapEx to enable the strong growth to continue.</p>
          <p>On the next slide we talk about mobilization of the Internet.  Let me turn to that component of our strategy.  There are three points I would like to highlight, first the strong growth in data revenues.  Excluding messaging, these rose by 28% on a global basis year on year to &#x20AC;540 million.  In Europe, the increase was over 40% to over &#x20AC;300 million but in the US in dollar terms the increase was nearly 31% to nearly US$360 million, and I'll talk about web'n'walk specifically in myFaves in a moment.</p>
          <p>Second, we have introduced a series of attractive new data tariffs, including a laptop flat rate in Germany of &#x20AC;34.95.  And third, as I mentioned, there has been the start of 3G in the US with the May 5 launch in New York to be followed by a further 20 to 25 core markets by the end of the year.  We have also increased the number of 3G base stations up from 8,000 to 13,000 in the first quarter and that's just 5,000 additional sites are now being deployed or have been deployed in Q1 and put on the network.  Importantly, the 3G launch enables the use of the AWS spectrum which we acquired in 2006 and that lays the foundation for future growth particularly in data but also in voice.</p>
          <p>Next slide is again on Internet mobilization.  In Europe there was an increase of over 80% in the number of web'n'walk customers year-on-year to over 3.8 million now and non-voice revenues excluding messaging rose by 41% to over &#x20AC;300 million in the quarter.  The growth in web'n'walk customers accelerated from 215,000 net adds in Q1 2007 to nearly 600,000 net adds in the first quarter of 2008.  In the US there are now more than 5.5 million myFaves users; one year ago we had just 1.5 million.</p>
          <p>Non-voice revenues in the US excluding messaging grew by 30% and now amount to nearly $360 million.  Differently from Europe where this market is more mature, we are also still seeing very strong growth in messaging revenues in the US.  In fact total non-voice revenues including messaging were up 32.9% to $747 million in Q1.</p>
          <p>Shortly after the publication, I will turn to the next slide now on network centric ICT.  Shortly after the publication of our full year results at the end of February we were able to announce the completion of the alliance with Cognizant for global IT delivery.  This alliance provides us with access to the vast offshore capacities of Cognizant and will allow us to significantly lower our production costs or development costs in system integration and therefore be more competitive in the marketplace.  We have restructured the business to focus on network-centric ICT solutions.  And that has entailed the sale of Media &amp; Broadcast and the transfer of a part of the business which we called Active Billing to T-Home to BBFN.</p>
          <p>We've also put in place a reporting focus to reflect better the changed marketplace; specifically the former Business Services unit has now been migrated to Telecommunications.  There are now three units, first is Computing &amp; Desktop Services, second is Systems Integration and the third is called Telecommunications.  We achieved a number of major deals during the quarter, the most significant of which was the 5-year &#x20AC;1 billion global data-center outsourcing contract with Royal Dutch Shell.  This transaction confirms T-Systems as a leading global network-centric Information and Communications Technology provider.</p>
          <p>Slide 16. I'd like to conclude by reiterating that despite the tough market conditions and the impact of the euro exchange rate, we are confident that we will achieve our guidance for the year of adjusted group EBITDA of around &#x20AC;19.3 billion and a free cash flow of around &#x20AC;6.6 billion and it is our intention to maintain an attractive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>With that confirmation, let me hand over to Karl.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ren&#xE9;.  I am very pleased as well with our first quarter results, especially with our improved bottom line and the strong free cash flow.  Let me draw your attention in particular to the adverse influence of foreign exchange developments on our results especially the euro versus dollar and euro versus pound sterling.</p>
          <p>Reported revenues decreased by 3.1% to &#x20AC;15 billion.  This was due to decreasing revenues in Broadband/Fixed Network and business customers which because of exchange rates developments could not be offset by the growth in the mobile segment.  Organically however that is adjusted for changes in the scope of consolidation and assuming constant exchange rates revenues in fact grew by 0.4% to &#x20AC;15.3 billion.  Despite, the decrease in reported revenues reported adjusted EBITDA remained stable at &#x20AC;4.7 billion.  This encouraging result is due to Broadband/Fixed Network and mobile outside Germany, in particular Eastern Europe and the US.  Organically with constant exchange rates adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.1% to &#x20AC;4.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Reported net income which benefited from a gain in connection with the sale of Media &amp; Broadcast more than doubled to &#x20AC;924 million.  Adjusted net income increased by one third to &#x20AC;750 million, in particular due to lower net interest expenses and lower D&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Finally, adjusted free cash flow more than tripled to &#x20AC;1.6 billion.  This was due in particular to changes in working capital.  I will get back to this later.  As we have seen adjusted EBITDA remained stable for the group despite the adverse foreign exchange rate movements.  This is due in particular to the encouraging adjusted EBITDA development in Broadband/Fixed Networks, whereas revenues continued to decrease minus 7.7% overall and minus 6.1% domestically, adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.9% overall and 0.5% domestically.  The increase in overall adjusted EBITDA is due in part to the deconsolidation of the loss making T-Online France and Spain.</p>
          <p>In addition, as of Q1, Active Billing was moved from the Systems to Broadband/Fixed Network and DTKS our Deutsche Telekom customer service was moved from T-Mobile to Broadband/Fixed Network.  If we adjust the prior year for all this organically adjusted EBITDA decreased by 1.7%.  Domestic adjusted EBITDA declined organically by 0.3% to approximately &#x20AC;1.7 billion, adjusted for Active Billing and DTKS in the prior year, domestic revenues decreased by 7.8%.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look to the domestic revenue development.  Domestic revenues decreased by 6.1%.  The main cause of this was again network communications with about half of the reduction due to excess revenues and half to calling revenues, reflecting line losses and the price effects from the new tariffs.</p>
          <p>Wholesale which had increased in previous quarters, had a slightly negative impact on the year-on-year revenue developments, since the continuing growth in ULL revenues was more than offset by decreasing revenues from voice interconnection and resale DSL.</p>
          <p>The contribution of IP Internet, which had been strongly decreasing in prior quarters, was almost stable due to the growth in DSL lines and the new consolidation of Immobilien Scout 24 as of November, despite ongoing strong price pressures.</p>
          <p>Other Fixed Network services in particular, data communication and value-added services had a small negative contribution to the year-on-year revenue development, which however was more than offset by structural effects, namely the consolidation of Active Billing and DTKS.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the adjusted EBITDA development for Broadband/Fixed Network overall.  You saw that adjusted EBITDA increased by 1.9% to just over &#x20AC;1.9 billion.  This was partially due to the deconsolidation of T-Online France and Spain, and also to a slight improvement in Central and Eastern Europe.  However, the main sector for the encouraging development was that the domestic revenue decline could be compensated for by corresponding reduction in OpEx.  Overall net costs were reduced by &#x20AC;0.3 billion, of which one third each was due to further savings from our Save for Service cost cutting program, lower market invest and reduced outsourcing and termination costs.  Going forward, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be impacted by increases in market invest, for example in connection with the ongoing rollout of our triple-play products.</p>
          <p>As we said, we expect domestic adjusted EBITDA for the year to decline by between 5 and 8%.  Net cost savings on the other hand may be higher then our original guidance of &#x20AC;0.1 billion.  Let me emphasize however that our guidance was for the full year and we are only now at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Mobile, the underlying operational development remains strong, especially in the US and in Central and Eastern Europe.  The number of customers increased by nearly 10% to more than 123 million.  This is the organic development with the customer figures for the prior year adjusted to include Orange Netherlands and SunCom.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, total revenues grew by only 0.5% to &#x20AC;8.45 billion.  However, organically that is adjusted for changes in the scope of consolidation and assuming constant exchange rates, the growth was 5% to &#x20AC;8.8 billion.  This reflects the strong operational development in the US, and to a lesser extent but still positive in local currency in the UK.</p>
          <p>Reported adjusted EBITDA grew over proportionally by 4.9% to &#x20AC;2.7 billion.  This reflects the margin improvement to 31.5% in the first quarter of '08 from 30.2% in the prior year.  The margin effect improved in all key markets including Germany, the US, the UK, and Poland.  Organically adjusted EBITDA grew by close to 9% to &#x20AC;2.8 billion.  The difference between reported and organic developments is even more striking if we look just at the adjusted EBITDA from the international operations.  This grew by 5.8% on a reported basis and by 12.7% organically.</p>
          <p>Turning to business customers, the reported figures mask an underlying improvement of the major trends.  Reported revenues decreased by 10.4% to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. However if we adjust the revenues in the first quarter of '07 for the sale of Media &amp; Broadcast and the transfer of Active Billing to Broadband/Fixed Network the decrease in revenues was 5.2%.  This compares to a revenue decline of 6.9% in the prior year.  Similarly, reported EBITDA decreased by 21.1% to &#x20AC;206 million.  Organically that is adjusted for Media &amp; Broadcast and Active Billing, the decline was only 2.4% which compares to a decline of 17.7% in 2007.  As in previous quarters external revenues decreased less than total revenues and international revenues continued their positive growth.</p>
          <p>Let me update you also on the progress with our cost cutting program, Save for Service.  I am very pleased that we achieved a net cost reduction for the group of &#x20AC;0.7 billion year-on-year in the first quarter.  While this was supported by the exchange rates developments, it still reflects a real cost reduction from Save for Service which more than offset the increase in market spend.  The total run rate of Save for Service now stands at &#x20AC;2.5 billion gross savings, which includes an additional contribution of &#x20AC;240 million in the first quarter.  In conjunction with the positive impact from foreign exchange rate developments and a higher market spends plus small inorganic changes, this resulted in a net cost reduction of &#x20AC;0.7 billion year-on-year, with half coming from BBFN domestic.</p>
          <p>We've also made good progress in reducing the head count in the Group.  Since the end of Q1 '07 we have reduced the head count by 9,400 employees, or 3.8%.  This consists of a net reduction in Germany of 13,300 employees, or 8.4%, of which 5,200 were due to deconsolidations.  Outside Germany, the employee count increased by 3,900 employees or 4.5%.  The international head count increase is due to the sustained customer growth and a systematic expansion of the business including SunCom at T-Mobile US and to a continuation of the internationalization strategy at business customers.  This was partially offset by the ongoing work force reduction in Eastern Europe.  The net effect was a 6% reduction in adjusted personnel expenses for the Group to &#x20AC;3.3 billion and domestically 8% to &#x20AC;2.3 billion.  Accordingly, the adjusted personnel cost ratio for the Group improved from 22.6% in Q1 '07 to 21.9% and domestically from 31.5% to 30.7%.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at the domestic work force development in the first quarter.  Specifically, we achieved a gross domestic head count reduction of 5,500 employees.  Net of new hires the reduction was 4,000 or 2.6%.  In January '08, 1,600 employees of Vivento Technical Services were transferred to Nokia Siemens Networks.</p>
          <p>The sale of Media &amp; Broadcast accounted for 1,200 employees, and a reduction of 400 employees was due to the deconsolidation of five call center locations in March.  In this context I would also like to highlight our success with Vivento.  Of the total of 39,300 transfers into Vivento since the year 2002, 30,900 employees have now left, and of those 19,800 were outside of DT.  As of March 31 there were 8,400 remaining employees in Vivento.</p>
          <p>As you have seen free cash flow more than tripled to &#x20AC;1.6 billion.  The main driver behind this was an increase in the cash generated from operations from &#x20AC;2.5 billion to &#x20AC;3.8 billion.  Compared to the first quarter '07, cash flow in the first quarter of '08 was impacted to a much lesser extent by changes in working capital.  This more than compensated for a reversal in income taxes from a net tax refund in the first quarter of '07 to a net tax payment in the first quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was further supported by slightly lower net interest payments and lower cash CapEx.  Cash CapEx decreased mainly due to a lower CapEx in BBFN.  All these effects more than compensated for lower proceeds from disposition of assets.  In contrast to the first quarter of '07 there were no major proceeds from real estate sales in the first quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>We also saw a very encouraging improvement in the bottom-line.  Reported net income more than doubled from &#x20AC;459 million in the first quarter of '07 to &#x20AC;924 million in the first quarter of '08.  This improvement occurred despite a higher income tax expense and was due to a higher reported EBITDA and lower net interest expense.  Reported EBITDA benefited from the gain in connection with the sale of Media &amp; Broadcast of &#x20AC;0.5 billion which more than offset other special sectors including restructuring expenses.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income improved by one-third to &#x20AC;750 million.  This was due primarily to lower net interest expense and lower D&amp;A.  D&amp;A decreased mainly due to lower depreciation on technical equipment and machinery.  In the quarter, we maintained our strong balance sheet ratios at the lower-end of our target ratio with regards to gearing and upper-end with regards to equity ratio.</p>
          <p>The SunCom acquisition with an enterprise value of &#x20AC;1.6 billion was entirely offset by our free cash flow in the third quarter &#x2013; in the first quarter, sorry.  In addition, net debt benefited from the cash proceeds of the sale of Media &amp; Broadcast of &#x20AC;0.8 billion and foreign exchange rate effects of minus &#x20AC;0.5 billion.  Accordingly, net debt was reduced by &#x20AC;1.3 billion compared to the end of '07.  With that, we are now ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon, I had two questions, first regarding T-Mobile in Germany.  You seem to have been able to do some good cost cutting there.  The fact is that SAC actually increased, so I was wondering where was the cost cutting taking place and how sustainable that was going into the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question had to do about your M&amp;A strategy. You've highlighted in the past that one of your objective was to reduce the weight of the German in your total assets.  Now you're working on OTE today, assuming that goes as you expected, do you think that that would get you where you want to be in the short term, or do you believe that you should be looking continuously at other opportunities to expand internationally? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah this is Ren&#xE9; speaking.  Let me start with the M&amp;A question.  In last year's strategic update we've made it very clear that we wish to grow abroad with mobile organically but also potentially through inorganic, selected inorganic moves according to the following priorities and that is unchanged: in-market consolidation, things we did for instance in the Netherlands, in Austria or in the United States have priority, adjacent markets because they can still be usefully managed in terms of the synergies and only third priority would be more remote markets, if they strategically and economically financially are feasible and make financial sense.  And therefore any potential acquisitions are strict, are subject to strict financial criteria, so the returns must exceed risk adjusted cost of capital.  And we will be very disciplined with regard to any acquisitions as we demonstrated by the selected moves we made.</p>
          <p>Allow me not to make any further comments and not to nourish any rumors and speculations because there are already plenty of rumors and speculations out there and it is our general policy not to comment on those rumors.  If we get OT, if that whole thing works successfully then we'll have quite a bit of work to do on making it successfully integrated and use the synergies.</p>
          <p>So on the German side, let me just check the question.  Cost cutting, how sustainable.  The market invest in Germany has been a little lower than previous year.  I think the total as a season in Germany has been, no sorry has been slightly up, and it's true.  Overall Sacs have been slightly up, total market invests if you include Sacs which become of course growing importantly, important in marketing costs then we are slightly down to roughly 400 million.  The churn has been lowered, so and therefore that also helped the margins.  We always stated by the way that a margin is achievable between 35 and 40%.  So in that corridor that's something we would still envisage and unfortunately we've come up a little bit, and we'll try and do our best to keep it high or make it even higher.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon.  A couple of questions again, one of which I suspect I'll struggle with a little bit, but I'll try anyway.  The first one actually I just wanted to pick up on the comment you made with regard to the ALL-IP migration where you implied we should expect a modest acceleration in line loss during the course of the remainder of this year.  I think I'm right in saying that the quota system for ULL increased to 330,000 lines per month from April.  Cable is still gaining traction, particularly Unity Media leading the way in that respect.  Why should we not expect a sharp increase in line loss from this point on, I wonder if you can just comment on that please?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I accept quite rightly you won't say anything specifically about Sprint speculation, but on paper at least it looks like a unique opportunity to take the top slot in a large and fundamentally highly attractive market.  I wonder whether conceptually you could talk a little bit about how you think about the US opportunity at this point in time.  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me turn the question around.  We have seen cable picking up slightly, that is true.  And I just don't see the logic behind expecting a sharp acceleration of migration.  We've seen some ALL-IP migration of about what we estimate 120,000 and we've seen some from my point of view some more or less positive development on the retail side, because the customers to ALL-IP were mainly lost through the reselling and through resellers so they weren't our end users prior to that anyway.  In our end user business, we've increased our DSL numbers stronger than we lost to ULL competitors.  So, I just can't see the reason for sharp acceleration, but we are conservative people and we think that there may be some increase in ALL-IP migration in the course of the year and that's pretty much I think also been stated in earlier presentations of T-Home that they expect some increase.  Let's see how it goes.  Of course we are fighting it as you can imagine we want to keep as many as we can.</p>
          <p>On US acquisitions and so forth I have to repeat what I said earlier on, I'm not going to nourish any of these numerous speculations, it's our general policy not to do that.  It's not related, don't interpret this in any way other than we don't comment on those things.  There are so many speculations.  We hope to get this OTE thing done, and then we'll have quite a bit of work to get OTE under control and integrate it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi.  Thanks for putting me on.  Just a very quick question on the use of shares, I know that this is continuing unfortunately on the M&amp;A theme.  One of your peers has obviously indicated that they would be willing to issue shares in an acquisition.  That's obviously quite a sensitive subject for current shareholders.  Maybe you could talk about what you think your cost of equity is, and what kind of hurdle rates you would need to see if you were to use shares or indeed if you think using shares for acquisitions is a good or bad idea full stop.  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question.  And perhaps I'll try at least to give you an answer.  Actually our cost of capital is 8% after taxes.  That's I think a very well known number.  And, as I think as we have always said and stated, if we do look into acquisitions, we are clearly very much concentrating whether this is accretive with respect to EPS and free cash flow per share, pre-purchase price allocation, because purchase price allocations is also some kind of misleading.</p>
          <p>And, I -- for example in the case of OTE, if we put the numbers together, we are seeing a very nice positive EPS effect as well as free cash flow effect from the first year onwards.  That's how we do our calculation, and yes when we look about the use of shares versus the use of cash, I think you have seen that in the case of OTE it was only something for cash and in light of our balance sheet total I think this is rather obvious.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, two questions please.  With the OTE deal, what is your understanding of the minimum requirement of control needed to fully consolidate OTE?  And I guess my question is that if the Greek government does retain total control or some sort of veto right, are you still confident you can consolidate the business?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, with the launch of your 3G network in the US this week, do you have any targets or thoughts behind what population coverage or 3G penetration you can see in the next few years within your US subscriber base, effectively how quickly will you attempt to migrate to the 3G network?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the question about control about OTE.  What we clearly want to achieve is full management control, full management control with the management of the ongoing operations.  This specifically translates into our ability to introduce a CEO.  And as a basis of that also to be in control on the decision making at the Executive Board.  That's basically what we do want and to have to achieve with respect to management control.  All further details and you will certainly understand we would want to highlight once we have come to a conclusion and to a decision with the Greek government.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the 3G rollout, if we take a midterm view by mid of '09, we're talking about 150 million POPs roughly, that's the objective, approximately two-thirds of our covered POPs within the next 12 to 18 months.  So, for us quite an aggressive rollout.  The main gauging factor in terms of commercial launch has been the spectrum clearance process which has taken a little longer than initially anticipated.  That refers mainly to the government users and the 1.7 gigahertz band.  But after some initial delay we are now making good progress with relocating these users to other spectrum bands and by the fourth quarter this year we plan to cover approximately 20 to 25 core markets amongst others, Austin, Las Vegas, Miami, Dallas, Chicago and so forth.  I can go through this, but I don't think it would be too much at this point in time.  So, about 150 million POPs by the mid of '09 is the plan.</p>

          <p>Mr. Ulrich Rathe from Dresdner Kleinwort, may we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, I have two questions.  One is some time now since you first gave the 2008 guidance and since then obviously the FX has moved against you as you highlighted, but you maintained the guidance.  So, my question is this, has there been a major shift around in your own sort of planning to reach that guidance or is it that the operating divisions concerned have done operationally better?  And specifically sort of tied to that, would you just &#x2013; just wondering how you control this.  Would you be willing for example to sacrifice market invest in Germany for example in IPTV just to offset weaknesses through translation effects in the US just to make the 19.3 billion for the year, or is this really something that you separate from each other from a control perspective?</p>
          <p>The second question regards SunCom.  As a clarification you said some time ago I think that the EBITDA contribution from SunCom for 2008 would be offset by the integration costs, which you included in adjusted EBITDA.  Could you give us a bit of a gauge how large these integration costs are turning out to be now that you're sort of into the project?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah let me try and answer the first one.  I think the answer is, it's a combination of both, aggressive cost-cutting in all cost items, particularly on the home side because this is where we have the largest potential still.  Mobile is more efficient and Home is less efficient.  So we have an aggressive plan there continued in place, and teams are working in detail really to accelerate.  Also that applies to the T-Systems side and to the, what we call GHS, all the central functions where there is still lot of saving potential.  So that helped, and yes a very disciplined management on SAC, SRC will be applied as well, will be sacrificed.</p>
          <p>In reality since I'm in this company since ten years there is always to be found the right balance on a yearly basis and you steer and manage the business throughout the year and the priorities have to be weighed against each other.  This year, it's a very high priority for us again like last year to accomplish the guidance, not to disappoint you in the market and therefore the answer is if we need to sacrifice a little bit of SACs and SRCs, yes we will.  Will it be drastic, dramatic? I actually don't think so because the SAC and SRC budgets are several billion euros per year and there is quite a bit of room to steer, and I don't want to go into anymore details.  But usually initially you think, oh this could impact the growth significantly.  And then after all it's not coming in as bad as it seemed.  So, we would sacrifice a little bit of SAC, SRC.  I don't think it would be overly dramatic to the business, according to my experience of the last many years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when it comes to the EBITDA contribution out of SunCom I think what we could expect is a positive EBITDA contribution in '08 including integration costs, i.e., after integration costs of up to &#x20AC;100 million. And the total size of integration costs I think is difficult to highlight at the end of the day.  Clearly this will go away next year as a consequence of that EBITDA contribution, next year it is going to be nicely higher.  But I think for this year we could expect a positive EBITDA contribution, all together of up to 100 million.</p>

          <p>Mr. Peter Nielsen Peter-Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux may we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much.  Two questions please Peter-Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux.  Firstly, could you comment a bit on how you see your performance in the UK Mobile market in this quarter intake versus margin performance and whether the sort of margin performance compared to the previous three quarters we should see that as indicative of what we can expect for the remainder of the year.  And just second question one of your targets for this year has obviously been 3 million subscriber additions in the US, given your performance in Q1 would you say that you are now setting your sights higher than that?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The UK obviously it's a tough, very competitive market, that's reality.  After the good performance in 2007 we saw some further improvements in the financial trends, but in local currency compared to the position in the first quarter last year.  Total revenues grew only by about 2.6% in Q1 year-on-year which is in line with overall market growth of between 3 and 5%; it's now at &#x20A4;723 million.  Adjusted EBITDA increased however by 16% year-on-year to &#x20A4;147 million; that is quite good.  And this massive EBITDA improvement clearly highlights that we are disciplined on profitable growth.  Particularly in mobile when the penetration is so high and therefore also that relates to the first question would we sacrifice SAC, SRC.  To be very honest sometimes it's a little pressure even is good to manage it very disciplined and to really steer the budgets and the resources such that your growth is more profitable and really turn the dollar twice before you spend it, that's helpful.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA margin was up by 2.5%, at 21.7% in Q1 compared to the first quarter last year.  And the weakness in Q1 revenue performance does reflect the development of decreasing sales growth in the second half of 2007.  That is true.  But that was by design as T-Mobile UK led the market in 2007 in all major financial performance metrics on a year on year basis and also relative to our competitors.</p>
          <p>So revenue growth bottom line is expected to increase in the course of the year as some higher market spendings from Q1 will translate in higher revenues.  So let's see, I think we can improve revenue growth in the course of the year, as we've been a bit more aggressive.  If you recall previous conversations of one year, two years ago, it's basically what I've always said that we are a little opportunistic in the UK going in for a period with more aggressive, using windows of opportunity given the overall market structure that seemed always the right strategy and if you see the overall trends, what we've done in the last 2, 3 years, it worked.</p>
          <p>US, no new guidance, no new guidance.  It's what I should say is that it looks probably a little conservative at the moment but as of today, no new guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  A couple of questions on German mobile.  On the contract usage side, I think you said the contract usage per customer's up 6% in Q1, that looks like it's down from about 10% growth in 2007, so I'm just wondering what you're explanation was for that slow down in usage?  And second, can you just say how many customers you've got on Congstar in Germany at the end of the quarter, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My short explanation on the MOU, there is an improvement in contract MOU per customer that we saw in previous quarters.  But I think we will see a elasticity of higher than one.  It will take some time before we see that.  There is a particular effect because of the higher share of resellers, and they also use their tariff buckets I think to optimize a little bit.  So, it's also an effect of the mix of retail versus resale customers, so that has to be taken into account.</p>
          <p>Overall I think we'll still see continued increase in minutes of use given the elasticity gradually kicking in.  On Congstar, it's slightly beyond 300,000, of which a good part almost two-thirds is prepay, but that's pretty much what they were targeted to do to break into that market segment, which the sort of the established legacy brand is not so credible, not so attractive appealing for and they are doing well there.  So, it's almost 200,000 in prepay and all together now beyond 300,000 about 315,000.  That's Congstar.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just to understand the trend in domestic wireline a little bit better.  I believe there was an overhang of unbundled lines waiting to be delivered at the end of last year and that you started to deliver the 340,000 gross a month on a voluntary basis from the start of the year.  Just wanted a confirmation of that and what you think the size of the overhang was that was cleared during Q1, please?  And secondly in the States, I wondered if you had a feel for how many, what percent of your net adds came from Sprint over let's say '08, or for '07, or the last 12 months, whichever you prefer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Justin, this is Ren&#xE9; speaking.  The overhang was not so significance.  There was a lot of complaining, a lot of noise about the time delay because of competitors had ordered less than they then on a short-term notice wanted, but I think we have improved the delivery speeds, but I don't think the overhang was all that significant.  And I think it's more or less done now, the complaints are being off the table and I think the regulator today issued a press statement, if I have seen the latest news correctly that, there is no longer an investigation against us for the abuse or misuse of market power, which of course never was the case because we've always delivered extremely fast and good to our competitors.  So there was no reason to complain in the first place and now even the regulator got that message.  Sprint number portability seems higher in our favor, highly in our favor.  About the ratio is about 3 to 4 customers coming in for every customer going out, so it seems highly in our favor, that's what we can say.  And overall number of Sprint how many came in, I can't comment on that.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon.  First question on cash flow, just wondering if you can update us on how we should think about cash tax.  What were capital restructuring charges for this year, and anything you can say about trends in those for '09 as well.  And then the second question on OTE, there seems to be quite a bit of press coverage of the unions' reaction to your interest.  I was just kind of wondering whether that's taken you by surprise, if you think it's a temporary issue, and if you have actually started to engage with the unions at all to kind of resolve any concerns they might have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take this one with respect to OTE and also with respect to cash flow.  Well, I think one should not overdo the reaction of the unions or the employee representatives.  That's perhaps also something which is a little bit typical for the southern part or the southeastern part of Europe.  Yeah, certainly we did not have the opportunity so far to talk to the union, union representatives directly because as long as we don't come to an agreement about the shareholders' agreement between shareholders, I think we are not in a situation to talk before hand to the union representatives or to the employee representatives of the company.  But, I think we should not overdo the reaction and if we would have come to a transaction on that basis we would clearly start talking to both parties and then after a certain while I think this kind of pain will ease over the time.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to taxes, I think what we have seen in the first quarter in the P&amp;L we could also take as a run rate for full year.  This would then lead to approximately a P&amp;L charge of up to &#x20AC;2 billion and with respect to cash taxes I think one could make the same assumption and the same calculation, which would lead us to a cash tax outflow of between 0.7 and &#x20AC;1.0 billion for full year.</p>
          <p>CapEx expenditure, yeah CapEx expenditure also with respect to cash flow, we have already said that it can be slightly higher than the level of '07.  We all know that we are running into the second year of our VDSL rollout in Germany and we also have made it clear that we do want to improve the quality of our 3G network in the US.  The breakdown of the CapEx is not going to be significantly different to what we have seen in the year before, but this all has to be managed with respect to operational performance in order to meet our free cash flow guidance for full year at the end of '08.  Restructuring charge was another question, it could be around &#x20AC;1 billion for '08.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Hello, I had a question about a couple of the smaller markets, looking at the Netherlands especially despite acquiring Orange a year ago, you've basically got flat EBITDA and the experience of consolidating Austria as well I guess has perhaps been a little bit disappointing.  Can you expand a bit on the results of those two markets and how you think they are going to develop and whether the experience of the Netherlands and Austria has changed your view on synergies at all?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the data side, some encouraging stats for the Group but in absolute terms data is not growing at all in Germany in euro terms.  Can you talk a little bit about why that might be?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me start with the question on the Netherlands.  Revenue is up 44% year-on -year to the first time consolidation effect.  And service revenue up as well, 42%.  The adjusted EBITDA is up &#x2013; is at 62 million and Orange Netherlands had a lower double-digit effect there.  EBITDA margin is at &#x2013; is 6.3% up.  So which clearly shows there are these scale effects through the integration but also bear in mind it's still pretty early in the integration process.  We've only closed it I don't know off the top of my head when last year, but last year and we're not in the second or third quarter of integration.  So, there's, the networks have to be integrated, the sales organization, shops et cetera.</p>
          <p>No there is clearly an inter-country synergy particularly on the network operations, on the distribution, sales, branding, et cetera and fundamentally my view hasn't changed.  But it's always to be seen in the light of what the overall market looks like, how competitive the overall market is and how competitive the pricing is and so forth.  But the relative position has improved, and we're also seeing some of these effects that does apply to Austria after all.  But Austria is a totally aggressive market.  Pricing is below fixed line and minutes of use are extremely high, prices are very aggressively low.  And therefore don't compare it with -- if the market had been the same, you would see a much more visible effect of these integrations and of the synergies, but some of that is obfuscated by or overshadowed by the fact that the markets have become extremely aggressive, some of that.  So, nonetheless I still stick to the story, I see it in practice everyday since years, it is working.</p>
          <p>Data, let me check in Germany what the total number looks like.  No that's Austria, the data story.  Data overall is growing.  Let me just check on Germany.  Non-voice without messaging is about the same.  You're right it's 100 &#x2013; no it has increased, sorry it &#x2013; in 2007 Q1, it was 97 million and this is non-voice, non-messaging.  And now it's 125, so there is a significant increase on the non-voice non-messaging, but I think there is some pressure on SMS pricing and therefore that may have overshadowed the total.</p>
          <p>The total is let me check that comparing, it is also slightly up, but total including SMS is not strongly as it's only 15 million or so higher than previous year.  And that pretty much has to do with SMS buckets and prices have come down significantly, but the non-voice non-SMS is growing as reported about 30 something percent.</p>

          <p>Mr. Frank Rothauge from Sal. Oppenheim, may we have your question please?</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi it's Frank Rothauge.  I have a quick question on value-added services in particular with respect to broadband.  One of your domestic competitors United Internet explained when they were asked about their rather high profitability in domestic broadband that they achieved that by selling much more Internet value added services than their competitors.  Do you feel that you fully exploit the opportunity, what more can you do in this respect and wouldn't it be worthwhile to show the development of your Internet platforms and assets better to investors?  Because you are aware that valuation of these assets in the markets are higher than those of Telekom's assets.  And in this respect can you also give some idea as to how value added services in connection to IPTV develop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Rothauge, you would need to help me a little bit on what kind of value added services in broadband you mean.  But before I come to that, United Internet's model is as far as I know and I'm not authorized to speak on behalf of United Internet, but they have a very strong hosting business where the incremental costs for additional hosting are very limited and their margins are extremely good.  But in terms of DSL resale, I think it's pretty straightforward actually that their margin is being mostly derived out of the margin they accomplished through retail prices minus what they pay for, but maybe you can help me with what kind of value added services you mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hosting is just one service issue, but also the rate of for example antivirus products, advertising you generate with the portals, for example United Internet invests a lot of for increasing advertising revenues by attracting their broadband subscriber base and profiling and to raise the return they get from advertisers.  Do you also develop things like that?  Maybe you could...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes we do.  I mean let me try and jump in here.  I'll give you a few examples where we are in terms of either verticals or in terms of value added services.  We have a couple of verticals such as Immo Scout, AutoScout, the Scout group is one of the strong verticals which also has very nice growth numbers, very strong growth, a very attractive asset.  Then we do music load, games load, video load, software load these are the verticals we have &#x2013; we are developing value added services in our product house for the group both for mobile and fixed.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; I wish I could give you an answer on the where we would compare with regard to the profiling and advertisement revenues, because I think that's an interesting point you are raising there.  Forgive me for not having the numbers out of top of my head.  We also have an activity interactive media services in our Group which is quite strong and quite successful, but I can't give you the details, because from my perspective it's just a small activity in the total group, but it is an attractive small activity.  I just don't have the numbers off the top of my head.</p>
          <p>Other than that I could say that IPTV entertain customers now.  I think we have sold about 200,000 and about some 160,000 or so connected, 155,000 connected by now delivered and connected.  That's up about 40,000 in the last couple of months.  We have introduced attractive pricing in April, so there is more momentum now behind it.  We needed to do something about that.  About 30% of these customers now use also the video on-demand service, not just their increased broadband and TV service and so forth, but really video on-demand.  I think there we are leading the market.  40% have at least one pay-TV package.  So, not sure whether that answers your question, but we have a number of activities on the value-added service/content management side and the verticals as I just mentioned and the Immo Scout group and we are not stopping there of course.  So, we're agile, but not sure whether that compares well to United Internet.  I greatly respect that company.  I think they're doing a good job.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon.  So, my one question would be in T-Mobile, there is a pretty significant positive swing in the reconciliation line or the headquarter cost line which is roughly about 45 million not withstanding contributions from Montenegro.  Could you please explain the nature of that?  That's in the adjusted EBITDA?</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, good afternoon.  So my question is in March you gave a guidance for the domestic BBFN business of minus 5 to minus 8% in EBITDA.  Now in the first quarter you showed actually plus 0.5% year-on-year.  So, how realistic you believe this guidance still is?  Thank you and yeah that's the question.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we have said I think we have given guidance for full year.  Now what we have seen is a good line and a strong performance in the first quarter but that's I think not strong enough and not good enough to change the guidance for full year.  I think one also has to keep in mind that in the first quarter '07 this was impacted by the introduction of bundled product in November '06.  Therefore, we have seen higher OpEx in the first quarter of '07 and what we are certainly also going to see is some more market investment in the upcoming quarters in BBFN and as a consequence of that I think it would be just premature to increase our guidance for BBFN.  Yes as I have highlighted in my speech, these cost savings of 0.1 billion for full year could be a little bit conservative but again it would be premature to change guidance for full year now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our rating targets are unchanged now for a very long period of time.  We have always made it clear that we do have to have a permanent access and a strong access to the rate capital markets.  This certainly translates into a A minus or a BBB plus rating category.  That's where we do want to be and for that we also have highlighted that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio should be always between 2 and 3.  I think that's what we have as a credit rating target.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Just coming back to Obermann's comment about risk adjusted return on capital.  Have you been allowed to do any due diligence at OTE?  And also what's really your assessment of the competitive and the regulatory environment there?  And might you have in the same vein, might you have had a chance to confirm your initial estimate of about 2 billion synergy benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the synergy benefits we are expecting the number is unchanged, but certainly there will be more details once we have been in a position to make a more in-depth analysis together with the OTE management.  And due diligence fair question, yes, we have made some management due diligence.  We are right now in the process to go more deeply into the due diligence process in light of the progress.</p>
          <p>We are doing, there is significant more insight, and in addition to that what we are doing right now, I think one has to say that OTE is a publicly listed company in the US.  And if you look into the 20-F and in the statements which the company has released for the US authorities there is very many nice details, everybody can find it's also true for us.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  I have a quick follow-up on the IPTV thing that Frank already raised.  The question is here, have you seen the momentum increasing in the last months and if yes what do you think was the reason, and if not, what do you think will change this?  And if you could quickly remind me of your full year &#x2013; end year target of IPTV customers and if you have considered including this line in the reporting of the fixed line segments like some of your peers do?</p>
          <p>And another question on the figures, if you look at T-Systems, we all have seen it was kind of weak performance on a reported basis, what do you think will be the most successful restructuring measure there, what brings the most benefits and can we already see a quarter-on-quarter pickup in the second quarter of the adjusted EBITDA of T-Systems?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as far as IPTV the package changes came into effect in April announced at CeBIT.  So, clearly that's only a few weeks and it's just too early to give here some details.  Let us do that in the course of second quarter reporting.</p>
          <p>Clearly we are doing a lot on the network buildout, and it's one of the preconditions is the availability and by mid of this year about I think about 18 to 19 million of households will be able to use that either via VDSL or ADSL2+.  So that also is one of the preconditions.  The customer satisfaction though is good on the new product because the UI is very easy to use.  It's stable.  It's improved in its features, and I can only repeat what I believe out of my own experience and I'm a critical user myself.  It's become a pretty mature product, a good product, easy to use, and it's very customer-friendly.</p>
          <p>So I think we still need to do a lot educational work on the market, because I think from the customer point-of-view many customers still are a little shy to use it because the suspected technical complexity which is not the case anymore but also because they don't know that it's all in one.  And that they can actually cancel their existing cable contract for instance.  So I think a lot of basics haven't been yet understood by the market, there is a lot of more education to be done.  But we keep pushing and we keep going here.</p>
          <p>And then you had a question on T-Systems.  I think the big part of T-Systems was because of internal revenues as well.  But let me hand over to Karl because he has some more details there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I tried to make clear in my speech that there was significant movements out of reallocation inside of DT and you have certainly realized.  I also have made it clear I'll try to at least to make it clear that on an adjusted basis by these effects we have seen a nice improvement the first quarter in comparison with this last year.  There is clearly there is strong improvement.  We do hope that this improvement can go on.</p>
          <p>We know that there is also in T-Systems a high price pressure, specifically in Germany where we have the major part of our business.  That's why this international revenue development is of high importance and there we see good progress.  But let me also make it clear that we have given long-term guidance with respect to profitability and EBITDA and EBITDA margin of T-Systems until 2010 and I think it would be just wrong now to try to enter into a quarterly guidance with respect to profitability.  That's I think something we should not start doing.  I hope that we see another further improvement and perhaps we can now stabilize the business in the course of this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  Just a follow-up question from the free cash flows, so there was a significant improvement of the working capital in Q1.  I wanted to know if you expect to keep the same performance over the year, or if there will be some differences in DT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this free cash flow improvement very heavily supported by working capital, yes it's true.  We only have seen a slight increase of working capital this year in comparison with the year before.  The year before there was some special effects in '06 which has led to this increase of working capital in the first quarter of '07 which was not to be seen in this year.  I think to expect a continuation of such positive working capital improvements would be a little bit aggressive.  But what we will certainly continue doing is more improvements with, in this regard in order to meet finally our free cash flow guidance which we have given for full year.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much, good afternoon gentlemen.  Brief question on your broadband business in Germany.  Looking at your numbers in the first quarter we've seen a strong growth in subscribers, but the revenues are hardly flat now, slightly down to first quarter, so I suppose that this is due to continuous negative trend in prices in the first quarter and I was just wondering if these are trends we should expect for the next three quarters, the next rest of the year, and, that's basically all, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, the guidance for the full year on the home side is between 6 and &#x2013; sorry between 4 and 6%.  Oh God, no mistake here again, between 4 and 6% that's unchanged.  I think the major contributor to the slight decrease in revenue would still be on the line loss side &#x2013; on the PSTN line loss side, and more migration to bundled product.  So there is less revenues from variable revenues more towards the bundles.  So, just to reiterate the guidance, we are of course working hard to improve that, but so far the guidance is unchanged.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good afternoon.  My question would be concerning T-Systems, is there some more headroom in the Save for Service program which we might hope for to see in '08 and '09 maybe going forward.  So, did you leave some headroom there for maybe some continuing pricing pressure, and is this pricing pressure going to be more intense than in '07 or actually coming down a little bit?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again there is no change in guidance which is true with respect to the EBITDA of the Systems but also true for the long term guidance we've given for our cost cutting program Save for Service.  Clearly, cost cutting Save for Service all together also includes T-Systems in Germany, and yes if we look into the margin developments and EBITDA improvement of T-Systems it has to be strong supported by cost efficiencies.  But, there is I think not too much more we could add here.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentlemen.  One view from your quarter results and probably one view from the last five years is that profitable growth as a strategy doesn't actually achieve very much.  So, in that regard, why don't you invest &#x20AC;2.5 billion in your domestic business, trying to actually restimulate that for once rather than actually buying a stake in OTE?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Guy I'm not sure whether you mean the mobile part or the fixed line part.  Let me start with the fixed line part.  Let's assume we were to significantly increase for instance investments in the network and so.  The overall equation wouldn't look better I think it would look worse because after all we're regulated here and whatever we do we will be subject to regulation particularly on the fixed line side.  And in Mobile, we keep our share fairly high.  We keep our market leadership that's a good position to be in and if we were to be the sort of the price leaders in the market it would probably cause as an effect is that the overall market there goes down further.</p>
          <p>So, what we should do is start following to the extent that customer see no reason for leaving us.  I think I agree with you on that one, I don't think we should be even more aggressive on the mobile side than we are and on the fixed line side if we were to invest more money you would probably complain then about low returns and insufficient returns because of regulations.  So, I think our strategy for the German market is right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also to put it into perspective if I may add that I think we are already heavily investing in Germany.  This is true for wireline as well for wireless.  I think there is not too much more we could do in CapEx spending as long as we do want to justify everything with our return.  And we are strongly investing into restructuring at our German business, which is also something one should not underestimate.  That all together I'm saying we are strong investing in Germany and there is not too much more we can do especially when it comes to inorganic things.  I think in Germany we would not be allowed to do anything inorganically at all.  So, with all due respect there is no limitation to good investments in Germany.</p>

      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello the question regarding the OTE deal, you mentioned earlier on the call that it was going to require a substantial amount of management time going forward when you run the business.  Yet your shareholders are only going to receive 25% of the economic benefit of your hard work.  I was wondering if you felt happy with that balance, and with that in mind what would be your willingness and your ability to be able to increase your stake in OTE in the medium term?  If I have time for a quick second question, I noticed you had the best service revenue performance in Germany you've had in the last eight quarters.  Is this an indication of better times to come in German mobile, or is this more of a blip and the declines could get worse going through the year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start again with OTE.  I think the first purpose, but I do not want to go into details today already.  The first purpose of the total exercise is to buy what we can buy from a significant stake in order to get management control.  That's why we are looking for this kind of shareholder agreement with the Greek government.  That's the purpose of today.  Yes, you're right.  We will certainly invest some significant management capacity in order to also further improve the quality of the business, but more than that I think I would not want to say today about our discussion points also with respect to our stake in the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the German mobile market, and by the way that applies to other European markets as well.  The opportunity is a further increase in non-voice, non-SMS, as non-messaging data, because of network build-out and more and more equipment coming and services being really usable now via mobile access.  So that is to me always and has been for quite sometime a strong upside potential, and I still more so than ever believe that the mobile Internet is going to be the key driver of growth, and for instance with 3.8 million web'n'walk users now, that's a very good trend.</p>
          <p>Data volume, throughput volume is increasing strongly.  So, I think that's an upside potential.  MOUs for voice are still not satisfying I find.  There is untapped voice potential with more and more over time at least more and more fixed mobile substitution for voice.  So, as I think on the minutes of use and ARPU side for voice there is also room for improvement.  So interpret how you want this to interpret, I'm not making any new guidance, I'm saying data is an opportunity and minutes of use also they can go up further in the future.</p>

          <p>Let me start with this inactivity question, because that's a good one.  In prepaid, the policy of deactivation had to change because of customers who have still credit on their prepaid account couldn't &#x2013; the SIMs couldn't get deactivated.  So, the real inactivity relative to the reported number of SIMs is increasing and it makes more sense to look at overall revenues for prepay and for contract rather than for prepay ARPU for instance because that is distorted by the inactivity rate.  So, that's growing.  I'm not giving you a detailed percentage number.  First of all, I don't know it off the top of my head but also I don't think we've reported that number in the past.  Total value added service volume for BBFN domestic, I can hand over to Karl.</p>

          <p>Well, I think this would be also a little bit premature here to give more details.  I think we are today not ready to give such more guidance.  I think perhaps at the end of the year we will split it up, but not for today please.</p>

          <p>Okay.  Just a question on the guidance 2008 domestic fixed line.  I'm going back to your Investor Day on the 19 of March.  You were saying that you were seeing EBITDA decline by 5 to 8%, but in order to achieve that you need to have net OpEx savings of &#x20AC;560 million if we take the midpoint.  At that time, you were speaking about net achievable savings of &#x20AC;100 million.  So, I wonder if you could come back on that and give us, give me some explanation on how you are going to fill in the gap of something like &#x20AC;460 million of net OpEx savings you need to find which were not detailed.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know whether I understood the question correctly, but first and foremost, I think the EBITDA and the revenue guidance for BBFN is unchanged.  We have confirmed it today.  EBITDA declined between 5 and 8%, and the revenue declined between 4 and 6%.  And when it comes to the question about OpEx savings, we &#x2013; I thought we guided that for full year we would expect 100 million OpEx savings in order to come to that EBITDA guidance.  Net, we have seen a nice over-performance to that in Q1, because in Q1 it was net 0.3.  I also have made it clear that this had a special effect in the first quarter of last year as the period of comparison.  And also I have said that we could expect some more market investments in the upcoming quarters, that's why again for full year I'm not expecting significantly more than this 100 million OpEx savings, it could be a little bit conservative.</p>
