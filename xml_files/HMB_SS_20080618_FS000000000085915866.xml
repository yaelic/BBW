          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H&amp;M Half Year Report Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  I would now like to hand over to today's chairperson, Nils Vinge, Head of Investor Relations.  Please begin your meeting sir and I'll be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's second quarter results.  You'll find the slides we'll use during the presentation on our website, hm.com.  With me is our CFO, Leif Persson, and we're happy to answer your questions after the presentation. Please turn to the slide, First Half-Year 2008.</p>
          <p>Sales excluding VAT increased 12% to 41.4 billion Swedish kronor.  The increase in local currencies was 12% while comparable unit sales increased 1%.</p>
          <p>The gross result was more than 25 billion, which corresponds to a gross margin of 61.3% compared to last year's 60.3%.  The operating profit was almost 9 billion and the operating margin was 21.7%.  The result after financial items increased 11% to 9.5 billion, net profit went up 19% to 6.9 billion.</p>
          <p>During the first half year, we opened 59 stores and closed 8.  In May, 7 Weekday-stores and 13 Monki-stores were added as the acquisition of Fabric Scandinavien was finalized.  In total, there were almost 1600 stores at the end of the period.</p>
          <p>Looking at the second quarter, we have experienced a period with two weak sales months and one very strong.  March and April stood out with significantly colder weather than last year in several of our markets.  As soon as the warmer weather arrived in the beginning of May, the negative sales trend reversed.  Sales in May increased 25% in local currencies and 14% in comparable units. Of the increase, calendar effects contributed around 3 to 4 percentage units compared to the same month last year.</p>
          <p>Sales excluding VAT in the second quarter increased 8% to 21.6 billion.  The increase in local currencies was 9% and in comparable units, sales decreased by 2%.  The gross margin was 62.9% compared to 61.6% in the same period last year.  Gross margin was affected by lower buying expenses due to the favorable U.S. dollar exchange rate, which was partly offset by a higher level of price reductions and increased transportation costs.  The operating profit was 5.2 billion, corresponding to an operating margin of 23.9%.  Profit after financial items increased by 6% to 5.4 billion and the net profit increased 14% to 3.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Having looked at the financial results, let's take a moment to talk about the activities behind the figures.  During the quarter, we have continued to develop the new initiatives started last year.  Internet and catalog sales continue to do well.  Catalog sales in Germany and Austria, launched in the beginning of the year, have been successful, attracting many new customers.</p>
          <p>Sales of our shoes have developed strongly as have the new markets we entered last year.  We continue to develop the store chain, COS. During the second quarter, our COS store was opened in Cologne in Germany.</p>
          <p>One of the quarter's major events was the acquisition of 60% of Fabric Scandinavien.  Fabric owns and operates the store chains Weekday and Monki and the brand Cheap Monday. Just like for COS, Fabric's stores and concepts will be developed independently from the H&amp;M brand.</p>
          <p>However, Fabric gets access to our powerful organization within production, establishment and logistics, which makes it possible for Fabric to expand at a faster pace than what would otherwise be possible.  We see great potential in developing the stores and concepts in other markets.  At the same time, we've strengthened H&amp;M's position in an interesting and fast growing segment.</p>
          <p>The collections were well received in our markets and we have seen great swings in sales growth during the first half year.  December sales were okay and sales in January, February and May were very strong while sales in March and April were really weak.  This emphasizes the importance of evaluating sales every season not just in a month. In Germany, sales have developed well in a slow market.  The launch of catalog sales in Germany and Austria in the beginning of the year has started off very well, so far reaching our highly set expectations.  Activity throughout the rest of the year remains high with a great number of store openings and many refurbished stores.</p>
          <p>Sales in Sweden, as in the other Nordic countries, developed nicely in the first six months.  Southern Europe is another interesting region.  We continue to build our presence here.  Spain, France and Italy are markets where we plan to open a great number of stores during the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>In UK, where weak retail sales in general have affected H&amp;M as well as the market, sales increased 8% in local currencies at the same time as we opened 10 new stores and closed 2.  In China, we had a fantastic journey so far.  We have four stores in Hong Kong and three in Shanghai, and we are currently looking at several attractive store locations, and two new contracts in Shanghai are already signed with planned openings this autumn.  We are also pleased with the progress of the franchise stores in Middle East.</p>
          <p>Looking at some key figures.  The stock-in-trade increased 10% to 7.1 billion. In relation to sales, it was 8.5%.  In the perspective of the last few years, this is a very good level.  Our efficient and flexible buying model is reflected in the stock-in-trade, which is well composed and at a good level.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from current operations was slightly higher than last year at 7.7 billion. Investments were 1.9 billion, reflecting new stores and markets and the ongoing regionalization of the store logistics.  Liquid funds and short-term investments were 14.5 billion, mainly reflecting the dividend payout of 11.6 billion. Return on equity was further strengthened to 56.9%.</p>
          <p>The H&amp;M Group's expansion is realized to new stores, new markets, new customer offerings and new sales channels.  The level of activity in the second half of the year will be high with an unusually large proportion of store openings.  In terms of openings, the peak is in Q4.  Already in September, we opened our first store in Ginza in Tokyo, Japan.  In connection with the opening of our second store in Tokyo, at the beginning of November, this autumn's guest designer collection at H&amp;M Comme des Gar&#xE7;ons by Rei Kawakubo will be launched.</p>
          <p>Rei Kawakubo is one of the world's most respected creators and a suitable choice for our launch in Japan.  She will design a limited women's and men's collection for H&amp;M.  The collaboration will present our customers with modern, emerging and artistic fashion.  We see great potential for H&amp;M in Japan with its large and fashion conscious population.</p>
          <p>In June, the first franchise store in Egypt was opened in Cairo.  The reception was fantastic and during the autumn, franchise sales started in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.  We planned a net increase of the store count by around 140 stores during the second half of the year, mainly in Germany, USA, Spain, France and Italy.</p>
          <p>Shoe sales continue to do well.  Our customers have really appreciated the possibility to buy matching shoes.  Our Organic Cotton initiative has been successful and appreciated which achieves more than 3,000 tons on organically cultivated cotton in 2008 compared to 1,300 tons in 2007.  We continue to develop the store chain costs and expansion proceeds as planned and the launch of the home textile range, H&amp;M Home, scheduled for the turn of the year.</p>
          <p>This autumn a new trend collection for men will be launched for the trendiest.  The collection will sell in selected stores starting from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>To conclude, our aim is to increase sales with maintained profitability.  Our international expansion continues.  In total, we expect a net addition of 190 new stores in 2008 plus Fabric Scandinavien's stores.  And as always, we strive to continue developing our customer offerings with new collections, new concepts and new products.  We're really looking forward to an exciting autumn.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention.  And we're now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen, Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon&gt;</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wonder if you could give us an update on where you are in terms of the logistics infrastructure project in terms of what you are opening warehouse wise this year and next year and the year after, just so we some sort of sense of how it's going to impact on cost particularly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we already opened the Polish one serving Eastern European part plus the mail order business. This year we are -- or as we speak, we are tuning up the second one in Hamburg and that one will run parallel to the already existing colors which it eventually will replace. So there are some investments coming from that one.  Looking forward, we will open a third one in a year or two, and that's it as we see it now. Eventually, there will be a fourth one, but that will probably take four or five, six years or something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it a year or is it two years, or is it sort of on the borderline of those two, and <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no final date -- we will see costs coming for the next two years, the investments and then we'll also -- in this transition period, there will also be somewhat higher costs on the logistics, which we, again, for the future see a good benefit of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And where is the third one, sorry, that's going to open in a year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Third one, we haven't published yet where it will be, but it will serve the Western and Southern European countries.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kindreich.  Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Adam Kindreich from Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch in Geneva.  I had a question on the currency impact, because it seems at the sales level, currency has hardly any impact, certainly a slightly negative impact in Q2.  But if you look at the bottom of page two, there seems to be quite a big impact on the result before tax, sort of 400 million swing relative to 8.5 billion Swedish kronor, which is about 5%. So how come you've got such a positive impact from currencies on the result before tax whilst there is hardly any impact on sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a -- could we do this like this? Could we look at this now and then get back to your question and take the next question now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that okay for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Our next question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain. Please go ahead, announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  It's JPMorgan.  A couple of questions actually. Just the first one is you mentioned an increase in transportation costs in the statement, I just wondered if you could clarify whether you expect that cost issue to remain the same or maybe to get worse in coming quarters or certainly for the rest of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just talk about the transportation cost. It's of course -- part of that cost is for oil prices that has, as we all know, have increased. And to comment about the future, it's very difficult for me to say of course, but that's just one of the costs of course.  And then the transport also has to do with supply and demand in different transportation legs, and that's very difficult to say anything about. But we felt it was worth mentioning in the last few quarters, because there is definitely a transportation cost increase that affects the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay.  Also, just I had a question on Weekday. Am I right in saying that you've opened or you plan to open in Copenhagen in Denmark? And if so, I know it's obviously very early days, but what kind of customer feedback have you had -- or you could see towards the store so far? What kind of reception do you expect that brand to get in Denmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.  We have opened one store in Denmark. I think it's three or four weeks old now, and the feedback that we get from the people within Fabric Scandinavien is that it has been well received. We haven't -- none of us have been looking very closely at that one; I'm very sorry about that.  It is still very early days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor.  Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, UBS.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question please on mail order.  I mean you've got a well established business in the Nordic region obviously, so you're pleased with the way it has started in other countries.  I just wondered if you can give us an idea about the, if you like, the profitability of that business. I mean in terms of logistics and in terms of returns, handling and so on, how do you find that in terms of sort of net profitability relative to the retail business? I understand, though, that there may be some development costs in at the moment. But generally speaking, how do you expect that to pan out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have already commented that it's in line with retail operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is including the extra sort of logistics, the ramp up cost and things or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely, of course, yes, it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations.  On the gross margin, you don't mention sourcing as a positive input this time around. Can you just explain why that's the case? Is it now neutral or are you expecting possibly, it might be a bit of negative later in the later?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I didn't really understand your question because it's a bad line. Could you repeat it slowly please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry. In the past, you have mentioned sourcing as a positive impact on the gross margin, which you haven't this time around.  I was wondering, was its influence on the gross margin neutral? Do you expect it to go negative later in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The improvements which we have been doing in the buying or sales and in our projection when it comes to the sourcing part, that improvement we have already seen as we plan of course not to lose any of that activity. But it does not really help us to boost the gross margin this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Our next question comes from the line of Luca Solca. Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm from Bernstein in London. A question on divided as a standalone format. Are you satisfied with how it's trading and are you planning any further deployment just down the road? And if I may add another question on the -- just sort of building on what was asked before. What kind of sourcing environment are you finding especially in Asia?  Do you -- are you actually finding that you actually have more cost inflation coming from -- faster cost inflation in countries such as China? Are you starting to get the benefit of weaker export volumes through the U.S. from Chinese manufacturers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we take the first question about the dividing concept, as we said, on the last telephone call, first, we are very pleased with the development of that concept. But we also do see that this is an integral part of the H&amp;M family. So we think it fits best into the family. So of course, there will be some standalone stores, but not very many because it's simply part of the family. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question about the sourcing, it's -- that is very interesting because we gain a lot from the U.S. dollar of course. But when it comes to the sourcing in China, the Renminbi has not depreciated as much against the Swedish kronor and the euro as the dollar has. So, of course, this drive for price inflation in China. But we see that more as a sell-in because that is something which really hit everybody who is trading with China. So we simply have to be a bit better in negotiating that. I don't know if that answers your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, it's Anne Critchlow from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I have a question on China first of all, and the sales per store in China seem to be almost double the average for H&amp;M and -- is other stores on average larger in China, much larger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The average stores in China, since it's a start up of China now, we are very, let's say, we are building some rather big stores, probably a bit bigger than they will be in the future. So they are a bit bigger, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, SEB Enskilda. I just want to speak a little bit about the SG&amp;A development. And in particular, I mean we've seen SG&amp;A increasing quite substantially more than sales in this quarter in particular. And I was wondering, could you give us any idea how -- to what extent your sort of store refurbishment program is coming to an end or not and give us any idea of what you expect from the SG&amp;A level for the remainder of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the store refurbishment program, it will never come to an end I hope because that is a very important part of our business to refurbish our stores. And as Rolf said this morning in the press conference, this is probably a more normal level this year than it was years ago. So that was your first question. Second question was regarding operating costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly, operating costs in light of your sort of expansions, what you expect? Do you think that we've seen relatively high expansion-related costs in the first half of this year as opposed to what we should expect for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very difficult to say, but of course, I mean the top line in the first, especially the second quarter, wasn't as we had expected and then of course -- I mean we continue to -- we are strengthening the organization for future growth and expenses have developed in line with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can maybe then add also that we have a 14% increase on the cost side in this quarter compared to last year, and last year was quite low. So this is something which really follows us, to be quite frank</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. It's Lehman Brothers in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions. First of all, could you comment on the developments in the U.S. market?  I noticed in this first quarter, constant currency growth was about 20 -- 25% and then in the second quarter, it looks like it's more like 13, even though you've opened more stores in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. We are -- in general, we are very pleased with the development in the U.S. and especially the reception on the West Coast, that's where the focus on the further expansion is. And the U.S. remains our largest expansion market and we'll, probably for many years, we'll see great potential in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So what were the factors that caused the pull back?  I'm guessing the weather patterns weren't as extreme in the U.S. year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it wasn't. You are quite right. The weather change in U.S. has not been as big as in Europe. But we can also -- you can also say that opening up in the U.S. today, we will also add stores very close to another store, which of course also influence a lot on the selling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To me that's sounds a little bit mixed because you're saying there is cannibalization on the one hand, but you're also saying there is a lot of opportunity for further growth. So --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean you're going to be moving into new territories, new areas of the U.S. you haven't been previously in the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We will still be opening up store -- hope to be opening up a lot of stores in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco and still also New York of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay. And then if I might just one final question on the cost growth front, I appreciate the second quarter cost growth was 14%, the first quarter was 20. And so I think what people are trying to understand is how volatile that line is going to be and what a sort of normal level of cost growth is for the business given your warehouse and online investments. If they are going to continue to build over the next few quarters, should we expect 20% one quarter, 10% the next?  What's the kind of overall level of SG&amp;A growth that we might expect in normal market conditions on a full year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We tried to guided -- guided  this loss and say that we have sort of lost around six, seven, eight years in between 37 and 38%, and that is also what we are looking or would like to look at going forward. And that can of course, as you say, increase with things like driving double short logistic places and it can also increase, of course, on a short notice or in a short run with a mail order sort of <mark type="inaudible" />. And all of these things are done, of course, through a third person either that is to drive the selling or just to reduce cost in the future or heightened effectivity. So in every one quarter, two quarters, three quarters, we can have deviations from that of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It simply is -- simply just to give a bit of history where we have been on. But we don't really see any big changes in future growth.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>I'm very sorry, but it's very difficult to break out the U.S. dollar as such. We've tried to do that before, but I think we made it even more confusing perhaps. There has definitely been a -- there has been a material impact from the U.S. dollar, that's for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regards to when you say that's sort of something like up 175 bps, 200 bps of that order?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few words on sourcing. Can you give us a flavor of the sort of cost inflation you're seeing at the moment and just a sense of the range of cost inflation between particular countries that you source from; just a sort of a broad perspective on how much that's feeding through into your gross margin, if it is at the moment?</p>

          <p>There are some things, some things -- I understand that has a big increase for this of course.

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That wasn't me. Anyway, just a follow-up question on China again. You mentioned, you commented on the strong reception of the stores that you opened, the stronger sales they are achieving. Yet, it seems to me that your opening plan is quite conservative yet. And I would like to understand better how strategically you think of China going forward and much of it likely is the risk that as we move on, you're going to have to speed up some of this expansion, considering also how some of the other players in the market are tackling very aggressively the Chinese market. So I'm just still surprised that you're not going to open significantly more stores than what you're planning at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We understand your question and it's quite relevant. But I think China is quite conservative when it comes to everything which is not fashion. I think it will remain like that. And I think we've learned from experience not to be carried away. And you are right, we are very happy and excited about the launch. But we also have a deep respect for the challenges we meet in the future and we want to make things right and not comprising. And we are looking at, as I said, a lot of interesting premises, and I can assure that we will expand, but we will take it in -- step-by-step in our own pace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you concerned at all about the tougher development that you're seeing from your peers to some extent, especially the local ones? And when it comes to capability to access the right real estate and the right places at the right time that that first mover advantage, that maybe, some may argue, the more you wait, the less you can get. How do you think about that sort of opportunity at this point in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see your question -- I understand your question. But our experience is that the more competition, the better it is for H&amp;M. And I mean we were probably not the first one to enter the New York or Paris stores, but we did very well. So it doesn't scare us that other competitors might be there before us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got a very extreme balance of openings between the first half and second half this year with -- I think it's 50 in the first half, was 140 in the second. In what quarters does that actually hurt the operating margin because of the sort of pre-opening costs and start-up costs? Does that mainly affect Q2 or Q3 or Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we actually would try to balance this somewhat tricky opening schedules for new stores with rebuilding and refurbishment of older stores. We have enough -- we have a number of new stores open, we also have a number of old stores to refurbish. So we try to balance that out. That's what happening in terms --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are saying --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are saying we wouldn't necessarily see in any one quarter a drag effect from a particularly heavy group of openings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just -- you will see an effect when it comes to the shops that we are opening, many more shops in Q2 and Q4. But because they are much more evenly spread on that, because we do refurbish that in another time phase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just on the same sort of subject, you said you're going to be opening a lot of stores in Germany. Should we be expecting more cannibalization to start occurring in Germany now that you've got a fairly big store base there already or are you going into smaller towns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You will see some cannibalization effect, but we are also going into smaller cities; that is for sure. But the whole point for us in opening up a new store is that we do get full overseas effect. So in the beginning, you may very well see that there are some effects on neighboring stores, but the overall effect should be that we make a good turnover in the new stores.</p>

          <p>Where you see there is traffic right now? Do you see them in the malls? Do you see them on the high street or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're right, I mean that's exactly one of the reasons why we are a bit conservative to, because they are open, there are a lot of malls that open, but you don't know which ones will be the good ones. We want to be in the good ones of course. Also, we said we focus on the Shanghai area rather than spread out our new stores throughout China. And that's why we wait in Beijing while we are focused on Shanghai where around 50 million people in that region only.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we look in -- at the end of 2009, you're probably not going to be in that many more cities in China, but you will have a lot more stores. Is that the right way of thinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I don't really think that we should specify where we are. But what we are doing also, we have local teams in place whose sole responsibility is to look at different locations and of course, we also work together with consultants in China. I think that's something we will have accomplished.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then to the current economic environment, in some of your markets, it's quite weak. And then just wondering how much have you had to adjust your current business because of that. I assume you don't change your store opening plans at all, but more for the like-for-like business. Because looking at your inventory levels, it was a very good level now at the end of the quarter despite two very weak sales months in the beginning of the quarter. Is that because you slowed down on purchasing in anticipation of a slowdown on the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, as we readjust our purchasing to the conditions which we are in; that is true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But have you had to adjust let's say three or six months ago? Are your main markets weaker than you were expecting at this point of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, six -- three or six months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So no major changes to your business plans at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't get that, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you have -- it's no major changes to your business plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No major changes. But of course, we are watching all the time what goes on -- what's going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe I can get back to that question which we couldn't answer before, the difference in currency effect on the selling and the result. And we have a currency effect on the selling of about 1% and of course, and so the diff -- we have a different selling and result profit level on different markets and different currencies. So it's very hard to make that calculation. I think it was Mr. Kindreich from Geneva who raised that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>One minute please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can -- have we done? If there is no more question on that subject, could we have the next question then please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Kindreich is now in the queue. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Yes. Can you hear me please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can hear now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it just seems to be a huge impact. I mean you have hardly any impact on sales, but there must be something there. I mean your pre-tax numbers were up 11%, and 5 of that 11 was coming from currencies. It just doesn't seem coherent at all you know. I mean there must be something -- did you make an exceptional gain on the futures you were hedging and maybe made a gain on the forwards or futures or something, something that's an exceptional result there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a moment please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which sum are you referring? Could I have that, because I don't understand that? We have a currency effect of 187 million on the result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but compared to last year, you had an impact of minus 230. So the swing is nearly 400 relative as a base of --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that is last year. You can only look at this year, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the impact is 187 rather than 400?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are arriving at 187.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, maybe we could do it like -- maybe you could call us later and then we can just furnish in detail with you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Stellan Hellstr&#xF6;m.  Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Nordea. I'd like to come back to the SG&amp;A cost. And as has been mentioned previously, the SG&amp;A cost increased 14% in Q2 compared to 20% up in Q1. I was just wondering how much of this low growth rate is due to you adjusting costs given the weaker sales level in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually not very much, actually, because we have not -- we didn't go in and try to cut down on salary costs since we knew that -- or we were secure in our feeling that once the warm weather would come, then also the selling would come, which means that you really shouldn't send your part of your staff home to save money on the salaries. So we actually didn't cut very much there. We were very secure in our beliefs in our shorter month, which we had in the stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>

          <p>Next we have a follow-up question from the line of Nicklas Fh&#xE4;rm. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I just want to ask you, I mean since you have now been operating your first COS stores about a year or so, do you think you can give away any sort of thoughts on how those stores are performing in the current macro environment versus your H&amp;M stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are very -- we are pleased with the way COS is performing. I don't know as -- we have a very, very short history with the COS stores. We barely spent around a year. So for us, we very much like to look at the selling today compared with a year ago. And we really don't have very much to go on when it comes to COS in that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just like for H&amp;M, I think our internal processes like management, prices, collections are much, much more important than macro questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Credit Suisse again. Just on the sales you achieved in the first half, the comparable unit 1%, how much below your budget was that? First question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And looking forward, I mean is, you're presumably budgeting for some positive like-for-like in the second half of the year, are you?</p>
