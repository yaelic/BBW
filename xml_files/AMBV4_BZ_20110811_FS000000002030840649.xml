          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you for waiting. We would like to welcome everyone to Ambev's second quarter 2011 results conference call. Today with us we have Mr. Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, CEO for Ambev; and Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer.</p>
          <p>We would like to inform you that this event is being recorded, and all participants will be in listen-only mode during the company's presentation. After Ambev's remarks are completed, there will be a question-and-answer section. At that time, further instructions will be given. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Ambev's management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions because they relate to future events, and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of Ambev, and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Jamel, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Maureen, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to be with you today to discuss our 2011 second quarter results, and before I start, I would just like to remind you that as usual, the precipitous change discussed during this call are both organic and normalized in nature.</p>
          <p>Normalized figures refers to performance measures before special items, and special items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the company. As normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, we disclose our consolidated profit, EPS, EBIT and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>I will start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter, and then Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with a brief overview of your results in Brazil, HILA-ex, Quinsa and Canada. I'll close by providing more specifics regarding the second quarter financials.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, our consolidated EBITDA was close to R$2.6 billion, which represents a 9% organic increase when compared to the second quarter of 2010, while our margins expanded 110 basis points to 44.5%. Our Brazil EBITDA increased by 9.9% in the quarter supported by a 4.3% revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion of 240 bps to 47.6%. Our LAS operation delivered during the quarter volume growth in beer of 2.9%, and decline in soft drinks of 4.7% while growing EBITDA by 20%.</p>
          <p>In Canada, beer domestic volumes increase by 1.1% in the quarter due to industry decline, and our margins decreased by 70 bps mainly due to phasing of market investments. As a result, our EBITDA decreased by 3%. Normalized profit reached R$1.8 billion in the quarter, which was 20.4% higher than last year, and normalized earnings per share increased by 20.1% in the quarter. I'll comment further on profit at the end of this call.</p>
          <p>And I'll now hand it over to Jo&#xE3;o as we start to look a little deeper into the results of each of our operations. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nelson, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the industry evolution in Brazil we faced a tough comparison against second quarter 2010 due to the World Cup and poor weather in May and June.</p>
          <p>In Canada, although the industry improved, it was still slightly negative versus last year. In the other business, HILA-Ex, in Latin America South beer, the industry was positive, driven mainly by economy recovery, while Latin America South CSD industry is still recovering at a slower pace.</p>
          <p>Going deeper into Brazil. Our beer volume decline was 2.6% in the quarter, impacted by a softer industry and the 160 basis point share loss year-on-year as a result of our price increases, which widened the price gap to competitors mainly in the off-premise channel. Our market share in the second quarter 2011 was 69, the third best market share average ever for the second quarter. Also we have gained 110 bps every month since February.</p>
          <p>Our beer net revenues per hectoliter in Brazil increased by 8.1% this quarter mainly as a result of price increase and higher rate of direct distribution, partially offset by higher taxes, mainly the excise, the federal one.</p>
          <p>Both our liquid and packaging operation continued to deliver a solid performance. Our 300 ml returnable glass bottle and the Skol 360 reached already an important market share level, and our rollout strategy nation-wide remains on track. Innovation continues to gain relevance in our portfolio, and is helping to drive both market share and drink preference upwards.</p>
          <p>Our next important launch this year is Budweiser that will hit the market at the end of this month. This year we're also increasing our focus in the premium beers through our local jewels, Bohemia Original and also enhancing Stella Artois execution, which has been growing at the fastest pace between our brands.</p>
          <p>Now talking about our COGS. Brazil beer cost of goods sold per hectoliter was up by 8.9% in the quarter as we were negatively affected by higher packaging, mainly aluminum, which went up by over 40% against the year &#x2013; the previous year. And raw material cost, as well as the lower fixed cost dilution, partly offset by better currency hedges.</p>
          <p>We believe we remain on track to deliver cost of goods sold per hectoliter for the year in line with inflation. Beer SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation/amortization, decreased by 1.2% in the period as a result of our cost initiatives and lower accruals for variable compensation, partially offset by general inflation and higher logistics cost due to the increase of direct distribution, and to product transferred between brewers.</p>
          <p>Our capacity expansion year-to-date has already reduced the extra impact of the logistic costs, and we believe the new investments to come will help our results further in the second half. Normalized Beer EBITDA finished the quarter with a 10.9% growth versus the same period as last year, and EBITDA margin expanded by 240 basis points.</p>
          <p>Moving now to soft drinks in our non-alcoholic, non-carbonated business. Our volumes in Brazil delivered a 1.3% growth in the quarter as a result of industry conditions, while we had a 10 bps market share gain, standing now at 17.8% as an average for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter growth was negative 1.9% in the quarter, mainly as a result of a 20% excise tax increase that took place in April, while costs per hectoliter increased organically by 4.5% due to packaging cost and lower fixed cost dilution, partially also offset by better currency hedges.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by 16.6% in the period, mainly as a result of lower bonus accrual and phasing of sales and marketing investment. We're able to deliver a 4.9% EBITDA growth driven mainly by a 240 basis points margin expansion in volume growth. In the innovation front, we're prepared to roll out nationwide some of our recent successful launches, such as our 1 liter returnable glass bottle for Guarana Antarctica.</p>
          <p>Turning to HILA-ex. Volumes increased by 10.6% in the period mainly as a result of industry recovery for the region, and also market share gains in some regions, which helped deliver a 25.2% organic EBITDA growth.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Latin America South, we achieved a 20% EBITDA growth as a result of strong revenue management and solid support to our brands within a context of beer volume growth compensated by a soft drinks volume decline. We are enjoying market growth ratios in most of our beer operations, including Argentina, where the market is recovering from a poor 2010, but market remains tough in soft drinks. We gained market share in the region as a result of strong support to our mainstream brands, and innovations in the beer segment.</p>
          <p>In first half of 2011, volume growth in Argentina came from the national-wide launching of Quilmes Bajo Cero in the non-alcoholic <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:58) recently introduced. We also launched Brahma Light malt in Argentina, and Pace&#xF1;a Black in Bolivia, among others. We heavily supported our main brands in the region through communication and sponsorship related to the Soccer South American Cup that took place in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Our beer net revenues per hectoliter grew as a result of price increases in line with inflation and effective trade spend management aimed at maximizing our top line. The premium segment continues to grow with our brands gaining market share. Stella Artois' strong performance keeps being an important source for volume and profitability growth in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Our soft drinks business is now experiencing market contraction. Price increases were introduced to offset severe cost pressures. We also launched <mark type="ph" /> Twister (9:43), a flavored non-carbonated water aimed at gaining presence in a growing market. We will continue to focus in revenue management initiatives and innovations to keep recouping our margins.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost as an expense, we experienced higher cost of raw material, labor and inflation. We are suffering increases in beer commodities and packaging material. Cost increases in soft drinks included sugar, PET, juices and others. We keep working hard on implementing cost cutting initiatives to overcome these cost pressures and maintain our margins.</p>
          <p>In spite of this cost pressure and poor market performance, we have been able to deliver double digit EBITDA growth in Latin America South in both beer and soft drinks as a result of strong revenue performance, and continuous efforts to achieve higher efficiency levels.</p>
          <p>Turning to Canada. The second quarter was one of relative stability for Labatt's, characterized by an improvement the industry, which was still slightly negative versus Q2 2010, and marginal gains in both market share and domestic net revenues per hectoliter versus the prior year. However, as indicated in the second quarter, we increased our market investments versus the prior year, which is the main driver for a 3% decline in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>The Canadian beer industry showed a slight decline in the second quarter, representing a significant improvement in the negative trend that has persisted since second quarter 2010. This momentum is likely due to a slightly weaker comp in the second quarter of 2010, and improvement in the weather.</p>
          <p>Over the first half of this year we have launched new marketing campaigns on both Bud Light and Keith's, while investing heavily behind Budweiser and our plan to establish it as a beer of hockey, Canada's most popular sport. Although we are still in the early days of these campaigns, we're trying to see progress in the market share and the brand health of our focused brands, which now make up more than 60% of our total volume, and drove Labatt's share to gain 0.1 basis points in the quarter versus last year.</p>
          <p>Having spent the last five quarters stabilizing our market share in Canada, our main focus now is to maintain this base while growing overall profitability in the market. Said differently, we are working to leverage the positive brand health and market share momentum into net revenue per hectoliter growth.</p>
          <p>Our net revenue per hectoliter was roughly flat versus prior year, as we cycled a final quarter of harmonized sales tax in Ontario, which reduced our net sales per hectoliter by roughly 1%. COGS increased by 0.6% versus last year as higher aluminum costs were offset by productivity initiatives and better currency hedges. SG&amp;A, excluding deprecation, increased by 3.5% in the quarter as our higher marketing investments were partially offset by a lower fixed cost base.</p>
          <p>Over the balance of 2011, we plan to continue optimizing the market share and profitability <mark type="ph" /> equation (12:31) in Canada, while continuing to execute against our new focus brand campaigns to ensure continued momentum in market share and brand health.</p>
          <p>Going back to the overall Ambev business, I want to wrap up by saying we're pleased with our consolidated results as we were able to offset negative volume performance through pricing strategy and cost management initiatives to deliver 110 basis points EBITDA margin expansion.</p>
          <p>Looking into the different business. In Brazil Beer, we expect to continue delivering profitable growth by balancing volume and net revenue per hectoliter growth, while margins should improve as we have an easier comparison in the second half due to higher impact of 2010 imported cans and logistics costs. In soft drinks, we'll focus on top line growth through our innovations rollout to improve our market position, and by fine tuning our pricing strategy to increase our profitability.</p>
          <p>In Latin America South, we'll again deliver solid EBITDA growth, and strengthen even further our brands, as well as continue to lead the way in the premier segment while invest in our mainstream beers.</p>
          <p>In Canada, industry volume trend had improved, and we will keep investing further in our focused brands to drive top line growth, and pursuing any cost savings opportunity to go back to the positive organic growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, HILA-Ex, we continue on track to deliver our long term strategy in the region, while being able to improve the short-term profitability.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I'd like to congrat our people, our major assets and are supporting us to deliver positive results in a tougher volume environment.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to go back to Nelson.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o. In this final section, I would like to guide you through the main items between the normalized EBIT of R$2.2 billion, and profit of R$1.8 billion, as disclosed on Page 3 of our release.</p>
          <p>Our net finance results were R$25.4 million negative, which is R$80 million better than last year. This is explained by lower net interest expense, as well as better results on derivatives related to our ongoing hedging policy.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate in the period improved to 16.3% compared to 22.2% last year. The main reasons were an increase in the income tax incentives related to our investments in the north and northeast regions of Brazil, higher tax benefits from interest on capital payments and some one-time tax credit.</p>
          <p>Our net cash position was close to R$700 million in the second quarter compared to the net cash position of R$200 million at the end of December 2010. And during the second quarter of 2011, we announced a R$1.2 billion dividend and interest on capital payment that took place on August 5.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to add that we remain committed to our CapEx plan, particularly in Brazil where we invested R$1.4 billion year-to-date as we do see relevant growth opportunity in the beer industry moving forward, despite some short term softness.</p>
          <p>I will now hand back to the operator and open up for questions. Please, Maureen?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. I was hoping to get a bit of an update on the consumer environment in Brazil. I think last quarter you seemed rather cautious, I guess, to talk about notable improvements this year. And I guess now that we're looking into the second half, curious if you have any greater clarity about trends for the second half? Or should we just really be more optimistic and think about better growth returning next year? And I guess the second part of the question also, and this is on your, primarily your Beer Brazil division, seeing the pricing gap being somewhat wide for quite some time last year and this year. Any preliminary thoughts about your next round of pricing? Do you feel the need to be less aggressive as a result of what happened last year? Or are you committed to your previous plans?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Lauren, sorry about this. Basically, the macro that we see now it's similar to what we thought, which might have been in the good news because I think our industry saw a decline or a volume deceleration in the first quarter with some other sectors up in Brazil are seeing the second quarter as we're looking at second quarter results of other industries.</p>
          <p>I think the government had decided to sort of decelerate the economy from the 7.5% to the 4%, and they're doing different things. Of course, our industry, beverages overall, not just beer, but also beer and soft drinks were slightly more impacted than other industry just because we had the 15% increase for beer, and also the 20% increase for soft drinks. So we saw the deceleration, I think sooner than everybody else. Therefore, we were I think more cautious than the average.</p>
          <p>We see that as a current momentum overall in the economy, but still very optimistic about the pick-up in the beginning of next year with the 14% increase in the minimal wage. I think in a way, the fact that we saw the impact of this "transition year" in the first quarter we were able to take a lot of actions in terms of our SG&amp;A, some of them showing in the second quarter and more to come as we go forward.</p>
          <p>What we're doing, therefore, is taking a close look and a cautious look on the expenses, but still be let's say "aggressive" on our capital expenditure plans because we are optimistic about 2012. So we're also making this a transition year for us. We took the option. We're exercising the option of protecting our profitability in the short-term, of course, especially in beer we're leaders, a little less in soft drinks because we are followers.</p>
          <p>Going to the second part of your question, which is the price gap. I think the fact that our beer market share is back to above 69%, we're right now at 69.3%, shows that some of the price gaps are closed. I would say that the price gap to the first price increase was totally closed, and there are minor adjustments to the second one. We are doing much better in returnables than in one way, given that we had a much higher price increase in cans, which in a way are bringing competitors to close that gap in a way which is I think net, net very positive for us. So that's where we stand right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you any comments with respect to the next round of pricing? I mean, do you think you were too aggressive and the market's not absorbing those types of increases? Or looking into next year, you feel confident that you could do something similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the follow-up. I missed that part. Well, I think we did the &#x2013; let's say the combination of both price increases we had this year they took in consideration above the average several tax increase because they were lagging for two and a half years.</p>
          <p>Assuming a regular tax increase, there's no reason to have the same sort of price increase. Therefore, I feel very confident, given our share level, which is a very good one, even that we have been able to maintain or enhance our price preference, we're definitely very ready for the next price increase, which should come in the regular time, will probably not need to be as high as the one this year, but mainly for tax reasons.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning or good afternoon. I was wondering, Jo&#xE3;o, if you could talk a little bit about some of the actions you took to control SG&amp;A in the quarter? It was very impressive to see a decline, given all that we know about kind of the inflationary pressures that are the reality in Brazil right now. So if you could give us a little bit of color on what exactly you did and how you see that sort of playing out through the rest of the year? That would be really helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lore, for the first piece, I think I missed exactly how aggressive we were in the price you mention? Or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I just want to understand what kind of actions you took to control the SG&amp;A so tightly in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Well, it's a combination of many things, so I give you a few examples. Okay? Let's say, and then Jamel can also add on this. But as we looked for, let's say, a flattish one for the first half and we'll be prepared for that or for any growth in the second half. There are parts of your business that have &#x2013; a part is variable, a part fixed is fixed.</p>
          <p>So, for example, logistic costs. So logistics has a component of fixed that you cannot apply, but has a component of variable that you can do. So let's say you have 3,000 trucks available for you if you don't want to buy spot. As we look at the sort of year that we're going to have, we can diminish sort of the inventory of trucks that we have. So by diminishing the "inventory of trucks" that our system had, not that we have inventory, but we contract them through our distributors or through transportation companies we work with. By decreasing that available inventory, you're decreasing your variable, part variable, part fixed.</p>
          <p>Same thing happens for your plants as you add or diminish extra shifts. So we saw early on that extra shifts on the plants, extra shifts on logistics and things like that and you can look at this across the board were not necessary. So the fact that we have the cost metrics very well mapped help us to quickly take some actions on the plant level, on the logistics level, as well as some commercial and marketing investment, especially of course, in the non-working money that we are also to do without of course effect either volume or preference of our brands, which we can see I'd say by the combination of very good share and also very high preference level.</p>
          <p>And part of what we said also in the release is a lower bonus accrual. So the combination of those things allowed us to have some impact already in the second quarter, but I hope there's more yet to come in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, sorry, this is Jo&#xE3;o. Just to put on what Jo&#xE3;o said, I think he clearly mentioned that there is no silver bullet, no one thing or no single action that can drive this sort of improvement. I think besides what he said in terms of shifting or transforming some of the fixed or semi-variable costs into more variable like in the examples he gave, I think it's important to emphasize the opportunity we captured through procurement sales. I think we have been putting even more emphasis on some of the negotiations we have for our suppliers, for instance.</p>
          <p>For many, many items in Brazil, we have what we call a hidden FX. Of course there are some things we buy that are really traded in dollar terms like in our COGS, and therefore we have a full exposure. But even for if you're going to the supply chain all the way down, you'll find some opportunity there because we have an implied dollar exposure in our supplier, which of course, if the real appreciation was an opportunity for us to <mark type="ph" /> seed (28:12), negotiate, say that they will negotiate, that was important.</p>
          <p>The other thing we have improving a lot here is in terms of e-auctions. These are two that we have been investing more and more behind it, and expanding it from the direct materials that we had before also to our SG&amp;A sort of scope, our <mark type="ph" /> CBD (28:36) scope the way we call it. So e-auctions and the combination of a very detailed and diligent approach into our procurement opportunities led us to these results.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Maureen. Good day, everybody, and congratulation on the quarter, guys. I was hoping you could expand a little bit on Budweiser and in the launch later this month? Maybe you could touch on the contracts, perhaps the economics, the choice of the timing and any investment you'll have to make and any co-investment that ABI might make to support the brand or the infrastructure that's needed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, Bob. This is Jo&#xE3;o. Okay. I mean, first the timing of the launch, we've been working on this since last year. We had a point in time had planned to launch at the end of last year, but given all the capacity constraints we took our time to really fine tune. I think we have a very good combination on our value-based brand approach, both from a functional standpoint, which as you know how the liquid will go into our demand planning, the main landscape and also from an emotional standpoint. So we have had enough time to work on both aspects for the launch.</p>
          <p>We will be using some of the things we have also learned through research not just here, but in other global launches, so very good that we were, let's say, later on compared to other countries that we could learn from. So I think we really have a good combination. I think we're able to surprise our consumers. Clients are very much excited when you talk to the off-trade, the Wal-Marts of the world, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:41) of the world, the Carrefours of the world. They are really excited about seeing this U.S. global brand coming into Brazil, so consumers I think will be a bit surprised. Clients are very excited.</p>
          <p>Then when you look at the portfolio, I think with the arrival of Budweiser we really have a winning portfolio in the premium segment by having two local jewels with two different approach, Bohemia and Original, having Stella more on the super premium segment, and then having Budweiser also in both, okay?</p>
          <p>In terms of investment/royalties, we'll have arm's length contract with marginal or very low royalty fees to ABI with also some co-op investments with them, so that's the combination. At the end what we want with this agreement is the best for the brand. And this brand will only grow it will only make sense if it's good for both of us. So I think we have the right agreement for it to foster the brand and for this brand at the core plus premium sort of pricing to be able to succeed in Brazil.</p>
          <p>So very excited. I think we have a great addition to the premium portfolio in that manner we can look at the 2012 year where we can win both on the mainstream, but also on the premium segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jo&#xE3;o, if you look at this compared to the economics of maybe core Brahma, right, how would be the economics compare? And then you mentioned the other earnings in different marketplaces around the world. Which marketplace do you think is a good reference point? Is this &#x2013; is this like an Argentina in terms of the potential for the brand in Brazil in your opinion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when you look at Budweiser in Brazil and learnings are coming from the different source, and I'll get to that, we're probably going to be positioning this between let's say a 120 to a 130 when Brahma, let's say, is 105, okay? That's why I'm calling between our core plus and the premium, so <mark type="ph" /> the floor (32:54) with good economics for us. I think there are different learnings that come from different markets because as you see Budweiser in Argentina it's positioned more at the 100%. When you look at Russia, it's more of a premium. When you look at the U.S., not that we're learning specifically from there because the brand has been there for a long time, but with a lot of consumer research that you know that we have been doing, we've been learning a lot about the packaging.</p>
          <p>So we're coming with a great packaging that we have developed here, of course, in combination with the U.S., and it was mentioned today some of the new news that they have for the U.S. market will benefit from that. We'll benefit from the learnings of Argentina, but with a different pricing strategy, and also benefits from the early learnings from the Russia launch, so that combination. But, of course, customized to Brazil because the brand has been in a way launching here in previous times. So we have the combination of the learnings here from all the research we did in the past 18 months with those other markets. And that combination, I think, it's a very good portfolio mix for us to come into the market right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much. Hi, Jo&#xE3;o. My question has to do also with pricing, like the first question you got, but I want to understand a little bit better what happened in pricing in beer in Brazil in the second quarter. I think the decline of, sequential decline, we know that there's a seasonal component to it, but 5.5% to almost 6% decline I think it was higher than expected. Could you elaborate how much of this move quarter-over-quarter is coming from a packaging mix, which kind of surprising given what you commented regarded the prices of cans, but how much is packaging mix? How much is geography? And I know you already mentioned that you're expecting another price increase, as expected, which would be closer to the fourth quarter. I guess a more short term question would be, what should we be expect in the third quarter, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Alan. Very good question. I think there were a lot of questions regarding this. I think before getting to the details, I still think that the 8.1%, although there's a decline and there is a seasonality, as I mentioned, still very strong pricing, way above inflation, especially given an important tax increase to show in the revenue <mark type="ph" /> manage (35:27) and showing the exercising the option that we built and still with a very good share.</p>
          <p>But having said that, I would say that there are three or four components that will explain this decrease. I think first on top of the usual VAT catch-up that if you look in the past three years we've been talking about this, the fact that you put the price in and the state taxes will come catch up later. And let's say this is just for the sake of using one third of the explanation, not be exactly one third. Then the package mix, what happens is actually that the net sales per hectoliter of cans, although the macro is lower, the net sales per hectoliter is higher. So therefore, a shift towards returnable will help you on the macro, but will not help you in the net sales per hectoliter. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then there is the usual market adjustment that we mentioned that if we felt that the market was too flat, we would adjust to that market condition. So that's why this quarter we had a slightly greater decrease on the net sales per hectoliter than you saw in different quarters in previous years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I hear you. But should we expect for the third quarter this to remain stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What usually happens, Alan, and I think it should not be very different. Usually we have a price increase that shows a bigger net sales per hectoliter in the first quarter, then a lower on the second and third, and then again, greater on the fourth. Okay? So that's what I would expect. This is the normal cycle. I'm not giving any guidance. But usually if you look at 2010, 2009, 2008 you're going to see that softness, <mark type="ph" /> cold drink (37:13) softness decreased on the second and third, and then again a stronger, greater on the fourth. That's the usual trend, and that's what you see. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And usually the third &#x2013; sometimes the third quarter is slightly below the second. I mean, but look at the trends. Shouldn't see much different trends than what we saw, and the slightly more decrease in this quarter was more due to the package mix shift into returnable which is overall positive, but negative on the net sales per hectoliter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very useful. That's very clear. Now a final quick question, more of on a technical side. Was there any change in the depreciation rate? I mean, we're seeing here a slight change from, again, from previous quarters. It's something relatively minor. Was there any change there? Or am I reading this incorrectly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alan. It's Nelson here. Let me pick up this question. Indeed, we had implemented a change in Q4 last year, and then you a major impact in the quarter as we made the adjustment for the full year in Q4. We even put it as a scope change and tried to give some visibility when we reported last quarter.</p>
          <p>Of course, on a recurring basis now we have less of this issue. And there was indeed a change in depreciation rates. Some were moved up, some were moved down. Of course, we have to take into consideration that even the CapEx is step up we have been doing since last year. Total depreciation is also going to increase because of that. That's natural. But this change was definitely much more significant in Q4 last year, but from now one we should see this evolve in a more organic basis for the following quarters.</p>

          <p>The next question is Jos&#xE9; Yord&#xE1;n, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just two questions. One is a clarification. When you said COGS per hectoliter would go up with inflation this year, are you still talking about Ambev consolidated or for Ambev Brazil or Brazil Beer? And then my second question is just the inconsistency in your statements in the press release about soft drink industry contractions in Latin America South because as you know, the Coke bottlers that operate there, the two public ones, have been reporting upwards of 10% volume growth there. So any color you can give us on any of these two would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, Jos&#xE9;. It's Nelson here. Regarding COGS per hectoliter, the sentence is valid for both. So in Brazil we expect to be pretty much in line with inflation. If we think last 12 months inflation in Brazil is around 6.7%, all the forecast we see for the full year is somehow this should cool down and go down a little bit. We should remain on track for the full year number, so end of December, rolling 12 months. So it's going to be the full number by December, which should be in line with inflation. And this is also valid for our consolidated results. Of course, we have to wait &#x2013; a weighted average let's say inflation between Canada, Quinsa region and Brazil.</p>
          <p>So again, we'll benefit a lot in the second semester, especially in Brazil because of the impact of the imported cans we had last year. So we talked about that on a full year basis, but also if we think of the impact of the imported cans in Brazil, roughly 75% of it was concentrated in the second semester last year. Therefore, we're going to really have an easy comp, and that of course will help margins to improve even further in the course of the year. So that's the good news.</p>
          <p>In terms of CSD volumes in Argentina, what we have there is still clearly see the industry, the soft drink industry recovering at a lower pace than the beer industry. If you look on a quarterly basis, this quarter we had mainly as we said an impact of the industry decline, which explains pretty much two thirds or 70% of our volume drop. The average was 3.4%. We also had in the quarter some market share loss which explains the remaining 30% decline, but if you look on a year-to-date basis, for instance, our market share is pretty much flat versus the previous year. And the volume performance therefore, and that's according to Nielsen, okay? But the volume performance therefore is mainly driven by the industry performance.</p>
          <p>When you compare to other public players there, of course, there are some different regions in the country. Some of them operate in a more restricted area, and so their numbers may change a little bit. Of course, not dramatically, but according to all the research we have here, we do see market share flat at this stage. Of course, with a decline in Q2, which was of course is also a consequence of the sort of pricing we put there. The decision was to protect our margins in the soft drink business in Latin America South, particularly in Argentina. We had there an important increase that helped our margin. We have even a reduction to the price gap we have to the liter. The price gap used to be 5%, now is down to 2%. So this is also part of the explanation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And if I can follow-up real quick on your cost per hectoliter. Presumably you've been taking advantage of the very strong real to lock in next year's FX hedges. Can you give us any sense at this point of whether you are maintaining your 12 months? Or have you gone up to your limit of 15 months for hedging as far as FX and/or your grain hedges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have been doing have been, of course, acting consistently with all our policy, which you know, we can be at 12 plus or minus 2, so it could be up to 14. Of course, I think, it's too early as we are still somewhere midway in the year, so price are definitely not locked for 2012 yet, and we are, of course, looking closely into the market performance, as you know. I mean there is a lot of volatility, but I think it's too early to provide any specific number for 2012.</p>
          <p>But again, the key message is that we remain totally aligned for our policy. And overall we should have for 2012 a benefit on the FX impact, of course, given the evolution that is in the marketplace. On the other hand, some commodities are going to be probably locked at the higher level than what we had this year. But again, the key message is about our disciplined approach towards our hedging policy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Want to go back to the discussion on the premium segment a little bit. Obviously, some punchy numbers in there. 200% growth in Stella, the Budweiser launch coming. One of the smaller brewers or one of the competitors in Brazil just recently sold to Carre and in their comments were they want to focus on the premium segment. We know Heineken said the same thing. So it sounds like the stars are finally aligned after all these years for all the big players or at least by my calculation 85% plus of the market to focus on the premium segment. And on top of that you have, as you mentioned, the real wage increase and then you have the Olympics &#x2013; the World Cup, excuse me, then the Olympics. So it seems like you have an unprecedentedly good set of factors supporting that. 10 years after we started talking about this I think or at least publicly started being discussed the thing is the market is still 5% only at premium. Can you give us a sense of how you see with all these factors involved and the Bud launch and all this other stuff how you see the premium segment evolving? Do you think it could be from five now to 10 in just a couple years time? Is it still going to grow very small basis points of share in the market over time? How do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Celso. This is Jo&#xE3;o. Very good exciting question. As we are seeing now with the global launch, I mean, just to paraphrase Budweiser, great times are coming. So in terms of great times are coming, I think you're right. I think we had the stars aligned 10 years ago when we &#x2013; Ambev was created, and back then took the premium market from 2.5 to 5, and then it was stable for a long time and I think now we have a good combination of, as you said, the players in the marketplace, Heineken and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:58) and us focusing on this, and also consumers willing to pay more and to try more to upgrade to those brands.</p>
          <p>And I think having the brands that we have, having our full portfolio when we research either here, either other segments or abroad, having four strong brands, this is sort of a segment that one brand alone usually don't do it. So having maybe four of the best brands out there I think will help us. Whether this will grow, so I feel that we are very well positioned. Having learned a lot from the past, having as you said the stars aligned.</p>
          <p>I think what is the &#x2013; still is one of the challenges, and when I say challenge is to go from 5 to 10 in a few years because you're already like setting a target is that Brazil was one of the few countries and I hope will continue to be that way where both Class C and D, but also A and B is growing. It's not an exchange where you're seeing A and B not growing in exchange of C and D.</p>
          <p>The good thing about Brazil, and assuming that the trend that we saw in the past couple of years will continue is that you cannot have the growth of C and D, and the also the growth of A and B. I think the difference from 2012 onwards when you compare 2009, 2010, I think 2009 and '10 we had a very strong strategy for classes C and D, and not as strong for class A and B.</p>
          <p>When I look at 2012 onwards, we'll have a significant and very good strategy brand and resource behind both the mainstream and the premium segment. So which one is going to grow faster because to go from 5 to 10 we'll have to grow faster than the mainstream, but we also have still very good programs not just through the launch of different backbeat strategy.</p>
          <p>We also have very strong on and off trade programs that will help both. So it will be sort of a race between the mainstream brands and the premium brands for the premium brands to grow double the rate of the mainstream. So I think we have everything for that to happen. But the macroeconomics are actually helping both groups. So I think the difference that we will be wining, looking to win in both cases.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Nelson, Jo&#xE3;o. The first question is on the Brazilian beer. It seems to us that the industry was pretty &#x2013; had pretty much flattish volume growth this quarter, and although you're coming from a much higher base and you had the price increases, do you think that we are already at the bottom for the industry in terms of volume growth and that essentially as the price gap closes you could see already a good and better solid growth in the third quarter? And also I would like to see if you can comment, it seems that your &#x2013; one of your main competitors in the northeast could be a little bit distracted by the corporate activity that they're going through, and you're launching &#x2013; and you're going to be more aggressive there and you're opening a new production facility in the region. So how do you think you could benefit from all this situations over the next two, three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Gustavo. Thanks for the question. I think starting with whether we are at the bottom or not. As you know, we'll not be giving any guidance for second half or volumes going forward. I think what we can say is that we had very strong second and third quarter last year, okay? So we have pretty much two quarters in a row growing above 12%.</p>
          <p>So I think the third quarter is still a tough quarter to beat, and then we have easier comps as we go into the fourth quarter where growth was between 2% and 4%, so that's as much as I want to say about having reaching the bottom or not.</p>
          <p>Looking at what we're calling the <mark type="ph" /> NENO (51:30) strategy, the northeast and the north. We have started this last year. I mean, we all follow how much we have invested, not just in transferring products, in launching new products, taking them to the north/northeast, but also committing a major CapEx investment to what could be the second largest plant in the company in Pernambuco to start now in the second half. So this is our commitment.</p>
          <p>The good thing is that both share and preference are improving in that region. So we're already benefiting from a volume standpoint, from a share standpoint and also from a preference standpoint in that region. Whether there are going to be further opportunities, I hope there will be. As you mentioned, our job is to take those opportunities. Of course, we are seeing one former local player being sold to a listed multi-national, so there are the consequences of that. So I think that that combination is altogether a positive combination, and we'll be prepared to take any opportunity that come along.</p>

          <p>When you segment that market for your broader strategy in the northeast, do you think that because the economics are a little bit different and the GDP per capita is lower, is your price &#x2013; are your pricing going lower as well? Or you're able to sustain like very good pricing points in the region?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It &#x2013; when you open that up, it depends a lot. There are places where you have higher. There are places that where you have lower. And therefore, we don't like to go into the details of the strategy because it will show maybe some of the opportunities that we have in place. But it really changes across the board.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My last question is on the CSD business in Brazil. I don't know if there was an impact in gross margins. You mentioned some of them on the PET, but I don't know if also there were some impact in your gross margins related to your returnable presentation strategy? Or if there were any accounting changes because your gross margin were very weak, but your operating margins overall were excellent, right? Because obviously you move a lot of your costs out of the system perhaps with the strategies that are already coming on, but I'd like to understand a little bit better? And also on the CSD in Brazil, if you could give us a little bit of color on how you stand in the returnable presentation strategy? You mentioned that you are rolling out the Guarana to other parts of the country, and if you could give us a little bit more color on what's happening there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I'll give you some of the overall commercial and the strategy, and then if Nelson wants to touch a little bit more on the margin. But I mean basically, starting with the top line. Well, number one we are not the market leaders, so we're followers, so we'll be subject to the movement of the industry. I think second it's good to remember that we had a much higher tax increase in soft drinks that we have in beer. So the combination that the industry in soft drinks didn't move as much as we did in beer, as well as the higher tax. That combination on the net, on the total sales, of course, have affected the gross margin because, I mean, taxes took a great portion.</p>
          <p>When I look at the strategy that we have in soft drinks, we are much more prepared to fight the right fight, a profitable fight today than we were about a year ago, not just because of the one-liter returnable but we mentioned about the new H2OH! flavors. I mentioned about the new introduction package that we have in isotonic, about the new energy drinks, but the big, big bat is really on the 1 liter returnable, as you mentioned. We have expanded this now for two regions. We were in the beginning of the year in just one region of the country. Now we're in two. We are dividing eight in the total country from a sales perspective. It's already two, and we've been introducing in more regions and it will take a couple more quarters to see that all over the country.</p>
          <p>The results so far, everywhere we go, very positive. We are seeing already some of the reactions from the competition, but to be quite honest, the competition has been alone there for many years. So it's our time to take some share in that segment, so continue to be very, very optimistic about the future, given the difficult moment that the industry is going through because of the higher tax. So I think we have the right strategy. We have a very good pipeline in hand. We have much better flexibility with that price right now, and remember also that the Pernambuco plant in the northeast is not just a beer plant, but it's also a soft drinks plant so that will give us more flexibility in the north/ northeast.</p>
          <p>And then last, but not least, we must fight back, especially in the net sales per hectoliter in the next quarters to come, so we will be doing that so that we have a good combination of not just EBITDA margin, but also absolute growth, volume growth, as well as net sales per hectoliter. But that's an area where we see still the best quarters in the sense of the whole impact of the tax increase. Okay? But I think we are much better prepared to fight the right fights in that segment than we were before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to complement on I think Jo&#xE3;o talked a lot about the CSD and just talk about COGS, which is certainly part of the equation for the margin expansion and a point to raise it. There we have, I don't know if you remember, but beginning of the year we even indicated that we had a very good start in terms of COGS per hectoliter in soft drinks. But that the full year we could get up to high singles, and that was mainly a concern around the commodities that you are not able to hedge in CSDs, mainly PET raising.</p>
          <p>But since then as PET costs or at least looking to the screens we have today a better outlook. We had probably &#x2013; we are also aligning our expectations to inflation for the full year COGS per hectoliter evolution in CSD as well. There we are benefiting from better currency hedges. Sugar is not a gap because last year it was already at a very high price different from beer where we have aluminum growing 40% year-over-year and this is impacting our beer COGS per hectoliter in this quarter. For CSD you have more of a stable condition. So we are confident we can deliver also COGS per hectoliter in line with inflation this year in soft drinks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it seems then that if you have sustainable SG&amp;A and your &#x2013; you improve your COGS, obviously there is room for a lot of margin expansion going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what we &#x2013; in terms of COGS per hectoliter, the impact it could have in terms of margins as well is I forgot to mention that because we're talking about the 1 liter bottle. Of course it's you asked a reason about if there's any difference in terms of accounting treatment, and there is, right? Because they're returnable bottle, so we are going to have in soft drinks the same current situation we have with beer, which is we treat the packaging in this case for the 1 liter returnable bottle as CapEx instead of an inventory item, right? Instead of a COGS. So that will improve COGS overall, but it's still a very tiny volume, right? So it's still a very small <mark type="ph" /> waste (59:28) in our total volume, so there is no major impact in our COGS directly moving forward.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from <mark type="ph" /> Gabriel Lima, Barclays (59:40). Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. So, Nelson, my question is also about the northeast, such as the latest question. Could you give us a sense regarding the state of the production ramp up in the region? Maybe any sense regarding the capacity utilization for the plants that are already operating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, <mark type="ph" /> Gabriel (1:00:07). Well, for the plants we in line that were already started end of last year, we already &#x2013; the ramp up period is over, right? It's behind us. We have the productivity and efficient at the level <mark type="ph" /> of the order placed (1:00:24). So that is great, and that's giving us extra capacity.</p>
          <p>Of course, for the plants in line that we have starting and going live this year, we will have the same ramp up. But of course, let's take into account when you forecast our ability to deliver, especially the fourth quarter volume which is where the CapEx, as you know, it builds in the course of the year, really makes a difference and is really useful for us to deliver and to address demand.</p>
          <p>One advantage that we have this year is that on average the start-up of the new lines and new plants is earlier, one or two months earlier than it was last year. So it has &#x2013; this ramp up is starting earlier and according to seasonality that is helpful so it can get into a better shape towards Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That sounds interesting. And could you relate recent market share gain in Brazil Beer to the northeast ramp up now? So this 120 &#x2013; sorry, 110 basis points gain, could you relate that to the northeast market share gain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the capacity we build there in the northeast also is an seasonal element of the whole strategy and the whole focus we are putting in the region, both north and northeast. As you know, these are regions that we have a share below our average. These are the regions that are growing the most in Brazil or have been growing the most in Brazil. So of course we have this focus in the region where per capita as well is growing above average because of the middle class growth.</p>
          <p>So I think there are a lot of positives around this region, and therefore increasing capacity in this part of the country is important to support our market share gain objective there. As you know, our market is primarily a returnable market, therefore having the proper logistics around it is critical to enable this market share growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just lastly, I don't know if anyone asked it, I'll just jump it in, but you mentioned at the beginning of the call that the tax rate was lower due to northeast, some northeast benefit, so is it fair to assume that it's a recurring benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In terms of our effective tax rate, in terms of our income tax, as part of the &#x2013; a counterpart for the investments we do in the region, there is also incentives in terms of income tax that we break this down into our press release. I also mentioned there was a one-time credit there. So the type of growth we have there if you look into our, for instance, year-to-date results and you look on the table on the page that's related to income tax, we see an increase from a positive R$91 million that we had last year to R$110 million this year. So this growth, I would say half of it is from organic, and half of it was a one-time credit that we got. So you can assume an important amount of this growth is on a recurring basis.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Just a quick follow-up question on the use of cash. As you guys mentioned, you ended the quarter with a net cash position of almost R$700 million. I was just wondering if there going forward if there's any change on your target of net debt, zero net debt, and consequently, the amount of dividends that you intend to pay going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="ph" /> Chavel (1:04:29). It's Nelson here. Well, the position was indeed a net cash position, which of course after the payment we did in August, the R$1.2 billion payout, but this has already changed. So I would say we have been consistently using our cash over the recent years, and there is no change in terms of our priorities for use of cash.</p>
          <p>So actually to do, of course, in first place invest behind the business, but then at this stage we have pretty much paid pretty much more than the year-to-date free cash flow in terms of payout because again, is a cash generating business, and even with the <mark type="ph" /> ex (1:05:15) investment we have been doing, CapEx and so on, we still are delivering, I would, say attractive returns to our shareholders, so no change so far in this strategy.</p>
