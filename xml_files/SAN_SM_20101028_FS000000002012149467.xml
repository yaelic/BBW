        <plist>
          <p>...the crucial aspects of management in the quarter and then Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez will review the Group's results. And we'll talk in more detail about the various business areas.</p>
          <p>Finally I will close with some conclusions on the year and our vision for the coming quarter. And the first point I'll make is to say that in a very complex environment, we've once again had an excellent quarter. We've improved some of our key management variables. They generally &#x2013; in this slide you can see a summery of the Group's fundamentals which I'll review in the next few slides, and I have divided this into 4 major areas.</p>
          <p>The first is the Santander's ability to continue to generate solid profit in a difficult market environment. As a result we've been able to be to very conservative in the criteria we've used to apply the new Bank of Spain recommendations on provisions. And also to transfer the impact directly  against the quarter's profits without having to free-up any generic provisions to offset that.</p>
          <p>The second major aspect in the quarter has been the strengthening of our balance sheet, our credit and market risks are still well under control. We've continued to improve our liquidity position and our capital ratios are still extremely solid.</p>
          <p>Third point is that we continue to provide a high shareholder return with a total expected remuneration for the whole of the year of &#x20AC;0.60 per share.</p>
          <p>And fourth, we continue to bolster our strategic position in the markets where we operate, both through acquisition, and also by gaining market share organically in target products and segments in the different countries.</p>
          <p>Let us now review each of these points in more detail. In Q3, we generated recurrent earnings of 1.6 -- attributable profit of 1.6 billion, so that accumulated up to September were &#x20AC;6.08 billion, which is 9.8% lower than in the same period of 2009. This profit was impacted by a one-off provision, 472 million, as a result of applying the Bank of Spain's new letter on provisions. This is a one-off impact; it's a non-recurrent impact, which has been offset entirely by a profit. I will elaborate on this point later.</p>
          <p>Excluding this impact, the ordinary return profit this quarter would be more in line with the Group's run rate and would be up to &#x20AC;2.107 billion, which would bring the total in the first 9 months of the year to September of 6.5 billion, which is only 2.8% below that of 2009.</p>
          <p>The business model positioning diversification where our major drivers maintain recurrent profits. The best example of diversification can be seen on the screen. Looking at results, and starting on the right hand side, emerging markets show significant profit growth. Brazil up 15% versus the previous quarter and 26% versus 2009; both percentages in local currency are without minority interest impact. The other Latin American countries are also experiencing significant growth rates. The large countries in the region are registering double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>The U.K. and the U.S. profits rose by a combined 38%. The U.K. grew by 13% in pounds sterling, and Sovereign broke even and has generated profit in the last quarter. That is 3 of the 4 major business areas where we do business have shown significant profit growth. It's only Continental Europe that where profits have fallen due to a worsening macroeconomic environment and the one-off impact on provisions, which I will now explain.</p>
          <p>On the screen, you can the details by units of the provisioning in the quarter for the application of the Bank of Spain's new letter, 693 million, as well as the impact on attributable profit, &#x20AC;472 million, which is slightly higher than the one announced in the results presentation in July. The new regulations, which came to force on September 30th, have an impact for Spanish banks &#x2013; mostly for the Santander branch network and Banesto.</p>
          <p>It does not affect those banks, where IFRS are applied &#x2013; for instance, the U.K. &#x2013; nor on those in Latin America where the more rigorous criteria is applied between the Bank of Spain's local criteria and the internal auditing risk models. And the new recommendations are very similar to the Group's internal rules restrictive, which we had already been using.</p>
          <p>Over the next few minutes, I'll explain briefly the content of this new regulation, its general impact, and I will specify the impact for our Group.</p>
          <p>The first impact is the establishment of a more demanding coverage calendar. Before, 100% coverage was reached between year two and six depending on the type of loan. With the new letter, the calendar is moved forward, and 100% coverage has to be reached in 12 months in all cases. And that means bringing forward future provisions at the time of their first application with a subsequent negative impact on earnings.</p>
          <p>The second impact is positive for results, since the new letter increases the percentages of credit guarantees related to housing and real estate. This reduces the percentage of non-performing loans to be covered by provisions, enabling funds already established above the new guarantees to be released. This positive effect is mainly obtained in the land and real estate promotion area, since in the previous rule no value was assigned to the guarantee at all, and in the new letter, it's 50%.</p>
          <p>And finally, there is a third impact through the establishment of a new calendar for provisions on foreclosed property. These assets will have to have a coverage of 30% within 24 months of foreclosure or of 20% when justified by updated valuations. This impact will have &#x2013; will be negative or positive for a bank depending on the percentage of coverage at the time of first application of the regulation, and the decision whether to release or not any possible excess or potential excess coverage.</p>
          <p>In the Santander's case the effects are shown on the left hand side of this slide. First effect to bring the calendar forward means provisioning by 965 million. The second impact, release due to guarantees releases 272 million. The figure is relatively small due to the lower weight, in our case, of developer loans and land on the NPL portfolio, which are the most favorably affected by the current regulation.</p>
          <p>And the third effect on real estate assets will be very positive for our Group with a strict application of the new calendar we will be able to release over &#x20AC;700 million, so the total impact of regulations would have been 32 million positive.</p>
          <p>However, since in the Group we are traditionally extremely prudent we've opted not to release any provisioning in real estate. When we provisioned 30% at the end of 2009 we did so on the basis of a real estate appraisal or evaluation of the real estate which we believe has not changed. Consequently, and since we have not made this release total provisions made amount to &#x20AC;693 million. Additionally, and as I mentioned, we have decided not to offset these provisions by releasing generic provision but rather to charge it fully to profit.</p>
          <p>In the second area in that initial slide was the strength of our balance sheet, and here I'll  mention 3 issues; risk quality, liquidity and solvency. With regards to credit risk our management is shown in a good evolution of net entries of NPLs and on the risk premium both for the whole Group and for our larger business units.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the lower part of the slide with particularly notable improvement in the U.K. and in America as a whole, both indicators have been improving consistently since mid-2009, which is beginning to lead to a lower demand for provisions in some limits.</p>
          <p>And also a better evolution of our NPL ratio which is now more stable in the Group in the last quarters as a consequence of improving ratios in units like Santander Consumer Finance, the U.K., Brazil, and Sovereign, which offset the rises in Spain and Portugal which, as we mentioned in the last results presentation, will continue to grow for a few more quarters.</p>
          <p>Also, coverage ratios are improving in most of the Group's units. We should emphasize the U.K., Sovereign or Santander Consumer Finance which is already at 122%. Brazil and rest of the Latin American countries are still at very comfortable coverage levels of around 100% or higher.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have excellent coverage ratios at the Group level, 75% which is higher than what we had 12 months ago, and which enables us to continue to compare favorably with our competitors in risk quality.</p>
          <p>As for liquidity, the business dynamic and the Group's ability to capture funds have produced, I mean further improvement in the quarter, so we are in a extremely comfortable position. We've improved retail and wholesale funds by 123 billion in the year, which is double the maturities of wholesale issues envisaged until the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>Also, by September we had already covered all the full program of issues foreseen for the whole year. Our high rating and the centralized or coordinated access to wholesale markets by the parent bank and the 8 subsidiaries, gives us great flexibility to attract funds through different instruments, maturities and currencies. And this two-fold strategy has enabled us to significantly improve our financing structure, that's the deposits in medium and long-term financing, which already cover 113% of our loans. And also, to narrow the lending deposits gap from 150 at the end of 2008, to an excellent 119% today.</p>
          <p>And the last area I will discuss, I'm talking about the strength of our balance sheet, is solvency. We ended September with a core capital ratio of 8.5%. The main changes in the ratio in the said quarter were the generation of ordinary free capital 13 basis points, a drop of 8 basis points, because of that one-off provisioning. Negative impact of 34 basis points from the minority interest in Mexico, and a net rise of 15 basis points after the sale of 2% of Brazil, partially offset by the entry of consumer portfolio.</p>
          <p>We have a very solid capital ratio, especially bearing in mind our business model and our risk profile. And we have a lot of flexibility in our capital management. A good example of this is the active portfolio turnover we've carried out in the last three years, which today gives us a more diversified and a better quality portfolio.</p>
          <p>This improved quality has meant that the Group has practically financed itself since capital consumption for the acquisitions of 200 basis points has been almost completely covered by sale --156 basis points to which we should add our usual capital generation.</p>
          <p>If to this we add an estimated impact of the new Basel requirements of only 70 basis points, 37 to intangibles, 25 for minority interest and 12 for counter party risk, we are in an excellent position that makes us feel very comfortable with the implementation of Basel III.</p>
          <p>Strong profit generation and capital structures, combined with a stable payout policy, are enabling the Santander to maintain a high remuneration via dividend throughout this crisis and recession.</p>
          <p>For the year our payout will be of &#x20AC;0.6 per share, which is the same number as in 2009. Therefore the Santander is consistently offering high shareholder return. Dividend yield has been at over 6% in the last few years, which puts us at the top of the ranking of our peers, almost tripling their average return. And total shareholder return were also above the average and the benchmark index for both short, medium and long term.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to explain the first major pillar in the year, the management of our business portfolio in the last few quarters. I'll bring you up-to-date on main operations. In Germany, we've integrated the retail business of the Scandinavia's Enskilda Bank or SEB. We intend to close this operation at the beginning of 2011 once we can -- we finish installing Personen in Germany. Personen will be the basic operating platform for SEB and the migration process will take 18 months.</p>
          <p>In the UK, we will integrate -- we've integrated over 300 Royal Bank of Scotland branches and their retail and corporate business. The European Commission has already approved the operation. We expect to complete the transaction by the end of 2011 after sorting out the assets of the business acquired and then we will begin the migration to the Santander U.K. platform.</p>
          <p>I'll remind you that this operation, like the one in Germany, is a carve out, that is, we're extracting part of the business from an entity which continues to operate independently. As a consequence, we require strong technological and management capabilities in order to succeed, something that could be done by a very few banks and amongst them, of course, the Santander.</p>
          <p>And, finally, Poland and the acquisition of the BZ WBK Bank. We are still awaiting approval by the Polish regulator, it's a process that usually takes a rather long time. It's an operation we feel has an enormous potential because of the country and for our brands. Poland is a growing, stable and well managed economy, population of almost 40 million and a development level which is similar to that of Spain 20 years ago. Its economy represent 40% of Eastern Europe's GDP, and as a member of the European Union, it will be the largest recipient of development funds in the coming decade. Also the BZ WBK is a large and very well managed bank. It's the third largest by branches and profits, with a business that fits very well with our model and with room to keep growing and improving its efficiency. Also, it has a good management team which will stay on. Therefore, our brand in Poland including the consumer business is expected to bring in close to 500 million in profits in 2015.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to point out that Santander has continued to strengthen its position in the markets where it operate with growth initiatives in product and target -- in product and segment target.</p>
          <p>This slide and following comments will describe our different initiatives. In Spain, a deposits campaign has brought in over 2 percentage point in market share and 100,000 new customers. It has had a very dynamic impact on our branch networks that can be seen from the notable improvement in market share by number of transactions.</p>
          <p>In the U.K. as you know we're focusing on strengthening our SME and card businesses, and in both of them we're having -- had significant growth. In Brazil we're accelerating our growth in key products as Mr. Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez will explain later. Amongst these, payroll loans, mortgages and cards, where we're already operating as issuers and acquirers. The agreement in the acquisition part is beginning to be felt in transaction levels and market share gains.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we're focused on loans linked to payrolls, mortgages and SMEs. In all of these segments we're gaining market share. Finally, Chile started with the highest market share amongst the countries where we operate was over 20%, and nevertheless we're still gaining market share in some segments.</p>
          <p>And now Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez our CFO will discuss the Group's results by the different business areas.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As usual, now that our CEO has discussed the main aspects in the year, I will review the Group's overall results, and the business area. As you know we usually post on our website very detailed country-by-country information. What you see in this screen is the P&amp;L account, we generally show you 2 columns, in the first the variation in the first 9 months the year in accounting terms. And in the second, so you can be draw comparisons more easily, we subtract the exchange rate effect, which is very small.</p>
          <p>I think we can say that the underlying trends are consistent and solid. Basic revenues in emerging markets we have very positive trends, and in our case as our CEO has pointed out, there are 2 different trends. In mature markets, we have restructuring going on, business generation has been very good, and other markets, where we have very consolidated brands, growth has been lower and profits are weaker.</p>
          <p>Cost management is still I would say, as usual, very good overall. The strong drop in recurring provisions, we have seen a drop in recurring provisions of over 10%, and net we have had a growth without the exchange rate and perimeter effect of 7.6%, which is not seen in the final profits because of the one-off I mentioned. Our <mark type="inaudible" /> have been low in the quarter. I will talk about the effect of impact -- the impact of interest rates on our headquarters and the impact of higher minority interest in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Looking at basic revenues, what we see is that the more commercial revenues, the quarterly evolution is very consistent, given the current stage in the cycle. Of course underlying that we have some units that are growing very strongly and others with weaker earnings, as we will see later when we review the different geographies. This is the result of consistent growth in deposits, as you can see deposits are growing very strongly and that continues. And we have seen a change in the trend for lending where we had had negative rates in the last quarters of 2009, still negative in the first quarter of this year, but now positive.</p>
          <p>As for spread, we have 2 different trends, on the one hand in deposits low interest rates in mature markets together with the customer deposit campaigns in Spain have brought down our margins for deposits, but the margins for loans are still evolving very positively. There is a higher cost wholesale financing, and a particular impact in the U.K. with the greater regulatory liquidity needs which imply higher financial costs. On the right hand side of the slide, you can see that we are still significantly closing our lending deposits gap, as our CEO pointed out before.</p>
          <p>As for cost, I'd say that it's business as usual. Our retail units in Europe and the U.K. are all with negative costs. We continue with the restructuring costs, and overall in Sovereign costs are down 11%, Mexico and Brazil cost increased below inflation. Chile, that we have plan to open new branches. We've signed a new collective bargaining agreement with slight upfront salary raises, and that's why in Chile cost are growing above inflation.</p>
          <p>As for provisioning, ordinary provisions, we have an increase at the Group level of 9% because of the impact of the Bank of Spain's new regulations, excluding that we would be seeing a drop of 10.5%. That's a pretty stable trend in generics in comparison with previous quarters. If we look in detail, we see that provisions have been falling almost constantly in the last 5 quarters, both in Brazil and in the U.K. and Sovereign, as well as in Latin America, except for Brazil. The only exception is Spain and Portugal because of the economic circumstances which indicates the underlying businesses in both countries. In general the emerging markets and restructuring markets are doing very well, and Spain and Portugal weaker.</p>
          <p>As to our &#x2013; the quarter, there hasn't been much growth, basically because of a significant impact of exchange rates. The generic provisions fund amounts to almost 6.5 billion, of which about 1.4 billion are for Spain, which this quarter have used up around &#x20AC;450 million.</p>
          <p>If we look at an underlying aspect of the business, financial revenues plus commissions minus loan provisioning, we see that the business is solid and consistent, with growth of around 8% without considering the exchange rate and perimeter effects. So overall the underlying businesses are growing significantly with the differences between them I have mentioned, and when we look at the different units you will see that most clearly.</p>
          <p>Let's turn, you can see as we saw in the previous slide that we have the same trends, Brazil still has very solid dynamics, Continental Europe is decreasing, the U.K. and Sovereign also very good trends, and Latin America, except for Brazil, very similar to what we see or saw in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to the different business geographies, starting with Continental Europe, as usual. The income statement for the first 9 months shows the difficult business environment. Gross income down 2%, in the area overall against the backdrop of low growth in lending, interest rates at record lows and strong competition for deposits.</p>
          <p>Costs are flat, slightly decreasing, as we saw earlier. They only rose in SCF, because of the increased perimeter with AIG, Poland and the U.S. portfolios. It's not so much the portfolios but the servicing of those portfolios in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Provisioning also remained fairly stable after excluding the one-off impact of the Bank of Spain's new regulation, and the net of all this was attributable profit in the first nine months of 2.175 billion, 3% down in the same period of 2009. But without the one-off we have had a very good performance in consumer finance, growing at 3%. We will see later that business dynamics are very good. Global banking and markets have produced slightly less profits than last year, which was extraordinarily good. And this year it's around minus 7%. But still very solid profit generation.</p>
          <p>Analyzing the different units included in Continental Europe, the Santander branch network. We can see the trends that we've mentioned in previous quarters. Strong growth in deposits, as a result, of course of our campaign, with 34% inter annual growth. Lending still weak, slight drop in lending overall, down 3%, particularly for mortgages. And as a result of that our results reflect this tough environment. Pressure on revenues from less activity, lower spreads on deposits and fee income still weak because of low volumes. Costs continue to register negative growth, and provisioning with or without this one-off reflect the impact of the new regulation. Without them provisions have remained pretty stable, with limited use of generic provision.</p>
          <p>Although Banesto has already shown their balance, they are staying in focus with volumes of deposits captured; comparative going down, relatively flat cost. And as part of the objective they have -- had set by their leading teams, they are fulfilling their plans for credit quality and stability. As we have seen in their financial balance of what the Bank of Spain calls troubled assets, these are the data we have. We have already supplied these data in the past, and since have remained the same so far. We have a lower exposure in this sector in general. Our exposure is lower. We have less troubled assets.</p>
          <p>Our credit portfolio in Spain is around 14% or 15%, and in the area are -- troubled assets are 8%, clearly below our market share proportion, and our weight in exposure to the real estate and construction industries is below 30% versus 30% as an average in the industry, as we have already in prior occasions. And this lower weight is reflected in all sectors.</p>
          <p>As for coverage, our coverage is higher in all areas, both specific and specific loss generic, as well as acquired assets. So our most generic coverage is 8 points above the industry, and as we add the capacity to generate earnings, our coverage would be 80%, well above 67% industry average.</p>
          <p>But this is just an update as we have already provided during the first quarter of this year when the Bank of Spain coined this termination of troubled assets and called for a greater need to be more transparent in this area.</p>
          <p>Moving over to Portugal now, the situation is very similar to that of Spain, although credit is slightly better. The evolution is very similar to that of the Spanish network, we're growing healthily in deposits and similarly in credit.</p>
          <p>Income  has been slow due to a drop in spreads. There is intense competition for liabilities in a system that has -- had a difficult environment in the last few month. Costs keep driving down, and although spreads are below those of 2009 a change in trend has been detected in the last month. So perhaps this trend of lower profitability of deposits remains.</p>
          <p>As for Santander Consumer Finance, it had a good positive and growing evolution. Loan production has gained momentum in the last few months. In terms of countries, we're growing a lot in the U.S., Nordic countries and Italy, relatively stable in Germany.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> in Spain, because actually production in Spain is growing significantly compared to last year. Deposit have gone very well, they are doing very well, particularly due to new deposits in Germany, around 20 billion, so it's healthy growth.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> environment and increase in spreads is generating better results leading to a growth of around 30%. There is a slight effect on Santander Consumer Finance as our CEO was pointing out, and according to the change in the letter of the Bank of Spain, but even in these conditions our earnings are growing soundly and we believe <mark type="audio gap" /> (33:40 &#x2013; 34:43) the company is increasing market share. The whole sector is growing by 4%, but as we go to the SME world our growth is already 23. And in the core business we are growing at 14%. Deposits are also growing and an interesting rate, 7%. And in terms of results, we are witnessing spreads on assets following a positive trend, and liabilities there's a compression. Costs are higher due to wholesale, financing and due to higher liquidity requirements from the regulator that has led, or that have had a significant impact on the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the sales side we're improving costs, but there's restriction in the spreads, lower needs for provisions and clear improvement of credits or loans, and the positive growth. The continuation of these trends in the next few months, combined with controlled costs point to a highly positive profit growth.</p>
          <p>Brazil, we are going to start talking about Brazil. I believe that their situation, and that of the rest of the countries in Latin America, are very similar. The attributable profits from Brazil have been 2.079 billion, 8% more than the same period in 2009, after deducting the larger minority interest from October. Growth before minority interest has been 26%, which is the best example of the business run rate. This 26% is very positive.</p>
          <p>Growth is based on growing revenues, and we've continued to grow quarter-after-quarter through an improvement in activity. We will later see how these activities lead to greater revenues, and also due to higher net interest income, although some regulatory changes have been introduced. Particularly there is an IFS rate that used to go to commissions and now it doesn't. Without that impact our commissions would be growing at a rate of 8%. Cost are controlled and the low inflation and provisions, along with the economic improvements of the country has declined for the fourth consecutive quarter. With all this, the attributable profits to the Group coming from Brazil every quarter is approximately $1 billion per quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of activity, we noticed that in the third quarter lending has grown as an annualized rate of 20%, inter-annual 15; remember that late last year our rates were negative, and these have improved throughout the year. In certain products, as our CEO mentioned a while ago, we are growing at very interesting rate. And we are improving our growth rate in the area of SME.</p>
          <p>In savings we're becoming a lot more selective. We are capturing figures that depend on the need for liquidity rather than on the client policy. And so we are growing at a rate of about 15%. We've had greater revenue due to higher volume, and well managed costs lead to solid profit growth in coming quarters. And lately, the most important milestone is the integration of the brand that will take place in November. The rest of Latin America, excluding Brazil, and I would say their situation is pretty similar to that of Brazil, the evolution of credit for instance is late 2009 was 15% is going to minus 3%, plus 2 in June and plus 7 in September.</p>
          <p>In detail all of the countries have significant growth, except in Mexico which significantly affects the overall growth based on our decision to change the retail strategy in Mexico due to low quality of the credit portfolio that has actually been hurtful to us. In terms of result, the net interest income is pressured by lower interest rates than in 2009 and incentives mix towards lower risk products, for instance the reduction of the card business in Mexico has had a strong impact on the total results.</p>
          <p>However, there is a lower cost of risk, which is reflected in the reduction in provisions. This makes significantly <mark type="inaudible" /> basic revenues minus provision to have a clearer idea of the area evolution, and this shows a sustained quarterly growth over the past 2 years.</p>
          <p>This evolution is spilling through to net operating income, showing a strong improvement during the quarter, and profit of the region is 1.84 billion, in other words 14% higher than last year. Mexico's profit have grown by 22%, Chile by 10%, Argentina has risen to 25% with net income saving growing by more than 30%, quarterly risk improving NPL ratios below 2% and coverage nearly 140%.</p>
          <p>Naturally we have wide levels of liquidity in all units. Uruguay's profits have increased by 26%, Puerto Rico remains pretty flat, Colombia is lower because of changes in interest rates, and operating income after provision has grown by 36%.</p>
          <p>In general terms there is a faster pace of business -- adjusted &#x2013; to the business depend on the quality in each country. In Chile, we are broadening our sales capacity, and the cost of credit is falling in general term and all point to a good performance of earnings in coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Allow me to elaborate a little bit on Mexico and Chile. Particularly these 2 countries due to their primary importance in this panorama. In Mexico in the third quarter the growth rate has &#x2013; annualized growth rate has been 27% with all sectors growing except cards. Savings are growing interestingly and with a good spread dynamic.</p>
          <p>In terms of compared &#x2013; intra annual comparisons, well the area of card have an influence of minus 24%, costs remain below inflation, provision have declined for the third consecutive quarter. And I would say this has to be related to the reduction in income from cards. But all of this is reflected in net operating income after provisions and attributable profits higher than those of previous quarters, particularly compared to 2009. And I must also point out that from the attributable profits of the third quarter, there is an impact of $20 million due to the integration of 25% of the Bank of America in September. So the impact for that month is $20 million.</p>
          <p>Chile, I would say that qualitatively the trends are the same. Good growth of lending, good growth in fund. As you can &#x2013; as you probably know, Chile has increased their interest rates in an environment of strong economic growth and slightly decrease in inflation. Their net interest income increased by 14% backed by higher inflation. You know that in Chile we have actual interest rates compared to face rates that are not reflected in the net interest income, because there were significant surpluses last year. We have lower provisions again in this quarter, as in the rest of the region, and there was a good performance of net operating income after provisions, which closes the latest quarter with 21% higher than its equivalent last year.</p>
          <p>And finally, let's go over the units. Sovereign, results at Sovereign are highly favorable, were above profits. When we talk about provisions for the next few years, we were talking about $150 million and the accumulative at 184 million for the first quarter which is a very good delivery.</p>
          <p>The credit score positions continues to improve. We have said that we are discontinuing approximately 20% of the credit portfolio, and as you can see there is drop of approximately 49%. Good behavior of core deposits. It is true that the rest of deposits, like CDs we've had a less aggressive pricing policy; at a time we became very aggressive with Sovereign for liquidity reasons and this has driven deposits down a little bit, but this has improved our &#x2013; the cost of funds.</p>
          <p>In the last quarter it has been driven up, however, because we are beginning to hire agents for retail business in SMEs, lower need for provisions due to improved credit quality and coverage, its improving in the first quarter. We had already had a positive trend of 2 quarters, and now they add up to 5. In credit quality and coverage the growth in the third quarter has been 157 million, with a cumulative of $384 million.</p>
          <p>In corporate activities, I will refer as usual to the differences between this year and last. We have greater losses up to September. The interest rate is due to the higher cost of funds, lower ROF going from a profit from 402 last year to losses of 226 million in 2010. In other words, minus &#x20AC;226 million; have two components, the highest one is the exchange rate and the counterpart of that is a 500 million generated in business loan. And then last year earnings from sales of our core portfolios were positive, and these results have been obtained this year by selling our <mark type="inaudible" /> participations. So the net effect comes from interest rate coverage, although a positive in business areas are negative in the corporate sector.</p>
          <p>The secondary segments, we'll skim through them quickly. Just a few ideas to point out. Retail banking has survived consistently with high resistance to the environment. And last quarter the impact of the letter had been noticeable, but the generation of profit had been consistent, and the management of assets and insurance the recovery of the second quarter located well above that of last year.</p>
          <p>Here we're gathering a single area profit from asset management and insurance are generating approximately 1 billion in the third quarter, approximately 9% of the total Group income. And finally, wholesale banking remains at normalized figures as in the last few quarters, lower than last year though. At least lower than the first quarter of 2009 due to an extremely favorable environment back then. Wholesale banking is reducing lending and increasing deposits.</p>
          <p>And now I will give the floor back to our CEO for him to elaborate on the final conclusions of this presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have reviewed the Group's strategy and evolution. And I would like to finish by pointing out 7 ideas that sum up my views of a highly complex period in which Santander has offered a differential performance. First, once more, we have reported solid recurring results backed by diversifications and the drive of emerging units that make up for the slowdown in other units.</p>
          <p>Second, due to the greater efforts we have made in provisions by applying the new Bank of Spain letter in an exercise of the utmost caution. Considering that this has gone entirely, that the profit without using generic provisions and with very strict criteria in order to present a release of real estate income which has favored our P&amp;L balance, thanks to an increase of the net margin in Santander.</p>
          <p>Third, because we have improved our credit quality with stable NPL throughout the Group and a reduction, a generalized reduction of NPL and risk premiums, high coverage of up to 75%, 2 percentage points over June, and supported by 6.5 billion of generic funds at Group level.</p>
          <p>Fourth, due to our excellent liquidity position which we have further strengthened during this quarter. Fifth, due to our capital strength with the core capital up 8.5%, which places us in a very comfortable position vis a vis Basel III.</p>
          <p>Sixth, due to our active business management, which leads to a more diversified portfolio and one of a higher quality. Seventh and last, because we're sailing through the crisis while maintaining our dividend policy. For years, we have been one of the banks with highest remuneration for its shareholders, and we will do the same thing this year.</p>
          <p>Considering the oncoming quarters, we will continue to actively manage the dual world we have been facing lately. On the one side the developed markets, we have weakness and pressure on revenues, and provisions that will vary according to different markets. And on the other side, a better situation in emerging markets fueled by faster business pace that will offset pressure on spreads, coming from a better environment and a gradual change of mix, and based on further reductions in the cost of credit.</p>
          <p>All of this while we face potential changes of the regulatory framework that are still undefined in many aspects, but which are expected to affect key drivers of our business. Today, Santander is sufficiently prepared to meet the new scenario, and to make the best out of our high potentiality to create value.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Usually we will start by answering the questions, received through the internet and if we have time we will answer telephone questions.

        <plist>
          <p>First of all going to strategy regulation and capital, we have one first question about Poland from Britta Schmidt, Autonomous. They asked whether we can update the situation of the discussions or the status of the discussion with Polish regulators and when could the agreement possibly be signed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>During the presentation I did mentioned this topic. Poland is a country where bureaucratic operations take a long time, and according to the background we have studied these usually take a long time. We have already started requesting authorization and permits. We have received a positive outlook from the authorities but it's very difficult to set a specific figure or deadline.</p>
          <p>We believe it will take months, months will go by before we get these permits. Of course we are trying to speed them up as much as we can. And we seen to have an open and full cooperation from the Polish authorities but it would be very difficult to establish a specific deadline today.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About capital, Marcelo Sanardo from Sanford Bernstein asks, considering the situation in Europe about capital enlargement and activity in M&amp;A, do you think capital enlargement is likely and can you make any comments about possible evolutions in this area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a definite no. We have said this 3 times already, the bank is not considering any capital enlargements whatsoever. There is no need for that. We are absolutely comfortable with our capital. We are generating capital organically and we will continue to do so in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>We feel fully comfortable facing Basel III, considering that the risk assets will grow moderately in the full Group, and considering that no acquisitions are in the horizon. We feel, as I have said, fully comfortable with our capital levels, and there is absolutely no need for capital enlargements today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There are several questions on Basel III. Some about the impact, about DTAs and <mark type="inaudible" />, Willie Chandler from Barclays, Carlos Peixoto from BPI, Andreas Heinke from MedioBanca Antonio Ramirez from Keefe and Neil Smith from Western Leeds .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have said in the presentation that the impact of Basel is 70 basis points, basically 37 from intangibles, 25 from minorities and 12 through counterparty risk. Obviously, these are figure up to 2013. As for DTA, either because they expire or because they're within the 10% of the new regulation, this would not affect those 70 basis points that's the total impact of Basel III. I am summarizing it this way, because there are several questions about the topic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is question from Patrick Lee from Sovereign and Rollie Chandra from Barclays , about capital in the Group. Can we help them understand the difference between local capital request by regulators and capital in the headquarters, and what the possible best way to consider capital allocation per country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the figures you're asking about have been calculated. Well, local capital is calculated under local criteria and the consolidated Group capital is calculated based on the criteria of the Bank of Spain, which is the ultimate or relevant regulator in this case. So, obviously, these 2 figures are not the same and cannot be calculated directly. You cannot subtract local ratios from the total and try to estimate the matrix in capital.</p>
          <p>Well, as you can imagine the Bank of Spain is very close to us. I believe the capital of the parent is approximately 11%, that's the figure I have seen in some documents, and people attempting to seek the apparent capital. It's approximately 11%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is another question from Daragh Quinn, Nomura about capital. She is asking what the reasonable amount of capital, or objective amount of capital will be under Basel III. She does not specify whether it is for the whole industry. I understand this is open for discussion then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is, it is a subject open for discussion. There is a whole set of set parameters, still some of them are &#x2013; have not been set. But today our expectation is reaching above 9% core capital by the end of 2011. But we're expecting the definitive standards on systemic risk and how it affects our different units, and our specific area. Considering the difference between entities depending on their risk level, business profiles, connectivity and other factors. It is under discussion right now. So it's perhaps too early to define absolute comprehensive levels for all elements. But considering what we know so far, we believe that if the Group manages to reach 9% in May 2011 we would feel a lot more comfortable vis-&#xE0;-vis Basel III.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About our subsidiary in the U.K. there are several questions, Carlos Peixoto from BPI, Daragh Quinn from Nomura, <mark type="inaudible" /> and Antonio Ramirez from Keefe about a possible listing of Santander U.K. and the U.K. market. Are we still considering it? Have we dismissed this idea? What's the rationale for this listing? Are we including Mexico in that potential listing? And would we reconsider the idea for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, listing Santander U.K. is a decision that has already been made. Perhaps we have not decided when. Obviously it will take place in 2011, and it's highly likely that it will happen early next year, but there is no specific date set yet.</p>
          <p>I believe the rationale is known to all. No need to repeat that as we have discussed it a number of times. That's the U.K. As for Mexico nothing has been decided yet about the matter. These are mere speculations, based on a fluffy idea that might or might not come to fruition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From M&amp;A General, we have two questions from Jaime  Beseril and Ignacio Bari. Have we considered to continue to expand through Europe? Do we have any further expansion strategy? There are also a couple of questions about Asia and other minority participation in European or stakes in European banks, and the strategy for inorganic growth in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think I mentioned this earlier when we were talking about capital, and about not increasing capital. Right now we are not planning to acquire anything. Neither in Europe nor elsewhere. And so the work we have to do now is more about consolidation and integrating what we've already acquired. And implementing things that are still pending in our integration processes, like those carve outs in the U.K. and Germany, and continuing to integrate the remainder businesses. That's as far as integration and acquisitions. Nothing planned, nothing in the horizon in terms of acquisitions or bringing in any new units.</p>
          <p>As for minority interests, I think the market now in general we are not in favor of taking up minority stakes. Our idea always is to take up a majority stake and have management control. But anyway that's what we've done traditionally and always and in principle, that's our basic policy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About strategy, Daragh Quinn from Nomura is asking about inorganic growth in the U.S.. So we've already answered that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About profit, Pier Alexandre from Oddo is asking whether we are holding to that guidance of 8.8 billion, &#x20AC;8.9 billion in net profit for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will talk risk weighted assets in a minute, answer the question about profits. Well, I think we already said in the press release that, in fact, with the new regulations by the Bank of Spain, which came out after that guidance was issued we are not maintaining that guidance, I think we explained that clearly in the press release. I suppose they have received that press release which said what the effect of that one-off provision was going to be, and the impact per quarter and how profits were going to be growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As for risk weighted asset, Benji Koura from Maguire is asking why the drop or the slight downwards variation in risk-weighted assets in Q3 versus Q2? Any particular driver or is it business as usual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's true that there has been a slight drop in risk-weighted assets in the quarter. By areas, I think that reflects the business trends. We've had growth in risk-weighted assets in Latin America of course. Slight drops, in line with lending activity in our lending portfolios in Spain. Basically stable in the U.K., because then we have two effects, slight growth in lending activity of 3 to 4% and a slight drop in securities portfolios which offsets that. So, basically risk-weighted assets have remained pretty stable in the U.K. And there is a slightly larger drop in Sovereign due to the de-risking process we're carrying out, and that's the major trends I think for the future.</p>
          <p>With respect to Basel III, we expect risk-weighted assets in the U.S. to experience two impacts. One direction, the growth that we expect and we're beginning to see in our retail activity, but also in the coming years it will be a process as we move from the standard model to the IRB, model in all the Latin American countries, and that will probably have some effect in the opposite direction. But, in general, in the Group, since most of our risk-weighted assets are in mature markets, we don't see that those are going to grow significantly. They will remain at fairly low figures in terms of growth of risk-weighted assets in general.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As for the new Bank of Spain regulations Carlos Peixoto and Noray Chandra are asking, whether we expect any particular effect on provisioning levels in the future as a result of this change in regulations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, well slight decrease, not very significant, because what really matters here is that there is change in the rules of the game, and from now on this will mean a slightly reduced need for provisioning. It's more about the new entries in NPLs than about the effect that bringing forward the calendar will have, although it will be a slight effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is another question about whether we're going to maintain the dividend, and you've already explained that in the presentation. &#x20AC;0.60 is the total payout for the year. And in 2011, we will let you know as the year goes by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Daragh Quinn from Nomura again is asking whether the impact of the new Bank of Spain regulations, if you could explain what that's going to be for Spain and Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Impact is only for Spain. For Latin America and the remainder of the Group, we made it clear in the presentation the criteria that we use there. And we try -- IFRS or internal models whatever is most conservative in each case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as for financial management, there is several questions about capital gains. David Vaamonde from Fidentiis, Matteo Ramenghi from UBS, Antonio Ramirez from Keefe and they're asking whether these are in the corporate center or in the ROF? Can we confirm the amount and the reason? There's another question connected to this, which is why the negative ROF? I think you've seen that in the presentation too. And then in connection with this they're asking about our current hedge &#x2013; no, coverage or hedging strategy for exchange rate, both in the quarter and in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not really any changes there. You know we have two kinds of hedges for the exchange rate. One for the 8% excess of the book value of our stakes in the different banks, for anything above 8% we have a hedge, and the positive or negative effect of that is against reserves not against the hedges capital. And then we have hedges against the expected profit in the different subsidiaries. Mutual hedges I mentioned in that presentation I said that together with the CLO capital gains, these have produced significant losses because currencies in general have appreciated significantly versus the euro, and that together with the Sienna capital gains is in that ROF of the corporate centers as I explained. Our current hedge strategy is the same, basically we have in the relevant subsidiaries, of course we don't have hedges for the Norwegian Kroner because &#x2013; for any profits generated by our Consumer Finance business in Norway, but the significant subsidiaries like Brazil, the U.K. and so on we have hedges for the expected profit in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay there is a question about the tax rate, Antonio Ramirez [Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods] is asking why it's gone up in the quarter and what are the main drivers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is from profit generation in countries with a higher tax rate. I think we've explained this before in the past; that's generally the main effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs is asking about changes in the valuation adjustments for equities in the quarter. There is a variation about 2 billion on variable rates versus the -- versus Q2. And subsequent impact on core capital I think Pepe could give you more details about that if you like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the question is actually about the drop that we've experienced in reserves in our core capital calculations. And here there's two effects. The major one, because as you know our capital ratio is calculated looking at net of all reserve minus goodwill. When exchange rates which is happened this quarter in some countries, particularly the pound sterling and the Brazilian real drop, reserves drop but so does the goodwill, so the capital ratio's net. If you only look at reserves then it looks as if they are growing down, but you also have to look at the drop in the goodwill.</p>
          <p>The second impact, as you know, is in the coverage we provide for capital in each country up to only 8% which is the capital ratio in the Group. So in the capital in the subsidiaries anything above that 8% is not covered and therefore &#x2013; or hedged &#x2013;  when there is a depreciation in those countries, in the 2 I mentioned that generate negative reserves in the Group offset because the risk-weighted assets in those 2 countries are worth less too, and that's one of the reasons why there was that drop in risk-weighted assets in the quarter 2, which was asked before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay about dividends, Irma Garrido from Ahorro Corporaci&#xF3;n is asking about our payout policy and whether we can say anything about the next years? Shareholder return or remuneration and do we believe or expect that the scrip dividend might be extended to the third interim dividend in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our payout policy I think has been very clearly specified. Both payout and total dividend is going to be $0.60 per share. We are planning a second scrip dividend for our third interim dividend, hasn't yet been formally approved by the Group, but our intention is to do that. Our intention to have a second scrip for the third interim dividend, and again the bank's policy will remain the same -- same payout policy, same total return for the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's several questions about capital. About the new regulations not yet defined, we have several questions from Arturo Frias, Evolution, and Javier Bernat, from Caja Madrid. They're basically asking how likely do we think, is it that there might be special regulations for the largest highest entities, do we think it will be 100 or 200 basis points? In general will banks, and ourselves particularly, have to have a counter cycle capital buffer and how large? And don't we think that it might be better to be proactive and make sure our core capital ratio is as high as possible as soon as possible? These are all basically around the same point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is still a very opened ended issue. There's an ongoing debate on how this will be defined in terms of systemic risk banks. There's even some discussion about how we define what's &#x2013; which banks will be defined as having systemic risk. And there is certainly a significant debate on the type of treatment they're talking about. More stringent capital requirements but also about other alternatives, like contingency capital or bail in, or things of that type</p>
          <p>I think it's too early really now to say anything in terms of how this debate, these discussions will end. Because even the regulators are yet to come to some agreement on different positions &#x2013; different regulators and dialogue with the industry continues, and so this is something that changes practically every week, and so lets wait a little. I think there will be a decision fairly soon, probably in the first semester next year we will have a clearer idea, and so then we will have a chance to discuss it and to see what the impact might be. I think now it would be rather difficult to predict what the regulators will ultimately decide on this. It's still very early days.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About capital, Luis Pe&#xF1;a from JB is asking the breakdown of those 15 basis points of capital growth in the quarter from the sales in Brazil and the U.S.A. portfolios.

          <p>Santiago L&#xF3;pez is asking whether we believe that there will be a capital increase in 2011? That's already been answered by our CEO and no we won't.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Javier Bernat is asking about the weight that hybrids may have in the banks -- potentially I guess in the new environment, do we have any idea about where we are going with hybrids?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we know so far about hybrids that the traditional hybrids, that is the old upper Tier II and lower Tier II preferred shares, since none of the ones we have fulfilled our requirement that are currently going to be set in the future in terms of absolute or almost absolute discussionality in coupon payments. There is a calendar established where either on first call or maturity those will gradually disappear, but we don't know about the new capital hybrids because they haven't been defined yet. But that's connected again with the previous question about the counter cyclical buffers, and the IFIs and so on, and we think that hybrids might play some role there. Whether it's going to be instruments with a haircut or core cut, or all the different instruments that are being discussed, and also the possibility part of this going to Pillar II.  That is to a model that will take into account a business -- a different business model of the different banks. But these are things that are still under discussion; all we know is that current hybrids have limited life span, and the new will be different and are still undefined.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A question from Ignacio Fedesa from JP, what do we think will be the evolution of the risk premium on 2010? Doesn't say whether it's by geographies or in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've explained that risk premium had been going down consistently, and we expect it to continue to go down in the main emerging markets and the whole of Latin America, but also in the U.K. and in Sovereign. Risk premiums are also going down although of course you have to discuss whether it's generics or not, but we don't think that for the Group, the risk premium is going to do anything but continue to go down.</p>
          <p>Okay. I'm told that the <mark type="inaudible" /> capital gains, it seems that the amount who is not clear, we announced its relevant fact, 233 million. We announced it as the relevant fact back then and that's in the ROF of the corporate center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as cost, Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs is asking whether we can say something about the quarterly trend? Why have costs risen so much in the quarter? There is some one-off effect there or is there an exchange rate effect? You want to elaborate, there is that AIG thing in Poland?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well perimeter effect, that's just AIG in Poland and some servicing of the U.S. portfolios, the ones we are not acquiring. It's not so much portfolios themselves because they include servicing, and servicing is purely a fee against cost business. So that's the 2 change of perimeter effect.</p>
          <p>In general, costs in the European unit have gone down. I have mentioned that cost have gone up in Chile because we've opened new branches. The change of perimeter effect plus costs has gone up slightly in wholesale banking. When you look at the wholesale banking P&amp;L, plus we are increasing our activities in some markets where we are providing hedges. Part of our strategy in the U.S. Sovereign will have some business in its geography with large corporates, and the U.K. too we're increasing that business. And also some IT investment for wholesale banking -- possibly increased activity within those 700 or 800 customers we have. There's been increased activity in plain vanilla products, and we have been doing some IT investments in global banking and markets too. Which is why costs have gone up basically. I don't know whether its cost growth in the quarter or in the year, but only very slight.</p>

          <p>Ignacio Cerezo and Alejandro Rovira  from JP and Kemper are asking, do we expect in Q4 to divest anything or have any extraordinary allocation to provisions for any retirement or anything else? And Arturo is asking can we issue some guidance for corporate center in 2011, since the numbers in Q3 have been lower than in other quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't know, for now it's too early to say. We will talk about that 3 months from now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And about the corporate sector, do you want to elaborate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no a guidance there either. Corporate center for 2011 started trends, well the corporate center in general terms it's highly volatile amongst other things, basically because of the exchange rate effect. There is another element, which will be negative, and that's that the cost of funding for corporate activities, which is a wholesale funding, because that's how we finance our corporate center activities, will have a negative impact. And the corporate center includes <mark type="inaudible" />, the parent companies <mark type="inaudible" /> costs which I don't are going to show any significant variations. And then there is the exchange rate, and it's hard to say. We will maintain our hedging policy at the corporate center, it makes a profit it will be because there will be a depreciation of currencies, and if it has losses, it's because currencies will have appreciated, the more volatile element.</p>
          <p>Cost of funding will be slightly higher but not much higher because that's not a lot of funding. And the exchange rates, again, that's a major issue; at some point in the past we charged here in the corporate center some write-downs like <mark type="inaudible" /> maybe, but apart from that kind of things, those are the elements that can help us make forecasts for the corporate center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Javier Bernat is asking can we say something about cost of capital for the group as a whole? And how do we calculate our costs of capital? I suppose he means economic capital. You know, that's risk weighted. And we don't disclose. But in general for the Group can we say something about cost of capital? I think that's basically it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Internally, we do use the cost of capital level. It's not based on share prices, it's based on the risk premium, plus the risk free bonus. For internal purposes we change this every year. We are now at around 13% internally, that's the number we use, but if I'm not mistaken, technical element that the German two-year bond, the risk premium plus EBITDA over market, that's what we've been using, and it changes every year. Of course, we look at the last 2 years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Rohith Chandra from Barclays is asking about the evolution of NPLs in Spain, both sector wide and our own, and when do we think the trend will change, and what do we expect for the next quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About NPLs from now on there are different opinions, we think &#x2013; we think and we still believe that we haven't reached the highest point yet. We think there will be still a slight growth in the next quarters, certainly in the next 3 quarters, until we get probably overall of course that's our best guess, but again it's only a guess. But we do you think that NPLs will continue to rise slightly for a couple more quarters at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, there several questions about sub prime in Spain, about coverage for different assets allocated and acquired, several question from JP from Iberian and from MF Global about that about real estate assets coverage, about value of collaterals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have all information in slide 76 of the annex of the main presentation. This is what we disclosed, which is 4 point some billions, the coverage and foreclosures, acquired and coverage and losses in each case. So you can check all the details there, because there is lots of very detailed questions there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going into business areas. And as for Spain, Daragh Quinn is asking how concerned are we about a double dip in Spain. And again, the risk quality we have already talked about, but specific question about probability of a double dip, and are we concerned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well not really, no. In fact we think our major concern is about slow growth more than about the possibility of a double dip. I think the risk of double dip is not really significant right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About financial margins and net interest income in Spain, there is several questions about that from Patrick Lee from Softgen too is asking. They have different questions about the financial margin, why is it going down? Our net interest income, what do we expect for the future? Cost of funding, cost of deposits? How we are managing our net interest income over assets? Are we are gaining market share? I think you heard something about this in the presentation and also comparing our trend in absolute terms with the spreads published, or reported. What do we do, given the drop in spread, to keep our net interest income up? And that summarizes the 4 or 5 questions on this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well about net interest income in Spain, it's been weak, dropping in fact. We talked about this several times, and of course what's happening here is volumes on the lending side are going down. Lending is going down in both the Santander network and Banesto, so that's a negative impact. Then deposits are growing, but we have a campaign underway. We're offering high interest rates, so the impact of that is also negative for the net interest income.</p>
          <p>It's a very positive step commercially, and we think it will give us consistent market share gains in the future, but short-term it does have a negative impact on our net interest income. And as for spreads on the lending side I'd say slightly positive. We think there is still some way to go.</p>
          <p>Spreads have risen in fact significantly for SME and corporate lending, not so much for mortgages where spreads are still very low, and we expect to see some rising. And as for funds, there are some <mark type="inaudible" /> that have funds campaigns on the way by many banks, and so spreads on the funding, on the customer funds side are basically dependent on the intensity of the competition from the different players in the markets. So lending spreads we think are going to rise slightly, not so much because of the interest rate occurrence, mortgages were appreciating at 120 now it's 150, and it seems that that could continue and that would be a positive impact, but the negative impact would be whatever happens with deposits.</p>
          <p>Wholesale funding of course the turnover of  that -- general there's going to be less being acquired and maturing, but there will be a negative cost impact because the costs are rising. Net interest income will be weak. We cannot specify exactly how large it will be, but we expect net interest income to be weak and high dependent basically on the deposits wars, because that's really the hardest variable to predict.</p>
          <p>[Spanish]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll provide details when we finish the presentation. Kindly <mark type="inaudible" /> speak about deposits war with two basic questions. Do we believe it will continue and will there be further deposit wars in Spain should the Bank of Spain intervene somehow? And they are comparing our evolution in deposits. They continue to ask about net interest income, why we doing better than others, our evolution in deposits and why both Santander and Banesto have fallen this quarter? Do we intend to launch any further deposit campaigns and can we provide some guidance? And since most these questions have already been answered perhaps you would like to say something about price war in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, I think we have covered deposits. It's a piece of data we have already provided. Obviously, the price war was initiated by Santander but now it's an overall game and we will have to sit back and see how it evolves I wouldn't want to forecast any -- what the future strategies will be, we will see how things go depending on competition and the behavior of other actors in the scene. So we'll just have to wait and see. We have no specific answer for that question right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And to finish with Spain there's a question about an increase in interest rates and its possible impact both in net operating income and on NPL. Do we have any ideas about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, its influence on net interest income will be clearly positive. This is a provision of the balance, unless there is a high <mark type="inaudible" /> which is not our case it will be frankly positive for all deposits. In terms of NPL, I believe we're -- this aspect is little bit over-estimated. If we take a look at the mortgage portfolio which is the most sensitive one to this aspect, we clearly see that most of that portfolio has reached a 5.5 or 6% at some points. So it would have some effect in NPL, but it is also true that at a certain point in 2007-2008, the real estate portfolio was re-preciated, as it is it now, 1.2, 1.3 minus spread. Yes, increasing interest rate would imply a little bit more NPL, a little bit. I don't think it would increase a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Britta Schmidt about the increase in inter-banking deposits. Have they increased because we're generating cash, or is it due to some other reason?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is basically yes. As you have seen in the presentation, we're living in a sales gap closure and that generates interest that obviously affects us on the asset side in terms of increased balances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going into different units as I was saying, the United Kingdom's Sergio Gamez asked whether we can say something about the competitive environment in the U.K., particularly on the resale liability side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have seen no significant changes so far in big numbers. It is true that the spread in that deals has grown weaker, particularly on retail but we have grown noticeably and SME and corporate liabilities. It is true that in retail we have a lower spread but that's been offset by the increase of the net interest income, but yes, it has been a competitive environment, not just now, I would say for the last year and a half or two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question from United Kingdom <mark type="inaudible" /> and Daragh Quinn from Nomura. Can we classify the new liquidity requirements and their impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can actually tell you what those requirements are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the specific presentation about U.K., can you show the impacts on net interest income and spreads of these new liquidity requirements?</p>
          <p>Claire Kane from MF asked about the evolution of spreads for clients &#x2013; net interest income is somewhat dropping, is that due to liquidity requirements and what trend have we observed here for the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would say, if I remember correctly, this quarter we had an increase of the commercial spread of 2 basis points and an effect on the net interest income of 8 basis points. But I'm saying this off the top of my head. So the effect is negative; the liquidity effect is not a one-off as we grow the balance, but the process of fulfilling the regulation is a one-off event. So these considerations cannot be projected in time. We cannot assume that it will cost the same thing in oncoming quarters. But I believe that in the U.K. spreads between credits and deposits are 2 minus 8, or minus the 8 basis points due to wholesale funding for &#x2013; by liquid assets to fulfill the FTA regulations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions left from the U.K. Can we explain what the restructuring process looks like, above the capital enlargement of the &#x20A4;4.5 billion, and the new view of the Group asked by Raoul Leonard from RBS, and the second one Arturo Frias from Evolution. The cost of credit has been decreasing in the last 4 months, but it's still somewhat held 19 basis points for the area that is predominantly real estate. Do we expect any further drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the cost of risk, we have had a positive surplus in the last few months, so there is no reason to believe the situation will change. Obviously you need to consider that we are growing 21% in credit to SMEs and 12% in our core loans to corporate. So the mix will affect the cost of credit in the future and it will also affect spreads. But like-for-like we are still improving in loans.</p>
          <p>For capital enlargement and the businesses group transfer. Well the capital enlargement was done for buying the assets from RBS, and the businesses we will be transferring are the ones from the United Kingdom, or at least those that were not within their perimeter. Basically consumer finance, credit card and the small part of big corporate U.K. that rested in the London office. These are the parameters we are willing to create for the United Kingdom, and besides the acquisition of the RBS French network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About Latin America, Patrick Lee asks a general question. Facing that there is an improvement -- an increase in the risk account -- with a positive improvement, you said the growth at the top of the P&amp;L balance is still single digit in many cases. And could we say something about the possible evolution of the profit and loss balance in Latin America for next year, as I understand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that the trends pretty much show the way we come from negative growth of credit stock, not so much deposits, we were growing well in that area. But it points to an acceleration towards double-digit growth, I don't know if it will be 20% but at least it will be double-digit. I don't know if it will be fully translated, it will depend on the mix.</p>
          <p>But we remain highly positive on the evolution &#x2013; or about the evolution of our income in the on coming quarter. Since there are certain areas, there are a few penalties, like in Mexico or rapid growth of interest rates in Chile and in Brazil we are going towards products with a lower risk premium, and therefore lower margins. Credit is growing by 41%, but obviously it has a lower spread than the product <mark type="inaudible" />. We believe that this will be turned into a better business dynamic and therefore better results. So Brazil has already given their forecast, I'm thinking about high double-digits in Latin America doesn't seem so out of reach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About Brazil, David Vaamonde from Fidentiis asks whether we can expect a greater acceleration of the quarter on quarter net interest income, about which you just commented about possible future growth and double-digit growth. He asks about the sale of minority businesses. We believe that we have 42% of Santander Brazil and that something marginal to the transaction with Qatar? It's an additional 2% of default, reaches our objective that in 25% when we presented the IPO. And Irma Garrido asks about the Qatar operation. She asks about this 23.75 conversion plus in these operations. Her questions specifically is why the target is set below market, and can we expect other operations of the same nature in Latin America. And in the Qatar operation, leaving open the issue of old stock and new stock, and a 3 year perspective she asked for the reason for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the fact that they are new or old provides flexibility. It's a measure intended to provide flexibility. Pricing and all the financial conditions of this operation are adjusted to market. These are market conditions considering dividend versus liability, tax effects, so it's actually a par operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one last question from Raoul Leonard from RBS. He says that the area of wholesale has had &#x2013; has not done so well this quarter as it has in the past. And he asks whether this is due to an increased investment in this unit, or he asks if we believe we might lose growth capacity in the mid-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that the situation is so bad. We have come from a very good quarter due to global market circumstances that make this quarter look un-brilliant, if you wish, but in absolute terms it has been a good quarter. We have had a positive evolution, a slight cost increase mainly because we're investing in technology, and obviously technology in this business comes at a price. So investments come from technology little bit, and personnel, but within our policy and our strategy and our understanding of our wholesale banking division this has been a positive quarter &#x2013; and its doesn't look like the horizon looks very bleak, it looks reasonably optimistic, although in comparison with the same quarter last year, this quarter doesn't look so good. It's just because it was extraordinarily good last year. But the perspectives ahead are very positive.</p>
