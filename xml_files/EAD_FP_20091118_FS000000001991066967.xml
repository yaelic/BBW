          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is the EADS Nine Months 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about one hour. This includes Q&amp;A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation.</p>
          <p>It is also webcast with a special banner on our homepage. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. Slides which we will now walk through and financial statements were e-mailed to you this early morning.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain a Safe Harbor Statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now to Hans Peter Ring.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I am sitting alone here, because Louis with the Airbus team is obviously in Dubai. And you have certainly read some of the news coming from Dubai.</p>
          <p>I will introduce our quarterly results with some observations about EADS, as we are positioned toward 2010. After a close look, as Nathalie said, at our Safe Harbor statement, let's start on page four.</p>
          <p>A few remarks, first on our business environment. As we have said in previous calls, the macroeconomic environment has impacted our commercial customers, like those of many industries, and the deterioration of their financials creates a risk on our commercial delivery outlook.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless we are cautiously envisaging an improving, or an improvement in economic and market conditions. October figures further confirm that the cycle for freight and passenger traffic is bottoming out, notably in emerging economies. World-wide passenger traffic increased for the first time since November 2008.</p>
          <p>From an economic standpoint, the continuous weakening of the dollar, also not an immediate threat in the short-term, thanks to the Group's long-term hedging policy and cost cutting initiatives is challenging EADS's performance, because of a weakening hedge book over time. The long-term dollar level is an important driver of EADS earnings power over the coming years.</p>
          <p>Business wise this quarter, delivery patterns continue to be strong, thanks to our active order book management and a robust order book as such. In July, the Eurofighter negotiations were successfully completed with the contract signature of the Tranche 3a securing deliveries beyond 2012.</p>
          <p>We will discuss the financials in more detail later, however, I will point out that our net cash position remains a key strength and the level of direct financing for our customers remains limited so far. In addition, they remind the seasonality of our defense and institutional business who's top, bottom line and cash performance tends to be back-loaded.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk a bit about our programs on page five. Firstly, the A400M. The Flight Test Bed campaign of the A400M is now complete and the first flight version of the FedEx software is being tested and providing satisfactory results. Detailed negotiations with our customers are currently ongoing. We are preparing for a first flight around the end of the year. PDP payments have resumed with partial retention, but the absence of a major triggering event in the quarter to enhance visibility on either the technical or contractual situation of the program means that the early stage accounting treatment is maintained.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the negative net EBIT impact of &#x20AC;224 million for the first nine months does not reflect a complete new estimate of the cost at completion. The charge taken in the nine months represents an estimation of the over costs deemed to be irrecoverable as revenues as well as the foreign exchange adjustment on future costs. We regret the decision of the South African government to withdraw from the A400M program. Technical and financial implications need to the assessed.</p>
          <p>On to the A380 program. Our customers are highly satisfied by aircraft performance in terms of range, load and fuel burn efficiency as well as its strong popularity with passengers. However, due to outstanding work, A380 costs are still higher than expected and weigh on EBIT before one-off.</p>
          <p>In 2009, the A380 program has faced both continuing production instability and customer requests for delivery postponements. As a result, the production plan is under review and a couple of deliveries for year-end will likely shift into early '010. This will continue to weigh on profitability and the flexibility level of some sites.</p>
          <p>Now I will talk you through the Group's financials in more detail and I'll start on page seven. Revenues remained stable compared to nine-months 2008. An increase in revenues at Astrium and Eurocopter was partially offset by lower revenues at Airbus. Revenues generated by defense activities are lower than a year earlier, which included the A400M Power-on milestone with 419 million, and the transition to early stage accounting with 800 million. It means in total A400M revenues are lower by 800 million. The third quarter traditionally has a lower delivery phasing than the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>EBIT before one-off was lower versus the last nine months 2008. It mainly relates to Airbus. Higher volumes and Power 8 savings were more than offset by the degradation of hedge rates, the deterioration of pricing on commercial deliveries and some cost increases. In addition, progress on A380 is slower than expected.</p>
          <p>Order intake, especially for our commercial businesses, was lower across all divisions versus '08, except for Astrium, which booked the second batch PB, so-called PB of 35 Ariane 5 launchers worth more than &#x20AC;4 billion. 2008 included strong inflow in commercial aircraft orders, including those from Farnborough and the order intake for the tanker programs.</p>
          <p>Our backlog now stands at a robust &#x20AC;378 billion despite the revaluation impact at the closing rate of 1.46 dollar versus euro at the end of September, versus 1.39 at the end of December '08, that has led to a reduction of &#x20AC;14 billion.</p>
          <p>Our defense order book remains stable. Recent contract awards for the Saudi Border Security project, the Eurocopter Brazil orders, and the Eurofighter Tranche 3a are not yet booked, so we do expect some increase towards year-end.</p>
          <p>Let's now go on to page eight, where we can look at the underlying performance of the business. The margin calculated using EBIT before one is 5.6% at the Group level, excluding early stage revenues on the A400M program from total revenues. Let's now consider the list of non-recurring items. We have explained the negative net impact to the EBIT of the continuation of early stage accounting on the A400M. On this slide, we present the gross figure, excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange of &#x20AC;107 million that is contained here in the line Revaluation of all Loss Making Contracts.</p>
          <p>Since H1, to mitigate the volatility of our earnings, we used a compounded rate to revalue our loss making contract provisions. It resulted in no movement on this line in the third quarter. An update of the compounded rate will be made for the year-end.</p>
          <p>In nine months 2009, the dollar-mismatch impact coming from the reversal of pre-delivery payments that were cashed in at an historical rate and the balance sheet revaluation had a negative impact on our EBIT result of around &#x20AC;300 million. Other one-off charges amount to &#x20AC;90 million.</p>
          <p>Up to slide nine now, where we see R&amp;D increased slightly versus last year, driven predominantly by increases at Eurocopter and DS. However, you should be reminded that R&amp;D is expected to ramp-up in the last, or fourth quarter, to around &#x20AC;2.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The interest result is lower than last year. The change comes from the decline in interest rates on the financial markets. Meanwhile the other financial result deteriorated by almost &#x20AC;200 million year-on-year.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, since the spot rate deteriorated, the revaluation of U.S. dollar and gross -- and British pounds cash asset was significantly negative. This line also includes the negative valuation of the premium paid for option and the unwinding of discounted provisions.</p>
          <p>In total, foreign exchange effects had a negative impact of &#x20AC;1.7 billion on the net income before tax. The reduction in earnings versus the nine-month 2008 has led to a lower tax expense. The tax rate is at 32% in line with our expectation.</p>
          <p>Up to slide 10 now, due to the evolution of U.S. dollar rates, the mark-to-market value of our hedge book is now at &#x20AC;2.1 billion. As we already stated, the volatility of the dollar and the risk pricing of financial institutions made hedging more difficult or unattractive with a number of banks.</p>
          <p>However, despite that we have continued our hedging activity. Whilst, $12 billion of hedges matured, $11.9 billion of forward contracts were added in the first nine months, at an average rate of 136 dollar per euro. Since we began to restructure some of the 2011 and 12 euro call options we added in summer '08, the new forward contracts include $3.5 billion of options restructuring at more favorable rates. In total, we sold $5.5 billion of options, our hedge book therefore decreased from $68.1 billion at the end of December to $62.5 billion at the end of September '09. Our Q4 2009 hedge portfolio contains $400 million of options to secure the forward rates of our contracts in defense.</p>
          <p>On to slide 11, now to the free cash flow. Free cash flow is in line with expectations for the nine months '09. The significant changes versus last year come from working capital and the gross cash flow from operations. The gross cash flow from operations for the nine months was weighted down by the lower EBIT before one-off. The deterioration in working capital comes from a stronger increase in inventory and a lower inflow of advance payments at Airbus. The increase in inventories reflects the A380 ramp up, but a low level of A380 deliveries to the end of September. In addition, there is a mismatch between production rates and deliveries for both single aisle and long range in the nine months. Due to an expected ramp up in Q4, this mismatch should be significantly lower at year end.</p>
          <p>Stripping out the reduction in orders the inflow of advances linked to Airbus commercial activity is steady compared to last year confirming the robustness of the order book. There was an increase in Astrium related to the strong '09 order intake, but it was weighed down by the partial retention of advances from OCCAR for the A400M.</p>
          <p>Net customer financing outflow was lower than expected in the nine months at around &#x20AC;300 million. Even though we expect it to increase in the fourth quarter, the year end forecast is expected to be below the budgeted one billion figure. Investing activities consumed around &#x20AC;1.2 billion reflecting an increase in capital expenditure as investment ramps up on the A350 program. Capital expenditure is expected to reach around &#x20AC;2.3 billion by the year end.</p>
          <p>We will now dig into each division's performance, and as usual we start with Airbus on page 13.</p>
          <p>The former Military Transport Aircraft division and the business unit EFW have been integrated into the Airbus segment with effect of January 1. The Airbus segment also contains the completed Aerostructures reorganization. 2008 figures have been restated to reflect these changes except for Augsburg, a plant which was transferred from our Defense business.</p>
          <p>Airbus Military is currently reported within the Airbus segment under its former perimeter MTA, but as an interim measure only. As the integration progresses from an accounting standpoint, this presentation will be updated accordingly.</p>
          <p>Onto the performance in the quarter. A lower level of commercial activity is reflected the net order intake. However, 59 new firm orders were booked in the third quarter, taking the level of gross orders up to 149, demonstrating a continued appetite for new aircraft from certain customers. Cancellations remain at low level, with only 26 recorded in the first nine-month period.</p>
          <p>In Airbus Military, we booked 10 medium and light military aircraft. Four new orders were booked in the third quarter for the Czech Republic. In addition, Airbus Military underscored its strong position in the tanker business with an order for three additional A330 MRTT from the Saudi Arab MoD bringing their total order to six aircraft.</p>
          <p>Airbus continued to achieve a record number of deliveries with 358 aircraft delivered in the first nine-months '09.</p>
          <p>Financing requests continue to be heavily supported by the ECA, so by the export credit agencies who provided support for 32% of deliveries. So the export credit system proved to be very efficient.</p>
          <p>All deliveries qualified for revenue recognition.</p>
          <p>Due to the successful management of the backlog, production rates have maintained stable and are currently at rate 34 for single aisle and rate eight to 8.5 for the long range aircraft.</p>
          <p>We will look at the nine-month in more detail for the segments on slide 14. Airbus commercial revenues at the nine-months were inline with last year. A higher number of deliveries was offset by lower A400M revenues and price deterioration, notably from A330 deliveries. In addition, our freighter conversion and Hawker business has seen a significant deterioration in business activity. The reduction in EBIT is driven by the negative impact from foreign exchange effects, price deterioration and costs increases. Progress on the A380 program is slower than expected.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D costs are in line with last year, as the ramp up in A350 was offset by the ramp down in A380. There was a major milestone on the A330 freighter program in November with the successful first flight that launches the flight test program. Airbus Military revenues benefited from an increase in tanker and medium and light activities. They were more than offset by lower revenue recognition on the A400M program where 2008 figures included the Power on milestone and the first application of early stage accounting as I already mentioned. The EBIT recovery of Airbus Military is due to higher tanker activity as well as the absence of A400M charges booked in '08. These were weighed down by a weaker mix in the medium and light aircraft deliveries.</p>
          <p>Now on to Eurocopter on page 15. The trend of bookings over the nine months has shown here significant slowdown with 179 net orders registered versus 605 last year, including an average decrease of 70% across the civil product ranges. Continuing cancellations demonstrate the decline in the civil market. Eurocopter has recorded 79 to the end of September, mainly in the private and corporate segments. However, for the first time this quarter the number of cancellations has decreased. Production levels are being closely monitored and adapted accordingly.</p>
          <p>Important military contracts booked in '09 should mitigate the decrease in civil bookings, but only on a mid-term basis. Total deliveries will be down by around 8% next year. Consequently, Eurocopter announced a transformation program, named SHAPE. It aimed to provide Eurocopter with the necessary assets to better face the economic crisis in the civil market. It aims to generate &#x20AC;200 million in savings which includes the Eurocopter contribution to future EADS.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter delivered lower volumes with 392 deliveries in the nine months, slightly down from the level in '08 of 404 helicopters. However, a favorable mix in civil activities and an increase in customer services generated a revenue increase of 9%.</p>
          <p>EBIT was inline with the '08 level, as a favorable mix was offset by margin pressure on a NH90 program reflecting ongoing qualification and acceptance complexities. EBIT was also weighed down by higher R&amp;D due to strong efforts <mark type="inaudible" /> (21.02) and product investment and a negative foreign exchange impact.</p>
          <p>In services, Eurocopter was a awarded a contract with the British MOD for the life extension of 28 Puma helicopters. For the Tiger, the French Army dispatched three helicopters for operations in Afghanistan where Eurocopter is providing onsite technical assistance.</p>
          <p>Up to Astrium, on slide 16, where the economic crisis has a had a limited impact or effect so far even on the commercial part of the business. Astrium recorded a strong growth in revenues across all businesses versus the nine months '08. The main contributions come from an increase in navigation and earth observation satellites, ballistic missile production, and in services both telecom and earth observation. I remind you that the second quarter revenues included a non-operational positive one-time effect due to a revenue catch up for in-orbit incentive schemes on commercial satellites with low margin recognition.</p>
          <p>EBIT growth for the nine months was driven by a ramp up in productivity on the M-51 program, and in earth observation satellites, partially offset by an unfavorable translation effect from the declining British pound to euro foreign exchange rate on Paradigm. Ariane 5 continues successful operations marking its 33rd consecutive success. On October 1, Astrium satellites, SATCOMBw, Bundeswehr, the first secure communication satellite for the German Armed forces and Amazonas 2 for the Spanish operator Hispasat were placed into  orbit.</p>
          <p>And now on to Defense on slide 17, where the Augsberg Aerostructure's activity is now consolidated within the Airbus segment. As said before 2008 figures have not been restated here. DS revenues reflect gross from Eurofighter activities and the consolidation of Plant CML that almost compensate the Aerostuctures carve-out.</p>
          <p>DS EBIT is stable, growth and margin improvements on core programs offset, ramp up in R&amp;D investments in areas such as radar, UAV, and security markets as well as the Aerostructure's carve-out.</p>
          <p>The segment will benefit from positive seasonality effects in both revenue and EBIT performance in the fourth quarter. The DS order book at the end of September stands at &#x20AC;16.3 billion; order intake for this quarter was largely driven by integrated logistic support for Eurofighter and the launch of the assessment phase for Team Complex Weapons, and missile.</p>
          <p>As we already mentioned, the Eurofighter nations reached an agreement in July for the third production tranche, the contract is spilt in two parts and Tranche 3a comprises a total of 112 aircraft. It is not yet reflected in the backlog.</p>
          <p>DS started to achieve milestones on the security contracts in the Middle East. Meanwhile, its unmanned platform sector, DS successfully tested Barracuda, the largest UAV demonstrator ever built in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now on to other businesses on page 18. Other businesses where I will first remind you that EFW is reported as part of the Other segment. 2008 figures have been adjusted to reflect this change.</p>
          <p>In addition, 70% of Socata was sold to Daher in January. The remaining 30% is consolidated at equity within other businesses. 2008 figures have not been restated. The significant reduction in the order book since year end is explained by the change perimeter.</p>
          <p>Revenues were lower year-on-year due to the consolidation perimeter changes that offset the successful ramp-up of LUH, the light utility helicopter activity at EADS North America.</p>
          <p>EBIT was also lower year-on-year. Productivity gains at Sogerma confirm its turnaround. They are offset by negative foreign exchange effects as well as lower asset management and support activity at ATR and a lower EBIT in EADS North America.</p>
          <p>ATR delivered 30 aircraft, below the 2008 level of 37, due to a delivery shift to the fourth quarter. Implementation of financing is slow in the current market environment. At the end of September, gross orders reached 33 with five cancellations bringing the backlog to a total of 158 aircraft.</p>
          <p>At EADS North America, the LUH program continues its success with a ramp-up in deliveries to 33 versus 29 in the nine-month 2008. All helicopters continue to be delivered on time or ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>The new US tanker competition is underway with our partners. We are working on the draft proposal currently.</p>
          <p>Now I will comment on our guidance on page 20. In a challenging market EADS maintains its estimate for new gross orders figure of up to 300 aircraft. I would call this target a stretch target, but the good news is that there are ongoing campaigns, some of which might materialize this week at the Dubai Air Show, as we have already seen this morning in the news flow.</p>
          <p>Production rates remain stable. 2009 deliveries are expected to be around 490 aircraft. For 2010 EADS is still working with its customers to establish a total delivery outlook including the A380 program. Using &#x20AC;1 equals $139, which was used in the previous guidance, as the average spot rate EADS 2009 revenues should be roughly in line with the 2008 level. However further deterioration of exchange rates in the fourth quarter could lead to slightly lower Group revenues.</p>
          <p>Due to ongoing uncertainties on the magnitude of the potential A400M and A380 charges in the fourth quarter EADS is not able to give a guidance for EBIT for the full year. Under a continuation scenario, which is deemed the most probable, the A400M provision, for which &#x20AC;2.4 billion in charges have already been accrued, has a wide range of possible outcomes depending on the negotiation process and could substantially alter the financial statement of EADS in the future.</p>
          <p>Putting those effects aside, EBIT before one-off for full year 2009 should amount to around &#x20AC;2 billion. In a difficult environment the Group's cash flow management continues to deliver better results than expected. EADS will provider less customer financing than anticipated, therefore excluding the A400M program, EADS should now consume less than &#x20AC;1 billion of free cash flow in 2009, knowing that this is the most volatile figure to forecast.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2010, the Group is still cautiously monitoring its production rates in a soft market environment. Delivery of Power 8 savings, a better aircraft pricing level and further progress in space and defense will be challenged by deterioration of hedge rates and uncertainties surrounding the A380, and if unresolved in 2009 the A400M.</p>
          <p>To conclude, and now I'm on page 21, which is the appendix page. To conclude, our resilience during 2009 provides a solid platform for EADS beyond the short-term perspectives. We have been able to secure a strong balance sheet and with that we have maintained our close attention to cash preservation, which is the enabler of financial and commercial flexibility as we move into what we anticipate will be a slightly more robust economy.</p>
          <p>We drive our operations to be more efficient and we push for further optimization of the support side with future EADS. Eurocopter, with its new initiative SHAPE is a good example. Continued pressure from managing our customer delivery plan and the question of a prolonged weakness on the dollar remain the biggest challenges on profitability, even if smart hedging is buying us some time. We do not expect support from the delivery side, for say, one or probably two years in a soft market environment for Airbus and Eurocopter.</p>
          <p>Therefore, stabilizing, engineering and industrial processes to improve on critical programs remains key, as well as delivering on all ongoing savings initiatives. Once delivery levels return to the level assumed at the outset of Power 8 initiative, the Group will be even more efficient and better positioned in a more robust economic environment.</p>
          <p>In defense, our goal has been to foster margin growth and we are successfully delivering on that. This is particularly the case in maturing contracts such as the Eurofighter, and new business such as the border security contracts where we derive revenues from multiple sources, platforms, consulting, and services.</p>
          <p>In space, after improving and stabilizing the performance of launchers and satellites we are expanding, particularly in services, with success.</p>
          <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, and now we are prepared to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. It's Rupinder Vig from Morgan Stanley. Two questions for you Hans Peter. Firstly, just around the customer financing, you talked about the fact that there's been fairly insignificant need in the first nine months of the year. What's your view for what the full year will look like? And any commentary around 2010? Kind of the billion number that you previously talked about. And then second question just around A380, you said that a couple of deliveries might slip from this year into next year. What's your view on how many deliveries for total there could be for next year. And the reasoning behind the slip, is this more customers that are wishing to defer, or is this more issue in terms of your own production process? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Rupinder, first of all, good morning. On customer financing, we indeed expect to consume less for the full year. We are at roughly 300 for nine month. Obviously, the most difficult cases are in the last quarter, which explains also that we expect a higher than average delivery rate in the last three months. So as of today, I would be probably around 800 or probably even a bit less.</p>
          <p>For next year, obviously we have not yet finished our budgeting exercise. As of today, I wouldn't -- I mean since we will not consume everything this year. I would -- for the time being not expect that we are much different from the number we had planned for 2009, which means around a billion. That was your first question, I guess.</p>
          <p>Second one, slip of A380s. Yes, we say there is probably a couple of aircraft going into January or probably February. So a rather limited, I would say, effect. It is due to both, as I mentioned in my speech, industrial and also customer requests. So both of it is responsible for the delay, but it is not anything which I would see as being dramatic, given that it's only, I mean artificially due to the cut-off of the 31 of December. So it's a few weeks of delay on some aircraft.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Ben Fidler from Deutsche Bank, UK. Please state now your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two questions, please. Firstly, just on Power 8, I wonder if you could help us understand the level of savings on Power 8 that have been delivered now year-to-date? And also what you think could be delivered in 2010 to offset what sound like could be almost &#x20AC;1 billion of currency headwind in 2010 from the hedge rate.</p>
          <p>And the second question was just if you're going to help us to try and understand, or if you can scope out a little bit the various scenarios around what level of further charges we could see on the A380 taken in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Ben. I have to comeback to Rupinder, because I forgot one last point on his question, which was related to 2010 delivery levels of A380. So again, I mean we are in the planning exercise at this point, but the level I think we communicated already before is around 20 aircraft.</p>
          <p>On Power 8 spend, level of savings, I mean for the full year we would expect something in a range between 1.8 and 1.9. I don't &#x2013; I cannot give you now the precise number for Q3, because it's very difficult to drag through all the different line items in the costs. But for 2010, we would expect as of today that we are ending up north of the 2.1 billion we had planned, which is consistent to a certain extent with Power 8+, where one element was an extension of Power 8 saving. So it should be something better than or north of 2.1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to clarify, we're looking at...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I say 1.8, 1.9 billion for 2009, it does not mean, you cannot translate it 1:1 into EBIT performance because EBIT performance will be lower due to the fact that a lot of those savings are flowing through inventories et cetera. So not everything is ending up in the P&amp;L in the year where the projects deliver.</p>
          <p>Scenarios, A380 on Q4, I mean obviously if I would have a number, I would have to give it to you, Ben, so it's under assessment until now, and it's not going to be something which is an extremely big number, just to caution you. So the program is progressing. I mean, we have our difficulties industrially as we have reported recently. This has a cost obviously, which now needs to be translated into the different contracts. And first of all, the costs have obviously to be assessed and the question of how quickly we can now converge to the learning curve, and this is indeed the, I would say, remaining challenge of the current planning, which is ongoing. So I could not give you any indication of scenarios, etcetera. It will be most likely something, and that's all we can say today.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Zafar Khan from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, U.K. Please state now your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. It's Zafar Khan from SocGen. Good morning to everybody. Two questions please, Hans Peter. First one just on the A400M early accounting that you're doing. Just want to understand what your burn rate is, what the EBIT impact is on a monthly basis at the moment because I guess you're financing the development from your own resources now, as opposed to charging it against the sort of pot you had because you expired, that's been used. So that's the first question. Just trying to understand how we should think about a sort of a monthly cost on that development?</p>
          <p>Second question is just on the Airbus 2010 deliveries. I know you're not in a position to give us a definitive number on that, but just wondering how much of the production for next year has already been sold and secured in terms of the financing? And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More &#x2013; I'll start with the last one. More than 100 &#x2013; first of all, good morning, Zafar. More than 100% of next year's deliveries or production I would say, as we plan it today, is sold. In other words, we still retain a small overbooking in the second half of next year. So, in other words, from the backlog side, it seems to be rather stable at this point. Obviously, what we have highlighted in the speech, we cannot be 100% sure that everything is financed today and that everybody was taking the delivery on board. And I think the major question mark certainly is coming from the solvency/profitability development in some of the customers for next year. So there is an uncertainty clearly still remaining and that is the reason why we could not tell you today whether it's exactly the same we had this year, or whether it's going to be bit lower. But obviously the environment is not extremely favorable as of today.</p>
          <p>On A400M early stage, early stage works in a way that we have to record the expenses on the program against the revenues we deem as being recoverable. And then indeed there is a negative difference coming out of that, which is then obviously covered through expenses in the P&amp;L, and the overall difference or burden for EBIT due to that early stage is 220 roughly -- 220 million as of now. And this is based on expensed work in progress of 780 million, roughly. And the 220 EBIT impact is including some foreign exchange impact, as we have said in the speech.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I just divide that by nine, would I get the kind of monthly run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just ask a supplementary on Ben's question on the A380 provisions, and lot of my peers know that I have difficulty with some English terms, and you say it will not be an extremely big number. Can you kind of fine tune what that means? What is not an extremely big number?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Winfried Becker from Oppenheim Research, Germany. Mr. Becker, may we have your question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Winfried Becker from Oppenheim. First question on net liquidity, Mr. Ring. I'm happy to see that you could save the 8 billion level. Trying all impacts together, were you willing to make a forecast where this might go at the end of this year? Would it be stable, higher, or lower? And second question on Eurocopter, trying to figure in what you say concerning cost savings, et cetera, and the costs for a cost savings program. Could it be a right assumption, looking to EBIT in fiscal year '010, that Eurocopter might come out with a lower profit number, or is that completely wrong? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all to your net cash, obviously without now considering anything as a cash outflow additionally for A400M, which anyway we would not expect at this point this year, we should end up somewhere around the level you see today. So in other words, we would not consume further cash until the end of the year, with probably some upside as we have indicated in the outlook.</p>
          <p>On Eurocopter, first of all we -- as we said, delivery, I would say rate in 2010 will be challenged. We are roughly or nearly at the same level of deliveries in 2009 like last year, which was a record year for Eurocopter. So, we are still at a high level. We would expect for next year a decline in the commercial deliveries, clearly. And this will weigh on EBIT. And that is obviously the major reason why this new program in Eurocopter was launched, which we call, or Eurocopter calls, SHAPE, with 200 million to be delivered, certainly not 100% next year, you should not expect that this falls into the bottom line already in 2010.</p>
          <p>The majority of the project is related to, I would say a definition of overhead, a very wide and large definition of overhead. So everything which is not working directly on the helicopters is considered in this assessment as being indirect, and this area is now challenged through this program, mainly. And additionally, Eurocopter has included some of the savings we want to generate through future EDS. So all of that together should generate the 200 million, but certainly not yet fully to be delivered next year.</p>
          <p>I cannot give you the split now, because we just launched program. Eurocopter has clear ideas where the savings should come from. And they're fixing the projects within the next weeks and months, and we will update you in the next releases, obviously.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Antoine Boivin from Cheuvreux, France. Please state your question now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Hans Peter and Nathalie. My two questions are the following. The first one is, could you give us an update on the U.S. tanker issue, following the latest statements coming from the U.S. side?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you give us an idea of the prices you are making on new orders, even if these orders are still relatively limited? I would be quite interested in knowing the pricing issue for the A380 and A350 new orders as compared to what you were doing before. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the last two ones, I can tell you it's above, or at least at, our planning assumptions. So the pricing level we receive not only on these programs, but at large, is in line with our plans, or slightly ahead. That has not changed, which means it is at a higher level than you have experienced now in the last &#x2013; or we have experienced in the last three years. So that is, I think, good. So we're quite content with the development on the pricing side.</p>
          <p>U.S. tanker, we are working with the customer on the draft RFP. We delivered all of our questions. The negotiation is ongoing and we would wait for the final RFP towards the end of the year. I don't have the exact date in mind. So that is the current status of the program, and you have seen a lot of news flow around it. We are challenging the way the draft RFP was written, as well as our competitor. And if you like, I could give you some more details, but I'm not sure that was your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be as well, so if you have ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be as well. [Laughter] No, I mean, it's clear, Antoine, what we said. We understood, from the outset of this competition, that the U.S. Air Force was looking for a game-changing multi-role tanker and transport aircraft, and I think we feel pretty comfortable with our product. So we think we have the superior, definitely the superior product. It is a slightly bigger aircraft, clearly. That means that if it is just a price shootout like it is structured now, which includes lifecycle costs of that program for the Air Force you are, with a bigger aircraft, obviously disadvantaged. So it's clearly a price shoot out, they have 300 and I think 73 requirements which are mandatory. So a huge, huge number of requirements, much, much bigger than in the first time. So, and everything is equally important, so if everything is important, is anything important, you could ask.</p>
          <p>So we have challenged all of that. We also challenged the price strategy, which means the fixed price, which they request because it avoids obviously to assess the past performance of the contender and we feel pretty comfortable with that, because our product is currently flying, and is flight tested with the Australian Air force. So we are pretty well advanced. So all of that is not considered and that's why we are trying, heavily trying, to challenge all of that in the current process, and we will see where we will end up in a few weeks.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can I ask you three questions? Firstly, can I ask, the A350 XWB, is it on schedule and how is the margin on the schedule of that program compared with the original assumption? Secondly, can you update us on the use, the consumption of loss making contract provisions on the A380 so far in 2009, and then what you expect for the full year and for 2010? And last question is, deferral requests at Airbus in the third quarter, were they at a similar pace or similar number to where they were in the second quarter, or is the pace of new deferral requests decreasing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the last one, only on A380 or at large?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At large. Across Airbus Hans Peter, if we can?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. Second question, I keep it short because there is no answer. First question, A350 margin, on A350 schedule and development currently is zero. As we have repeatedly said, the program was from the beginning very, very tight and there are no schedule margin at all, so we will have &#x2013; we will have the next milestone assessment in January, Milestone 6, so-called, where we would, I think freeze the tooling. So that is an important milestone and at this milestone obviously, we will get the final assessment whether everything is on track. Clearly, as in each and every aircraft program, you're fighting against weight a little bit. But it seems at this point, at least, to be under control.</p>
          <p>On the deferral requests, the pace of deferrals, it's difficult to say, I'm part of the Risk Management Committee in Airbus every two to three weeks. I have the feeling, but I have no scientific breakdown for it, that the deferrals -- the pace of deferrals is slowing down currently, as we can see that market is picking up, particularly in some regions. So that seems to be I would say, more under control than it has been half a year ago.</p>

And my second question is regarding <mark type="inaudible" /> (54.57) the Saudi border contract, I know you cannot disclose the precise amounts, but do you have an idea of the timing of the payment and key milestone we can expect?

          <p>Okay. Tangible assets on A380, sorry A400M, it was not A380. A400M, so we have obviously investments into plant, property, equipment and which is an order of magnitude I guess of 800 million, some small inventories, not a big number, around 50 million and then some advance payments which were transferred or made to our suppliers at close to 1 billion currently. That gives you a broad picture of the assets.</p>

          <p>Hello. Doug, it's early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. You are right. I was interested on financing. When you look at next year, one of the issues that we've seen with a lot of carriers is the issue around PDP financing. And my first question is have you seen this as an important issue in looking at what deferrals might turn out to be in 2010, and are you working with airlines on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First of all on PDPs and PDP inflow and overdues it is unchanged, so it's very much under control. No specific issues at this point. On the PDP financing we have seen some requests, but not much to be honest.</p>
          <p>So for the time being this item, for us at least, seems also to be under control, and anyway if there would be financing usually it would have to be done through banks because it would not, I mean you do it probably in exceptional cases, but it would not make a hell of a lot of sense if you finance your own PDPs. So far I think I see this as being under control for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then second, on the A330 freighter. Given the weakness in the cargo market, how are you looking at that outlook? Has that changed much for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that has changed. We have converted some of the freighter contracts already in the last 12 months into passenger aircrafts. I do not exactly remember how many exactly due to this weakness, and also by the way due to weakness of some of the customers. So indeed this is difficult program for the time being, but we are now just starting flight testing, and if we assume that the freighter market is coming back next year, and we have seen a very strong recovery in the last two to three months, I think -- I mean it would certainly change the picture in 2011 probably, probably not so much here 2010. But in so far we still think it's going to be a strong product in our product range. And probably hope &#x2013; if markets recover, it's just in time probably for the recovery.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>So you're looking at something that might just slip back a little bit in your view?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That could happen, yes. And the first positions are, anyway for the year are covered, so we have some time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Hans Peter. Question about pricing, not of new aircraft intake pricing, which you talked about already, but of what's going through the delivery pipeline. I think there was a headwind still hitting you this year from things that had been historically under priced. Could you quantify that in terms of sort of what was the EBIT headwind for 2009 versus 2010 &#x2013; 2009 compare to 2008, as you'd make your best guess presently? And then in 2010, do we get kind of a tailwind from adverse pricing kind of reversing? That you have under priced aircraft going through in the current year and then next year they're sort of back up to satisfactory pricing. Is there any tailwind that we should think about next year in that sense? That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about tailwind is probably too early at this stage of the cycle. I would say pricing impact we would get for the full year to be somewhere between 3 and 400.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the negative -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Negative impact this year. For 2010, as I said before, we should recover. We will see a positive number which is in the three digit millions, obviously, starting next year.</p>

          <p>Thank you, we will now take our last question, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The last question comes from Jason Adams from Nomura UK. May we have your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, everybody. In the interest of time I'll just limit it to one, and that's on FX. You know the euro/dollar rate has really gone against you guys this year, and my question is, is it still business as usual or is the FX gone in such a way that it's causing you to really adjust your strategy, either with work placement or hedging or et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is indeed probably one of our biggest headaches today. The level of the euro dollar. Remember we have changed and adapted our strategy last time the dollar was very weak around levels of 155, where we said we don't want to take or to lock-in forward contracts on currencies, but rather make it more optional. That is an option we will have to consider if the dollar is at the 150 level or weaker I think. So locking in the very weak rates is probably something which is difficult. We were doing very well with that option strategy, so we restructured more than 50, 60% of these options already now with a very nice upside compared to the lock-in rate we had in the option.</p>
          <p>So if we would believe the dollar remain cyclical, and some experts in the markets tend to believe that, that could be an adaptation of our strategy going forward. But I mean, the question is really where does it go? So we will have to think about that and come back to you in the next call obviously. But in principal I mean, our hedging strategy as such is not changed, we never have changed it also last time the dollar was very weak.</p>
