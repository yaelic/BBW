        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Operator and hello, everyone. And welcome to our conference call for the fourth quarter of 2009. With me here in Stockholm is Ericsson's CEO, Hans Vestberg, and Jan Frykhammar, the Chief Financial Officer. Also joining in today is Johan Wibergh, Head of our Segment Networks.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I'd like to remind you, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call today. These statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions. There are risks and uncertainties associated with these planning assumptions, and the actual results may be different due to a number of factors. Therefore, we encourage you to use caution when considering such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that out of the way, I would like to hand over to Hans for comments about our results and some plans going forward. Hans?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gary, and hello, everybody. I will not go through the slides that were given in the press conference this morning. I will try to make a summary where me and Jan will do that or what we have conveyed in the morning, so we can have some more time for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So, I will just start by talking about the trends in 2009, and I think there was five clear trends in 2009. The number one was definitely the breakthrough for data growth, the acceleration on that. It was very much about the next generation in many networks, and of course that was fueled by the smartphones coming out as well as much more mobile broadband in PCs.</p>
          <p>And we have seen also in the last report of 2009 now that many operators have started focusing on the machine-to-machine opportunities. So definitely we can see that data growth is there, and of course all the devices coming out is supporting that.</p>
          <p>And that also has led to that more and more operators, especially in developed countries right now, are looking into network modernization because the coverage is already there and they are looking in how to modernize, upgrade the networks in order to meet this sort of a more of a converged networks and modernization of what they have, and that of course enables also, and will include "IPification" on the networks.</p>
          <p>The third trend that we're seeing through the year is that 3G overtook 2G. And 3G has now higher volumes than 2G and we have now had GSM as the number one volume driver since many, many years back, but 3G this year over-passed it.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have seen the first sort of contracts on 4G or LTE where the earlier operators have now been out and defined the vendors and we're happy to say that we are part of a major rollouts on that as well.</p>
          <p>And the impact on the economic environment is sort of the fourth trend that we had in 2009, and we already started by into &#x2013; where we present the Q4 2008 to talk about it would be unreasonable that our &#x2013; the telecom industry and Ericsson would not be impacted by the economic situation. And hence, we saw in the second part that the credit constraints, the currency situation in some markets, and the overall quarters' net, especially in these emerging markets actually came into play and we came down in volumes, and that of course must come from that type of environment.</p>
          <p>Fifth, and the last trend in 2009 was the focus on the efficiency from operators as the climate became as it became in 2009, operators focused much more on that, which of course opened up a lot of opportunities for managed service for us. Those are sort of the five highlights from 2009 that we bring with us.</p>
          <p>If we then talk about our net sales, net sales in Q4 ended at 58.3 for comparable unit, down 16%, therefore full year basically flat. So we stayed flat on sales between 2008 and '09, but the Q4 came down with 16%. And that is also reflecting what was said at the latter part of 2009; we saw that gradual impact on quarter sales and also the impact on credit.</p>
          <p>And I think that if you go back, and of course it's always difficult to generalize on the world where we are in more than 175 countries, but in one way, you can say that a lot of the decision-taking in first half-year of 2009 is of course what is flowing into our sales in the second part of 2009. And there can be different reasons in different markets, but if I try to generalize, of course, that the overall economic climate as well as the credit constraints, those were the main drivers for that. At the same time, we had of course of also the change in portfolio, where 3G came up and was not really offset in our 2G.</p>
          <p>And last but final, I think that the currency when it comes to 2009, of course was flat, taking quite dramatically and we saw the U.S. Dollar exchange rate in the beginning of 2009 going from nine kronas and now came down, so we had a depreciation through the year. So beginning of the year, we had the support of it, and then we have gradually less and less support of the currencies.</p>
          <p>So overall that's what we see, but one thing that you can say also that, the trends that we saw coming in Q3, that was the same trends we have in Q4, when it comes to the market and our business. And it has not worsened; it is basically the same trends.</p>
          <p>If then you will say something about our operating income and here we talked before joint ventures and excluding restructuring, in the short summary, we improved our operating margin to 12% compared to 11% last year, and on a yearly basis or year-over-year, we remained stable despite the drop in sales in Q4.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and that's of course a lot from our cost efficiency work, that has been part of that. We have also the effect in both net sales and operating margin on Nortel, 2.7 billion, we invoiced on the CDMA as required in the last six weeks when we were having that in our books. So that's sort of one piece of the parcel as well.</p>
          <p>If you take the regions fairly quickly, and Western Europe down 21% year-over-year, 6% full year, the fourth quarter impacted of course on the re-scoping on the Hutch Italy deal that took down the &#x2013; to a negative growth. But excluding that, it still would be a negative growth, but it has been an impact.</p>
          <p>We see in this region now more focus on quality of networks and efficiency of those networks and of course that is high on the agenda of those operators. A couple of important wins was of course with Mobile Norway and TV4 Group, and the TV4 Group is of course very interesting to see that our managed service offering are now moving to the media industry as well, where we see it a natural next step for us with the capability that we built up.</p>
          <p>Last, in the beginning of the year, we signed a LTE deal with TeliaSonera, and also the expansion of the 3 Scandinavia, for mobile broadband that we are happy for. We also now split up our talk about Western Europe for all regions by segment. I will just make a few comments on the segments. You can see in Western Europe, as I have been stressing before, we have gone from a very strong GSM rollout market to be a 3G service market. Basically, it changed the whole portfolio in Western Europe, and I think that our management in Western Europe has done a great job.</p>
          <p>CEMA region, which is the most impacted probably from this economic climate, we came down 21% and 4% full year for comparable units. I think that there are large variation in this region. There are some 2G build-outs still, as well as very advanced mobile broadband networks being built. We can see that managed services and services in general has a very high attraction in this region. We signed, for example, Romtelecom, a fixed line operator in the fourth quarter, as well as the mobile operator, du, in UAE. So that, you can see, is what is happening.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we also in the networks business have secured with the largest operator in Africa, MTN, the frame agreement for 2010. So this region has been a little bit more impacted, and it's little bit different cycles and different markets here because there, some are more developed than others.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific: growth in all segments, and growth overall for the full year, came down in the fourth quarter. We can say that we have some variation about China, India, Vietnam, and Japan saw good development during the year in building networks. We can definitely see, as I've said, several quarters right now that Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan came down in relative terms quite a lot, especially due to the economic climate. We saw it on the fourth quarter that India came down. That, we believe, is more from a structure point of view, as they are waiting for a 3G auctions in the beginning of the year, which have been announced. We have no more guidance than we can see in the press, but that is the expectations.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific, I said, growth in all different regions, and if you look for a full year it's of course very good to have the big rollout in China on mobile broadband and WCDMA, but also that we now have secured in China GPON contracts with all three operators.</p>
          <p>If I then go to Latin America, Latin America had a year that was quite tough, down 25, 13% full year. Then we should know that 2008 was a very strong year for Latin America, with the accelerating growth through year, with both 2G rollout and fo-pon for 3G rollout. So that came down, but we can still see the underlying trends are still here. The mobile broadband growth and subscriptions growth is still there, and we see a growing demand for managed services in the region.</p>
          <p>So that was Latin America, and finally then in Latin America (sic) [North America], we can conclude now, looking back in 2009, that we have significantly strengthened our position in North America, both with the Sprint deal, but also with the CDMA acquisition, but also with gaining the LTE contract with Verizon, as well as being domain vendor for AT&amp;T on fixed. So we have done a lot of inroads in North America and definitely strengthened our position there. And we can say we have growth in all segments. We grew 41% in the year and even if we would exclude CDMA and Sprint, we will still have a growth in this region, due to market share gains.</p>
          <p>Finally, a couple of notes on the segments, 4TV networks, as I said before, networks came down then, at the second part of 2009, ending on a flat year basically and down 16% year-over-year. Still, with that year-over-year down 16%, networks showed stable EBITDA margins on 17% and year-over-year &#x2013; 2008 and 2009 actually improving the EBITDA margin. We had a positive impact in Q4 from the Nortel, as I said. It was SEK2.7 billion. In here, we both have the markets I talked about, but also then the mix of technologies on 2G to 3G happening during the year.</p>
          <p>We can say that we have maintained well our market shares in networks during 2009, which is very good. Then we also saw at the latter part of the year a pickup on our backhaul and IP router business, driven, of course, by the growth in broadband and data.</p>
          <p>Professional services, a quarter with 2% growth. Here we had a little bit of differences where one &#x2013; on the one hand, we had Sprint for the first quarter. On the other hand, we had still the re-scoping for a comparable reasons from the Hutch Italy. Maintained margins, full year 2008 to '09, but we came down in the fourth quarter with 3%, and that was the thing that I talked about in third quarter, the early start-ups from Sprint, Zain and the re-scope of Hutch. At the same time, I would say there are efficiency gains in the service business. We have now 370 million in our managed services offering.</p>
          <p>Finally, on services, we made after the year-end closing an acquisition of Pride in Italy, which adds some 1,000 people in system integration, which we believe is a very important piece for our network transformation and working with our customers going forward.</p>
          <p>Multimedia had a growth of 5% full year, down 14% in the fourth quarter. The main reason for coming down in fourth quarter was the CEMA region and revenue management, which were a little bit more cautious. Margins have been improving already through the year and we had a 20% EBITDA in fourth quarter and 16% for the full year. And we can definitely see that there are now more signs on that the TV business increases of interest from operators.</p>
          <p>Finally, before I let Jan come in, just a couple of things on Sony &#x2013; on the joint ventures. They reported on Friday. So we basically have said it. In general, we can say that both of these companies have done considerable restructuring and or improve &#x2013; while showing an improved profitability, or less of losses, I would say. And also, Sony Ericsson, it's worth mentioning that they improved their ASP in the fourth quarter with a new release &#x2013; that's the average sales price.</p>
          <p>So, Jan a couple of things about the financials and our balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans. It's great to talk to all of you. This is my first quarter as a CFO. Please remember that when you ask all the nasty questions.</p>
          <p>Anyway, so looking at Q4 and summarizing, I guess 2009 from a financial point of view, I think we have had a strong focus in the Company of controlling what we can control. That means to work on our cost base, and at the same time, work on the passive side of our balance sheet. We have started to see clear impact, both in the Ericsson core assets in terms of progress for the restructuring, as well as also now in Q3, Q4, some good signs on progress in our joint venture companies.</p>
          <p>What we are very proud of in the quarter is the cash flow. If you then look at the debt maturity profile, this is working with balance sheet on the passive side to really prepare for good &#x2013; for tougher times. And we can see here that we have during the quarter paid back a Eurobond loan of some &#x2013; or obligation &#x2013; of some &#x20AC;471 million. So now we have a very good maturity profile. In addition to that, we have as well an undrawn backup facility of some $2 billion that matures in 2014. So I think from a &#x2013; we can conclude here by saying that we have had good progress on the restructuring programs and also worked hard on our balance sheet. That means also that we then have a strong financial position.</p>
          <p>Looking at the cash flow in the quarter, operating cash flow of 12.4. If we exclude cash out, the impact of restructuring that was provided for, we had some SEK13.6 billion in the quarter. We paid the Nortel acquisition, which you will see impacting the investment cash flow in a negative way there. And then, the Eurobond payback is the reason for the financials being minus 6.1. All in all, we ended the quarter with SEK2.2 billion improved net cash position.</p>
          <p>If we look at the balance sheet a little bit more then, I think in the quarter we had very strong collections. Good work by our organization, and we also had a high amount of projects coming to an end, which you see visibly in the inventory rate shifts.</p>
          <p>On the cost reduction side, we have &#x2013; we said already in Q3 that we saw some &#x2013; we had good progress and we also had identified during the Fall some opportunities for further savings. Now we have said clearly that, we believe that this program by its end &#x2013; and it will end by first half of 2010 &#x2013; will generate some savings between 15 to SEK16 billion, and with an estimated restructuring charge of all-in-all 13 to 14 billion.</p>
          <p>And with that said, I guess Hans, it's time for you again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just let me summarize up before we go to the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So then the summary of 2009, it was an impact for the &#x2013; from the economic climate in the second part, but I said that was sort of part or what we thought and plans were in the beginning of the year when we started our cost rationalization.</p>
          <p>We maintained market shares well in all segments, and we even increased in some, especially in services, which I think is good in this environment. We can clearly see that the cost reduction has given effects to the margins, as they were stable despite this volume, if you exclude the restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>And finally, the strong financial position that we have created during 2009, both by working on the debt side, but also on the collection side, has enabled us to come out in a very strong way here with the financial <mark type="audio gap" /> 2010. And of course, that also made it possible for us to do the acquisition on CDMA et cetera with Nortel, which will be important for us.</p>
          <p>So by that, I hand it back to you, Gary.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As always, limit yourself to one question at a time, and keep your questions at a broad level. Detailed information is provided in the report and Ericsson's Investor Relations and Media Relations team will be happy to take additional questions and discuss details further with you after the call.</p>
          <p>Our first question is from Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Hans, looking at the networks segment specifically, we talk a lot about data, and the advent of smartphones, as to how it kicks up data rates, et cetera, but it's clear that wideband CDMA has not grown large enough to offset even the decline in GSM.</p>
          <p>First, is that on a unit volume or just dollars? I'm trying to get a handle on price erosion. Are you selling as many wideband CDMA units, especially to radio networks, as you had expected and just the price competition is too intense? Or is it just that we're not needing as many of them because the efficiency of the system has turned out to be better than what most people expected?</p>
          <p>And based on your answer there, what can we expect for LTE? I know that a lot of eyes have turned towards that as Verizon starts to look at deployments. If almost 10 years into the wideband CDMA deployment we're still not at parity with GSM, what can we possibly hope for LTE? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I think that just a quick comment there, is in value 3G is higher than 2G. But remember also that 2G is coming from a much higher level, of course, so we're not offsetting that yet, but it's still a big mix shift that we see in our markets right now in 3G and data group. But on the other hand, also there is an efficiency gain on the technology that we're coming out with all the time, so it can actually cover even more technology. So I think that's sort of the short answer.</p>
          <p>Then of course on the LTE, et cetera, it is always &#x2013; becomes more software in these technologies going forward, but also the data rates are coming up quite dramatically as well, and so it will be a trade-off there. I think that on the LTE side, we have said now for, at least when we have got questions, we of course will be part of a couple of very important operators in LTE business right now. But from a volume point of view, we still look out a couple of years before that will be a significant volume for us. And we need all to remember that GSM came out in 1991 and sort of 2008 was the peak year. So our technologies are long-lived and of course that goes for 3G as well, which is now some eight, nine years into a 10-year old technology.</p>

          <p>Question please, Operator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Gareth Jenkins from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi Hans, thanks very much. Just a quick one on gross margins, from the press conference earlier. I just wanted some clarification if I could. You were talking about more network modernization during the course of this year and accelerating data, which would suggest some under-investment by operators. I just wondered if you could give us a sense of how that impacts your gross margins through 2010? Should we assume gross margin mix shift is weaker because of more services, or should we assume it's stronger because we're getting more IP and software modernization? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will not give any clear indication where the gross margin goes, but what I said at the press conference, of course that the gross margin was fairly stable during 2008 to 2009, but then we need to understand also the mix shift that we're having in our portfolio with much more services that for obvious reason has a lower gross margin, but much less <mark type="inaudible" /> so from a profitability point the same, so the gross margin will change over time. And of course the network modernization effect, that's a combination of product and services that we see opportunity for. And we're seeing more and more discussion about it. So that we will see when you come into 2010, how that will play out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Tim Boddy from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for the question. It'd just be helpful to understand &#x2013; I think you mentioned in the press conference that visibility is better at this point in the year than it was a year ago, so obviously -- you've obviously stopped providing guidance; it would be helpful to understand why that is?</p>
          <p>Also, I just &#x2013; more of a technical point, I noticed that your intangible amortization charges, which I guess are principally charges incurred from acquisitions of obviously non-cash amortization of historic brands and IPR and so forth on the balance sheet, that's risen from about 800 million a quarter in 2008 to 2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, and I imagine might even keep rising now you've added Nortel into the mix next year. Can you just give us an outline of what this non-cash drag on earnings is going to be in 2010, and whether or not you're going to start to show an EPS excluding intangible amortization, as for example, Nokia does? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start from the back here with your request on EPS excluding amortization on intangibles. As usual, we report in the same way during the year and then we look in the first quarter what changes we need to do and we will definitely consider that if it would be helpful for you, and if we feel it, it's also helpful for us and we can report it. So we will look into that in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the increase in amortization, IPRs, et cetera, that of course means that we had CDMA Nortel in the fourth quarter. That amortization is included in the intangible always. So that is &#x2013; now we don't &#x2013; we have no more acquisitions at the moment that we're adding in there. So that has to be cleared up; this is what we have right now.</p>
          <p>On the guidance, I think that the guidance we said already a lot here that we will try to perform instead of talking more about the market and tell what we are doing and how we are going about it. And yes, we have a better visibility. I think it was much more unsecured in the beginning of 2009 because then we were early out in the crisis. That doesn't mean that the crisis has gone away. But we have a way of working with it, we work with internal indicators, we work with external indicators, we work with our customers much closer. So, we have been into this economy now for a while. So, of course we have learned some from it. So, that's why I'm saying that we will have a better visibility from that point of view.</p>
          <p>But again, guidance we have decided not to do. Instead, we prefer to perform, and then we report back every quarter as we're doing right now and tell you what's happening in the quarter, as much we can by the segments and by the regions.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a question on the competitive landscape in the core networks business. Could you just talk a little bit, as any changes we've seen in the market or in pricing as Huawei particularly gets a lot bigger, what has that meant?</p>
          <p>And tied to that, you mentioned some of the emerging markets as being macro-impacted. Could it also be that there is macro-impacts there and some of the competitive Asian solutions make more sense, and therefore we're seeing some market share losses in those areas? Thank you.</p>

          <p>We think we have maintained our market share well on a global level. Of course it can be certain markets have trouble, but we think we have maintained our market share well.</p>
          <p>When it comes to competitive landscape, for obvious reasons, I think that this industry has come with a lot of competition because the prospect of the industry is good. I mean, we can see there the growing importance of telecommunication in the society for you and me and for businesses. So, of course there are more people coming in here. We have Asian vendors right now; we had other competitors before. So I think that we just need to lead with competition, and we have done it for quite a while. So, I don't see it getting worse. It's tough all the time, and that's what we need to work with, at least after the assets and the competitive norms that Ericsson has, and then continue to find efficiency all the time. That's what we need to focus on, but it will always be competition out there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hans, how should be think about the duration of the recovery from networks as it relates to the operators' urgency to upgrade their networks? If we look at your geographic focus, subscriber net adds, traffic growth, are you planning for the market for networks to grow this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. As I said before, I mean it's a little bit too early to start guiding out on that, and I will probably not &#x2013; I will not come back to guide on it, neither. I will more report after the first quarter what I've seen in the first quarter, which will be important. I think there are drivers in the markets which we have seen before. There are some markets continue with rollout and actually taking a lot of investments; there are others that have been down. If they will turn around right now, I'm not sure that we want to see, but I think that Ericsson has great assets to compete in this market and actually grow faster in the market, especially with our mobile infrastructure, IP portfolio, and the service business together that can create us to be able to grow faster than market. But again, it's little bit too early to say anything specific about 2010.</p>

This is one of the toughest crises since I think many decades. And of course when you come into that, you start to look into the models, again what will happen, how it will impact us. And we're now around that four or five quarters, of course, we get better visibility because our customers also understands a little bit better how their marketplace is moving and that means that we that are staying close to our customers get more information from them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Hans, I just wanted to ask you, on North America obviously a lot of growth. A lot of that coming out of the new revenues that you've added from Sprint and from Nortel. But I wonder, could you comment on what's going on in the underlying? We can take some guesses, but it would be nice to hear from you what the underlying growth was in North America for Q4, either on a year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>And then, I just wonder, we've seen continued heavy levels of spending from North America through this year, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit about whether you think that's going to taper off in 2010 or whether you think the probability is pretty high for that to continue at the same pace that it did in 2009? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can deduct it yourself. I mean as I said &#x2013; I mean we have announced the Sprint deal, which is somewhere around U.S.$700 million a year, and then we also disclosed SEK2.7 billion on Nortel sales in the fourth quarter. So if you exclude that, you can make the calculation. I don't have the calculator in front of me, so I cannot really help you, but &#x2013; so that we can get out. What's your other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the second part of that was just, where do you see that spending going in 2010 generally? I mean, do you think it's going to maintain itself at the same level that it's been in 2009? Do you see it tapering off a little bit, do you see growing, essentially? Just wondering directionally where you see the underlying networks business going in North America in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that first of all, if you take the whole context, not only networks, we are now building more recurrent revenues on the service side, and of course that's there to stay, and then we sell on top of that and continue. On the network side, we are now represented in basically on all technologies from fixed to wireless with all operators, and of course a lot will be defined how the market develops.</p>
          <p>But the underlying growth, as long as we can see of course, is continuing there with the data growth in the networks and more and more smartphones coming out and small PC notebooks that's going to use the mobile broadband. So of course that will continue, and if that demand continues, of course it's going to be important with the networks having high quality and the capacity all the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I mean, I should assume from that comment that you're thinking that the revenues stay at least where they are and potentially go up in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; the important here is of course to understand that operators' investments will define that. I think as I said, the underlying pieces are there in order for grow the market. But finally, it's going to be the investment core from the operators are going to define how revenues go in there. But the underlying is still there, and I cannot judge that that is going away.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Richard Kramer from Arete Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Hans, thanks very much. Just a couple of simple questions. One on M&amp;A, when you highlighted a number of areas you see as growth for 2010 and beyond: transmission, broadband access, routing, a number of other areas, and in none of those does Ericsson currently seem to hold a top three position. Given that as CFO, you are presiding over a spend of about SEK60 billion for M&amp;A since Marconi, how do you look at the cash balance that you have now, and inorganic growth looking ahead for 2010 and beyond? And then I have one other follow-up question. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, Richard. I think that when it comes to acquisitions, I think that on the portfolio side, on the product side, we are happy with what we have on mobile infrastructure. We are leading and we strongly believe in organic growth.</p>
          <p>On the fixed side, we have made a lot of &#x2013; on the IP side, we have made the <mark type="inaudible" /> acquisition and here it's more about execution and seeing that we have it right. There can always be some products here and there that can be needed, but I don't see anything at that side.</p>
          <p>Services, we look into all the time and of course that smaller acquisition with resources in certain market in order to get the confidence or acquire market share with it. And then multimedia, here we have our portfolio right now, and we're going to see if there's something more needed, but that's going to be some small addition as well.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we also need to understand, if you had asked me that same question one year ago, I would have said the same. Still, we acquired pieces from Nortel because in this reconsolidation, we always need to have a watch for and see if we can enhance our number one position in this industry. So that's an unknown &#x2013; that's sort of unknown, but other than that, that's how I see the M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>And on the cash balance situation, I think we have done a good job to increase our net cash, even though we have been doing a lot of acquisitions during the last years. So I think that we have a very strong financial position that we have right now, and that is important in these times, as we saw last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just as a quick follow-up, when you think about restructuring, do you ever see an end point for the restructuring plan in Ericsson, where you'll have a year where there'll be simply no need for restructuring, or you'll able to stand pat? Because we seem to have seen a restructuring plan in more years than not this decade, and it looks as if it's continuing through 2010; it's not clear whether we'll see it planned every year after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, efficiency work is part of our business all the time, so that's true, but of course, I mean we believe that some time we will not have the restructuring charges and that's of course. And if we look back in the decade, we have had several years where we don't have much restructuring charges. But right now, in this economic climate, I think it was obvious that we need to adjust our cost structure, given what we first saw already in the beginning of the year, even though it came late in the year. So, I think that were being very proactive and taking the right activities here, but again, we all want to really to run the Company without restructuring, but that doesn't mean we will look for efficiencies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my question. It's actually rather broad-based, and I noted that during your presentation you mentioned the GPON rollouts in China, and you also mentioned your expanded role at AT&amp;T. My question is whether that could be a blueprint also for other markets where you engage maybe more aggressively also on the fixed side, simply because big, integrated operators demands a broader set of products and services? And in particular, could that also mean that maybe if you look at new areas of competence in the services area, that could in the future more related to next generation broadband deployments on the fixed side? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We strongly believe in a growing broadband infrastructure, whether it's mobile or fixed. So in the same way as you have seen so far, there is huge uptake on mobile broadband, and we see several countries where it's being complemented with a high-speed and fixed broadband, so here then we talk about VDSL2 technology or GPON Technology. And as you said, we've made good advancements in China and the U.S. that we are extremely happy about because they are extremely big &#x2013; I mean in the range of 60% of the world market for that type of fixed broadband connection. But we also have made advancements in other countries during the year, and we will continue to selectively target other countries where we believe there are some good growth opportunities for us.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we strongly believe that going forward, that more and more operators will come in to convergent architecture and convergent business mobile, still being dominated by the mobile access, but very much being complementary with a fixed access. And of course for those operators that fit us well, of course we target those.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I just wanted to have a clarification on India where you said it is going to be down about 25% this quarter and you mentioned 3G has been a very disruptive sector.  Is there &#x2013; in my current understanding, it seems that the timeline for 3G is that 3G spending is not likely to happen before the very late part of the year, in the last two months of the year. And most of it is likely to happen actually in 2011, so do you expect by then the continued weakness in the market in India, or do you see in India several rollouts in 2010 in 2G that will maintain the level of spending comparable to what we've seen in 2009? Thank you &#x2013; in 2010 sorry, thank you.</p>

          <p>I think that &#x2013; I'm not predicting when the auction is going to be because that is very difficult for me to do, and I'm following the market as close as I can, as you are doing. Of course, if the auction will be moved out one year from now, the underlying growth in subscribers et cetera are happening in India, so that means that we will then invest in the 2G, so that will be the flip side. The prospect in Q4 is &#x2013; in the fourth quarter was that it should be an auction in the first quarter. So of course, then we saw some hesitancy and some waiting there, but let us see now what will happen with the auction, and if that's postponed or delayed or something, that will of course mean that they will continue to spend on the technology that they have.</p>

          <p>Hey, thanks for taking the call. On Nortel, you had mentioned seasonality. How should we think about the magnitude of that contribution in the outlook, and was there an additional factor beyond seasonality related to the change in ownership that might have distorted it even more than normal?</p>
          <p>And also, you mentioned some markets that have pretty good subscriber growth, but didn't have a lot of spending in 2009, and what would be your feeling about the pent-up demand converting to revenue for your Networks business?

On the CEMA region, it's hard to generalize because there are so many countries in there. Some will probably come back this year and some will, may take it easy for a while. But to give any guidance what will happen and when the rebound that I &#x2013; it's a little bit too early, so I wouldn't do that.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about how, what you see in terms of wireless networks usage. I think there was a very interesting slide with regards to markets there from the CTO regarding the usage of bandwidth on 3G Networks between netbooks, smartphones, and sort of voice. I mean have you seen any sort of change in the distribution of bandwidth, or is that still very much driven by 3G netbooks and notebooks?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I mean, what we explained them back in May is very much what we continue to see those. I mean it's two main drivers, I mean the first one is laptops, netbooks with built-in 3G modules or dongles, and continue to show a pretty good uptake worldwide.</p>
          <p>And the second one, trend maybe becoming increasingly stronger is the smartphones. It used to be only the iPhones, now even much more will be Android phones. And the volumes they are generating seems to be very much on the similar path. Typically we see around 400 megabytes on the smartphone per month, and laptops, netbooks in the range of maybe three gigabytes. Of course, there's huge differences here depending on which country and subscribers, but still fairly substantial volumes anyway, and I see that that trend keeps on.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, the consumer demand here has been strong. I think that's what looks most positive here is that the &#x2013; for many of the first years on 3Gs, it was the build-out was driven by license, demand, and coverage built out. But the last more than 12 months, we have seen expansions being driven by consumer demand and by successful launches of applications, and I don't see that changing, really.</p>

Since the beginning of '08, about 40% of your restructuring was targeting costs of goods sold, yet the gross margin has moved in a steady downwards motion to the current level. Can you maybe comment on whether we should just write off that part of cost-cutting as going to the price pressure that you see in the market, or is it essentially the evolution of your business mix?  Thanks.</p>

          <p>On the first one, on the market development, it's a little bit too early to judge where the infrastructure business has gone in 2009, but we can definitely see that it has been a decline in infrastructure business in 2009. And it's most probably also double digits. But we need to see everybody reporting and so on before we deal with that as we will first start with &#x2013; we have to wait and see.</p>
          <p>On the gross margin, I think that the main part, first of all, a lot of the efficiency works that we're doing against cost-of-sales right now, that of course is coming into play over time, there. On the other hand, the business mix is a very important parameter that you're measuring. I mean as for increasing the service business, our gross margin is coming down, but that should not mean that our profitability is not staying at same level, as we have different type of cost structures on services and networks.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I wanted to go back to an earlier question and the comment was made that at some point 3G and WCDMA spending generally will offset the decline in 2G. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of insight as to when, or at what level that's likely to take place firstly.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we've talked for a long time about just the need for increased spending, particularly out of where you're seeing increased data rates, particularly other carriers like in Western Europe. And I'm wondering what you look at as kind of the key elements that would likely catalyze that and drive your business in those markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. When it comes to the 3G GSM offsetting, I mean, I would wait with that sort of indication and see what's happening here going forward. But again, I mean GSM today is still deployed in many large markets, which are very important, and of course if they continue to invest a lot on GSM, it will be there for longer time. So that is still a little bit on different operators, but also remember right now we're going into technologies that's going to have radio base station that contains all types of technologies all the time. So it's going to be harder to say what is what there all the time. That's for sure and then frequencies as well. So, but definitely we see &#x2013; I said before that 3G is coming up and the decline in GSM is not offset on the growth of 3G at the moment. The second question was about &#x2013; I don't remember now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I'm sorry, just about &#x2013; we've talked about the need for increased spend to address growth in data rates in Europe, but I'm wondering what you look at as kind of the key catalyst or key things that need to happen for that to be catalyzed?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look quite a lot on the data traffic of course in the networks, but also on the transmission possibilities in the backhaul, because that is usually where it seemed in the beginning that where the capacity constraints are coming. So we look a lot in the hyper backbone and transmission of data, but also on the access interface on mobile broadband.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much. I've got a question on professional services, two parts if that's okay. The non-managed services part, or professional services seemed to be very weak in Q4. I was just hoping you could detail the dynamics there. Is it a macro cycle or something more structural? And secondly, on managed services, you said during the first half of the year that interest picked up. I was wondering if that interest is starting to wane at the operators toward more normalized levels, or are you starting to convert this interest into concrete contractual discussions? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I can take that one. So if you look at Q4 there, there was some &#x2013; you have to look at Q4 '08. We had a very strong ending of a lot of projects there, predominantly in consulting and system integration, so there was a bit of a tough comparison for that business in Q4 '08. On the &#x2013; if you look at managed services, I think, I mean there is still a lot of discussions ongoing with basically all wireless and wireline operators, and I think that you can classify the demand as being still high for sure, and I don't see any change in that pattern compared to earlier in the year.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I've got a couple of questions, the first one is actually on Western Europe. If I look at this bit of the details you put in on Western European network revenues. And if you go back a few years, it's clear that the Western European networking market for you has declined probably every year since 2006. And I'm wondering, is there any visibility or hope? Is that in long-term secular decline, do you think, or could that recover? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one, I guess is for Hans. On targets, when it comes to the Ericsson as a global leader provides various guidance or targets apart from to say you are in best-in-class margins in long term. Well, frankly, it doesn't mean a great deal when the industries isn't making much in terms of margins, so can we look forward to a long-term kind of margin target which would be a bit more ambitious than that, do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On Western Europe, I think the mix shift is quite apparent inside that network business, coming from very much rollout on GSM in the 2006 and '05 so that &#x2013; to now being predominantly WCDMA, HSPA, and backbone business as well. So it has been a clear mix shift in inside network, which maybe you don't see here. So, it's quite a big swing and at the same time, our work in European region has of course also converted itself to do much more services, which have been growing very nicely. And that's all about our portfolio that we can play with different type of products and services in times, or during different times.</p>
          <p>When it comes to targets, I think that those are the targets that we're going to follow and we're going to focus on them. We're sort of breaking down in turn how we go about them. If we're going to disclose them externally, have not decided to do that and &#x2013; but as all the time, we are reviewing and seeing, but definitely nothing decided at all doing at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And will the cash conversion still be around 70%, or can we look forward to 100% cash conversion any time soon for Ericsson as a Company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good question. And we have had a target for 70% cash conversion or above 70% cash conversion, so that's important because we believe in a growth model; of course we will need some capital to use it. But as we've seen in this year, of course we performed good on the cash conversion, given that we actually have worked on our capital side, but also that we have a little bit lower business volumes. So, I think that is still valid with a cash conversion about 70%, but it can be over 100% as well.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you. So, lot of questions have been asked. I wanted to know if you could talk about seasonal patterns for 2010. Again, you did say visibility was a bit better, but typically the March and September quarters are weak, and relatively stronger second and fourth quarters. For modeling purposes, should we be looking at a kind of a normal seasonal decline here for March and then normal seasonality going forward, or at this time it's just too difficult to predict? Thanks.</p>

I said before yes, we have better visibility, but again, we will not guide on any specific way here at the moment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thanks very much. I had a quick follow-up or two small ones, rather, on the restructuring side of things. You've formally extended the amount of savings that you're looking for now out to the 15 to 16 billion level. I was just wondering whether the split between COGS and OpEx remains roughly even, as you'd highlighted previously for the 10 billion?  And then also at third quarter, you'd highlighted you're ahead of plan in terms of achieving that initial 10 billion, but can you tell us how much was actually in your figures as of the end of 2009? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, yeah, it's a sort of the same split that we had before on the remaining portion of the program. And the second question was how much we have achieved so far?</p>
