          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Bayer's Investor and Analyst Conference Call on the First Quarter 2012 Results. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Cleo. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome, also on behalf of my colleagues, to our first quarter conference call. As always, with me on the call are Marijn Dekkers, our CEO; and Werner Baumann, our CFO. HealthCare is represented by J&#xF6;rg Reinhardt; CropScience by Sandra Peterson; and MaterialScience by Patrick Thomas.</p>
          <p>Marijn will start off with a brief summary of the developments in the quarter. As always, he assumes that you have received and reviewed our document. Before handing over to Marijn, I'd also like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement. Thank you. Marijn?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alexander. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It's my pleasure to speak with you about Bayer's encouraging start to 2012. We delivered record sales and higher earnings in the quarter. Our innovation pipeline delivered good progress and we again reported positive results on our key pharma pipeline assets. We're increasingly confident for the rest of this year and confirm our 2012 financial outlook.</p>
          <p>So let me now elaborate on some key figures for the first quarter and when talking about sales, I'll concentrate on portfolio and currency-adjusted data. Group sales rose by 5% to the record level of &#x20AC;10.1 billion. All the subgroups contributed to the increase, particularly CropScience, which experienced a strong start to the season.</p>
          <p>Reported EBIT rose sharply by 43% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion, mainly due to lower special charges and the improved operating performance. The special charges of &#x20AC;169 million versus &#x20AC;442 million in the prior year quarter comprised a partial impairment loss of &#x20AC;100 million recognized on the company named MEDRAD. It also included restructuring charges of &#x20AC;39 million and litigation-related expenses of &#x20AC;30 million.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA advanced by 9% to &#x20AC;2.4 billion, driven by positive business development at HealthCare and significant volume gains at CropScience. In addition, positive currency effects of &#x20AC;85 million, mainly at HealthCare and CropScience, contributed to the increase. Earnings of MaterialScience came in below the prior year period due to higher raw material costs but showed the expected increase against the weak fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Core earnings per share came in at &#x20AC;1.68, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. From a regional perspective, in the first quarter, we saw the stronger growth in the United States. Our business moved ahead by 10% in the quarter, driven by the strong business expansion at CropScience and solid growth at MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>In the emerging economies, we achieved a 6% sales increase. These markets accounted for 33% of group sales. The highest growth rates were in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa and the Middle East. Emerging Asia grew by 1%, business development both impacted by lower sales in Thailand and Taiwan.</p>
          <p>Gross cash flow in the first quarter advanced by 22% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion due to the improved operating performance. Cash tied-up in working capital increased markedly due to the expansion of business. Net cash flow was down by 66% year-on-year at &#x20AC;271 million. After investments of &#x20AC;256 million, the operating free cash flow came in at &#x20AC;15 million. Net financial debt fell since the start of the year from &#x20AC;7.1 billion to &#x20AC;6.9 billion mainly as a result of positive currency effects.</p>
          <p>Let's now move on to the performance of our subgroup. Sales of the healthcare subgroup came to &#x20AC;4.3 billion, an improvement of 2% over the same period of last year. All divisions contributed to this growth. Sales in the Pharmaceutical segment rose by 2% to &#x20AC;2.5 billion. Growth was achieved mainly in the emerging markets, especially China. There were slight decreases in some other countries, particularly in Europe. The development of our key pharma products was mixed in the quarter. Kogenate gained 2% due to higher volumes through tender business. As expected, Betaferon sales were slightly down from the previous year.</p>
          <p>Volume declines, especially in North America, were only partially offset by selling price increases. Nexavar developed well particularly in the U.S. and advanced by 5%. Revenues from Mirena increased in all regions as a result of higher volumes, especially in the United States. Avelox and Levitra were down 13% and 9%, respectively, because of a partial restructuring of distribution from general medicine products in the United States.</p>
          <p>Aspirin Cardio advanced by 16% driven by the continued expansion of our own marketing activities in China. Xarelto generated sales of &#x20AC;42 million following market launches in further countries and the expansion of indications. Sales of our Yaz family of products were at the prior year level, the decline in Europe due to generic competition being offset by gains in other regions.</p>
          <p>Please allow me to update you on the litigation surrounding Yaz and Yasmin. As of April 18, 2012, the number of lawsuits pending in the United States and served upon Bayer was about 11,900 involving about 14,000 plaintiffs excluding cases already settled. As of April 19, 2012, Bayer has reached agreements without admission of liability to settle the claims of 651 plaintiffs in the U.S. for a total amount of about $142 million. Bayer is only settling claims in the U.S. for venous clot injuries, which is deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism after a case specific analysis of medical records on a rolling basis. The number of such injuries cannot be estimated at this time. However, less than half of the cases served to date allege such an injury.</p>
          <p>Based on the information currently available, Bayer has taken appropriate accounting measures for anticipated defense costs and for a grief and anticipated future settlement. Bayer is insured against product liability risk to the extent customary in the industry. However, going forward and depending on further developments in the litigation, it is possible that the company's global liability insurance program may not be sufficient or fully applicable to cover all expenses and potential liability, if any, resulting from this litigation.</p>
          <p>So, so much to the Yaz and Yasmin litigation, now I'll go back to business in HealthCare. Adjusted EBITDA of pharma improved by 2%. Earnings benefited from higher sales and a decline in development costs, which was mainly due to the completion of most Phase III studies for Xarelto as well as from exchange rate movements. This effect was partially offset by increased expenses for the marketing of new products and investment in business developments in the emerging markets. We remain optimistic for future development of our Pharma business, especially because of the continued success of our pipeline.</p>
          <p>At the end of last month, we published the results of the EINSTEIN-PE trial studying Xarelto versus standard therapy. As you know, Xarelto was proven as effective and safe as the current standard drug regimen in treating patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism and preventing them from developing a secondary venous blood clot. Xarelto demonstrated similar overall bleeding rates that was associated with significantly lower rates of major bleeding versus the current standard regimen. We have since filed for this indication in Europe.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the year, we also presented full data for regorafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Since then, we also reported that regorafenib met its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors. These very positive results show that we are on the right track.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to Consumer Health. Sales at the Consumer Health segment advanced by 3% to &#x20AC;1.8 billion with all divisions contributing to growth. Business developed especially well in the emerging markets. Sales of the Consumer Care division grew by 2%, while sales of Bepanthen increased, business with Aleve and the One A Day line of dietary supplements matched to good prior year level. Sales of Aspirin declined from the high level of the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Sales of the Medical Care Division rose 4% driven by the positive development of our contrast agent and medical equipment business. The growth in our diabetes care business was largely attributable to substantial sales increases in all regions for our Contour line of blood glucose meters.</p>
          <p>The Animal Health Division lifted sales by 5%. The Advantage product line benefited from an additional distribution channel in the U.S., considerably raising sales once again against a strong prior year quarter. The adjusted EBITDA of Consumer Health increased by 6%. The earnings improvement was mainly attributable to higher sales in all divisions, while successful cost management kept expenses stable across all functions.</p>
          <p>The performance of the HealthCare divisions resulted in adjusted EBITDA of &#x20AC;1.2 billion for the subgroup as a whole, an improvement of 4% over the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to CropScience. Sales in the CropScience subgroup climbed by 14% to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. The season got off to an early and promising start in the northern hemisphere, especially in North America, with moderate growth stimuli in Europe. Our sharpened focus on marketing and distribution is already bearing fruit.</p>
          <p>With good marketing conditions continuing, we grew all areas of the business. Sales of the Crop Protection Division advanced by 15%, driven by all product groups and regions. While our seed treatment business showed a moderate increase, the other business units registered double-digit growth rates. Sales of insecticides benefited from our rejuvenated portfolio. The herbicides business was mainly driven by our corn portfolio. The strong growth in fungicide revenues was achieved in North America and Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>BioScience continued on its path of growth with a considerable sales gain of 17%. The largest increase was posted for our canola and cotton seed businesses. Our vegetable seed business saw a modest start to the year, with a moderate decline in sales against a strong prior-year quarter.</p>
          <p>Sales of the Environmental Science business unit advanced slightly by 3%. This was due to sales increases for consumer products in the U.S. and Europe. However, sales of products for professional users declined due to phasing in tender business.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA of CropScience has moved ahead by 32%. Earnings growth, mainly the result of an early start to the season and considerably higher volumes, was also helped by efficiency improvements, successful cost management and positive currency effects. In addition, we benefited from one-time gains of &#x20AC;22 million in connection with the divestment of active ingredients at Crop Protection and from the earlier receipt of royalty payments.</p>
          <p>So let's move to MaterialScience. There, sales advanced by 3% chiefly due to higher volumes in all regions. Selling prices as a whole were level with the prior year quarter. Sales of our Polyurethane business rose by 5% driven by both higher volumes and higher prices for MDI and polyether.</p>
          <p>TDI sales came in below the prior year quarter on weaker prices. Volumes for TDI, however, were slightly higher. Our Polycarbonates business unit came in 4% below the strong prior year quarter chiefly due to a global decline in selling prices in our granules product group although volumes increased.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for MaterialScience before special items at &#x20AC;278 million was down a substantial 19% from the prior year quarter, but more than doubled against the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings were diminished above all by a rise in raw material costs, higher operating costs also had a negative effect. These cost increases were partially offset by savings from the efficiency improvement programs.</p>
          <p>Earnings benefited from increased volumes. In addition, we recorded one-time gains of &#x20AC;90 million on the acquisition of the remaining interest in the joint venture Baul&#xE9;. In view of the good start to 2012, we are increasingly confident for the rest of the year as I already said. However, given the continuing global and economic uncertainties, we are for now adhering to the guidance for the full year 2012 that we issued at the end of February.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2012, we continue to forecast the sales increase of about 3%. This would result in group sales of approximately &#x20AC;37 billion based on unchanged exchange rate assumptions. We continue to plan a slight improvement in adjusted EBITDA and we also plan to slightly improve core earnings per share. Also, the guidance for our subgroups stays the same.</p>
          <p>For HealthCare, we plan to increase sales by a low to mid-single digit percentage and to slightly improve adjusted EBITDA. We expect market conditions for our CropScience business to remain favorable in 2012 and predict above market growth. Following the strong start to the year, the guidance we issued in February, which is, "We anticipate the currency and portfolio adjusted sales and EBITDA before special items will advance by mid-single digit percentages." But this guidance may be adjusted upon publication of our Q2 report depending on future business development.</p>
          <p>For MaterialScience, we continue to plan for sales and adjusted EBITDA to remain level with the prior year. Compared with the first quarter of 2012, we expect an improvement in sales and significantly higher adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, before opening the Q&amp;A session, let me summarize the main points. The Bayer Group saw an encouraging start to 2012. We confirm our outlook for 2012 and are targeting higher sales and earnings. So this concludes my remarks and we are now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Race. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, guys. It's Tim Race here from Deutsche Bank. Three questions please. First one on CropScience, just a very strong volume gains but limited pricing. Could you just talk about how you expect this to play out with the rest of the year and with competitors? And just generally, are we actually seeing market share gains or is this predominantly phasing, if you could talk around that.</p>
          <p>Just simply on MaterialScience, we've seen price rises in April, how are they sticking and the general level of visibility in the business right now. And then maybe a question just on -- from Marijn, just on strategy. It seems every time I look, somebody apparently very familiar with the market is talking to the press about M&amp;A. So if we look to your overall strategy, surely, you must be very confident in the organic growth prospects of at least two of your divisions. So when you look to the future, do you see any case for need of greater scale in any of your businesses and what particular geographical presence or perhaps technology are you missing -- maybe I'll leave it there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. We'll start with CropSciences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks for your question. The way we would describe the first quarter is we're actually quite pleased not only with the volume growth but also our pricing performance in the first quarter. If you remember the way in which we deal with pricing is when we're launching products, they're usually launched at a price premium compared to the reference price that was there before. And we have seen that those products &#x2013; that those new products that we launched last year and the ones that we're launching this year have been able to sustain those higher prices and we're actually seeing higher demand for those new products than we initially anticipated.</p>
          <p>So that had some positive effect also on the first quarter. So we're actually feeling pretty comfortable with where we sit today with our pricing, both on our BioScience portfolio as well as in our crop protection portfolio and we've been able to command and sustain those slightly higher prices.</p>
          <p>Now, as we always say, it's still a little bit early in the year and we'll have to see how the season develops particularly in the second quarter whether that will hold up through the second and third quarter, both.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the early start of the season, that's been predominantly really in the North American marketplace where the season did appear to open up somewhat early. It's hard to actually calculate how much product moved into the first quarter versus the second quarter. But there are a number of other effects including, as Marijn mentioned, our new products are doing quite well.</p>
          <p>But also some of our increased focus on marketing and sales execution, not only in North America but across our business in all of the regions we've seen some positive uptake in our portfolio. But this is a &#x2013; it's a volatile, cyclical business and part of a what we need to see is how the second quarter fully plays out in terms of what actually gets planted and used through the second quarter to have a much better visibility on the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks, Sandy. Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Tim. Just a bit about pricing, I probably have to talk differently about the different sectors a little bit here. TDI pricing started to move up in Asia in the first quarter and is continuing into the second quarter. The price rises, which were posted April 3, 2012, have stuck there and we see a continuing momentum into the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The absolute level of pricing TDI has led to some consolidation in the industry. We've seen multiplying of capacity in Japan and Korea and also closure of a unit in Brazil, which is helping in terms of supply and demand balance. So, I'm positive on the pricing aspects of TDI looking forward. So, I'm reasonably confident now those prices will continue.</p>
          <p>In MDI, where the growth is primarily driven at the moment by U.S. growth particularly for insulation demand and for these new CARB regulations where polyurethanes replaced formaldehyde products in the wood industry, we've seen some good growth and that's helping with supply and demand and as such, we see, at the beginning of quarter one, price increases and I think the momentum is reasonably good following the low single digit drops during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Then on polycarbonates, which was where we had the biggest price impact in quarter one, primarily due to the mix of sectors that we were serving with some good strong volumes, we have the main effect of the middle eastern capacity coming on stream. That primarily affected Asia but, of course, Asia is 60% of the market, so that's significant. There's no new capacity coming on this year. There have been delays to the projects which have already been started and are under construction. Therefore, we expect the pricing momentum to continue also in Polycarbonates during the second quarter. And certainly, looking at March and April sales data, that would support that principal view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, and then, this is Marijn, to answer your question on strategy. Those rumors pop up regularly. Of course, we have the policy not to comment on M&amp;A type of rumors but I think what you said is correct. We are confident and hopeful that our organic growth momentum will accelerate in the next number of years. In pharma, we have the new product pipeline, Xarelto and EYLEA this year getting extra sales momentum and then other products in the next few years.</p>
          <p>In CropSciences, we have a very nice portfolio that should lead to significant organic growth. And also in MaterialSciences, we have spent quite a lot of money in capital investments over the last years, particularly in Caojing, China to build more capacity for both Polyurethanes and Polycarbonates. So we are well-positioned there to continue to drive top line growth in MaterialScience as well. And that is really our key priority, drive organic growth for Bayer in the next years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Redenius. Please state your name, company name, followed also by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. Thank you for taking my questions. I have few a questions about CropScience and then one on MaterialScience. First of all, on the CropScience volume growth, is it possible if you could help us quantify the mix effects &#x2013; the positive mix effects you saw this quarter? And then second, could you help us understand the nature of some of the cost reductions you're seeing as well as the nature of the portfolio rejuvenation? I'm just trying to look for an example of what's happening there and also if you can give us a feel for the size of the impact of those changes? And then finally, for CropScience and MaterialScience both, could you give us a feel for the size of the raw materials inflation impact this quarter? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sandy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jeremy, could you actually ask your first part of your question again? I didn't quite understand what you were asking me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Sorry. You've talked about the positive mix effects from selling newer products at higher prices in the existing products. I'm just trying to understand that. I understand you put that in the volume growth components of your sales growth. I'm trying to get a feel for how big that impact is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now I understand. So let me just explain that point a little bit clearer. So when we actually &#x2013; when we launched these new products, you won't see the &#x2013; if they're launched after the first quarter and many of them were of last year, you actually won't see them in this first quarter's result in terms of a price effect. So what actually does, it actually does show up in the volume side of the business. I can't give you an exact number of the mix effect of that specifically on the volume in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>What I can tell you, which is what we've said earlier this year, is, of those products that have been launched since 2010, we expect them, by the end of this year, to cross the &#x20AC;1 billion revenue line and we're clearly on track to be able to do that this year. So that's something &#x2013; but that -- the product that we launch between 2010 and 2011 -- but I can actually give you the specifics on the mix effect in this exact first quarter.</p>
          <p>The second question you asked was around the nature of cost reduction programs. As you know, we undertook a significant series of cost restructuring initiatives that we started towards the end of 2010. We announced that they would have a full impact of about &#x20AC;265 million by the end of 2012 and those are fully on track. Those actually go across many parts of our business. They go from things like cleaning up our portfolio, divesting or not selling certain products anymore, cleaning up our number of SKUs, our pack sizes. They go from things like taking costs out of parts of our business where we have lower growth in more mature markets and reinvesting some of that money in other regions and parts of the country.</p>
          <p>We also, part of this is a huge amount of work to optimize our supply chain infrastructure, both our asset base and how we actually manage our supply chain and our inventory. And that had a very significant positive effect on our business performance in 2011 and in the first quarter of 2012 has also had a positive impact &#x2013; a combination of increased volumes and the impact of those things have actually added another three points in our cost improvement in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And as it relates to your question about raw material costs and whether it had any negative impact on our business in the first quarter. It didn't because we are not as impacted by energy oil prices in our business and we were able to completely compensate for any of those raw material cost increases from the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Three questions, first on Xarelto, I wondered if you could update us on German market share and how you're progressing relative to Pradaxa and then broadly across Europe. And then related, assuming the trends that you disclosed -- I mean the management, have continued, just any color as to why you believe European trajectory versus Pradaxa has fared better than the U.S.</p>
          <p>Second question is just a follow-on on the M&amp;A angle. I know you won't comment on specifics, but I just want to check my understanding of where you're focus had been historically. I think you've commented that within healthcare, you're more interested in allied healthcare, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:14) consumer versus pure pharma and also more emerging markets than pure pharma. Is my understanding correct and does that remain the case? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me take the Xarelto question. Overall, I'm actually pleased to confirm that we are fully on track with Xarelto in Europe. In Germany, which is obviously the most important country for us at the moment. We continue to gain market share. We are now above 10% market share. We have good reception with cardiologists and also with GPs. And we are outperforming despite coming into the market significantly behind products. We are outperforming them in the German market.</p>
          <p>Now, Germany so far is the most advanced country. When you look across the rest of Europe, the picture is a little bit more difficult. So for example in the U.K., we got a positive recommendation from NICE, but we are still waiting for the final document to be shared and only after that the reimbursement procedure could start, so we will probably have to wait another few weeks until we are finally reimbursed in the U.K.</p>
          <p>In Canada, it's a little bit of the same picture. We are negotiating with the different provinces, province by province regarding reimbursement prices and that will take some time. So, the uptake in those both countries for the time being is slow, but according to expectations.</p>
          <p>We launched in Japan, you have seen this. We launched last week. We got a price that is at par with Dabigatran. We're actually quite okay with the price. Obviously, it's too early to make any projections, but the first initial uptake and the response in the market has been very good. So, in Japan we are again absolutely confident that we can achieve our objectives.</p>
          <p>Regarding the other European markets, France, Spain, Italy, reimbursement discussions are being started. As indicated earlier, this will take a few weeks or months, but for all of these countries, we would expect to be in the market and be reimbursed before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, you asked Europe versus U.S. I mean obviously, regarding specific U.S. performance, you need to talk to our partner J&amp;J. What we are seeing is that obviously the shift of new patients out of warfarin towards the new class of anticoagulants is less steep than what we might have hoped. We see that still, for example, in the overall market, roughly 70% of new patients are being put on warfarin. That is different with cardiologists, there, it's only 50%. So the acceptance of the new products with cardiologists is higher. But still, a significant part of new patients still goes on warfarin.</p>
          <p>Regarding those who don't go on warfarin, but I found Dabigatran or Xarelto, we see an increasing share for Xarelto. Week-after-week, we are gaining ground here as compared to Dabigatran, so for example in the overall market, the share of new patients that we get is higher than the one that Dabigatran gets. And among cardiologists, we are very close to each other.</p>
          <p>So overall, we see an improving trend in the U.S. But, obviously, it takes longer than what we might have expected to really convince physicians to put new patients on these products. That trend is different a little bit in Europe where we see higher initial acceptance rates for the new product. So that's why we believe that overall, the penetration in most of the European market should be faster than what we currently see in the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, J&#xF6;rg. I'll answer the question on areas of emphasis for potential acquisitions. I think we've said in the past that, particularly in HealthCare and CropSciences, would be our areas of focus, if we would be doing acquisitions in the future, and that is still the case. But to start speculating about what areas of HealthCare and what areas of CropSciences, I think, is not appropriate at this point. A lot of these decisions depend on whether a good acquisition target is available for a reasonable price that you can integrate successfully and create value on and that is really the most important screen for us when we would make a decision like that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Thanks very much for taking my questions. A couple, please. Just going back on the CropSciences and just wondering about whether you could comment on the very strong herbicide growth, whether it's related to market share gains, how sustainable you think that level of growth is going forward and, again, whether any demand has been pulled through into Q1.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just following on from the Xarelto question, just wondering whether the level of orthopedic surgery sales is pretty much flat or growing year-on-year. Obviously, there's been some sales in the U.S. of orthopedics, about &#x20AC;8 million, but just trying to get an idea of, I suppose, the split between orthopedic and the stroke sales. If you could comment on that, that would be &#x2013; on the dynamics you're seeing there in orthopedic surgery, that would be great. And then finally just on the margin development within pharma, again, how much of the cost savings targets fell through in the margin? How we should think about the margin development throughout the remainder of the year. Should we think of more SG&amp;A rises leading through on Xarelto, reducing the margins of the quarters going forward? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandy, on herbicides?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on herbicides, generally speaking, we &#x2013; this is not a phasing effect. Our portfolio on herbicides is actually the broadest in the marketplace and in particular, if you look at North America, where we're seeing a significant increase in weed resistance, our portfolio is actually able to tackle a number of those issues with some of our pre-emerging products as well as our Liberty line of product. And so we're seeing a very significant interest in demand from our North American customers in that regard but it's actually not just in North America.</p>
          <p>We're actually seeing strong growth in Asia Pacific and in Latin America, in particular, in the first quarter, and as the year progresses, our current view is this should be a sustainable level of performance in our herbicide portfolio because there are a number of challenges with resistance that are developing also interestingly in Latin America as well as in North America. So, we believe it's a pretty sustainable level of performance that we should see this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. So, J&#xF6;rg, orthopedic, Xarelto and then margin development of funds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Richard. So, what we see &#x2013; first of all in the orthopedic indication, we see growing sales in all the markets that we have approval. We see also that this past indication did actually help to sell. Also in the orthopedic indication, on average we are at the range between 15% and 25% of sales that overall sales at the moment for Xarelto that are in the orthopedic indication. This differs a little bit country by country and as you know with the different dosages, you're not totally sure whether the 10 milligram is really only sold by orthopedics. So, at the end of the day, that's the range, 15% to 25% with growing tendency.</p>
          <p>Now regarding margins, I actually have no reason to give you any other guidance for the remainder of the year than what we have been doing before. In pharma as we said, we believe that we will see a slight decline of the margin that will, to some extent &#x2013; to a large extent be compensated by better performance in the Consumer Health indications which will lead to a yearly overall slight increase in EBITDA for the HealthCare division. That is actually unchanged. I mean, you saw in the first quarter a decrease by 0.5% in the margin for pharma which had to do with the investment obviously in marketing and sales especially in support of the launches.</p>
          <p>We have a little bit lower R&amp;D costs in pharma and we have a little bit better margin in Consumer Health. So, overall the direction that we indicated in mid-management and that we gave you earlier in the year is still intact.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Mike Leuchten from Barclays. Two quick questions please. Number one, if I look at your working capital and you alluded to that quickly, it's going up quite significantly on the back of high receivables. Now, I understand that's related to the expansion of your business but as a percent of revenues or inventory &#x2013; as receivable days, that seems to be going up. I was wondering whether you could elaborate on that. And then secondly, just on Yaz, EU, could you just repeat, is that &#x2013; is the decline in Europe as expected or less or is it worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Working capital, Werner Baumann will reply to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mike. You're correct in assessing that we see a slight erosion in our working capital to sales ratios. It is to the largest extent driven by saving effects and the significantly higher tie-up of money specifically in receivables. We fully expect to bring that back to the performance levels of last year and some years actually even improving throughout the remainder of the year and that means performance in working capital management will be in line with last year, maybe in some areas slightly better. Overall, resources tied up in working capital will of course be significantly higher driven by our business performance you have seen in the first quarter and going on into the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Regarding Yaz, yes, the decline in Europe is a little bit less than we would have expected. It depends a little bit country by country. So for example in France, we have a decline by 33%, which is pretty hefty. In Germany, it's only 6% or 7% so far. So on average, it's a little bit less than the 30% for the whole of Western Europe that we had predicted but that's just the first quarter and we would expect this decline to accelerate a little bit for the remainder of the year. But it's not -- certainly not worse than what we would have expected.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Wenner. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. It's Fabian Wenner from Kepler. Could I ask three questions please? The first one to Sandra on follow-up on the sales evolution in CropScience especially herbicides, if you put Q1 2012 into perspective to last year, obviously you were saying there is not necessarily phasing, but this is structural effect and the second quarter 2011 also saw a good North American growth over the first quarter. Can you just explain what you think is happening when you speak to pharma in particular? The early start to the season is clear but anything else you can tell us that makes us more confident on the sustainability of our sales progression. Thank you.</p>
          <p>The second question for Marijn is a bit broader. Your MaterialScience guidance applies with the division again, won't cover its cost of capital this year. Do you see any progress in any of the value chains or do we have to accept that that's just the case, particularly improvement in PC pricing over the course of the years is something happening here and do you see structural benefits you can read? And the last question is just for J&#xF6;rg, the pipeline update. Can you give us any more insight into the timing of your pivotal Nexavar studies in lung, thyroid and adjuvant liver? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sandy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So your question has to do with the sustainability. It sounds like you're really specifically talking about herbicides. I can talk about a little bit more broadly but let me focus on the herbicide situation at the moment. If you look at North and South America as well as in Asia, there are a number of things going on. One of them is in North and South America. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing an increased resistance level to Roundup and we're seeing it in many different crops in parts of all &#x2013; in the United States and actually into Canada. And as you know, we now have the ability with the LibertyLink trait to actually have an alternative that can be used in combination or individually to actually address some of those problems.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, we're also seeing the same effect in parts of Brazil, in the Mato Grosso region in particular. And so we are seeing &#x2013; and now we also have crops that have gotten registrations where now you can use Liberty to help clean up those fields. And as farmers in that region do double cropping in a year, it's a way for them to be able to still use those fields by planting for, example, cotton with LibertyLink trait in one season and planting corn in the other season. And it really helps &#x2013; seems to help them.</p>
          <p>So we're seeing a pretty robust demand for that part of our product portfolio. But we're also seeing in other parts of the world where older &#x2013; some older chemistries are being unregistered or deregistered that we're also seeing Avast used in those contexts in Asia Pacific and that's part of why we're seeing a significant increase in our business there. But then we also have other products that I've mentioned earlier that are used for pre-emergence on a number of different crops and those are working quite well and they're working quite well across a broad spectrum of issues. And what we're hearing from farmers in most of these markets is that they need these products. They need to think about rotating crops, rotating different spray calendars to make sure the weak resistance issue does not accelerate further.</p>
          <p>So at the moment and things seem to be sustainable and it's just a question of how the rest of the season develops on the herbicide side but it's in combination with our broad acre crop portfolio, which has done quite well in the first quarter, which has a positive impact on hopefully our ability to continue to sell the complementary chemistry to the second and third quarter and into the end of the year. But that's sort of how things sit at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, Fabian, I will answer your question. I think you directed it towards me about MaterialScience earning the cost of capital better. Obviously, very important for us. The MaterialScience business is very focused on that. I think when you sort of look at what has happened the last five to seven years, we decided to make very significant investments in the world-scale plant, a greenfield plant in Caojing, China.</p>
          <p>I think the last time we added up all the numbers, we have invested almost &#x20AC;2.5 billion in capital in that facility. That's a lot of money and that really started running and getting up to speed when the economic crisis broke out. So it's understandable that we have a few years here of difficulty earning the returns on that very significant investment, but we now do have very good low cost capacity in place in key products and as demands strengthens, which it undoubtedly will with the development of the economy particularly in Asia where that plant is and prices pick up again, we're confident that we get back into the green zone of earning our cost of capital or better on those investments. But pricing particularly in polycarbonate in 2012 are an important variable there and unfortunately, you heard that prices were under pressure compared to the same period last year in Q1, but I do believe that we're confident that that is going to readjust over the next few quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Nexavar  &#x2013; I'm afraid I can't be more, much more specific than what you probably have heard before. I mean all three studies, the MISSION study for lung cancer, the DECISION study for thyroid cancer, and the SEARCH study for liver cancer. All three of them are event driven. All three of them are pretty close to completion. My personal guess right here now would be that within the next few months, I would say either this or next quarter, we should be able to give you at least some top line results on these studies.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Baum. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Andrew Baum from Citi. Two questions if I could. The first one regarding your Yasmin franchise, obviously you've began to settle cases. My understanding is your existing provision only covers legal charges. Can you give us some indications of provisions for the cases that you've already announced or already settled and those to come?</p>
          <p>And second question for Mr. Baumann relates to the tax rate. How confident are you in the potential for further improvement in your effective tax rate from current levels given that consensus currently has you at somewhere between 26% to 27% out, post 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andrew. Werner will answer both questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right. So, Andrew, the first question on Yaz, we have settled and extend for roughly 650 cases as Marijn already alluded to, $142 million. We have beyond that provided for defense costs for a price standard period to come. And on top of that for the known cases where we have had a chance to analyze the medical records, we have taken appropriate provisions in quarter one 2012. You don't see it on the expense side in terms of special items because we do have customary product liability insurance going against it so that's the &#x2013; let's say estimated to the best of our ability.</p>
          <p>The exposure we have, we have on the other side of the balance sheet on the active side of the balance sheet, appropriate claims for reimbursement from the insurance companies, yeah. So that's what you see here. There's an incremental exposure for the cases we know that there are claims but where don't have the medical records. And only as we go along and further analyze those, once they are available, we are in the position to further that. We've also said actually since quarter three 2011 that right now we are covered but that we cannot exclude that our current fraud liability coverage may fully suffice for the exposure we have.</p>
          <p>Second on your tax question, could you repeat it again with 2015 working infrastructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think looking at consensus expectations; it seems that the market is factoring no improvement in your corporate tax rate from its current levels. Perhaps you might like to comment on those expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, we have given guidance for the current year and we have not given guidance beyond that before. But I can tell you that we do have a tax strategy in place where we are looking at optimizing our tax rate going forward and we've certainly seen that 2012, if you normalize it, it does show an improvement compared to prior years.</p>
          <p>Yeah, and we are fairly confident that we do have some optimization potential which we will actually be able to realize in the next years.</p>

          <p>Thomas Gilbert, UBS. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:56),thanks. three questions please. Can you slice the &#x20AC;85 million currency benefit up between Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health and CropScience? The second question is for Sandra. You have growth in regions where &#x2013; which were beleaguered by drought, notably Latin America and Australia. Is it fair to assume that it was in these areas that the insecticide growth was particularly strong and if that sort of speculation is correct, do you think that product has been applied or has it been stopped preventatively? And the third question is a bit of more obscure one for Patrick Thomas. In February 2008, you saw your TDIs have dropped in Southern Europe and you basically were able to predict the financial crisis of the housing crisis in the U.S. so the export business in the financial sector fall to the U.S. What are you seeing right now in that business?</p>

          <p>Let me start with the first question, the &#x20AC;85 million, I'll give it to you for healthcare and aggregate. I'm not going to break it down further. It has been &#x20AC;39 million for healthcare overall, the majority of &#x2013; the vast majority of it actually accruing to Pharma. Secondly, CropScience accounts for &#x20AC;25 million and the remainder of &#x20AC;21 million has then benefiting MaterialScience in the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The question you asked regarding our performance in insecticides in the first quarter whether it's driven by drought, let me just make a couple of comments about our first quarter performance in insecticides. First of all, as you know, we cleaned up the portfolio and it clearly had an impact on our performance last year as we were exiting certain product categories and launching a number of new products, what you see in terms of our performance for the first quarter, if you adjust it for currency effects, it was a 15% increase and that increase did actually not come from &#x2013; did not disproportionately come at all from places like Southern Latin America or Australia where there are significant droughts.</p>
          <p>So what was driving that performance actually was the quality of the portfolio and across many regions like North America, Asia Pacific but not places like throughout stricken parts of Australia and in Latin America but actually quite honestly places like Brazil, Chile and other places that is really not &#x2013; it's not really an impact from drought. So we actually saw very strong performance in the first quarter obviously not as much in Europe because of timing of seasonality across our products and it really did not have a drought effect.</p>

          <p>So Thomas thank you for your obscure question. It's a beautiful question searching for lead indicators is always great fun. The trouble is with every recession the lead indicator is different. But I'll give a go at trying to correlate the lead indication. If I look at NAFTA, what I see is stronger growth in furniture and mattress segment which is obviously the TDI business and that is driven by a bit of a tick-up in the housing market either that or people are just getting uncomfortable in their old beds and they're buying them anyway. So, that would be a positive lead indicator.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Instead of a house.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Instead of a house, instead of moving house. And then if I look at TDI generally, I see a kick up compared to last year caused by again sales generally into the furniture segment. And I think if you look at last year's TDI growth, it's actually negative 1% and we probably expect something more like plus 5% this year and the principle drive 80% of that goes into the furniture industry which is always quite a good indicator. So that's as far as I can see into my crystal ball right now.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My guess is that's me. I've got two questions please. Firstly on Yaz, if you look through all the plaintiff documents for some of the litigation, you can see that not only are there claims to do with injury from the product but potentially claims to do with marketing practices. Does your insurance cover you for anything other than product injury? Could you have more broader coverage should the litigation develop more broadly?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on an emerging market field, if we look at other companies that have reported so far, emerging markets has been really very disappointing. For you, emerging markets has looked pretty reasonable. I wonder if you could just give us your sense of what is happening in the emerging markets, whether you're seeing more government interventions in pricing or whether you're confident that the double-digit growth we've seen historically will remain.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Jo, let me start answering your question on Yaz/Yasmin and our product liability insurance. All litigation claims, we are aware of, are covered, to the best of our knowledge, by our insurance policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Regarding emerging markets, Jo, it's a pretty mixed picture and I believe that may not differ so much company by company. Mixed picture meaning there are a number of countries that are really not &#x2013; did really not too well in the first quarter. South Korea is one of them. On the other hand, our performance in that area is to a large extent still driven by performance in China.</p>
          <p>And that has been strong again which may have to do with the portfolio mix which is very favorable for us, but still we see and more or less not accelerating, but also not slowing down performance in China which compensates to a large extent what we see in some of the other emerging markets. So, I believe a certain let's say slowdown for the majority of the markets compensated by a still strong China is what you are seeing there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Christian Faitz from Macquarie. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions if I may. First of all, in your release on the CropScience side, you mentioned also that your EBITDA was partly posted by royalties. Can you give us an idea on what roughly royalties contributed to your earnings and my take is that these were mostly LibertyLink royalties.</p>
          <p>And second on MaterialScience, Patrick. Can you give us an idea of what the volume trend would have been in Q1, ex the Caojing startup defect? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sandy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The royalty income as you suggested is related to trade income and I won't break down specifics of what products and what technologies. But the trade income is order of magnitude it's in the first quarter it's about the same as what our divestment income was in the first quarter. So, it's about the same order of magnitude, a little over &#x20AC;20 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Christian, if you look at the first quarter then from a Caojing point of view sequentially quarter-on-quarter, there was only really the new TDI facility and actually for a significant period in the first quarter, we had that on an inspection following the startup. So there wasn't a dramatic effect, marginal effect across year end of Caojing in the volume numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Florent Cespedes, Exane BNP Paribas. Thank you for taking my questions. First on Xarelto, could you tell us where are you regarding the development of an antidote to reduce Xarelto bleeding, an issue quite often raised by cardiologists? And a second question is a follow-up on China, could you give us the growth that you delivered in China in Q1 in HealthCare and is the price pressure you observed from Glucobay in China is worse than expected? And do you see any risk for the rest of your portfolio in China like Adalat or Avelox? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me start with the antidote which is of course the discussion that all companies and a consideration that all companies that are active in the field do have, I believe there are, as you mentioned, different approaches possible in terms of how specific an antidote do you have to develop, if any. I can reassure you that we are looking at different options that we have also for Xarelto here. The final decision as to what exactly we do has not been made, but it's a consideration that is pretty much at the forefront of our scientists' considerations at the moment. So without giving you a clear way forward, I can confirm that we are thinking about different options that exist here.</p>
          <p>Regarding China, when you look at pharma, the China growth has been 15% so far in the first quarter. You are right that we had a Glucobay negative impact last year in terms of pricing, which does impact on this year's performance in China. Actually two-thirds of our Glucobay sales are in China and obviously, price could have an impact. But nevertheless, that would be overcompensated by the good development of our &#x2013; the rest of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>I mean of course, regarding China, you always need to consider potential price cuts in the future. On the other hand, it's very, very difficult to predict the development for each individual product there. Overall, at the moment, we still feel confident that our strong growth that we have been showing in China for the last few years will continue for the foreseeable future. Obviously, we do also introduce new products and also Xarelto for example is doing well in China, Nexavar is doing well in China, so we are not totally depending on the primary care portfolio there. But for the time being, no reason to believe that our growth there will significantly slow down.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Damien Conover coming from Morningstar. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the legal strategy with the birth control drugs. Just wanted to see if you could characterize your strategy as something similar to how Merck dealt with Vioxx kind of a case-by-case basis and then settling towards the end, are you taking more of a kind of Wyeth approach where it was more of a kind of a class action strategy there? And then also just shifting gears to ATX-101, just following up on the positive data there. I wanted to see if you could frame the opportunity there given that the cosmetic neurotoxin and facial filler market is both at about &#x20AC;1 billion each. Just wanted to see how you thought ATX kind of fit into that market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Damien this is Werner Baumann speaking. Let me take the first question you asked on our legal strategy. Rest assured that we do have one but I also hope you will understand that we can't disclose what it is as we are in the midst of the discussion here.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding ATX, yeah. Obviously it is a new field for us here at Bayer. The result that we have shared recently are positive from an efficacy perspective and actually that entails different assessments driven by the physician, driven by the patient and also some objective measurements that you can make. So it is a market where self-pay is dominant and patients are very willing to spend money in the field. But as you can see by its significant market sizes that you were quoting for the other products there. So we are seeing, in principle, an interesting opportunity for us. As you know we have the rights only for outside the U.S. So <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:56) is wanting therefore come in the U.S. We will now share this data with the regulatory authorities, see what their responses are, but our expectation is that the product based on good efficacy results will be approved and then we'll see what we can do with it.</p>
          <p>Obviously, in the dermatology market, we have a strong status with our dermatology franchise that keeps on growing by 5% each year so it's actually a pretty lucrative environment for us in any case. But this aesthetics market is an addendum to this dermatology market that we need to explore further and that's what we're going to do over the next 12 months, overall a very interesting opportunity.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. First question on Bayer Science, so congratulations first for the good results. But there was obviously one weak spot I have to ask, seed treatment was still relatively weak, we have seen 24% growth that's tangential so it seems you continue to lose market share here.</p>
          <p>Will that turnaround and how &#x2013; I know you have some product launches here, will that let's say make bring accelerating sales here? That's my first question. Second question, Xarelto Japan. You said you just launched it. I just wanted to confirm, it's now fully reimbursed, or should we see a kind of kickoff similar to Germany or any kind of expectations here for that product and reimbursement here?</p>
          <p>Third question on R&amp;D specifically in pharmaceutical. Can you tell us your R&amp;D budget in pharmaceutical for 2012 or at least give an indication how it will develop versus 2011. These are the questions. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandy, the first question on seed treatment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, let me start with the seed treatment. So, first of all if you remember in 2011, we actually saw a 24% growth in our seed treatment business in 2011 and so we were obviously very pleased with that performance. If you look at the first quarter of 2012, in the Asia Pacific and all of the rest of the emerging markets; Latin America, Middle East and Africa. We actually saw more than a 40% growth rate in the first quarter relative to last year in the first quarter which clearly is &#x2013; we are very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>Part of the impact in Europe and North America, some of it is phasing, some of it is a little bit timing particularly in Europe of the slight weakness in our first quarter performance in seed treatment.</p>
          <p>But as you mentioned, we have been launching a series of new products. Our Poncho/VOTiVO  product is now being used in soybeans and cotton and we're seeing very positive uptake in that. And then as you know, we also just got regulatory approval for two new products that are in the same class that are fungicides for &#x2013; that are called <mark type="ph" /> Ernesto and Evenglow (1:15:29) for both potatoes and canola. So we actually think will to actually positively impact our seed treatment business.</p>
          <p>So we are still feeling very comfortable about that business. We believe that the first quarter slight decline in Europe and North America is somewhat phasing related and it's really not an issue in our mind that we're quite bullish about this business for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding Xarelto in Japan, yes, I can confirm that we are fully reimbursed. We are in the market at the price of &#xA5;530 for the 50 milligram dose which is roughly &#x20AC;4.60 so this is a very acceptable price.</p>
          <p>One needs to know that launching of new products in Japan is a little bit different than in the rest of the world. There are certain obligations that you have to fulfill for the first year. So for example, patients have to come back after two weeks. So all prescriptions that are being made in Japan in the first year do only last for two weeks, which of course limits, let's say, a quick update of the product to some extent.</p>
          <p>Now that limitation is being lifted after a year and from there on, you have kind of a normal behavior in the market. Nevertheless, we consider Japan to be an attractive and important market for us, and we have high expectations for that market.</p>
          <p>Regarding R&amp;D, yes, I understand that maybe the first quarter looked a little bit low in pharma. That will change over the course of the year and I would expect us to be at the end of the year at the same 15% to 17% range for R&amp;D expansions that we have been given as a guidance for the pharma field since a while. So I expect us to be rather flat as compared to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I may, I would like to add on a question on Bayer MaterialScience. The first question, Patrick, is it possible to give you &#x2013; give me the current utilization rate of the three major products? And obviously, we had just recently, let's say, increasing debates about China and the development there and could you give us a little bit, let's say, your last impression you had in China regarding the growth there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess the utilization rates varied hugely since the management discussions that we had so the data that I gave out, now, it was pretty detailed by sector. And if anything, what's happened is we've seen a tightening on the TDI situation primarily because of mothballing of other competitors' assets and also the closure of some assets. In MDI, we've seen quite a number of facilities not performing fully and having unscheduled shutdowns which has tightened the situation a little less.</p>
          <p>And then in the polycarbonates arena, the volumes have been high and the issue is the price. So from the polycarbonate point of view, the utilization rates are increasing and I'll be expecting in the second half to see the tightening again. The only question mark we have on polycarbonate is what's actually happening with the plants in the Middle East because it's unclear as to whether that's fully occupied or not yet. I guess that's probably the best update.</p>
          <p>The last part of your question, Ronald?</p>

          <p>China is, let's say, complicated at the moment because of the uncertainty around government and what we find talking to customers in China, people that I've been talking with is  that whilst there's uncertainty about the final result of the elections in October, the credit line is still quite difficult. Interest rates are quite high. There's a shortage of cash. And generally, people aren't willing to make decisions so that means very low inventory levels in the Chinese supply chains and project decisions.</p>
          <p>So government project decisions are getting deferred at the moment. Everybody is concerned about whether they're going to spend money on infrastructure or not because they don't know who's going to be in the top job. So there's this sort of unusual uncertainty mode. American elections always boost the economy, Chinese elections create uncertainty and I think that probably characterizes the feeling of the market.</p>
