        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen; and welcome to our second quarter conference call. First, I'd like to focus on the market environment and the highlights of the second quarter of 2009. And then Lothar Steinebach, our CFO, will provide you with the second quarter financials in greater detail. After that I'll comment on the outlook for 2009 and finally we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation which contains the use of formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation can be accessed via website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation and discussion, I'll conduct is subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>As all of you know, we defined our strategic priorities approximately a year ago and since then we have consistently and disciplined execute around our three strategic priorities, achieving our full business potential, focus on our customers and strengthen our global team, which is the long-term strategy which was taken to the company and that is also what we're starting to see is paying off at this stage.</p>
          <p>Now let me start and go into the market environment and the highlights of the second quarter of 2009. While we see the recession is ongoing, we are starting to see the first time some stabilization. But also we would like to be clear and differentiate between stabilization and upturn. We're seeing the first signs of stabilization, we are not seeing signs of upturn.</p>
          <p>We're seeing a continued decline in the industrial production and we're seeing the private consumption as the overall stabilizing sector. We believe and we'll speak about that probably in more detail in the call, but the raw materials have bottomed out at this stage. And we're also seeing that the inflation rate is remaining low. So we're seeing a challenging second quarter market environment where certain highlight is driven more by stabilization than by upturn.</p>
          <p>If I look upon the Henkel highlights &#x2013; and I'll start with the challenges &#x2013; we continue to see volume decrease in our Adhesive Technologies business, but slight improvement over the first quarter. The volume decreased by approximately 21% in the second quarter versus 23 in the first quarter. And we continue to see the markets being strongly affected by the overall recession.</p>
          <p>However, we also saw a continued strong development and performance of our Laundry &amp; Home Care and Personal Care division. We're seeing very clearly that the countermeasures that we initiated more than a year ago are now starting to payoff i.e., we're far down enough the circle, that this is being visible in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>It's clear that our top three brands with the comp of 25% of our revenue and our top nine brands with a comp of approximately 40% of our revenue is helping to boost sales and profits. And the strategic priorities I mentioned upfront the implementation of those are well on track.</p>
          <p>So overall, we have seen a second quarter that was improvement to see versus the first quarter. If I move to the Laundry and Home Care division. We saw the highest organic growth sales in the last two years. We saw strong double-digit growth in our emerging markets.</p>
          <p>We saw a significant EBIT increase confirming our profitable growth trend, but also I'll remind everybody that the second quarter of last year was the weakest quarter of our Laundry and Home Care division for the entire year of 2008.</p>
          <p>So we are comparing, so to speak, to a weak comparable. It's clear that our restructuring measures are paying off. And we've had a very successful launch of our Purex Complete 3-in-1 in North America.</p>
          <p>So we've had a quarter, well, Lothar will go into the number details, and the second quarter level is even stronger from a very strong first quarter in our Laundry and Home Care division.</p>
          <p>Our Personal Care division continued very strong organic sales growth confirming what we see as a positive long-term trend. We've consistently, over a number of years now, seeing quarter-after-quarter strong performance in our Personal Care division.</p>
          <p>We outperformed, meaning we are growing stronger than our respective markets, and was gaining market share in most of our strategic markets. We've seen our emerging markets continue to grow at double-digit growth rates and we further improved our high EBIT margin. We've &#x2013; as I've said &#x2013; we've seen high market shares and we have all time high market share positions in all hair care categories, color care and styling. And the styles product line that we introduced in the first quarter, we've continued the successful rollout in several more countries in the second quarter. So the bottom-line is for our Personal Care division, this was not a come back, this was a continuation of a very positive trend that we've seen over the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Coming to our third, and largest division Adhesive Technologies, we continue to see a decrease in sales and in EBIT driven our Automotive, Electronics and Metal business, but with clear improvements versus our first quarter.</p>
          <p>We're seeing our consumer and consumer related businesses behave more stable, but we've seen the industrial downturn, especially affecting Western Europe, Asia, and to a much lesser degree China and North America. We believe that we have strong market positions across our businesses and we have gained market share positions.</p>
          <p>And the last, but not least, we also finalized the sale of our North American consumer adhesive business in the month of May. So we're starting to see the countermeasures that we initiated last year and put under further pressure this year starting to give results particularly as compared to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the overall numbers for the Henkel Group. We came to a revenue number of 3.5, which was a change of minus 5%, minus, 5.3 organically compared to the second quarter of 2008. On the adjusted EBIT, we reached 308 million versus 372 of similar quarter last year minus 17.2. We have an adjusted EBIT margin of 8.7 versus 10.1, a decline of 140 basis points. And we saw the adjusted EBIT decline minus 20.8.</p>
          <p>Lothar would, later in our presentation comment on the difference between the decline in EBIT and decline on the earnings. However, if I compare it to our performance in the first quarter, we did see a sales growth of 6.9%. We saw an EBIT growth growing from 235 to 308 up 31.1%. The adjusted EBIT margin went from 7.2 to 8.7, so an increase of 150 basis points. And we saw the adjusted EBIT growing from 0.31 to 0.37. So, a growth of 19.4%. So significant improvements in all areas and in all businesses versus the first quarter.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd now like to hand over to Lothar, who will give you the details. I will then comment on the market outlook and we'll jointly answer questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kasper. With that I take over the financials of the second quarter 2009. As usual, we'll start with evolution of our sales development. This is the overview of Laundry, Home Care, Personal Care, Adhesive Technologies. We'll get into each of the divisions in a second.</p>
          <p>Let me first take a look at the development of our Laundry and Home Care division. With 4.4 total growth; 6.3 foreign exchange adjusted in figure 6.3 organic growth, which is composed of 5.1 from pricing and 1.2 from volume. This shows that we've been able to basically maintain our strong pricing from the first quarter, but the impact on sales growth was even stronger. We have achieved a turnaround in volume. As you may remember, we had a negative growth in volume in the first quarter minus seven, we're now back to 1.2, which is quite impressive in terms of turnaround and is more impressive to back out the impact from the discontinuation of our business in China, which accounts for 0.9 percentage points. So backing out the discontinuation of our business in China, we would have been at an increase in volume of 2.1%.</p>
          <p>All segments and all regions have been contributing to this strong organic growth, including the mature markets. We've also seen strong growth in our top brands Persil and Purex, which again have outgrown the average organic growth rate of our Laundry and Home Care divisions.</p>
          <p>However, we need to note that 6.3 organic growth for one quarter is obviously not indicative of the full year. So therefore, our recommendation is that we look at the full half year with the 3.3 organic growth rate, which is more indicative of the run rate that we would expect for this year.</p>
          <p>Next, Personal Care. There again we've been continuing almost exactly strong organic growth on quarter, 3.5 organic growth, composed of 1.1, pricing; 2.4, volume. Again, similar composition of growth in the first quarter as now in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>It's balance, growth, price and volume driven. So we've been able to increase price basically in emerging regions and continue to maintain our strong volume growth in emerging regions and mature countries.</p>
          <p>We've had strong performance not only in emerging markets but also in Germany for that matter and we have been able to overcome negative growth in a number of our markets. Particularly negative growth in the salon business &#x2013; in the salon markets, which we've been able to overcompensate through even stronger growth in our retail business.</p>
          <p>This was driven by all-time high market shares particularly in our Hair Care businesses and we've gained market shares basically in all regions.</p>
          <p>All this has been achieved in the face of increasing pressure from negative growth in some of our markets, increasing pressure from private label and very high competitive investments by our peers and our competitors.</p>
          <p>Next, take a look at our Adhesive Technologies business. We have organic growth of minus 15.4, which is composed of plus 5.7 from pricing and minus 21.1 from volume. We've seen considerable improvement in organic growth of 280 basis points versus Q1. We still see enormous weakness in the Automotive, Electronics and Metal markets. They still continue to be very weak.</p>
          <p>All regions have been affected by negative growth except for Latin America, where we have had experienced slight positive organic growth. That again has been composed of negative volume and very positive pricing.</p>
          <p>From our perspective, while we've seen an improvement over the first quarter, the recovery is not over yet. Seems to have bottomed out, but we're not seeing a recovery, in other words an end of the recession. While Q2 over Q1 is encouraging, we still need to see what the next quarters will bring in our markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of destocking and restocking, we think that again has bottomed out in the first and second quarters, with particular impact in the first quarter. It's been difficult for us to get a good handle on what has been the run rate of industrial production in the markets in which we are active, but we think that we're basically at a more normal level for this year certainly.</p>
          <p>Sales growth by regions. Latin America being the only region in terms of reported regions where we've seen positive organic growth compared to all other regions. Obviously the picture is very varied. We've seen good organic growth rates in some of the regions in some of our businesses, but overall only Latin America shows positive organic growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of Europe, Africa, Middle East, organic sales growth is positive except Adhesive business. North America there again the negative is from the Adhesive business and obviously Latin America, I've alluded to earlier.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific, we've seen difference between some of the countries, obviously China where we're seeing good organic growth in our Cosmetics division and an improvement although still negative in our Adhesives division.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at all emerging markets together. We've been able to maintain positive organic growth rates 2.3% over the prior year period, which is again an improvement over Q1.</p>
          <p>Our Home and Personal Care divisions both have continue to experience double-digit organic growth rates in the emerging markets similar to what we've been able to report in the Q1. Adhesives is still negative even in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>EBIT growth by business sector, Q2 '09 over Q2 '08. Laundry and Home Care was an improvement &#x2013; significant improvement in our operating earnings to almost 30% and FX adjusted above 30%, reaching an EBIT margin of 11.2, which is a change of 210 basis points.</p>
          <p>That's been driven by our ability to maintain our pricing basically stable. We've been benefiting from some tailwind from lower input costs that's something which we've been communicating consistently over the past six months.</p>
          <p>And at the same time that has permitted us to increase our marketing investments. All this in the face of difficult market conditions, strong competitive activity and also weakening foreign exchange currencies in the Eastern European markets. So therefore, that improvement is particularly worth of note.</p>
          <p>Personal Care, again our operating earnings of 100 million, an improvement of 2.8% over the same period last year. Foreign exchange adjusted 4.2, reaching an EBIT margin of 12.7 which is 20 basis points over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>So there again, we've been able to increase our ratio of EBIT to sales from a high level of last year with continued &#x2013; with strong organic growth and improvement in our profitability. Profitable growth path has been confirmed.</p>
          <p>We've experienced limited tailwinds from raw material prices inflation. We have increased again our advertising and promotion spend and we've been benefiting from lower prices on advertising in particular.</p>
          <p>Strong growth and the ability to increase our margins have been driven by marketing investments, as I mentioned earlier and strong success of our innovations.</p>
          <p>We've been able to offer to our customers and consumers the products that they were looking for to compare the negative market trend in the salon business with our success, introducing new products which offer a benefit to our consumers which is similar to what they experience otherwise.</p>
          <p>EBIT growth in our Adhesives division, minus 470 basis points compared to the same period last year. We still suffer from a very low capacity utilizations. So therefore as you've been noticing, the volume increase compared to the first quarter has been very limited pretty much almost on the same level as in the first quarter. So the improvement over the first quarter is entirely from our improvement in the cost situation. 280 basis points over the same period in Q1. That improvement is entirely driven by our cost savings measures.</p>
          <p>Now the encouraging sign is that, our consumer and craftsmen adhesives in terms of margin is almost back to the level of same period of last year, which is quite an achievement even in the face of difficult market conditions. Now we've seen some tailwind from lower input prices. We do expect that to remain stable during the same period in Q3, and we think that there'll be some headwind than in Q4, in terms of raw material prices.</p>
          <p>Capacity utilization has increased slightly over the same period in Q1, but still at a very low level.</p>
          <p>Income statement to gross profit, cost of sales have been decreasing by 11.3%, gross profit increasing by 3.9%. The gross margin as reported has been improving from 41.4 to 45.3. That's obviously somewhat distorted by restructuring expenses that we have reported last year to a higher degree than this year. We back out the impact from the restructuring expenses last year and this year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted gross margin is 44.9 last year, 45.7 this year. So therefore, we still see an improvement of 80 basis points like-for-like. Now the 44 to 45.7, the bridge the big impact is from pricing, 2.5 percentage points from pricing. You've seen a decrease of 0.5% from cost of sales, acquisitions and divestment of 1.7 and other impacts &#x2013; foreign exchange and various others of 0.5. The decrease from cost of sales on the cost of sales line is from &#x2013; although decreasing input cost have helped us that has been overcompensated negatively by the capacity underutilization. Obviously, entirely in the Adhesives division, where we have experienced a good capacity utilization than the other divisions.</p>
          <p>Reported to adjusted EBIT, EBIT as reported compared to last year. Obviously, strong improvement by both last year periods and this year has been somewhat impacted by one-time charges and restructuring charges were the big impact last year, much smaller impact this year with one-time charges this year of four million and restructuring charges of 25 this year. Therefore adjusted EBIT amounts to 308 million that's a negative 17.2 compared to like-for-like last year.</p>
          <p>Four million one-time charges is entirely based on the integration costs of National Starch and we've communicated that there will be some more charges occurring this year. Normal restructuring and restructuring expenses for National Starch is 19 and six million respectively and the four million one-time charges that I mentioned earlier have been consultancy expenses which do not qualify as restructuring charges but nevertheless they are one-time charges.</p>
          <p>Income statement, gross profit adjusted EBIT, the one item that I wanted to point out in particular is about the same absolute level of marketing, selling and distribution expenses compared to a decreasing level of sales. We have continued to increase our marketing investments in our consumer businesses as a percentage of sales and thereby have kept the absolute amount stable compared to last year. We've been able to not only increase our margins, increase our absolute level of operating earnings but also spend more in order to support our brands and improve our markets position.</p>
          <p>Income statement, EBIT to net earnings. As you've noticed, obviously we've experienced a higher tax rate not only compared to the same period last year, but also compared to our own expectations. Now the change compared to last year is 10.7 percentage points. And that is basically based on one-off impact in the second quarter Q2 '09. We have experienced a tax burden from the post-merger integration of some of the acquired National Starch entities. Where we've completed the legal integration which have resulted in some write-offs of tax assets and we have experienced a taxable gain from the sale of our North American consumer Adhesives brands. We've communicated the sale of &#x2013; completion of our sale of the North American consumer Adhesives brands in May, which on a book level have not resulted in a gain, but on a taxable book have resulted in a gain. So therefore we have experienced taxable gain from that and therefore increased our tax rate for Q2.</p>
          <p>Total impact from the two items is about 20 million, which obviously will not reoccur in the future quarters but will increase the tax rate for this year. Development of net working capital, that's an area where we take great pride in because it helps us support our financial position. Q2 is 11.7%, and that's no small achievement in the face of decreasing sales in our Adhesives division because obviously in an increasing environment it's easier to manage net working capital, cash net working capital than in a decreasing environment. So we've been continuing on our strong path to increase our management of cash as it is in net working capital.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operating activities, the one item that we think needs to be pointed out is obviously the change in net working capital. I've shown the improvement in our ratio. And coupled with lower level of sales that has resulted in the release of cash, 48 million, the systematic reduction in our net working capital has resulted in delivering some cash in our cash flow statement.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, obviously cash flow from operating activities &#x2013; we have in the first quarter experienced a cash out for the tax payment for the Ecolab transaction, which we're correcting on the way to report free cash flow.</p>
          <p>We do not report the cash-in from the Ecolab transaction under free cash flow, so therefore the cash-out for the tax payment consequently is not reported under free cash flow. We have free cash flow of 401 compared to the same period of last year of minus 162 and have strong improvement.</p>
          <p>We back out the impact of the cash out for restructuring in National Starch the one-off items in one through six '09 to be 87, which is composed of 24, the National Starch integration then 67 for Global Excellence. Then we arrive at adjusted free cash flow of 488, which again is a very strong improvement over the same period of last year and first six month of '08.</p>
          <p>Strong adjusted free cash flow which has been improving over the period of Q1 '09, only 35 million, so second quarter strong improvement in operating earnings, strong improvement in our cost position has released cash.</p>
          <p>Look at the net debt development compared to the same period of last year, under net debt &#x2013; net presentation, we start from gross debt increase or decrease by the market value of financial derivatives, then liquid funds arriving at net debt level last year; middle of last year has been &#x20AC;5.57 billion. Now we're at 3.914 which is obviously a very strong improvement over the same period of last year, which is helping us to maintain our strong balance sheet and our strong rating quality.</p>
          <p>Look at Global Excellence savings and our outlook on this expectation that we do entertain for this year from the Global Excellence programs. We have had, in the first quarter, 27 million of savings cumulative savings Q2, end of Q2 are now 60 with an additional 33 in Q2. We therefore have raised our expectation for the full year from 100 to 125 million which will help us a great deal in achieving our targets for this year.</p>
          <p>Similarly, look at the timeline of our National Starch integration savings. We have had 30 million in Q1, we've now 35 in Q2, arriving cumulatively at 65, therefore, we're raising our guidance for full year to 150 from previously 125 million.</p>
          <p>That gives me a chance to very briefly update you on the guidance that we've given. We have given guidance on ordinary restructurings, so far we've guided to 30 million, we'll change our guidance to 40 million. We have experienced in the first six months 24, so our expectation will be 40 for the full year.</p>
          <p>The tax rate which I have explained in terms of the one-off effect in the Q2. We're raising our guidance between 28 and 30% for the full year. Obviously 31.5 Q2 will diminish over the next two quarters because the one-off effect will not reoccur. And obviously our guidance for long-term will remain at the level that we have guided earlier, basically in the 26, 27% range.</p>
          <p>Finally, CapEx, our guidance has been 330 for the full year, expectation now is more 350, but that's not a big change in terms of full year guidance.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand over to Kasper again, to provide you with an outlook for the full year 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. And now on to the outlook. We believe that the recession seems to have reached the bottom. And the chart we are showing here is one that we've consistently showed over the last six to nine months, where you can see a deceleration of the decline, particularly in the last three to four months. So we're seeing a deceleration of the declines stabilizing around negative 3% and our assumption is going in to the second part of the year that we're going to see a stabilization; our assumption is not that we will see a recovery, but at least we're seeing a stabilization of the GDP decline.</p>
          <p>When I look upon the countermeasures that we've initiated. We're continuing with very strong focus on those, starting with the customer, emphasizing Henkel as the reliable supplier. That we'll be around. On the cost side, we've consistently said that we've had 60 projects plus on the manufacturing and supply chain side, and since last summer we've executed approximately two projects per month. Just to give you an indication of the amount of focus and speed we've had with this.</p>
          <p>Purchasing has had enormous focus on savings and will continue to do so. We have since April of last year, since April 2008 been extremely restrictive as it relates to hiring. We have worked the working time reductions and travel and severance expense reductions and we're delaying purchase that can be delayed.</p>
          <p>So we've not taken the eyes off the ball. We are continuing to have a very strong eye on the cost line. At the same time also, in the beginning of May, we announced the streamlining of our Adhesive Technologies division for Europe, which is well underway at this stage.</p>
          <p>On the cash side, Lothar spoke about net working capital results for the second quarter, that continue to be an area of focus for us in order to decrease the level of debt that we have.</p>
          <p>On previous occasions, we have spoken about our reduction in CapEx. i.e., we were aiming to reduce our capital expenditure by 30%. And we completely frozen our mergers and acquisition budget for the year.</p>
          <p>We are in the process, and have been all year, of further identifying marginal business in the SMP points for potential exit. I already mentioned in my presentation the exit that we've had at our North American consumer business for Adhesives in the third quarter, no second quarter. And we will continue to consider all options to help mitigate the impact of the current economic crisis, meaning that we do not believe that we've taken the final number of actions as relates to optimizing our cost structure moving forward.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the targets for 2009 and our expectations for the third quarter. Our targets for 2009 remain unchanged meaning that our target is to outperform the markets we compete within, i.e., grow market share and initiate and execute the initiated measures that will help support the development of EBIT and EPS.</p>
          <p>More specifically, our expectations for the third quarter is that, both, Home and Personal Care business that we see a continuation of the current good performance albeit at a slight lower pace. And from Adhesives Divisions division where we see a stable or slight improvement over the second quarter. I want to repeat that &#x2013; a stable or a slight improvement &#x2013; and we see a slight &#x2013; in this year and we don't see a major improvement.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the end of the presentation part, I now hand it back to you for questions-and-answers.</p>

          <p>Yes, hello, thanks for taking my question. Two questions, first of all on the corporate line, which incorporates the head product cost and Special <mark type="inaudible" />. In the first half, even the corporate loan was minus 60 million adjusted, but your guidance for the full year as far as I know for that segment is minus 90 million. So you still expect a huge Nexus result in the second half of 2009. Can you tell us what's the background for your extremely cautious view for the second half for this segment?</p>
          <p>The second question is on China, I understood that you have discontinued the business in China. I think it was in the Laundry business, can you give us the reason why you have done so? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me Mr. R&#xF6;diger, let me quickly answer your questions. Our guidance for EBIT corporate excluding restructuring for the full year is minus 90. In the EBIT as reported for the first half year that's 146, we have minus 62, which is after restructuring. So if we back out restructuring, we're at minus 45, it's almost exactly at what we've guided for the full year. So therefore that is consistent with our full year guidance excluding restructuring.</p>
          <p>Discontinuation of business in China, the Laundry business indeed, we've experienced a turndown in our market share in China over a period of years, which finally has resulted in a situation, which we have determined to be without a realistic outlook on a significant improvement. And therefore we've decided that we exit the country because otherwise we would have been in a position to either invest heavily into a situation, which is already occupied by strong competitors, local competitors, international competitors with no clear outlook as to whether that heavy investment would be successful.</p>
          <p>You also know that private consumption in China continues to be an issue, so therefore for the time being, we have determined that private consumption will not be a major driver in our businesses in China and we'll obviously reserve the opportunity to re-enter China if the situation and when the situation improves. But for the time being, we decided that this was no positive outlook necessary or reasonable.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My first question is about the growth in Laundry. You noted yourself that there has been a quite a turnaround in volume from minus six to plus one, yet your pricing has remained very high, I think plus seven and plus five in Q2. I was wondering if you could explain what justifies or what has been the driver behind such a volume rebound in the marketplace. Especially as it seems that you were able to deliver good margin at the same time. So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is about your input cost comments. You seem to indicate that they are bottoming in Q2. So are we right to expect that the input cost depletion windfall will be lower in the next, in the second half. You also mentioned that the outlook for Adhesive would be a headwind by Q4. Would that be the same for the Personal Care segment? Thank you. I am sorry the Home Care segment, of course?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first question and Lothar will take the second question. As it relates to Laundry growth, let me just make a couple of statements. Every time we do pricing we do see a negative volume impact on pricing in the following quarter. You can also see that on previous quarters last year. So what you've seen in the first quarter was a reaction to pricing. So we typically see a negative volume reaction to increase in price.</p>
          <p>We've kept the price stable which means that the market has accepted the pricing. And we have increased the level of promotional spend in the market. So i.e., we have kept pricing stable, the market has accepted pricing, and we've increased the level of promotional spend. These are the two primary drivers for the volume, on top of that there is no doubt that our introduction of 3-in-1 in the North American marketplace has significantly help drive the overall volumes of the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me comment, perhaps a little bit broader on the input cost evolution. First of all, we've seen a decrease obviously in the raw materials which have a correlation to oil price, basically coming down in the third and fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Then again obviously, oil price was increasing and therefore there is going to be some rebound, some reverse of that trend in the next quarters to come. From that it is apparent that the impact for us has been positive, slightly positive in the first quarter more positive in the second quarter. And we do expect that to basically carry through the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now the fourth quarter, there again we'll see a reversal of trend as a result of, obviously, the oil price coming up and therefore impacting raw materials which have a correlation to the oil prices. Now that's similar in Home Care and in Adhesives, not exactly the same but similar, because there's a similar dynamics in the raw material market that we experienced.</p>
          <p>There are also &#x2013; and that's important to note &#x2013; other developments which may have an impact on the raw material price situations. We do observe that our suppliers obviously try to adapt their capacity to lower demand, so therefore what we've seen in terms of positive impact may diminish to some extent even though prices may not go up. And we're also obviously seeing pressure from the markets, from our peers and in particular from our customers, retailers and customers in the industrial sector. Which do obviously want to have some cut from the impact from the raw material prices.</p>
          <p>The other element which is important to note is that we're seeing weakening of the currencies in Eastern Europe which have had an impact, a negative impact on our cost structure in Eastern Europe. And the impact is to the extend that we produce in countries with a stronger currency and then sell in countries with weakening currency.</p>
          <p>Obviously our cost of good situation increases, and therefore puts pressure on our margins. So that again has happened. We've seen some of the currencies in Eastern Europe weakening, some of the currencies holding up, and therefore we've seen the negative impact on our margins from this economic impact of producing in countries and selling in other countries. That's the negative.</p>
          <p>We've seen some positive impact from the material situation and strong positive impact from pricing, all-in-all have permitted us to re-spend part of it into promotions, and thereby improving and increasing our volume in particular, and Kasper mentioned that, in the Laundry sector.</p>
          <p>That's different in Adhesives because obviously Adhesives depend on our industrial customers. Their level of production determines the level of what they take from us. And therefore that's a very different dynamic in terms of supply chains but also in terms of pricing.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the next question comes from the line of Xavier Croquez from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have two questions, the first question is on mix and price in Adhesives. The gain of margin of around 300 bps, 280 bps matches more or less exactly the cost savings that you flagged in the following charts. You commented on the raw materials. I was a bit surprised that such a positive mix in price did not help the margin to a certain extent more than that. So operational leverage is eating all these benefits, is this the right understanding or am I missing something?</p>
          <p>And my second question is a bit on the &#x2013; you are not even going into detailed comments on 2009, but the context of 2010 as you can see it. One, the savings that you have raised for 2009, it's making quicker things you had planned or have you seen actually hopes of more savings. And entering into 2010 the comments you made on H2 and Q4, not enthusiastic at least for comps for Q1 2010. Is that also right reading? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start off on the latter and Lothar can be able to also attend to. Right now we have been very clear on our guidance that we have no long-term view at this stage. So that means that we're not giving any guidance at this stage for 2010 for good reasons, that's why we're also not giving any quantifiable guidance for third quarter at this stage. What we are doing, we are accelerating what we can do and we have consistently been saying that in our last three con calls, in order to get Global Excellence and our National Starch integration behind us. So there is no evaluation in the outlook for 2010, there's just no transparency at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question whether we are realizing more or quicker, it is quicker. We're not addressing other areas in our guidance. So what we've been doing is increasing our expectation for this year in terms of savings, which is advancing &#x2013; accelerating some of the project that we've undertaken. In terms of mix, pricing and operating leverage. Indeed the operating leverage is what we have seen in the first quarter with a negative &#x2013; strong negative impact on operating earnings. And the improvement is partially from tailwind from raw material prices and partially from the cost savings measures which we have reported under Global Excellence and National Starch.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Wanted to come bit more precise on the material costs. 2008 you've given us a number of 6.6 billion raw material cost for the entire year. Could you give us the comparable number just for the second quarter year-on-year comparison and your budgets for 2009, just to get a bit more feeling here, what will happen to the materials. What happened so far and what might happen in the second half?</p>
          <p>And the follow-up question to that is again regarding margin and prices, knowing that your capacities are underutilized, seeing that the raw material costs will creep up as of Q3 and beginning of Q4. Do you think it's fair to assume that prices can be passed on &#x2013; raw materials costs can be passed onto your customers or is there risk that margin will go back to levels of Q4 last year Q1 this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the number that you mentioned, the 6.6 is not just raw materials, it's what we call direct materials. These are the materials that can be attributed directly to production of a particular good that we produce that's raw material, packaging materials. It also includes contract manufacturing traded goods. So that's the totality of what we experience.</p>
          <p>Now this is the number for 2008. The full number for 2008. It will be negative, the effect will be lower, obviously, 2009. As a result of the lower sales volume, but also of some decrease in pricing. What we have communicated is that we do expect a lowering in that line in the mid single-digits for the full year. So therefore that's still our guidance for the full year. We do not provide guidance per quarter but for the full year because that's far too difficult obviously to provide guidance per quarter. But for the full year, our guidance remains what we've given earlier that it's in the mid single-digits.</p>
          <p>In terms of margin impacts from creeping up raw materials or direct materials for that matters. That remains to be seen. And that's why we're so cautious on the fourth quarter in particular. It very much depends on volume evolution, if you look at the Adhesives business. Obviously, it very much depends on whether we see some improvement over the period of time in terms of volume or whether we will continue to see the same decrease in volumes that we're seeing in the first two quarters of this year. As we don't know that and our customers don't know, it's very difficult for us to come up with any prediction.</p>
          <p>So we'd refrain from providing the outlook on the fourth quarter. And that obviously holds true for the margin as well. What we're trying to provide is an outlook on what we see so far. That's why we've given some guidance on the third quarter. But I think it would be pretentious for us to go into the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add a comment on the gross margin without giving you a number on it. The gross margin in our Adhesives business is highly impacted by the utilization rate. And those I spoke about, the increase of the utilization rate in the second quarter versus first albeit at a low level. I spoke about we've had 60 projects in the pipeline to execute around supply chain and manufacturing whereas we've executed approximately two months in last summer.</p>
          <p>So the primary driver to project or increase the gross profit margin line lies in the utilization rate and that goes back in decrease in capacity.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Just again to come back on pricing and this time, especially on the consumer division, you have been extremely strong and successful in second quarter so my congratulations on that one. How do you see the business going forward, especially if you bear in mind &#x2013; if I'm looking at what, for example, biased office is currently just this, and unprecedented aggressiveness in the market, especially at entry price points. And what kind of impact are you seeing on your business, especially here in Germany now in the consumer part in the third quarter, and also generally in other markets from an increased pricing strategy of competitors. How long do you expect to keep positive pricing effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first confirm that it may not be unprecedented but it's a very aggressive situation in the markets. Obviously we've experienced a number of marketing activities double-filling, additional volumes and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>Our response to that is innovation and investment in brands. And I mentioned earlier that we've been able to increase our investment in our brands in the second quarter which has helped a great deal obviously in driving our volume. So therefore that's the way we are going forward. We do not plan on going back on prices. We do plan on investing into our brands, into our customers, into promotions. And thereby again increase our volume, that's our plan for the next quarters, and maintain at least much of the pricing, whether we'll maintain everything is anybody's guess, that's obvious.</p>
          <p>In our discussions during the course of the first six months, and based on our experience in the first quarter, we've consistently communicated that we have experienced very strong pricing in the first quarter but a negative volume. And therefore, our strategy will be to invest, give up some of the pricing, get the volume. And if you look at the second quarter, we've been spectacularly successful in doing that. And therefore that's our plan. We will not go back into a price war, we'll go back into doing what we can do very well, and that is branding and promotion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to elaborate a little thing we mentioned before. Two of the biggest volume, incremental volume drivers for us in the second quarter was 3-in-1 in the U.S., a completely new innovation. Syoss in Europe, which was introduced late in the first quarter. And it does show that even in a tight market, there is room, that when you bring good innovation to market, you actually do get volume growth into your system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, if you look at the underlying volumes in your say, basically existing products, do you feel that it is declining right now or is it basically still stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we also said is that we have a strategy around focusing on our strong brands. I mentioned that the three brands cover 25% of our business in nine, 40% of our business. And what you're seeing is, you're seeing a market consolidation around stronger brands, and that is the long of the strategy that we've outlined more than a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll remind you that our strategy is to reduce the volume of our existing products. Our innovation rate is between 35 and 40% in our Home &amp; Personal Care divisions. So therefore our strategy is exactly to substitute more valuable product for the existing products, not the brands, but the existing products. So therefore there is a high degree of substituting existing products by new products. So that volume of existing products going down as a mandatory event, and the new product innovations are coming to the market, and therefore increasing our total volume. That's our strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I just got one question. You've clearly got some relatively weak comps in your Adhesives business in the fourth quarter. What do you think is going to happen when we actually hit these weak comps? Do you think we might see some growth, or given that I guess production levels around the world are well below peak, growth could still be negative? If you could give us an idea, that would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think it's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just don't know...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are right that the fourth quarter last year has been weak, already strongly impacted by the downturn, although we've consistently communicated that it started basically in November. Till November we were still doing okay, and that was the market, it was not just us in the Adhesive sector.</p>
          <p>So from that perspective, the difficulty is for us to look at what's going to be the impact in the fourth quarter of the recession, will it be worsening, will it be the same as today, will it be better?</p>
          <p>If you look at some of the markets &#x2013; and that makes life difficult right now. If you look at some of the markets such as the automotive market, which has a kind of an artificial boost from Cash for Clunkers and whatever you can call it. And that will fizzle away -- the elections in Germany in September. And therefore I think the attention of politicians in some of the countries will wither away as they will be back in office.</p>
          <p>So that's something, which I'm not suggesting that's there is going to be something particularly negative in the fourth quarter. Just saying that it's not easy to come up with a scenario, which has any level of credence over anybody's writing in the newspaper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from our perspective, the most important thing is that we think we've reached the bottom in most of the businesses or the areas, but that's not guaranteeing that there is a bottom. The other thing is that, our measures to improve our cost situation are really taking effect, and that's what really drives our &#x2013; not only our price but also our conviction that we're going to continue with our drive towards improving our operating situation. So that may not help you in terms of what's going to happen in the fourth quarter, but unfortunately our customers don't know that either.</p>

          <p>Pricing, this is more on the Laundry side, I mean, basically you increased your pricing in the Laundry business quite significantly in the second half of last year. Does that mean given there is no more price increases going on, does that mean in H2 your growth in Laundry is pretty much entirely volume led or is that a little bit too extreme?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it's not too extreme. I think that there will be a significant lower impact from pricing in the second half and we expect a stronger impact from volume because the prior year comps will be higher in terms of pricing; pricing has been affected already in the second half of last year, but again we can't provide the outlook via the euro.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hello, I have two questions. The first question is actually going back to your outlook you have given in the first quarter, you actually said at that time you expect a slight improvement in the Adhesive Technology business, so you obviously more than doubled sequentially your earnings. And can you a little bit elaborate why you at that time said a slight improvement and what has changed to the positive actually versus your original planning?</p>
          <p>And the second question is actually regarded to North America, obviously this is the region which is most down, you just talked several times about the very successful launch in the Laundry business, and how was the impact of that on earnings, meaning is the earnings downturn in North America mainly to the Adhesive business or how does it get impacted on the Cosmetics and the Laundry side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the slight improvement, we gave the outlook of a slight improvement because what we have is a slight improvement. I just want to remind you that we were 100 million below last year's earnings, and what we're seeing is, we are starting to see the price &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> the costing is taking place.</p>
          <p>So we're actually, we are not so surprised, we believe there is still a long way to go, and that's why &#x2013; because the overall drive moving forward on the big &#x2013; if you really want to improve, it is coming from volume. And right now we don't see, as I indicated we don't see a volume rebound. We see a stabilization of the downturn, so what we're seeing is, we are seeing a stabilization of the downturn, and the only improvement we'll get, assuming that would be correct is through the cost line.</p>
          <p>And that's what we saw in the second quarter, which we see as a slight improvement. That's why we're saying we believe we'll see a similar improvement in the third &#x2013; similar third quarter or a slight improvement to the revenue side. I do mean slight, because as you've seen the chances as well as I have. There is no indication that volume will significantly go up in the third quarter, and expecting the same kick-in from on savings increases is probably not realistic as we saw from first to second, because you have some big pockets coming when you do close down manufacturing plants. So there were no change in the market, it was simply, it was all cost driven.</p>

          <p>But a slight improvement could then imply 50 million higher EBIT actually.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I would, so let me be very clear, I'd think you would be building a different &#x2013; a wrong model if you put that into the model. That's why we say we believe a similar to a slight improvement. Last time we said slight, and we didn't say similar, so we have a lower guidance this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to defend our slight a little bit. The difficulty right now, and that continues to some extent is that there is a high volatility in the industrial markets. What we have tried to communicate over that period of time is that the impact from de-stocking and re-stocking as it occurs is very difficult to gauge. And therefore we've been consistently careful in not raising expectations beyond a level that we could justify. Whether there is a de-stocking and therefore unnecessary re-stocking is obviously observable once it has happened over a period of time, but as you go through the month it's not observable. Nobody tells you that he is de-stocking and therefore needs to re-stock next month.</p>
          <p>So therefore that has been a vacillation in industrial demand, which was very difficult to evaluate and assess, and therefore we've been careful. We've seen and that's what we have communicated during our Investor Relations work. What we have seen or what we have been looking for is what will be the run rate in the industrial production for this year? I can't tell that after the first quarter, we knew there is going to be somewhat improvement because January was closed down, and therefore there has to be an improvement over the first quarter. But what is the run rate? That's the difficulty, which we're facing then in the second quarter. And now we are feeling a little bit more comfortable, we think we're basically at the bottom, and therefore we look at a run rate, and that's why we think that similarly to the results that we have been able to deliver in our Adhesive's division in the second quarter, we'll deliver results in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The launch of 3-in-1 in the U.S. obviously has had an impact on our spend in the U.S. and therefore the results of North American business had been impacted negatively by Adhesives, obviously, and also by some higher spend to launch the 3-in-1 in the first six months in North America. So therefore that's indeed a correct observation. Also with respect to the third quarter, we need to point out that in some of our industry, and that's particularly relevant for the industrial customers. August will be a very slow month. There will be closures, plant closures, vacations, which some of the automotive manufactures have already announced. Therefore, the third quarter certainly will be again negatively impacted somewhat, and our outlook or expectation that will deliver similar results, from our perspective is already good.</p>

          <p>So you mean, you see a summer dip in Q3 coming.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see exactly what we have communicated, which is a similar result in the third quarter to the second quarter, which is good, otherwise be better, but there's obviously a summer vacation period, which some of the automotive manufacturers will extend.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just if you look upon our numbers and then we'll close with this question is, the volume increase is actually only from minus 23 to minus 21% Q1 over Q2. So going back and interpreting that we have a rebound would be the wrong conclusion.</p>

          <p>So ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for participating in today's second quarter call for Henkel. After what we saw as a restrained start to 2009, the second quarter showed slight improvement overall, but there's still some or a long way to go. However we believe that we are well prepared, and at the same time we're cautiously optimistic as we move forward.</p>
          <p>We wish you all the best and we look forward to talking to you again soon certainly by the time our third quarter conference call on November 11. In addition I'd like to remind you of our investor and analyst day here in D&#xFC;sseldorf, we'll have a special focus of our Laundry and Home Care business sector, and that will be held on September 2. If you haven't registered yet, I ask to please contact our IR team. With this thank you very much for today.</p>
