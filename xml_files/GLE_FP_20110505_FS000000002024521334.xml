          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group Third Quarter Results Conference Call. The presentation hosted by Mr. Didier Valet Chief Financial Officer will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Now I would like to hand over to Mr. Valet. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. I will make a brief presentation of 15, 20 minutes and then leave the floor for the questions. So if we start with the presentation page three. The Group had a good start to the year with an income excluding the revaluation of our own financial liabilities of &#x20AC;1,155 million, up 16% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>This good start to the year has been achieved in an environment which was marked by economic, political and financial instability and volatility. And thus we are pleased with the performance of our business lines.</p>
          <p>Starting with the French Retail banking business in France, it has been driven by a strong commercial momentum. And as you will see, the contribution to Group net income grew by 26% compared to one year ago at &#x20AC;352 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding the retail network overseas, due to political instability in Africa and the Mediterranean Basin, the performance was hurt. We had a contribution of this reduced by &#x20AC;59 million after tax, which include a cautious provisioning on the three countries Tunisia, Egypt and Ivory Coast.</p>
          <p>Our Corporate Investment Banking revenues were up by 4.2% at &#x20AC;2.3 billion, illustrating the solidity of our business model and also the benefit from the development that we have launched over the last 18 months. And as a result, the Group net income coming from the CIB business increased by 9.2% compared to last year, reaching &#x20AC;591 million.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, the contribution to profit of both Specialized Financial Services and Insurance on one side and Private Banking, Global Investment Management Services on the other side, continued to recover and their contribution to income increased significantly by between 70% to 80%.</p>
          <p>As you've seen, we were impacted by the revaluation of our own financial liability in the first quarter, the CDS of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale tighten from 158 basis points end of December to 130 at end of March. And as a result, we have to book a negative revaluation of our recent debt, by &#x20AC;362 million in revenues which is equivalent to minus &#x20AC;239 million after tax, so this has an impact of course on the net profit we published.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost of risk, we have continued to deliver reduction in the cost of risk in all division in line with what was achieved in the previous quarter. And lastly, we have also strengthened the capital position of the group by increasing by 0.3 percentage points both the Tier 1 at 10.8% and core Tier 1 from 8.5% to 8.8% in just one quarter.</p>
          <p>So you've seen that published net income stood at &#x20AC;916 million while excluding revaluation of own financial liabilities which I remind you is neutralized in the solvency calculation which was adjusted for these elements and profit was &#x20AC;1,155 million.</p>
          <p>If I go to next page, page four, just to highlight the performance excluding to this revaluation of our own financial liabilities, you can see that the group's net bank income momentum was good with an increase of 7.7% at current scope and 6.2% on a like for like basis at almost &#x20AC;7 billion. The cost income ratio has slightly increased at 62.7% but we have been impacted by taxes, systematic taxes for &#x20AC;25 million this quarter. We have also -- we are carrying on with the investments to achieve our transformation and we have also certain costs like the restructuring of our Italian consumer credit activities.</p>
          <p>Adjusted still from this revaluation of our own financial liabilities, the return on equity after tax reached 11.3%. If I jump directly to page six on the cost of risk, as you can see, the decrease was across all businesses, reaching 70 basis points in the first quarter compared to 77 basis points in Q4 and 91 a year ago.</p>
          <p>In the French network we've seen a sharp fall at 40 bps. In international retail banking business we've seen there also a 20 bps fall compared to the fourth quarter despite the fact that first Greece continued to have a high cost of risk at almost 900 basis points and also despite the fact that we set aside cautiously &#x20AC;51 million of provisioning, so portfolio based provisions, linked to the three countries I mentioned in my introduction, Ivory Coast, Egypt and Tunisia.</p>
          <p>In terms of trends in Russia, we've seen a cost of risk which has reduced by almost 50% in terms of bps compared through the fourth quarter, and in Czech Republic the cost of risk in terms of bps has decreased by one fourth compared to the fourth quarter. In Romania the cost of risk is almost stable.</p>
          <p>Regarding CIB, the cost of risk remains very low and also quite important. You can see at the bottom of the slide that the provisions for the legacy assets fell strongly in the first quarter to &#x20AC;96 million compared to &#x20AC;277 million in the fourth quarter and &#x20AC;214 million in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the cost of risk of the specialized financial services at 155 basis points also fell sharply, both for equipment finance and consumer finance activity. This relates to the fact that we have doubtful loans slightly decreasing, net of guarantee this is a stability to slight increase and the coverage ratio remain high at 72%.</p>
          <p>If I move to the capital position of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale on page seven, you can see that the net income adjusted for the revaluation of our own debt contributed to an increase of 33 basis points for the ratios. We have controlled our risk-weighted assets which are slightly down. We have set aside already, let's say, 35% for dividends on the first quarter results and we have started to optimize our legacy asset portfolio.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter we sold &#x20AC;1.2 billion and amortized &#x20AC;0.7 billion for a total of &#x20AC;1.9 billion reduction of the exposures. And we have started, as mentioned in the fourth quarter, to restructure our CDOs of RMBS. We expect the restructuring that we already launched to add up to &#x20AC;0.8 billion of capital relief by end of 2013. This is including the first benefits of the cracking and then the disposal of the whole assets that we will integrate from the cracking.</p>
          <p>You can see that for the first time, legacy asset portfolio adds a positive contribution to the capital generation of the group during the quarter. So as I said as a result, we are at 8.8% Core Tier 1 ratio at end of March 2011 and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:38) in terms of targets for Basel III.</p>
          <p>If I move to page eight, in term of financial structure and execution of funding program, you can see that we have continued to be active in term of deposit gathering with &#x20AC; 6 billion increase in the first quarter. This led to an improvement of volume to deposit ratio by two percentage point in just three months.</p>
          <p>We have already executed two-third of our funding program as of end of April with &#x20AC;17.2 billion of senior debt issued. You can see that for the Vanilla issuances, we have already executed more than three quarter also lengthening the maturity to seven year year-to-date compared to six year in 2010 and five years in 2009. And in term of structured issuances, we have made already 50% of the program completed.</p>
          <p>Also as from last week, because it was validated by the IMF last week, we are now benefiting from a new issuance, the covered bonds which allow us for the next four years to potentially raise up to &#x20AC;25 billion of long term funding.</p>
          <p>If I move now to the performances of the businesses, starting with page nine, I will be brief. The performance as by itself, you can see with the French network that we have robust commercial activities illustrated by numerous figures in terms of financials, we have increased in our revenues of 4.6% excluding SMC, excluding PEL/CEL so performance is 7.7% in absolute term. We have seen a good resilience of our margin, despite the part of the increase in the two months for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:25) and one month for the passbook of the 25 bps which took place on the first of Feb. And the cost income ratio continued to improve; it is down compared to the first quarter of last year. I already commented on the strong contribution increase of the French networks to the group profit.</p>
          <p>If I move to page 10, in International Retail Banking you can see that we have achieved a satisfactory commercial performance but due to the crisis that we face in Mediterranean Basin and in Sub-Saharan Africa, mainly in Egypt, Tunisia and Ivory Coast, we had a negative impact on our P&amp;L by &#x20AC;59 million after tax. This bites into the contribution of the division to net profit, which is down by 61% compared to last year at &#x20AC;44 million.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 11 with the CIB business, you can see that we were pleased with the NBI at &#x20AC;2.28 billion. This is a record level with a good quarter in global markets which are flat compared to last year. This is an increase by 12% for the equity part and a decrease by 8% for the fixed income side having in mind that, like most of our peers, we also book certain valuation changes into the OIS swap curve which about roughly a little less than &#x20AC;100 million of revenues in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to financing and advisory, we have the traditional seasonality of the fiscal quarter. This means that it is a little bit lower than the second half of the previous year. But the growth is 5% compared to the first quarter of last year, confirming the strength of our structured finance activity, notably infrastructure finance. And in capital markets we've seen resilient revenue in the slow European market. We confirm that we are numbered third in terms of Eurobond issuance in the first quarter of year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Cost/income is below the 60%, so at 57.7%, and, as you can see, legacy assets had a positive contribution of &#x20AC;42 million in revenues minus &#x20AC;96 as the cost of risk and all that combined led to a group net income of &#x20AC;591 million up 8% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>On page 12 for the Specialized Financial Services and Insurance, the recovery of this business is ongoing. You can see life insurance business post strong revenue growth by 15%. We confirm our leadership positioning in corporate financing, in fleet management and in equipment finance and we pursue the refocusing of our consumer finance businesses with new partnership agreement in France and most or strong growth as we already achieved in car financing, new loans which are up by 30% compared to last year. And thus you can see on the bar chart at the bottom of the slide that the contribution is strongly up, by 79% to &#x20AC;131 million.</p>
          <p>Life business line Private Banking, Global Investment Management and Services, there you can see that we have recorded strong quarterly inflows in Private Banking, plus &#x20AC;1.7 billion, this is a ratio of 8% of assets at the beginning of the period. Margins have increased by 8 basis points, this is supported by increase in interest rate but more importantly good performance in structured products. In custody, we have improved our cost efficiency. You can see cost income ratio which went down by 10 percentage points and in brokerage we have confirmed our leadership positioning.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in asset management you remember that a year ago we strike a transaction with MetWest to stabilize TCW. The transition phase of last year has come to an end and TCW now confirmed its capacity to recover with good net inflows and strong performance of its funds nicely, but I will let Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole comment deeper next week. Amundi post quarterly contribution of &#x20AC;32 million, up compared to last year. Altogether this led to almost &#x20AC;100 million of contribution to the net profit, up 76% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Before concluding a few words on the Corporate Centre, page 14, where definitely we have this negative item, the revaluation of the financial liabilities, so which is entirely linked to our structured EMTN business. So the negative impact on the revenues is minus &#x20AC;360 million. You can see that we have sensitivity as of end of March of &#x20AC;13 million negative for one basis point tightening. And I remind you that it has no prudential impact because as the regulators restate the plus or the minus into this impact in terms of solvency calculation.</p>
          <p>Also item is that we book &#x20AC;71 million of capital gain in the first quarter on industrial equity portfolio. And as I said as I started, we had also the &#x20AC;25 million negative French and British systemic risk banking tax which has an impact in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So to conclude and before leaving the floor for the questions, you can see that with a quarterly net group income excluding revaluation of our own financial liabilities of almost &#x20AC;1.2 billion, we confirm the redevelopments of our customer oriented and universal banking model. We have positive momentum in our commercial revenues which is part of strict capital allocation and cost management system and we have also generated a strong income growth despite substantial investments that we made to transform the operating model.</p>
          <p>This growth combined with commitment to the long-term improvement of our risk profile that you've seen in the results of this quarter enable us to generate the capital we need to develop our activity. And thus we feel confident in our achievements of our SG Ambition 2015 plan.</p>
          <p>That's it from me as a quick introduction and now I'm ready to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have a question from Mrs. Delphine Lee from JP Morgan. Madam please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Delphine Lee from JP Morgan. Good afternoon. Just a few questions. the first one is on the revenues in the international retail division, if we can have some maybe because it was a bit weak even if you adjust for the fact that you had branch closures during that quarter. Can we get some details maybe on organic revenue growth in Romania and maybe in the main markets?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the cost side, how much do you expect for the bank tax for the full year and also generally speaking how much investment cost should we expect in CIB and French Retail for this year and next if possible?</p>
          <p>And thirdly on Greece, just for Geniki would it be possible to get an update on the NPL and asset quality trends, where we stand and how it's progressing on that side?</p>
          <p>And last question is on the RMBS, the &#x20AC;800 million that you're mentioning of benefit under Basel III, does that relate to capital benefits or is that risk-weighted assets related or should we expect the &#x20AC;58 billion increase under Basel III that you indicated to be less or is that &#x20AC;800 million really a gain that we have on capital. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Delphine. I'll take the question on the revenue for International Retail Banking, a bit Geniki, let Michel P&#xE9;reti&#xE9; say a word on investment call we have on the CIB and also come back on the question of the capital and also take the bank tax.</p>
          <p>So, first let say because it will be easy on the bank tax, the full year impact will be &#x20AC;103. Second, on the benefit of the capital that we've mentioned up to &#x20AC;0.8 billion, this is a reduction in Basel III of the risk-weighted assets. This means nevertheless that in due course you know that we have prudential deduction from the Tier 1 and Tier 2. So, let's say, before moving to Basel III this will be less reduction and then in Basel III this will be less risk-weighted assets. Under Basel II and Basel 2.5 you have to divide by half the maximum benefit of &#x20AC; 0.8 billion because Basel 2.5 we will be able to deduct this impact both from Tier 1 and from Tier 2.</p>
          <p>Then if I turn to the International Retail Banking business, you were mentioning you had a question on the trend that we've seen in Romania. In Romania, let's say, you have that in the appendices. You can see that revenues are &#x20AC;152 million in the first quarter of 2011 on an amortized basis compared to &#x20AC;187 million a year ago. So this is a decrease by 17%. This is linked to two major elements, first on one side in net interest income, the fact that the local <mark type="indiscernible" />(19:10) are down and so are waiting in our capacity to get good margins in the lei. And second, also due to the economic environment, we have lower activity in terms of foreign exchange transaction with our corporate base and that is weighting on the activity that we have in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>For the rest, I'd say you've seen that in Russia we have an increase, we've lost, let's say, some of opportunities of revenue especially in Ivory Coast and to less extent in Egypt because the branch network was closed by roughly a week in Egypt and half a quarter, let's say, in Ivory Coast. We just reopened last week. So this is something of course that has a slight impact on the revenues and operating income pre provisioning level.</p>
          <p>On GDP we had in terms of cost of risk &#x20AC;98 million of provisioning this quarter compared to &#x20AC;100 in the previous quarter. NPLs are at 31.2% compared to 28% in the fourth quarter and the coverage ratio remain well slightly up by 1 percentage point to 69%. And you also saw that and this has an impact French, international retail banking business that since December we own 88% of Geniki compared to 54%  before so this means that the losses that we have from this subsidiary has increased. And I will leave the floor to Michel to have points on the evolution on the investment cost in the CIB business. Michel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. The cost on CIB, as you've seen we are slight decrease compared to Q4 and 14% increase compared to Q1 2010. This is &#x2013; if we treat with seasonal effect, this is in line with our investment program, which is mainly two-fold. This is first the resolution plan which is aiming at transforming our operating system which is a three year plan when we said we will increase our expense by &#x20AC;500 million over three years, so less than &#x20AC;200 million per year. And also the initiative we have made on the business side with the aim of recruiting a bit less than net 10% of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:45) staff this year. So all-in it's something which is highly monitored and with the idea of maintaining a cost/ income below 60% in order to maintain a position as one of the best in this industry.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Alex Koagne from Natixis. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello, Didier. Morning to everybody. I have three or four questions, if I may. The first one is on Russia. Could you please give us more granularity on the cost increase, how much is due to inflation and how much is due to investment? And what is your target in term of cost to income post entity merger?</p>
          <p>Secondly some bank are closing their business in Russia mostly the retail one. How far are you confident to turn and run your profitability in your business out there? And do you consider reducing your exposure to retail banking in Russia? When it come also to the provision you book in your International division, how much is -- how is the amount of this tax of this provision before tax?</p>
          <p>And lastly, given that the liquidity ratio under Basel III will change the business model of your consumer loan, how do you consider your consumer loan in Poland and in Italy? Do you consider -- do you think to dispose this asset going forward? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, can you repeat your third question again, the provisioning, because I didn't catch you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean you just gave the amount post-tax, could you just give the general amount before tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the impact on those three countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I will take this one. And then I will let Jean-Louis Mattei answer to this question on Russia. The &#x20AC;59 million after tax that we've mentioned in the press release, roughly &#x20AC;25 million of lower gross operating income. So this is fact that we have no contribution from Ivory Coast for half the quarter and also we've seen a slight slowdown in the revenues in Egypt because of the closure of the network. And this is for the three countries. And it's a generic base provisioning. We have set aside &#x20AC;51 million of provision of provision base -- portfolio base provisioning, sorry, on this these three countries in the first quarter -- so &#x20AC;51 million of cost is pre-tax.</p>
          <p>And a loss of opportunity, I would say, of &#x20AC;25 million of gross operating income on also these three countries pre-tax in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>I pass the floor to Jean-Louis to answer your two questions on Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Concerning your first question, concerning the evolution of the expenses in Russia. You have to take in mind that the inflation rate is more or less 10% in Russia. And that during the first quarter, the local authority decided to increase the sulfur taxes, that means an impact for Siberia of more or less &#x20AC;20 million. And at the same time in Russia, as you know, we're in the middle of the process of the transformation of consolidation of disposal and the process is ongoing. And just to say that we'll emerge, as we already say, with two universal banks in July. And before the end of this year we will have only one IT system for the two universal banks in Russia. That means that we're investing some money at the same time to reorganize the network in Russia.</p>
          <p>Concerning your second question, about our exposure on retail &#x2013; maybe your question is due to the fact that some banks announced recently that they will &#x2013; they decided to get -- reduce some local investments in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning the group, concerning Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, we are very happy to be involved in retail in Russia. We're definitely profitable in this activity for the two universal banks for the time being before the merger. And so two specialized subsidiaries, Rusfinance mainly car loans, and DeltaCredit mainly mortgages. So the matter is that in retail mainly, if you wanted to be successful and profitable you need to have a critical size and some of the competitors, mainly the one who decided to leave this country, were not at this level as you know. So it's not easy to compare our network in Russia and some smaller, if I can say, competitors, local competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>And just to answer your last question regarding the new liquidity constraint that we have to face, whole I would say Polish and Italian assets in consumer finance do integrate in the group strategy. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:20) we said that we have announced in beginning of March a restructuring plan, the idea is definitely to rationalize our distribution network to reduce this work force and more importantly to reposition Italia on one of its strengths, its very good strengths, which is cap financing. And thus let's say we will do that, I think let's say on the net basis strict control on the funding consumption of this subsidiary. And in Poland, let's say, Eurobank is already a bit much more than the sole consumer finance activity, It has a large network on the Polish territory; it is a already offering other services than just consumer finance, like deposit taking, like also mortgages And so we want to push the business forward and transform it on the market which, as you know, is of interest for us.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a follow-up question, please. On Russia what do you consider as a normalized cost of income and in terms of market size and retail banking I think that you have a very low market share, what is the market share that you intend to reach, let's say, within the next four year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost income ratio target that we have in Russia, currently while you've seen that in the figures, let's say we have the high cost income ration, but which is at the start of the transition phase where we need to better equip our retail customers. As Jean-Louis was mentioning, we have two powerful tools, DeltaCredit in mortgages and Rusfinance in consumer finance. And we have already launched a reform of the sales organization which aim to boost the contribution of retail in the total revenues of Rosbank.</p>
          <p>You have seen as a result that the dynamic in terms of growth of the loans that we have achieved in the first quarter which is up 10% on average, is stronger for the retail at 14% than for the corporate. So the idea is definitely to better cross sell, to better equip the client that we have in our let's say 600 branches for Rosbank and what -- something like 50 to 80 at BSGV -- so all together almost 700 branches.</p>
          <p>We got the cost/income, so we will have to execute the merger in June, the legal merger. We said in the fourth quarter last year that we have also to merge the IT system by end of this year and thus we will get a better scale, a better standardization and mutualization of the tools that we have across the organization and this will be a further leverage in terms of the improvement of the cost income ration. On IT, at this stage I will not give you targets but we work on improving the efficiency of this organization.</p>
          <p>Regarding the market share, we have approximately 2% market share in the retail if you look by total assets, but in certain segments like for example car financing, we have something like 8% market share of the total &#x2013; or it's consumer finance where we have 8% market share. So it's 20% in car financing, but 8% for the whole consumer finance business. And thus in our view and looking at our experience in emerging markets where retail has started first by consumer finance then migrating to a more fully fledged banking relationship. We feel that it's a strong door that we have to activate to penetrate this retail market. Of course, we will not the get the same size as Sberbank and VTB -- that's likely to remain I don't know whether it's forever, but for a long period of time -- it is the two market leaders. But aside with local Russian investor banks and a couple of foreign banks, we feel that we have capacity to compete and to gain market share.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I have few questions, if I may. The first one would be on the capital formation. Back at the Investor Day, you highlighted obviously three pillars for your capital formation planning, first the net income and it's obviously stabilized at decent level now. Then there was mitigation effects which all will engage as you pointed out this quarter again in with this restructuring in the legacy assets. And then there was a third point which was the arbitrage of some of the assets that the group have more in terms of the business line. Could you please update us on that as to where we stand? Or is this something which is more on the back burner now that the profitability has stabilized well?</p>
          <p>My second question was on the savings market in France and its longer term maybe medium term structure. Where do we stand on the possibility of having a new regulated -- say longer term savings account on balance sheet for the banks more similar maybe to a traditional life insurance policy? And on this topic as well, how would the profitability you think of such a passbook account would compare to an equivalent life policy for you as a bank if you had a substitution effect?</p>
          <p>And lastly, on the regulation of the insurance capital and the possibility of the new directive and obviously its outcome, is this for you a game changer if it does or doesn't come in the form that is currently expected and also taking into account the possibility of having longer term savings on balance sheets rather than through the life insurance?</p>
          <p>And then my last question was on Greece, if you could update us on credit quality outlook there? And also maybe more broadly, are you of the view that however risky the sovereign debt may be there, it is still--put it this way-- safest asset in the country and do you expect that credit quality could be of -- fare better in the event of a restructuring than the sovereign debt itself? Or does it have to be -- does the haircut on the sovereign debt have to be a cap on credit quality in a sense? Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean Francois good afternoon. Thank you for these questions. Regarding the first the capital formation, yes, we have three pillars. On the last one no, we are not &#x2013; it's not because we feel that the market has improved and profit has come back that's we are not looking at arbitraging the portfolio. We've mentioned that over the next two years we are committed to refine and lift the portfolio. So certainly there will be an in and out that we continue to expect in the portfolio and we already, let's say, make some comment on that.</p>
          <p>I remind also that compared to the 40 bps mitigation that we have announced in November in our capital planning to achieve our 8.5% target under Basel III. Thanks to what we've already implemented, we have secured almost 30 bps of this 40 bps already, mainly through the optimization of the legacy portfolio. On your second question was linked to the long term deposits that could happen  in France, well we are currently holding discussions, the banking industry, to look whether we could reactivate the kind of, for the experts, a PEP <mark type="indiscernible" />(34:44) product which had some success during the early 90s almost.</p>
          <p>So it's a way for us to have a kind of copycat I would say of life insurance product but which has certain tax break up to 8 years and provide you long term funding. So we are, let's say, waiting for eventual discussion. In terms of pricing and margin, I think it's a little bit too complicated to compare to one which is, I would say, fee based and the other one which is more based on your asset liability management policy in term of replacing this long term resource.</p>
          <p>In any case, one must look at what the PEP  has done compared to the life insurance and it is something interesting but that's will not make interest of life insurance or bancassurance disappear, so this is also a part of the answer to your third question. This mean that even if we had not, let's say, the financial conglomerate treatments, first of all for us it will be roughly negative 10 basis point impact on the capital position of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale compared to having the financial conglomerate. Due to the synergies that we are able to extract and also the importance to monitor this factor in terms of distribution capacity, life insurance we continue to make a lot sense within bancassurance group.</p>
          <p>On your last question regarding Greece, well the provisioning outlook is that, as we said in the fourth quarter where we had &#x20AC;100 million, we are likely to get the same type of provisioning levels for the coming three quarters. &#x20AC;100 million a year in 2011 seems to be a reasonable amount, I would say, looking at the current trends. And your last question let's say is tricky because to say that the sovereign debt is the safest asset of the country and that the restructuring could benefit to the whole, I think there is so many contagion and complicated items that could take place that I will not answer to that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure, actually I was meaning the opposite that sovereign that being the safest asset, at least by definition, that what we would have thought is the credit quality would have to be by definition worse than the sovereign haircut, if it ever happened. And just one quick question, you grew your revenues in French retail by 4.5% it seems on a like for like basis in the first quarter, and it seems as though it's well ahead of what you plan for the full year despite the fact that the comps on last year are quite tough actually, because you had a very good first quarter last year as well. So I was just wondering about the outlook there too, probably for the last follow-up question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Jacques-Henri Gaulard from Autonomous. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon, gentlemen, three quick questions, it's all around the same, really, but you have a profit target of &#x20AC;6 billion for 2012, on French Retail and on Corporate Investment Bank you are in the track of that. The main problem of everybody today is the International Retail which if I annualize the number of today, would get you to &#x20AC;200 million while you need to get to &#x20AC;900 million, &#x20AC;1.1 billion. How do we get there from the reasonably mediocre level at pre- provision that we have and can we get there? Are you confident? Are you going to be, are you going to have to offset, I would say, the underperformance of that division by another division doing better? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one, you said that you mitigated your Basel III core Tier 1 of 40 basis points in the Q3 presentation last year. You said you were basically 30, 35 basis point down. Isn't it the time then to  actually maybe review the mitigation and probably give higher Basel III core Tier 1 target for 2012?</p>
          <p>And the last question, to make sure I have understood. The translation of the &#x20AC;800 million are in the risk weighted assets, what is it precisely in billion terms, being a bit thick naturally? Thank you very much, Didier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jacques-Henri, good afternoon. Regarding well the &#x20AC;6 billion target, so first pleased that you have seen that we are on track in French Retail and CIB. Regarding International Retail Banking business, for the &#x20AC;44 million I would say to be fair it has to be reinflated by the &#x20AC;59 million. So I would say the underlying is more closer to something close to &#x20AC;100 million and there, let's say, we are conscious that we need to work to improve the efficiency of this network and also we feel that we should benefit from improvement in the cost of risk, because especially in Romania, even if situation is a little bit tougher than what we thought it should be or it could be a year ago.</p>
          <p>We are looking at our own macro economic forecast and also at the IMF. We should have a recovery gradually building up in H2 and thus having some fruits in 2012 in term of improvement in cost of risk in Romania. So definitely this is something on which we are working hard both on the cost side, developing the commercial activities, and also having necessarily some benefit in term of cost of risk. You've seen that we have also good news on the front of Russia, Czech Republic which is already at pre-crisis level and in commercial activities, for example, in South Eastern Europe, so essentially Ex-Yugoslavia we have also good momentum in term of top line. So we will monitor that closely in the coming quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding the annual targets, sorry, what was your second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's on the higher target on Basel III. You're at 7.5% and 8.5% for '12 and '13, and since your mitigation is already there...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are ahead of schedule, so definitely we will work on it to do better than the 8.5% by end of 2013 and we're seeing capacity to do better on our own means. And lastly on your question of the risk-weighted assets prevalence of the maximum &#x20AC;0.8 billion benefit that we have. It is &#x20AC;17 billion of risk-weighted asset equivalents by end of 2013 that we do expect in term of risk-weighted assets reduction compared to the estimation that we provide you in November.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome, Jacques-Henri. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Guillaume Tiberghien from Exane BNP. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I've got two questions. The first one is to rebound on Jacques-Henri's question. With regard to the &#x20AC;17 billion of RWA equivalent, if I say that you want 8% or 8.5% equity Tier 1, if you save &#x20AC;17 billion of RWA, then should you not save &#x20AC;1.2 billion or &#x20AC;1.3 billion of capital? So does it mean there is another minus &#x20AC;500 somewhere else?</p>
          <p>The second question relates to Russia you said that was &#x20AC;20 million more cost due to social taxes. Does it mean that the Q2 cost base is the new cost base, in which case should we assume that for 2012 your net profit in Russia will be less than &#x20AC;100 million instead of &#x20AC;150 million target? And finally, you disclosed the capital allocated to the legacy assets and I think it's gone up by from &#x20AC;2.9 billion to &#x20AC;3.1 billion but because of the FX I would have expected it to actually go down? So can you explain what has happened and maybe give me some granularity on the underlying RWA, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guillaume, first welcome back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your first question on the &#x20AC;17 billion, I didn't catch what was your missing to come to the math that you were making the &#x20AC;0.5 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I was just saying if you apply 8.5% equity tier one target to the group, if you have &#x20AC;17 billion less it means you've got about &#x20AC;1.3 billion less capital requirement and because you said that you save &#x20AC;800 million in your slides, then does it mean that's &#x20AC;500 million somewhere else on the negative side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sorry, excuse me, yes, so this is also because we have capacity also to accelerate the deleverage and to better hedge certain position. So all together the net income of amortization profile sale that we have already executed or we are able to execute in the coming quarter. And also as a cracking benefit, you come to this &#x20AC;17 billion risk weighted asset savings compared to our previous target provided to the market in November.</p>
          <p>On the cost side in Russia I will let Jean-Louis answer and then I will answer to your question on capital allocated to legacy assets. Jean-Louis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning, it's not only a matter of cost, so sorry if I weren't understood, it's a matter of profit, the forecast for 2012. First, the &#x20AC;20 million I mentioned represents one-third of the impact for 2011, that mean that the impact will be lower during the three next quarters and that's why, as Didier already mentioned, we are on the process to transform our network in Russia subsidiaries and we will save a lot of costs at the end of this year and beginning of 2012. That means for the time being we don't want to change our forecast for Russia at the end of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So again your question on the capital allocation on the legacy assets, we have just a slight increase from &#x20AC;2.9 billion to &#x20AC;3.1 billion Q4 on Q1. I remind you, Guillaume, like one of our competitors, we do allocate the capital based on the risk weighted assets and deduction at the beginning of the quarter, so this means that the benefit that you could expect from decrease in dollars and also improvements, as I say, cannot enough boost deduction and reduction through sales of our risk weighted assets. You will get it more in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Just to give you the risk weighted assets end of the year for the legacy assets, they went down by &#x20AC;2 billion from &#x20AC;17.1 billion end of Q4 to &#x20AC;15.1 end of Q1. So we will have on the risk weighted asset this benefit in terms of capital allocation in second quarter. And also a reduction of the deduction due to a low rated securitization due to both cracking and exchange rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask maybe a last question which is about the debate with regard to is 10% liquidity core Tier 1 under Basel III the right number or not? In terms of capital planning until the SIFI is finalized, do you have in mind that you have to end to 10% or you just say, okay, we earned for 8.5% as promised and then we will see once SIFI is finalized whether we need to step it up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guillaume, I will not comment too much in detail on that because on the SIFI the discussion are still going. And I think that we are certainly likely to get a clearer view more in the second half of this year. There is also the question whether let's say, our CoCos will or will not  we will not be allowed to cover this eventual additional charge. Let's say we've set already targets in November that was quite transparent for the market. I mentioned that now we are now ahead of schedule and we can do better. So we will definitely adjust depending on the outcome that we will see in terms of regulation, keeping in mind also that on the SIFIs the charge may not be identical for all global SIFIs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a few questions. The first one is your peer which published its result yesterday, saw quite a fall in cost of risk and we didn't see that in your case. Is it something you would expect in the next one or two quarters that you would have a turnaround of the cost of risk given the NPL evolutions? That would be the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is regarding the optimization of the risk-weighted assets, you indicated 15 basis points benefit for this quarter. Is it something you're targeting for the next few quarters as well and do you have a pace in mind in terms of risk-weighted asset optimization per quarter?</p>
          <p>Then another question which is related to the AUM, it declined from &#x20AC;87 billion to &#x20AC;84.9. But at the same time you have an inflow of &#x20AC;1.3 billion, so just trying to understand if the performance was quite dramatically poor or is there something missing in the equation there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean Pierre, thanks for these questions. Regarding the falling cost of risk also I read very quickly yesterday because I was quite busy, but I read that our competitor mentioned there was a seasonality impact in at least two of his divisions so we will see whether that's a seasonality that will  lead to a slightly different trend. It's always complicated to forecast the cost of risk. What we say that we've guided at the beginning of the year for something like 40, 50 bps in French Retail. We are already at 40 in first quarter, so this shows that the portfolio is in good shape.</p>
          <p>We are benefiting let's say from better trend on the SME market especially which is supported by better compared to last year even it's still poor growth in France. In CIB I would say the trend is continue to be good, i.e. there is no deterioration at CIB of our large corporate portfolios. You've seen that in financial strategies we have seen a sharp fall which was, let's say, maybe a little bit faster than expected. And then in International Retail Banking there is a decline compared to Q4 but still we did &#x20AC;51 million. So I would say you always remain cautious but the trends or the trend seems to be on the downside. The question is the magnitude. We will see quarter after quarter but, as you said, also in terms of asset quality we are currently seeing more positive signs overall.</p>
          <p>On the assets under management, just very quickly I think most of the impact is linked in the Private Banking to the forex, which was negative. You know that we have certain assets in dollar and also certain activities which are also in Swiss franc. I will give that to you. And regarding the risk weighted assets optimization, in terms especially of the CDO restructuring you have in the first quarter the benefit of just one restructuring that we launched in Q4 and that had an impact as of end of March. We've launched two further restructuring in Q1 that will have an impact in Q2. After that I explained to you that you need to get the control of the structure and so we will need to work to gain the control of the other structure that we could eventually optimize. But nevertheless it's, as I said, securing almost three-quarter of the mitigation that we were targeting by 2013.</p>
          <p>In terms of an impact, have in mind that for the first quarter we have a reduction of deduction of almost something like &#x20AC;40 million and we should get almost twice this impact in the end of June figure and this will &#x2013; both figures will almost double if on top of the cracking we are selling the assets that we inherited from the restructuring. I think that fits on the -- just maybe to give you the &#x2013; well I would comment on the FX impact on the Private Banking a little bit later when I'll get the figure.</p>

          <p>I can just make a quick comment, indeed the figures on assets under management and assets in Private Banking are very similar around &#x20AC;85 billion, but indeed the move between December and March is just due to the fact that our asset management fund is TCW in dollar and it's just the evolution of the ForEx.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, sorry to come back on costs in International Retail but even excluding Russia the cost ratio was perhaps higher than expected and there doesn't seem to be that much cost control relative to the revenue trends. So can you just touch on efficiencies, whether you have got any related investment spend that needs to come through for the rest of the year and any initiatives you have just outside Russia? And then secondly just very briefly, if you could just update us on the maturity and amortization schedule on the legacy assets? I mean you said in the past that broadly they've got a maturity of about three to four years. But excluding sales, is there a point at which we should really start to see larger amortizations? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the two question. Regarding the amortization of legacy assets, I think that we have in term of profile everything being hold, so without any sale. We have the capacity to reduce this to security from &#x20AC;30 billion to around &#x20AC;26 billion by end of '12 and &#x20AC;11 billion by end of 2015. And of course through the sales we will accelerate this natural amortization.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second or your first question on the cost of the International Retail Banking business, you said that even if you strip out Russia, this is cost evolution compared to revenues continue to be not favorable. As I said on Romania, we have seen a 17% reduction in the revenues and that we were not able to adjust the cost base of course in the same manner.</p>
          <p>So let's say when you look at the rest of the organization, the cost control is good and thus it's so underperforming more the top line and of course the cost side in Romania. And a slight increase in Russia due to the impact that Jean-Louis mentioned in terms of inflation and also increasing social tax.</p>
          <p>Also to complement more into detail what's the question of Jean Pierre, we had at TCW in the first quarter &#x20AC;1.9 billion of positive value, &#x20AC;1.3 billion of net inflows and minus &#x20AC;5.2 billion of foreign exchange due to the weakness of the dollar. So you can see that it's not linked to the performance but more due to the weakness of the dollar that we've seen an impact on TCW.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Didier. Good afternoon, everyone. Still a few questions left. The first one how, could you explain this high difference in sensitivity on that valuation between French banks, first. Second I was wondering how come the corporate loan in French Retail Banking was yes, slightly down but down both Q-on-Q and year-on-year when I was thinking that market was slightly improving?</p>
          <p>My last question is you mentioned you want to transform your consumer finance in Poland into a retail bank. I would say that's what one of your competitor is also trying to do if I understood well. Don't you think there will be some overcrowded competitor in this market to get liquidity to finance the consumer businesses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pascal, thank you. Regarding the evolution of the loan outstanding in the French Retail Banking business for the large corporates which you mentioned was down Q-on-Q. It's true we've seen a slight decrease, let's say, in both large corporates and SMEs and in fact it is mainly driven by treasury loans, short-term loans, because as you've seen we've seen a good trend in term of investment loans, new loans, on new business on that segment.</p>
          <p>Have in mind that traditionally we have higher than our natural market share in cash loans or in treasury loans to corporates, while traditionally and de facto this was the segment of the markets that did suffer the most during the crisis because, let's say, working capital needs of corporate sector shrunk and also there was change in law to reduce payment delay between corporates which also bite into the natural working capital needs of the corporates and thus reducing their needs for treasury loan. So we continue to have this impact on the evolution of our loan outstanding dedicated to corporate. Your first question, Pascal, on sensitivity was, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The sensitivity to spread of your own debt, valuation is very high compared to Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole  or BNP over the last two quarters and I was wondering how would you explain personally that difference in sensitivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think there's -- well first maybe let's explain from where this sensitivity is coming, it's coming from the structure that we are placing. So first of all, as we are worldwide leader in equity derivatives the usage of this underlying in the structured product that we sell to third party networks, private banking and institutional investors, is certainly bigger than for our peers. We have just to give you an idea, roughly top of my mind, &#x20AC;33 billion of debt which is linked to these structured products. And then there is first the amount I would say of the underlying outstanding and second there is also on various, maybe more compared to BNP Paribas, the fact that our spreads was a little bit more volatile than what they are. And your last question, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was in Poland, you mentioned during the Q&amp;A that you were planning to offer a wider range of products, going to more retailer bank in order to get deposit to finance the consumer business, but I think that's what other competitors already present in consumer are trying to do -- going to a retail bank? And I'm just a bit of afraid that this increased competition could put some pressure on margin or cost of funding there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but I would say when you look at Eurobank which is our brand in Poland, it is already well know, well recognized for its cash loan product which is what was launched almost now seven years ago. I think that we have a small outlet where the cost of exploiting the network is relative light and say we are able to easily cross-sell mortgage and also to get some cash from this customer base and would say compared to just standard consumer lending activities, to be able to gather some deposits from both, let's say, financial point of view in terms of profitability, but also in term of funding, is something which is beneficial for us. And let's say so far we are successful in this strategy, so we are continuing to make a slight push in this direction.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good afternoon, Didier. I have just three quick questions. The first question is on the legacy assets. You had &#x20AC;120 million write-backs on the monoline exposures, just wondering whether there were any specific names? And also on the &#x20AC;80 million for others if you can give us some color?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the shadow P&amp;L, where the potential loss is constantly decreasing in line with the positive guidance you've given in the previous quarter. Just wondering whether you can confirm that the positive trend is continuing in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And finally on the financial services, I am not sure whether I was able to find the loans and the breakdown between consumer credit and leasing, whether you can provide this figure to us? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding monolines, let's say we had and you can see that in the appendices, we had an active management of hedge and thus we have shift a little bit let's say provisioning against CDS and this led, let's say, to a positive impact on our P&amp;L. You will seeing  the appendices that we disclosed the amount of hedge that we purchased increased from &#x20AC;600 million to &#x20AC;1 billion in the quarter. And so consecutively, we are able to reduce the amount of provisioning and our provision rate was slightly above, let's say, the cost of the CDS.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question which was on the trends of the shadow P&amp;L. I would say, I will not comment on the quarter to date and that's definitely you've seen that the trends for this assets has improved. You've seen two examples that both Fed and one of the large U.S. competitor will always to deleverage a huge book of RMBS. So this showed that there is some appetite and scarcity in term of price evolution for such type of assets.</p>
          <p>Having in mind that the category which is not likely to improve, but to be relatively stable is on the CDO of RMBS where we are not too stressed and, then let's say, on the other assets where we are mark-to-market. You can look at the indices but it has shown an regular improvement over time. I think that's it. No, there was one last question, Alessandro?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was on the financial services division, the breakdown of loans consumer credit and leasing in terms of loans outstanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll check that, yes, I've got that here. So in terms of outstanding for the consumer finance, we have &#x20AC;22.6 billion outstanding as of end of March. And so by deduction you will find increase which is into corporate finance or equipment finance and fleet management.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We have a question from Mrs. Anke Reingen from RBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Anke Reingen from RBC. I just had some follow-up questions. Firstly mainly on CIB, I just wondered if you can please provide a bit more color on your strengths in the equities business and the equity and fixed income line. And I just wondered, the VaR went up a bit in the quarter. Is this something that has driven the strength or could you maybe talk a bit more about your strong performance here?</p>
          <p>And then coming back to international retail, at the Investor Day you talked about target loan loss ratio of 90 to 100 basis points. This is something which looks realistic on today. I mean it's 150  underlying in the first quarter, probably some way to go. And then in terms of loan growth for Romania and Czech Republic, I just wondered what your view is on the volume momentum in these countries? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you good afternoon. So I will first take the answer on the question on the cost of risk in international retain banking business. Then I will let Michel answer on the strengths of CIB business in the first quarter which is not just due to volatility, because heightened volatility is not always supportive. And maybe I will ask Jean-Louis to answer about the trends in loans that we do expect in Romania and in Czech Republic.</p>
          <p>So starting with the cost of risk in international retail banking business, yes we continue to confirm that we have a mid cycle trend between 90 and 110 basis points. This seems to be fair and efficient compared to the balance mix that we have. As I said ,you have seen that we have a different trends, we have in Greece which is right above the trend, Romania which continue to be above the mid cycle, Russia which has strongly improved and KB which is below, I would say, already the mid cycle. Of course I'd say idea is that the mid cycle, I am not sure it will materialize surely into '12 maybe it will '13, but that we continue to believe that the mix that we have should be the lowest be in this range when the economic environment will stabilize and we'll be normalized in the regions. Now I'll let Michel comment the strong CIB performance of the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay on the -- first on the equity side, it was a very good months and which was evenly split between flow derivatives and flow equity and structured, thanks to a good volumes and also helped by the market parameters, dividends and then volatility. So all-in it was very good market for us. We had also satisfactory performance in fixed income, in fact the strong resilience of our market driven by our rate business and to a lesser extent by our credit business.</p>
          <p>Overall this has been done in an environment where we've been monitoring our market risk very well. Our VaR has slightly increased from &#x20AC; 42 million to &#x20AC; 45 million, but we are pretty pleased with the fact that our risk have been under control and with a decline of our stress test and particularly in fixed income in volatile environment on the sovereign debt side and this is due to the diversification of our risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I will take the question on <mark type="indiscernible" />(67:53) on the trending in loans. As you've seen, we are &#x2013; we have seen our loan spending increasing by 4%, this is mainly driven by individual loans which are up about 8%, while business grew by 1%. In term of credit asset quality, we've seen non-performing loans in Czech Republic going down from 5% to 4.8% and thus we have been able to strengthen the coverage ratio from 68% to 72%?</p>
          <p>With regard to BRD the trends in some of credits we are more mute I would say. We have seen a reduction by 3.5% of credit versus the fourth quarter and in term of NPL, we have seen a slight increase from 11.9% compared to 10.5% in the fourth quarter while maintaining our coverage ratio at stable to slightly below 50%. Is that okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I was wondering what's your view on the outlook for loan growth in these countries? Do you think it's going to accelerate in the second half? I mean 4% obviously is not bad in Czech Republic, but I just wondered, do you think is more, more top line growth in the second half this year?</p>

          <p>Yes good afternoon. Just a quick question on slide 7, you've got a breakdown of the Tier 1 ratio move and I wonder if you could specifically quantify the impact of rating migration during the quarter? It doesn't seem to have been broken out in that waterfall bar chart. That would be helpful. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The impact of rating migration on the moves, I guess specifically on RWAs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rating migration is peanuts, because on the legacy assets what we have done is that we have this, as I said, small cracking, restructuring of the CDOs, which has had an impact because as I explained the CDO which are fully rated, let's say, are fully deducted for the non-impaired tranche. While when we crack a CDO, the mixture of assets that you inherit on average are higher than the CDO stand-alone, but certain are better rated and thus this is reducing the deduction that we have to face.</p>
          <p>And it's more a risk-weighted asset equivalent that we have but will you get some category from that side. And on top of that, as I said also, we sold certain assets in terms of legacy assets which explains so the plus 7 basis points that we have on the whole legacy asset. But in term of impact of rating migration on the internal growth of businesses but because it will be the sole of the parts where you could have such impact, it is peanuts.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just two from me. One, it wouldn't be a Soc Gen conference call if nobody asked about current trading on the CIBM business, so if there's any color about what you're seeing in April and running into May, that would be great?</p>
          <p>And the second question just comes back to the special financial services business, maybe circle back around to what you were talking about in terms of restructuring, et cetera, in that business. But if I look at the like-for-like numbers there, you've got revenues up 8.3% and then sort of negative cost with costs up 15.8% and that seems particularly to relate to the SFS business rather than the life business. I just wondered if you could give a little bit more color as to what's going on there and what your expectation is in terms of revenue cost going forward?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Robin, I'll take the second one and then let Michel comment on the mood in CIB business quarter-to-date. On the SFS business, negative choice is entirely linked to the fact that, as I said, that I will not give you the figure for confidentiality reason. We do the full restructuring provisioning of the plan in the first quarter and this explain why we have negative dues</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi good afternoon. I've got three questions actually, firstly I just wanted to revisit this kind of International Retail Banking net income target for next year. I mean even if I were to assume that we actually led to a normalized cost of risk, 90 to 110 basis points, next year, it still suggests that the operating profit would need to be somewhere in the region of &#x20AC;2.3 billion, &#x20AC;2.4 billion which is about 25% ahead of the run rate that we've just seen in Q1 even giving the benefit of some of the branches being closed actually. So I am still trying to struggle and I am still struggling to try to see how we can get anywhere near target actually?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just wanted to clarify, I heard you mention something on the SIFI surcharge being different for different banks actually, maybe if you could shed some more light on that actually?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, on Spanish government bonds actually, there seems to be some quite significant movement from the data that we had on the stress test to the end of last year to the end of the first quarter, namely there was a spike in the trading position and then a sharp decline in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your first question on the trends for the International Retail Banking business, so you made your calculations, so we've normalized cost of risks and the needs of &#x20AC;2.3 billion, &#x20AC;2.4 billion pre-provisioning operating profit to achieve it. Compare to the &#x20AC;451 million that you have in the first quarter, I remind you that we have this &#x20AC;25 million, as I say lot of opportunity which is linked to the closure of our activities. So you are more, let's say, almost at &#x20AC;500 million. So yes, we will have to increase by something like 15% next year, operating income, pre-provisioning, if you want to be close to what you mention on calculation. So as I said, we are committed to work on it will not be just be achieved through cost of risk decline, but also through active measures in terms of cost control and in terms of revenue growth.</p>
          <p>On the SIFIs you will see -- I think that you read newspaper and you will see there was such discussion, so I will not comment more than that on this eventually, let's say, progressivity on SIFI charge. And your last question, Kinner, was on stress test was in term of sovereign debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Spanish sovereign exposures, they seem to have declined sharply from the end of last year, but then they have grown quite significantly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Essentially linked to the trading because on the trading we are market makers for a lot of sovereign debt, so we could have certain exposure that's up and down and you have seen on the trading. Yes it has decreased from &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;0.2 billion in a quarter. We've seen the same impact in Italy where you've seen that the exposure reduced from &#x20AC;1.6 billion to &#x20AC;0.2 billion.</p>
          <p>So I would say, something which is by nature going up or down depending on the current appetite and our market making activity. Altogether this mean that the dips with the too high and the RMBS  decrease from 9.1 to 6.5 on the banking book, let's say we have now &#x20AC;5.6 billion on these five countries and just &#x20AC;2.4 billion on the so called GIP, so Greece, Ireland and Portugal.</p>

          <p>So would those trading positions typically be hedged and therefore the P&amp;L impact is just kind of bit of a spread that you make or...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There could be hedged or not hedged. In any case, at this trading you have the full impact on the P&amp;L when you have the picture at the end of the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Jean Pierre Lambert from KBW. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just a follow-up question on the risk weighed asset optimization. From the point of view of the operational risk, you still have high amount in CIB. So following the furtherance situation you had before, is there any sign that this can be reduced now that you have additional procedures in place and have created the systems and so on, it would it be logical to see a reduction there?</p>
          <p>Secondly, regarding the move to advanced methods, is there any units you can see closer to moving into that direction. I suppose Russia will take some time but maybe other units may be closer? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the risk-weighted asset optimization or regarding operational risk as you said opportunity is high because of the <mark type="indiscernible" />(78:28). And looking at the position of the regulators, I think that unfortunately there is likely to get an <mark type="indiscernible" />(78:35) for still a couple of year. So we won't be able to see major reduction on the operational risk for the CIB business in the coming on the short-term horizon.</p>
          <p>Regarding the advanced methodology, I would say that while you've seen in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (78:51) that we've advanced methodology in most of the CIB business and French Retail and International Retail Banking business we have deployed the advanced where we could do, namely especially in Czech Republic. .And I think that the rollout plan we will continue to carry on, but it will have a limited impact in terms of further risk-weighted asset mitigation.</p>
