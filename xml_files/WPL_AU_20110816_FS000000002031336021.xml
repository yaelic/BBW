          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Woodside 2011 Half Year Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would like to advise that this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday August 17, 2011.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to today's speaker. Mr. Peter Colman, please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all, and welcome to our 2011 half year results briefing, of course the first for me as the new CEO of Woodside. Of course once again we appreciate everybody calling in today and we very much appreciate your continued interest in Woodside. That company really is a great company. Sharing the conference call today with me is Lawrie Tremaine, our CFO, and I know you all know Lawrie.</p>
          <p>If I can move to slide 2, I'd just personally like to draw your attention to our normal disclaimer and also remind you that the dollars that you will see in this presentation are now U.S. dollars as we've moved to the U.S. dollar as our functional currency.</p>
          <p>We can move to slide 3; before we get to the financial details I really want to remind you of Woodside's strategy. I know that's important to many of you and of course is pivotal to the performance of our company as we move forward. The strategy itself will be familiar to most of you but it's really important we keep this in mind as we talk about our base business activities and I'll continue to come back to that as we go through the presentation today. The messages of course is we will continue to focus on long-term shareholder value as we deliver outstanding results from our foundation business, of course pursuing our growth opportunities and of course we have a number of other select opportunities that we're currently evaluating. I do say select and of course we'll be examining each opportunity in a very robust and disciplined manner.</p>
          <p>First a brief comment on the global market environment. I think it's important as we've seen many changes happening around us, particularly over the last couple of weeks, and I'll offer comment as to how we see that affects Woodside and Woodside's business. Really the message for us, or from us, is we do have a very strong business with very real cash flows and we believe the outlook for commodities over the long term is very robust. Of course as we will know, new supply is required to meet the mid and long-term energy demands, and despite the recent fluctuations in global markets, those demands stay very real and it's very clear to us that there's a long-term demand for the products that Woodside supplies. The real message is &#x2013; for us here is that Woodside is very well placed geographically. We have a very deep knowledge and competence in our business and we have very strong long-term relationships with our customers and our partners.</p>
          <p>As we move on and look at executing on the deliverables that we have in the company, and of course Woodside continues to advance the development of its assets, let me make it quite clear that we need to focus on execution if we really realize the full potential value of the three horizons that have gotten marked out on this page.</p>
          <p>Our ability to execute well is evident in the Northwest Shelf. We'll talk some more about that later, where of course five LNG trains have been installed and are operating with very high reliability and I would say world-class reliability. This strong performance has delivered record first half revenue for the Northwest Shelf, but it's not all about operations and operational execution. We run a very strong balance sheet, and of course you know earlier this year Woodside issued a $700 million bond which was very well supported in the marketplace and remains very competitive even on today's values. And Lawrie will talk more about our capital management plans later on. These activities underpin and provide momentum for Woodside to pursue our &#x2013; its LNG growth options as shown in the slide, but we're more than just LNG and we'll talk some more about that later on.</p>
          <p>Moving to the financial results and operating performance, the headlines here I believe are compelling as we look at the results. It really does show the ongoing strength of the company's base business and the value that that continues to contribute. The results speak for themselves. The first half revenues rose 7.2% compared to the previous period or corresponding period I should say. And of course the underlying profit increased 3.6% and is very much underpinned by the excellent performance of the North West Shelf and its higher revenues.</p>
          <p>With the cash flow that we're generating out of these assets and of course the majority of our investment spend coupled with around $2.9 billion of cash in undrawn facilities, we are very well positioned for growth and executing our growth plans here in the short and medium-term.</p>
          <p>As I look at operational performances, I mentioned previously our foundation business operation performance really does provide our engine room for growth. Our focus on operational excellence in all aspects of our business continues to deliver outstanding results. And while you can see our safety numbers improved in the first half, we really do need to strive for further improvement, and we're particularly pleased with the reduction in the high potential incident frequency that we've got here on the chart.</p>
          <p>Of course we've talked about reliability of the North West Shelf project. It does continue to reap benefits, which is translating to the bottom line for us in a very material way. Our solid first half production keeps us on track to achieve the full year guidance of 62 to 64 MMboe.</p>
          <p>And of course with that as background, I'll hand over to Lawrie now to talk us through the financial results before I come back and talk into more detail about the other aspects of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter, and good morning to everyone. I'm going to review our 2011 half year financial results beginning with production on slide 9. Production for the first half of 2011 was 31.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, down 13%. After adjusting for the one-off for the sale of Otway and the unusually high level of cyclone and other weather interruptions, production was 6% lower year-on-year. Increased North West Shelf LNG production, which was 7% higher than the first half of 2010, has partially offset the impact of field decline and planned maintenance and project outages. Our full year production outlook remains within the 62 million to 64 million barrel of oil equivalent range disclosed previously.</p>
          <p>Now to sales revenue on slide 10, sales revenue for the first half was $2.3 billion. This represents a 7% increase over the first half of 2010. Our revenues have grown at a very credible compound annual growth rate of 14% over the period shown in the left hand chart. Not surprisingly, stronger oil prices were the primary reason for this very positive result, more than offsetting the impact of lower volume. Average daily Brent prices were $111.30 per barrel, 42% higher than the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Woodside's oil is typically sold off Dated Brent. In 2010 we've benefited from the original supply and demand forces, which have resulted in stronger Brent prices relative to WTI. In addition, we've also achieved significant premiums over Dated Brent for our heavy Greater Enfield Area crudes. These premiums are as a consequence of strong Asia Pacific demand for gasoil. In the first half we've achieved average premiums from the Enfield and Stybarrow field of $6 per barrel over Dated Brent.</p>
          <p>The chart on the right shows the relationship between WTI Brent and Japan Custom Cleared prices. Also shown is the three month lagged Japan Custom Cleared price, which is typically referenced in long-term LNG contract pricing. There are a couple of points to note from this chart; firstly, the JCC price closely correlates to Brent pricing with a one-month lag. Our LNG prices will benefit from the stronger Brent prices relative to WTI. Secondly, due to LNG contracts referencing the three-month lagged JCC, the strong oil prices experienced in the first half will be reflected in our realized LNG prices well into the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Next, the lifting costs on slide 11. In the table on the top of the slide you can see that our total lifting costs in Australian dollars have remained flat when compared to the same period last year. Oil lifting costs increased by AUD6 million to AUD115 million. This increase, along with the lower production mainly due to planned maintenance, cyclone activity, and field decline, has resulted in an increase in oil lifting costs to AUD15.86 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Gas lifting costs reduced AUD6 million to AUD78 million in the first half. This was a good result and together with incremental production growth has enabled us to sustain and further improve the flat gas lifting cost trend of the past few years. With major shutdowns to North West Shelf Train 5 and North Rankin A, we expect higher unit gas lifting costs in the second half.</p>
          <p>Moving on to unit margins on slide 12. The height of the columns in this chart represents our average realized price per barrel across all products and the bottom gray section of the columns represents gross margins per barrel. The chart highlights that our unit margins have been increasing largely in line with oil prices. Our unit gross margin for the first half of 2011 was $46 per barrel compared to $36 per barrel in the first half 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 13. Our first half 2011 underlying profit was a very pleasing result, reflecting good operational performance, which Peter will discuss in more detail, and stronger oil prices, which I have discussed at length already. The underlying profit was $842 million, a 3.6% increase on the $813 million recorded in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>In first half 2010, we had net significant items at $88 million after tax. These were reported last year, but to recap, they included the gain on sale of Otway and a positive once off adjustment to deferred tax liabilities on adoption of the U.S. dollar functional currency offset by an impairment of the net chain asset and the write back of U.S. tax losses. The only significant item in the first half of 2011 is the $14 million impairment of the Coniston asset.</p>
          <p>Turning to reported profit on slide 14. You can see from the waterfall, higher selling prices partially offset by lower volumes are the major drivers of the result between the two periods. The variance in other income and expense is predominantly the gain on sale of Otway in 2010. Once again the adoption of U.S. dollar functional currency in 2010 resulted in once off adjustments to deferred tax liabilities, positively impacting income tax and negatively impacting petroleum resource rent tax.</p>
          <p>Dividends on slide 15. The directors have declared a fully franked interim dividend of US$0.55 per share. This compares to the 2010 interim dividend of US$0.50 per share. The dividend reinvestment plan will again be offered and will be fully underwritten for this interim dividend. The chart on slide 16 shows our current estimate of 2011 capital and exploration expenditure. The Pluto foundation project continues to dominate our expenditures, representing over 50% of forecasted 2011 spending. The increasing other category represents higher spending in 2011 on the Browse project, particularly front-end engineering and design, and expenditure on the other growth projects across our business. As reported in the second quarter report, our year-to-date investment expenditure was $1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Now to operating cash flow on slide 17. The operating cash flow result further reinforces just how good our first half result was. $1.4 billion represents a record first half result and a 38% increase on first half 2010. This result is largely due to higher revenues and lower income tax and Petroleum Resource Rent Tax payments.</p>
          <p>And finally, to capital management on slide 18. Net debt has increased by $402 million in the first half of 2011 to almost $4.4 billion. Gearing is at 27% and funds from operations over debt is 50%. The latter is a key metric the credit rating agencies use to measure our leverage. Through the balance of the Pluto development phase, we're targeting funds from operations to debt of above 35%. During the first half, we successfully raised $700 million in the corporate bond market. This transaction was satisfying insofar as the credit spread we paid over U.S. treasury yields better reflected the inherent quality of our existing cash flows and the imminent growth in cash flows from Pluto. We also accessed a broader debt investor base than in earlier transactions. We finished the first half with cash and undrawn debt facilities of $2.9 billion. This is adequate funding to meet existing commitments well into 2012 given the current oil price and exchange rates. Our balance sheet remains well positioned to fund our continuing growth.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening. I'll now pass you back to Peter to discuss our projects and operational performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Lawrie. Look, I'm on slide 20, we'll just slow down the pace here a little bit now as we kind of walk through the results for you and of course we'll now talk about some of the operational aspects and where we're heading to. I will remind those who were furiously writing notes here, of course we will post both this presentation pack and the speaker notes on the ASDX platform. So if you miss something we should be able to catch it there.</p>
          <p>I'm on page &#x2013; I'm on slide 20. I really want to start with this because we often don't spent enough time talking about the strength of Woodside's base business. And you've heard me talk about in the presentation already, but I really want to talk in terms of priority. I really can assure you that the team here is very focused on maximizing value from these really world class assets, and they truly are world-class assets. And as you can see, the performance of Woodside on the first half along with Australian oil assets shows that.</p>
          <p>Our base business grows next year. We've de-risked of course now a lot of the Pluto foundation project with respect to the execution component of that. Pluto will begin adding production as we've said from late first quarter next year and will add production and cash flow to those assets, those cash flows already regenerated by the North West Shelf and the Australian Oil business units. So we're poised here for a step change in our revenue stream and a very positive one here for Woodside. Of course, our Tier 1 LNG growth options include expansion at Pluto, Browse and the Browse project and also Sunrise. We do have large equity stakes in these projects. We're actually &#x2013; we're pleased to be in that position. It's a good place for us to be at this point in their development and that of course opens up additional options to us as we move forward through that development phase. Through a very disciplined approach and of course very robust processes within Woodside we will deliver value from the growth options over both the medium to long-term.</p>
          <p>Of course, the quality of our LNG growth options won't have us ignore other opportunities outside of LNG which can provide further value and enhance our portfolio. Of course, Woodside is very deep in a number of core competencies and the opportunities that we're pursuing include Laverda, Cimatti and of course our Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Exploration and Development program. And of course, we're also planning to drill an exploration well offshore South Korea this year. There's plenty going on at Woodside and I can tell you it's a really exciting time in the company's history.</p>
          <p>As we look at slide 21, I've talked a lot about the North West Shelf. I think this chart speaks for itself. The performance there and the reliability really is world class by any measure and you can see how the Woodside team has been able to improve the performance of this asset over a number of years to get to that world-class performance and it doesn't just happen. It's hard work and the team's worked very hard and very diligently to get here over a period of time and our commitment is to maintain these levels. Of course our priority is to sustain safe and reliable production, and of course consequent with that we need to maintain these facilities and keep them in good order to ensure that this reliability stays with us over the long-term.</p>
          <p>And in the second half of this year, we've had large maintenance programs planned for the North West Shelf and of course we'll have concurrent shutdown scheduled for Train 5 and of course the North Rankin A offshore platform.</p>
          <p>We move to slide 22 and maximizing the value of the North West Shelf by not only continuing to deliver on performance today but also extend production into the future. We outline here three projects that are really designed to extend that production and maximize the value of the existing infrastructure hub. And as we all know, step outs from existing infrastructure is the most capital efficient way that we can develop these resources. I'll just run quickly through the projects we have on the list. Of course North West Shelf oil redevelopment, you're familiar with that. That'll extend production well into the next decade. The critical path on this is the subsea work is now complete; in fact we pulled the vessel up this week, it's out now, out on station, and we're on track for first oil in early fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The North Rankin redevelopment projects of course will unlock low-pressure gas at both the North Rankin and Perseus fields, and of course further down the track we have development of the greater Western Flank, which will also provide additional gas supply. So we have a wonderful suite of opportunities that will continue to deliver a lot of value for the joint venture in the North West Shelf project.</p>
          <p>If I can move to slide 23 though, we are more than the North West Shelf and of course we &#x2013; our Australian oil assets continue to perform exceptionally well and Lawrie mentioned some of this as we went through the oil pricing discussion. But we're often seen only as an LNG company, but take a look at the revenue chart and you &#x2013; it just reminds us how important oil is in our business. And I should point out that the large green slice on the pie chart represents all of our oil assets, including North West Shelf oil and our share of Neptune in the USA. As Lawrie mentioned, we continue to sell cargoes at very attractive pricing benchmarked off Brent, with the Greater Enfield area a real standout performer for us. Our strategy here is to maximize value from the existing operations, and we're doing that in a very diligent way while we manage decline in these field areas through the normal activities that you would expect, the infill drilling and nearfield exploration, and of course that provides the most cost-effective tie-in opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>I certainly do see a strong continuing role in our business for oil, especially as we have new opportunities like Laverda and Cimatti coming into the portfolio. And of course beyond this we are continuing to pursue other attractive exploration targets.</p>
          <p>Well I talked to slide 24, guys, but we need to talk about Pluto. Of course let's talk about Pluto because Pluto is very important for us. We did announce a revision of our cost and schedule forecast on June 17. Of course, our first cargo now is estimated for March 2012, and of course commensurate with that the project costs have risen. While it's important for us to focus on the near-term challenges, of course with LNG projects as we know, it's also very important to take a long-term view because there's considerable value generated. And of course Pluto is and remains an attractive project underpinned by very solid 15-year sale contracts and of course we have some uncontracted volumes as well, which gives us opportunity to expand.</p>
          <p>If I can just reflect on Pluto, I think it's the first time I've had a chance to talk to the group about this; it really is a world-class project. It's adjacent to existing infrastructure. It's in an environment that we understand well and it is poised to provide a <mark type="ph" /> sure change (21:41) revenue stream for Woodside for many years to come. I must say I'm very pleased to have it in Woodside's portfolio.</p>
          <p>As we move to slide 25, how's the Pluto development going, and I'll put some numbers up here to remind us how this journey has gone and what we have remaining in front of us. And as you can see from this slide, our 2P reserves have increased over time. This has been positive for us with creating value for Pluto and of course have increased since FID, and quite a significant increase.</p>
          <p>I've listed the first half milestones on this slide, and of course good progress is being made. And of course over the ensuing months the focus is really now on commissioning the onshore LNG plant and first and foremost ensuring that we have a safe and reliable startup with our first cargos estimated for March, as I said.</p>
          <p>I'd like to move now onto the other growth opportunities we have, and of course I mentioned Pluto Foundation Project is a world-class asset and provides a cost-effective platform for us for expansion and we're seeing that in the examples I showed on the North West Shelf. So our expectations is similar opportunities will be captured for Pluto, of course. And of course we're progressing the business case for those expansion options. We haven't reached a decision point yet on ordering long lead items for expansion trains.</p>
          <p>And of course those expansion options we've talked about previously include both equity gas and other resource owner gas. On the equity side, we continue to build volumes, but we just don't have enough yet. But we do have additional work in our work programs and that's scheduled for us later &#x2013; through later this year and into next year.</p>
          <p>On the other resource owner discussions, they are active. I can say they're maturing and we are pleased with the progress of those particular discussions. As we move forward and then have a look at the other major growth projects, firstly at Browse, of course aside from Pluto we had Browse and with the FEED studies on Browse commenced at the beginning of this year and as you know we have a strategy of ensuring we get the lowest possible cost on Browse by having multiple FEED activities occurring. The FEED studies plus environmental and fuel development approvals are progressing in line with expectations, but I must say we do recognize the Browse schedule is a challenging one. It always was and we remain very much committed to being ready to take FID in mid 2012.</p>
          <p>With regard to Sunrise, we are actively re-engaging with government stakeholders on Sunrise. Of course as we talked previously, Sunrise is an attractive project. It's a very good project in many, many aspects. All of the joint venture partners are aligned and it provides significant benefits for all of our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>On slide 29, as we look at pursuing opportunities in our exploration program, we talked about our foundation business but of course we need to open the aperture and of course the most cost-effective way of providing organic growth in the business is through an ongoing and well-balanced exploration program for us. We continue to be committed to our exploration program and expanding our portfolio to make sure that we bring additional growth opportunities into our growth portfolio.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned previously, our leased drilling rigs will be busy again in the second half of the year. Those re-contracts continue through as you can see on the chart into 2012. We'll be continuing to explore for gas in the Carnarvon Basin and also we'll be drilling two exploration wells at the North West Shelf together with additional wells to support potential development of extensions at Laverda. Internationally we've talked about the Gulf of Mexico, but we'll also be drilling our first exploration well in South Korea and as I've mentioned Innsbruck well in the Gulf of Mexico. The message here for us though on exploration is we will only pursue opportunities that makes sense. The key here to look, be selective and value-add as we go through those opportunities.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 30 and in summary, it's really all about value. We have a clear strategy and a clear focus on delivering long-term shareholder value. As we've seen in the presentation so far, we have a very strong underlying business with real capacity &#x2013; real cash flows and real capacity for growth.</p>
          <p>Despite the recent fluctuations in global markets, we continue to focus on the things we control and execute them as well as we possibly can. We are committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to our investment to maximize, deliver and capture value from our existing business, pursue our LNG growth options and of course the select opportunities that we've talked about.</p>
          <p>I sincerely thank you for your time today and then we'll hand it over to you for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good day. First question on Pluto 2, previous management has spoken very confidently about securing the necessary gas volumes and then reaching FID by the end of 2011. I hear what you're saying; you don't have <mark type="ph" /> quite (27:30) enough gas yet. But given the materiality of this growth option to Woodside, I was wondering whether you could give us some guidance about exactly how much gas has been discovered, or at the very least a range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mark, thanks for the question. The &#x2013; as far as &#x2013; what I can tell your in here is that we're moving through the program of capturing gas resources for an equity train at Pluto. We're close but we're not quite there yet. We want to make sure we really do focus on value when we capture those resources. So we're not simply chasing gas for gas sake. We want to make sure each and every decision that we make really truly does add value and is economically justified in its own right. So that's the focus we have. We are close; we do have a program that we are committed to. As I said we have the rigs in place and the wells planned. So we'll continue to work through that but we're just not there &#x2013; quite there yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What does close mean? How much gas do you actually need for Pluto to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How much gas is going to depend on the development options that we eventually decide on Pluto too, because it also depends on where we get that gas from. As you know, some areas are in deeper water and require higher development costs of themselves. So we don't actually have a threshold number that we have in mind. What we're doing is we're working through each of the opportunities and as they get aggregated into that pool then we're looking for where that trigger might be for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just further on that, with the six remaining exploration wells you talk about in the Carnarvon to be completed by the end of first quarter 2012, how many of those are exploration wells as opposed to appraiser wells and also are they all located in the same area, that central hub, or some of those wells in another hub, in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:28) or other areas?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, they're mainly focused on the central hub area themselves so they're &#x2013; while they're exploration wells by definition of course, it's in a play that we know well and of course, there's no new plays that we're pursuing here. Those are plays that we know well.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Peter. Two areas I wanted to concentrate on, cost and then on Pluto. What's Woodside's plan for retaining staff post the bonus lockings you've got this year and what extra cost do you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, that's a good question of course. Woodside finds itself in a very competitive position in the marketplace these days in a number of areas, not just in people but also in other aspects of our business with respect to supplies and so forth. I'll be very frank with you; we really do welcome that competition. I think it makes us sharper as an organization. It really puts us on edge and really makes us focus on the contributions that people are making to the results that Woodside gets out there. You're correct. We do have a retention plan that matures late next year and of course, as you would expect, we're reviewing our options on that plan as we are that total remuneration package. I can't tell you what cost impact that has at this point of time because we really just haven't got to the point yet where we've made decisions on that. But of course, our focus is on continuing to deliver value. So my expectation is that anything that comes out of that sort of a package or program, whatever we replace it with, will be really driving productivity and efficiency in the organization so that we see offsets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And on Pluto, your North West Shelf Train 5 graph showed a four-year build up to reliability. Is this how we should be thinking about Pluto as it comes on-stream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's &#x2013; it's another good question. What I would do is, I would say as we look at Pluto and look at the learnings we've got from the other trains &#x2013; and of course you may recall Pluto is a look-alike to trains four and five. We took those loans across to try and minimize the risk that we had in the construction and commissioning activity and then also to ensure that our people had the requisite knowledge and experience in this type of an LNG train. And LNG trains are not LNG trains, they have &#x2013; all have their unique quirks and so we've tried to minimize or reduce that particular risk as we move forward. What I can tell you that we're doing is we're working very hard to ensure we have all the pre-commissioning completed. We're going over and touching every piece of equipment on Pluto to ensure we have a flawless startup. My expectation is we'll get up to reliability numbers like we're seeing on the North West Shelf very quickly and we'll incorporate that in our production guidance that we give later in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much of the $14.9 billion budget now for Pluto is to accommodate customer delays? And the second part of that is in the original $12 billion budget, how much contingent will be net budget originally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you don't mind I'll hand that across to Lawrie to answer.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sandra. Obviously our commercial arrangements with our customers have to be confidential and so for that reason we've chosen to roll the number into the $14.9 billion so that we can preserve that confidentiality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the original $12 billion budget, how much will continue to be in that budget, Lawrie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I don't want to talk about the specific contingency amount, but I will say is that through all of our projects we budgeted an appropriate level of contingency for the maturity of the project at that time. So with all of our estimates, the estimates become fine-tuned as the project approaches FID.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what's your best case scenario of when Pluto could actually come in and start production? March is probably the expected case; what's the best case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I was kind of looking at Lawrie to answer that; that might have been an interesting one for us. As you know what we're doing is we've done a number of milestones that we need to meet. We've reorganized ourselves on site, both internally and also with our major contractors. I mentioned also we're touching every piece of equipment to ensure that we do have a flawless start up and we get up to reliable operations quickly. I would tell you the schedule is still challenging while we build some contingency into the schedule, which I think was appropriate given all the balancing and competing factors that we had. It's still challenging so where we are today, we're on target to meet the guidance we provided and I really am reluctant to provide anything different to that, because we've still got some way to go.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a quick question on Xeres-1A, you've delayed the decision to flow test that well to later this year. Is it still intended to flow test that well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Gordon, Xeres is back onto our well schedule. As you may recall, we moved off the Xeres-1 well. We &#x2013; during the drilling of that particular well, we had some pretty difficult sea-stay conditions out there, including 8 meter swells, and what we found was we were seeing movement at the well head that concerned us. We did some technical analysis and determined that we could not get or go into the next phase of the program without understanding the impact that that may have had on the casing that was supporting the BOPs. So we chose to move off that well. We actually cut and retrieved that casing. We drilled the 1A. We still saw the movement though and determined that we needed to come back after we completed our metallurgical studies and then also calibrated some of our external and internal engineering computations on that. What I can tell you as we've done that is good news. In fact we found no fatigue, cracking, or concerns with the integrity of the casing. So we took a very conservative approach but we think an appropriate approach given the fact that we were &#x2013; the next phase of the program was to enter into an extended well testing phase which would have brought hydrocarbons to the surface. So I'm pleased with where the organization got to in the alignment we had here. We will get back onto the well as I said later this year. It's in the program for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and just with respect to your Gulf of Mexico strategy, you sold some Shelf assets, mainly gas production and not that material, but is that a signal in terms of further actions in the Gulf? And I noticed today you've highlighted a deepwater well that you'll be drilling so I'm little bit confused as to the future direction in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would read that as just simply us reviewing our portfolio and looking at the assets in our portfolio that may be worth more to others and that &#x2013; the sale of the shallow water Shelf opportunities provided us an opportunity to monetize those assets I think at the right time for us and when there were people out there who were looking for those assets. In the deepwater itself we're committed to our deepwater program. In fact, our Gulf of Mexico operations provide us a wonderful window into those activities and also allows us to partner with some of the very significant joint venture partners around the world and provides us a window into a major oil hub in the world, which is Houston. So we see Houston as strategically important for us to maintain a presence there. We see the Gulf of Mexico deepwater as a program that will continue to add value for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Lawrie, just on the PRRT, that appears to be much lower than what the market expected at $16 million. You mentioned a deferred tax liability adjustment; can you just explain why that's so different from the first half in 2010? Just a little bit more detail, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Gordon. If you remember, back in 2010 we had an adjustment; it was a negative adjustment to PRRT. It's associated with taking on the U.S. functional currency for the first time. That amount, I think we would have disclosed in our underlying profit calculation, but it was around about $90-odd million, right, and so our total PRRT expense for the first half of last year was $115 million and a lot of that was due to that once-off adjustment. So obviously in 2011 we don't have that once-off adjustment and so the resulting number, the resulting expense is about the same. Having said that though, I think one of the reasons why the market perhaps has overestimated our PRRT expense is just the impact of augmentation, augmentation being the uplift of our cost. So when we have an uplift, we treat that as a permanent tax difference, which reduces our tax expense for the period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly just on CapEx, it's gone up 22% from your prior guidance for 2011. A lot of that's Pluto; the Pluto CapEx has gone up $641 million. You've announced the project costs had gone up by $900 million. Is it fair to say that $259 million is the cost of meeting your contractual commitment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gordon, to be honest, I don't have the previous guidance sitting in front of me, so I'm not going to attempt a reconciliation. But it's true that exchange rate fluctuation has had a reasonably significant impact on our full-year estimate for CapEx. The Pluto hasn't changed &#x2013; in terms of the Australian dollars, it hasn't changed much at all with the increase in expenditure for the project overall, mostly shifting expenditure out into 2012.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering if you could tell us when you're targeting FID on the Pluto expansion. I'm guessing it's not this year anymore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Matt, as we go back and we talk about Pluto expansion of course, there're a couple of things in there that have unknowns in them. Exploration programs, as you know, it's always difficult to pick winners. You &#x2013; it's a probabilistic basis and you go through that in a very measured way. We want to make sure we maintain the right balance in that program of risk versus investment for us as we move forward. So there are scenarios that I could put you to that are earlier or later. I'm really not going to be driven by calendar year end date; what we will really need to be driven by is when will we have created enough to really get value out of it and when does it commercially meet our hurdles and make sense for us to pursue?</p>
          <p>Now, it's not just about equity as we talked. We also, as I said, are in active discussion with other resource owners. So we've not just got a single bullet, so to speak, on this one. We are looking at other opportunities as well. And as I've said, the discussions there are maturing; we're pleased with the progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you don't really have a target at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm not going to get set by date targets because as I've said the key here is you've got to work through your program. The message, though, is we have a program and the program's very clear to us. We have the rigs. We're going to drill the wells and when the discovery volumes are &#x2013; meet our hurdle rates, then we'll make those decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In the &#x2013; I think it was in the last quarterly you said that outcomes from drilling was only one part of the business <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:27) needed for confidence toward long laid items, what else do you need there and how's that going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the message there was there are many components as you go through those business cases and pull them together of course. One is the outcome from the drilling program, the other one is what equity position you want to hold in it and then of course what the final development plan may look like and whether it justifies its own train or whether it comes in in another way. So really what the message was there as we're considering these growth opportunities, we're really looking at the full basket of things to bring forward before we line up and say yes this is the one that truly does create the most value for Woodside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just relate what you're saying on what equity levels you want to take at Pluto, with funding potentially Pluto expansions and Browse, if you approve those in the next nine months, what are you looking at there as far as what equity stake you could take <mark type="ph" /> in all the (44:43) project? Because I imagine that's going to be $30 million based on current equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As I mentioned during the presentation, we're actually very pleased to have the equity positions we do currently hold in those projects at this point in time. And of course if we can go back and remember, Woodside has a great foundation business that has us very well cashed up, and as we've said Pluto will continue &#x2013; will start contributing to that in a very material way early next year. So we are cashed out, we have a good balance sheet and as Lawrie's talked about their profile is a good one as well. Having said that, we do recognize the challenges of these major projects as we line them up, and of course we're going to use all of the options available to us to see what's the right path for us and what's the right mix of debt for us and what's the right mix of equity as we carry that through and what other value options we may get out of equity. We're not simply trying to manage cash in that point of view. We are an oil and gas company. We recognize there's other valued equations &#x2013; value opportunities that need to come into that equation as we look at how we match that development profile up. But fundamental to that though, even in the base business, our balance sheet is going to get very strong next year and we do have a very strong revenue stream coming on and we're really pleased because that provides us lots of options and it allows us to do the right things at the right time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then one last one if I could, just on Cimatti, since you've delayed a potential production of that by a year or two from the previous &#x2013; the full year report, just wondering what, why that is and whether you're still planning a tieback through Enfield and what sort of project development you're looking at.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just a few questions. Firstly, Peter, you mentioned Pluto a world-class project, but obviously the execution has been a bit disappointing. I just wondered what your take is on sort of the issues that have plagued it and how you get confidence that Woodside has the ability to execute technically on say a mega project like Browse going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think those are interesting questions for the industry. I would go back and challenge you. I think &#x2013; or challenge the description. We set ourselves a very tight target on Pluto and we made that commitment very clear when we first went to FID that some of the execution timing and so forth were really going to put us into best-in-class type areas. So the execution we've seen on Pluto is certainly not out of range and I would suggest to you, with everything going on both within the oil and gas industry and also the resources industry in Australia, the execution has actually been very good. Having said that, we didn't meet our expectations and of course that was a challenge to us and it's one that we are feeding back into our organization and our learnings and making sure that as we look at execution not only of expansion opportunities but also of Browse that all of those learnings will be back in. And that's across the board and we think we've developed in our FEED process for Browse a recognition of the risks that we saw play out at Pluto and we're trying to ameliorate those risks as we go through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And can I just follow on from, I think it was Mark's question earlier about the Carnarvon drilling program now being mostly exploration wells? My understanding was actually it was mostly appraisal wells. So I just wondered if that sort of changed, what does that suggest? Does that suggest that even with good results from the appraisals that it wouldn't have been enough to get you to an equity train and therefore you need to find some new wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we may be moving around with definition of exploration and appraisal in the Carnarvon and as I mentioned we're drilling now in plays in the Carnarvon. And so we're not really stepping out into what I would call real Greenfield exploration type programs. As we look at it, we do have a mix in there. There are two appraisal wells in the mix. So it's not just exploration alone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And does a Pluto expansion have to follow straight on the heels of the commissioning of a Pluto foundation in order for the economics to stack up or do you have the capacity to delay it a bit further, man down the site and man it back up later when you decide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're referring to the economics of the Pluto foundation project, the Pluto foundation project we evaluate on its own. We don't need expansion opportunities to come to pass on Pluto for Pluto to be accretive on the bottom line for us. So if I can kind of isolate and &#x2013; say look, the Pluto foundation project itself is a positive contributor to Woodside. With respect to expansions, of course expansions will, as I've said, they'll occur when we've met all of the investment criteria that we've established. We don't see any issues at all with timing and debt and so forth. The reality is it's &#x2013; the connections between those would be difficult to maintain even where we stand today.</p>

          <p>Okay. And so last question. I got the impression from your predecessor that Woodside was working closely with Shell trying to do something about the remaining stake that they own. Are you able to comment at all on &#x2013; are you still taking a proactive stance there and trying to take place that <mark type="ph" /> self-strategic (51:25) buyer or what sort of role Woodside's actually taking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if I can handle that in two parts, I'll handle the first part and then I'll hand it over to Lawrie. But firstly, on the relationship with Shell, the relationship with Shell is an excellent one and it's a very collegiate one. It's one where we both recognized the strengths that Woodside brings and also the strengths that Shell brings to that relationship. So I would tell you as I sit here today I find that relationship a very complementary one to Woodside and it's one that has been a positive one for us on a net basis over the years. So we're very much looking forward to maintaining a strong joint venture relationship with Shell. I'll let Lawrie talk about some of the shareholding components that you're asking.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason. I think as we've said earlier we have engaged with Shell on their 24% ownership, but we've always qualified that and said we have to all note that these are Shell's shares and Shell alone will make decisions about how they regard their shareholding in Woodside going forward, and so I can tell you that there's nothing new that I can or should report at this time.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of John Hirjee with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. My question is on Browse, and Peter, as you mentioned this is the first time we've had a forum with you. So I just wanted to get an understanding of &#x2013; in the context of this project being such a significant project for Woodside in expenditure and certainly in execution wise, what you think or you're thinking about current rate of return that you would want from a project like that given the amount of capital you will need to commit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, well the rate to return, we have a set criteria for the rates of return that we expect within Woodside, and Browse will be no different to that. It'll get tested against a range of economic criteria, but we do have minimum return or hurdle rates that we set for ourselves and of course the challenge to the Browse team is to execute in a way that we meet those hurdle rates. So there's nothing special for us about Browse. We're not moving those hurdle rates and you really do need to be disciplined so that over a long period you're able to evaluate all of your projects looking through the same window or lens. You start moving criteria and so forth at certain points in time, it really doesn't hold you in good stead. There's lots of other moving parts on a project like Browse as you know that we need to manage and so we keep those economic criteria stable over time and what we do then is run a set of very robust scenarios against that to test the robustness of the economic outcomes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So given you're waiting on how much it'll cost you given the tenders are out there, if you find that that economic rate of fill is not achieved, what are your likely options? Would you look at other concepts that for example bring it back to the North West Shelf?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd go back firstly and just talk about the Browse resource itself, and then of course there's remaining opportunity for us to hopefully increase the size of that resource. You may be aware we're running some surveys already &#x2013; seismic surveys to bring better clarity to the development particularly of Tarosa. The point I would make is it's an excellent resource. It's in a part of the world that we know well and that we can execute with respect to the process that we're currently in. As we all know well, FEED is a very well defined process. It's kind of like we've got our ticket for the train. We've jumped in the carriage and we will get to the next station and then there will be a natural decision point for us as we get those costs in. Now we'll get an early read on that; that's the way we've designed the process for us so as we go through the next few months we're going to get early indications of where those costs are heading, but of course as you would expect we also are very diligently looking at opportunities where we can pull costs out of the existing development concept. So we're not just simply about saying okay, I buy the ticket and I go to next station and then I make a decision. No, we're monitoring this very actively and we actually have a process where we're looking at all of those investment decisions right now and really testing and challenging each one of them incrementally to ensure that they do pay their way. So I wouldn't suggest at all that we're looking at &#x2013; we're moving away from that path at this point in time. What I'd tell you though is obviously we're monitoring that very closely as you would expect for a project of this size and its importance to Woodside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One final question then, Peter. In the context of the ability to handle the Pluto expansion, Browse, and possibly even the Sunrise, do you think you have the human capital within Woodside to be able to execute on all those three projects all over a very similar timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wouldn't that be just a great problem to have? Seriously, we're putting a lot of thought into that. These are real challenges. We talked about the balance sheet challenges and how we'll handle that. We believe we have some good strategies in place to do that and we're maturing those strategies. Similarly on the people front and the capabilities, as I mentioned earlier in the call, Woodside does have a very deep bench of technical capabilities. We are very deep in LNG. On a worldwide basis, we're, by any measure, a world-class operator both in size and in performance. So we have a deep bench to draw upon. We're actively hiring a lot of people now already and the organization has been growing. Having said that, we know we're going to be challenged, but I think the best thing is we do recognize that's a challenge and so we can put plans in place to deal with it. But we're out there and we're realistic; we're out there in the marketplace with everybody else. But as I'll go back to, we have a wonderful core and that core has got a lot of learning already embedded in our processes and systems. So I'm confident we'll get there and whatever challenge we put to the organization, we're going to meet it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the Australian Financial Review. Look, Peter, I just wanted to ask about the synergy slide. I think you talked about selective new opportunities that Woodside would look at. Just wanted to clarify whether that you're talking about opportunities that are in your portfolio already, or whether you've just got something external there even given what you've got going on with the various projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Angela, as we look at the company and then the timeline of opportunities that you need to have to continue to feed a company the size of Woodside, and as we all know by any measure now, on a world scale we're a large independent. So that requires us to continue to feed that opportunity pump for ourselves so that we can maintain the selectivity that we need in the portfolio to make sure we choose to do the right things at the right time. Our strategy's always to really keep focused on that base business to make <mark type="inaudible" /> (58:59) a bit pumping out the returns that it has, but just as importantly the messages are there that Woodside is not necessarily a linear company. As I mentioned, we have a very deep experience base, very deep competence. We know Australia, we operate here well. That should provide other opportunities. Woodside wants to position itself as a partner of choice. I believe we have an offering that's an exceptional one and very <mark type="inaudible" /> (59:25) and that's the space that we'll be operating in, so what we're simply saying there is we need to continue to feed our opportunity funnel and as we move forward we need to develop the capability and competencies to capture those opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the movement there, I may have mentioned is &#x2013; I'll be meeting with the Timor-Leste Government in the not too distant future. And I'm hoping for the establishment of early relationships we can get a dialog going again between Woodside and the Timor-Leste Government to really understand where we have differences. I'm not saying though &#x2013; we've always got to go back and say what do we agree on between the joint venture partners, the Timor-Leste Government, and the Australian Government, and of course that is that Sunrise is really a good development. It's one that we all want to develop and it's one where we all see that there's value to it and the physical structures are in place, the joint venture structures are in place to allow that to happen. Where we have a stalemate at the moment is of course around what each of those stakeholders believe is the right development option for them. And we have some obligations under all the treaties and the licenses that we operated to bring forward what we believe that the joint venture is going to add more value based on the criteria <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:01:10) we'd continue to follow that. What I need to do as the new CEO of Woodside is to establish a relationship with the Timor-Leste government, a relationship where we can have a good open and frank dialogue and that's what I'm committed to. And as I've said we already have plans in place for me to visit Timor-Leste in the not too distant future.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning gentlemen. Peter, just a question on the LNG market and marketing progress. I note in the report to shareholders there that you believe LNG market growth out to 2025 will be something in the 4% to 5% range. I think the last report to shareholders had the figure nearer 6% so I'm wondering whether there's a view by the company that the outlook for the demand for LNG is tinted a little or might be it's just a little more conservative but nevertheless if I type that figure and then look at the last six projects, the sanctions, it just appears that the market is well missed through to about 2017 or 2018-ish, and therefore I just put it to the company what expectations it has about what the market opportunity is for a Pluto Expansion and the Browse in terms of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look I'd go back to the basic premise that the right projects will get into the market and always there will be a buyer for the right projects when they come along. Of course the gas from Pluto or Pluto expansion is gas that's attractive to a wide group of buyers and they're buyers that were very familiar to us, so as we look at some of those expansion plans of course gas is not gas. Some of it's different, has different values and of course we're a conventional LNG player in every respect of the word. That technology is well known, our capability is well known. So we expect that'll give us a leg up as we're talking to the buyers, so I don't have any concerns at all about that and it's certainly not a discussion that we've had within Woodside.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, as we look forward and we start to talk about what's happening in the broader marketplace, of course we don't see any change in that demand profile and particularly as we see continued growth through China. Of course a lot of our LNG is going into Japan but they're very, very solid buyers and have been very creditworthy as you know over a long period of time in Japan. Japanese buyers continue to have a large interest in Woodside's product offering. I believe there was a group of pundits probably said prior to March of this year that there may have been some sloppiness in the marketplace post 2017.</p>
          <p>Our discussions with buyers and around the area would suggest that that sloppiness or uncertainty has tightened up and I think there's a lot more certainty in the market as we move forward and I would even suggest to you there's potential upside in this market as we foresee the full flow through of the Fukushima issues and how sovereign governments deal with that over time and I don't believe we've seen all of that yet. We also are seeing other pulls in the system. You're seeing a proliferation of our <mark type="ph" /> re-gasification (1:04:42) terminals now around the world, both in South America or Southeast Asia or Europe and of course the U.S. to a lesser extent and of course those terminals now are moving us into a more fungible market and you're seeing LNG trade move around the world quite significantly. So we're actually, rather than I would say being constrained, I would say the market's moving to a more fungible type market. And as we see economies around the world change, there's sucking up the production and that's then coming along with our shipping as well, so all the elements, both the nature of the contracts, the term of the contracts, the shipping themselves and the relationships with buyers are all pushing us towards more fungible, more flexible markets over the mid-to-long-term. I think that's good for Australia and I think that's good for the LNG product that we're putting out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter, and just one follow-on question, which relates to some &#x2013; I mentioned maybe before about perhaps looking at select opportunities. I guess an observation I'll put to you is that the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:48) base is very concentrated into a couple of big projects, big equities, <mark type="ph" /> all of them would consider growth (1:05:57) if they work, the risks in an uncertain world are that if it collides or if they don't work, you're exposed. I just wonder whether the company's postulating broadening of the asset base whether there are certain geographies or jurisdictions the company would like to be in and whether there's a view that the product market mix needs a shift and in particular whether or not the company's looking at unconventional gas opportunities which seem to be sweeping the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look, I would say we've had a good look at ourselves and we understand what we do well. We understand what our full competencies are and how deep we are in those. We're in a fortunate position that in the conventional LNG market in the world, we have a competency that takes many, many years to generate and develop. We were one of the first LNG companies out there and we've been operating for a long period of time, both operating and building trains, so I would put that, that we really understand what we do well. We also operate FPSOs, which are complex pieces of kit. We've drilled most of the deepwater wells in Australia, in fact the deepest deepwater well in Australia. So we have other competencies in our tool kit that we really don't talk about a lot and we'll continue to talk about those. So as we look forward and we saw how do we balance the portfolio and what risk do we have in execution and so forth, what I can tell you is we're very mindful of that and it's something that we're actively looking at to make sure that we manage our way through to continue to deliver the shareholder value and growth in value that we're committed to delivering.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Peter, one of the growth areas you haven't really talked about is Bilby populations at James Price Point. My understanding is the work that you've had to do in preparation for an environmental assessment has already been submitted. Can you comment on what this might mean in relation to perhaps the process for environmental assessment and also in the shorter term, the demand sort of being made that activity at the site stops?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me put that back into context as I can. As I mentioned before, and I'll keep coming back to this, Browse really is a world-class resource, and it's one that we have certain commitments that we need to deliver on and we're focused on delivering those commitments. Now it's not just about what we deliver, it's how we deliver it and fundamental to Woodside and to the core of our operations and our people values is the fact that good signs and appropriate signs and consultation with community and others drives our decision processes. And so as we talk about some of the challenges that we've had at James Price Point, I suggest to you that they're challenges that we're well positioned to work through and I think we just need to move forward on that. We have the right organization, right people in place. We really do understand it and we are sensitive &#x2013; more importantly, we are sensitive to it. We're going to take our time to do it right.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have an execution plan already in place at Browse, as you know. We have geotechnical survey work underway on the site itself. That geotechnical survey work is progressing. We got off to a late start on that due to some weather and other delays, but we're catching up very quickly and that geotechnical work is important to our fleet progress.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, there is a strategic assessment review underway and so environmental approvals are one of the approvals that will need to have in place, but that's very similar to 20 other permits and approvals we have in place. So we don't expect there to be any undue delay in pursuing through those approval process. Of course it will take a lot of consultation and it takes a lot of work, so I don't want to in any way give an impression that we don't have a lot of work to do. We do, but we are stopped up and we're already on the ground up in Broome and here in Perth working on these.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter. I've got a really quick follow-on from Angela's question on Sunrise. I'm just wondering if you can comment on whether part of establishing or reestablishing that relationship with the Timor-Leste government would ever involve putting the option of on-shore processing back on the table. Is that something you'd consider or is that definitely off the table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's too early for us to move away or even have discussions around a different development concept for Sunrise. It just starts to cloud discussions and confuse. The real thing here for us is, we as the joint venture really do believe that we have the right development concept that's consistent with the requirements we have, which is good oilfield practice. I think before we start going down a path of saying my idea is better than your idea, the first thing to do is, let's establish a relationship, let's establish one where we really can sit in a room together and really thrash out some of these issues. And as I said in my earlier answer, I firmly believe there are far more things we agree on than things that we don't agree on and if we can really get back and say look, guess what, we actually agree on eight or nine out of 10 things, we've just stuck on this last one. And we knew the circuit breaker. What I want to do is go and listen to the Timor-Leste government. I really want to understand their concerns because there's really no value in me just blindly putting different opportunities around and trying them around and bringing rocks without really knowing what the issues are. So I want to understand it, that's why I'm going into the country, that's why I'm going to meet with the Prime Minister.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter, and thanks for giving the time. Just a quick one. Obviously the skill shortage and LNG boom and construction boom and <mark type="ph" /> WA to running steam (1:13:29) for the government and the industry. Previous management showed a real sense of urgency with the drilling program and capturing third-party gas for Pluto expansion. With <mark type="ph" /> Whitestone (1:13:40) targeting it for a deal later this year and Gorgon progressing, how are you factoring that into your thinking and how important are the actions and other players over there and the timing as perhaps choosing to go with third-party gas over waiting for equity de-risking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, it's a good question and it's one that is first very front and center on our considerations as we move forward. What I would tell you is until one path naturally stands out as being the best option to us we're going to continue to pursue all options, but there definitely is a tug on resources over here. There's a tug on footprints and available contractors and people and so forth. That's just being heightened by the activities on the East Coast notwithstanding the weather issues that Queensland has had but now also the resource activities over there, combined with the resource boom that's happening here in WA. What I tell you, I just come back to the core for us. Woodside has almost 4,000 people. I think we often forget that. We are a substantial company. So while these are real challenges, we have contractors who've worked with us for a long period of time. We have an excellent history of industrial relations up in the <mark type="ph" /> Pilgra (1:15:00). We have an excellent history of working with the community. So we don't underestimate the challenges but the reality is, I think for us, to sit and say we can pick one versus the other at this point of time is probably getting outside of the realms of our ability to forecast things, but we are preparing ourselves. So I would tell you, it's on our radar screen and we're watching that and we're developing strategies to manage thought that.</p>

          <p>Just finally, before I give a summary, I think we I had a question on Cimatti and what is the resource size. It's in the 10 million to 15 million barrel range and of course it's 100% Woodside. That's right, that's a 100% number, I should say.</p>
          <p>If I can just go back and talk about the messages from today, of course you can see the results speak from themselves. The performance in the first half has been excellent, it's really being built off our foundation business. So the strength of that underlying foundation business, I think, is obvious to everyone. I hope we were able to get across during the presentation how hard Woodside is working on that business to maximize the value from it and really preserve it and continue &#x2013; more importantly, continue that business into the long term. So it's a not a business that is in decline, it's a real business and one that's going to stay for us for a long period of time. Of course we're on the cusp of bringing Pluto online. We do have a good plan, we are well organized and we do have the right resources in place to get Pluto Foundation Project up and running. We are fortunate that we have a good suite of opportunities in front of us with new developments. We've talked a lot about expansion of Pluto and the value that brings. We've talked a lot of Browse and Sunrise and then of course we've also talked about our commitment to our ongoing exploration program and ensuring that that remains robust.</p>
          <p>I will come back and I will continue to come back to the point that we're an organization that's focused on value, an organization that's focused on delivering and an organization that's focused on positioning ourself as a partner of choice.</p>
          <p>We have a truly wonderful world-class offering and Woodside I think is poised now to really make a step change in our businesses as we move into the future. So with that as a final sum up, I'd also like to thank you for the quality and the insight in the questions that you posed to Lawrie and myself. That's a very helpful insight for us as we understand what's important to you and you are very important to us.</p>
          <p>And I want to make sure that we have an open dialogue, a dialogue that's frank and a dialogue that's based on a mutual respect. So again, thank you for that today, guys, and we look forward to catching up with you in the future.</p>
