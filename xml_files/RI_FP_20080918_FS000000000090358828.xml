          <p>Just a reminder, I'd like to ask you all to turnoff your cell phones and your Blackberries; quite simply because that improves the link for those of us &#x2013; or for those of you should I say, following the presentation online.</p>
          <p>Patrick Ricard, Pierre Pringuet and Emmanuel Babeau will present Pernod Ricard's accounts at June 30, 2008. The presentation will last about 45 minutes. It's been online since half seven this morning, the slides and all events. And after the presentation, as is now the custom, you will be given about 45 minutes to ask whatever questions you'd care to raise. That should bring us up to about half past ten.</p>
          <p>Something new this year for those of you following us online, you can also ask questions. What we'll do is we'll begin with three questions from the auditorium here in Paris and then give the floor to those of you following the presentation online. We'll keep alternating between the two of them.</p>
          <p>Without further ado, let me give the floor to Pierre Pringuet, who will begin the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not Pierre Pringuet, Patrick Ricard just for 30 seconds to explain to you that I'm practicing for my future situation, I will not be making the presentation myself. I leave that to Pierre Pringuet and Emmanuel Babeau.</p>
          <p>So, as far as I'm concerned, I am very satisfied with the results for the financial period just ended and that I would be very happy to have the same results for the next financial period. Pierre Pringuet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick, for your trust and your satisfaction, which I believe is fully justified. Now when you see this series of figures on the slide, with the net sales up 9%, profit from recurring operations up 13%, this is organic growth on a like-for-like basis; plus the net profit from recurring operations up 8% and net profit, that's attributable net profit, up 1%.</p>
          <p>As you will see this includes all exceptional expenses that have already been incurred through the acquisitions of Vin &amp; Sprit, so when you see that series of figures, that series of very impressive figures and the group's performance, Patrick Ricard, you're perfectly right to be satisfied about our performance but may I remind you that just a year ago when we were in the middle of the sub prime crises a lot of people were being &#x2013; were very negative about the financial period just starting. Well we explained that there was no reason not to be confident I think that we've proved &#x2013; we've been vindicated.</p>
          <p>Okay and how has the environment changed over the last year, first of all very strong growth in emerging countries? This is a reality. And the Western markets have continued to achieve strong growth.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'm saying that the euro has considerably strengthened against most of the countries, in particular the US dollar, but sterling has weakened also. Not to mention the Korean won which has faired very poorly over the last year. I should also add that US interest rates have decreased, but there are number of uncertainties as a result of inflation raising its head once again.</p>
          <p>So what about the highlights for the last year? Obviously, the top of the list is the acquisitions of the Vin &amp; Sprit group and the ABSOLUT VODKA contract signed on the 30th of March. The deal closed on the 23rd of July, after approval from the competition authorities.</p>
          <p>Now this is remarkable growth, remarkable profitability growth in all regions, the four regions namely France, Europe, Asia and the rest of the world, and finally the Americas. The growth has been strong, very strong as you'll see shortly.</p>
          <p>We have also further increased our expenditure in advertising and promotion, A&amp;P as we call it, and Pernod Ricard in its sector is certainly the group that is investing most and growing its A&amp;P expenditure most for the whole sector. So, we are really paving the way for the future. That is one of the hallmarks of the group.</p>
          <p>Finally, the final highlight I'd say is a continued reduction of the group's debt.</p>
          <p>So, post balance sheet events, what happens since the end of the last financial period? Well, first of all, excellent news, which exceeds our own expectations, that is the taking back of ABSOLUT VODKA's distribution in the US and in most worldwide markets as of the 1st of October next.</p>
          <p>This is as a result of the discussions we've had with Fortune Brands, but also with Maxxium. Remember that for Maxxium we've felt it would take about two years and for Future Brands the contract was to extend up to 2012. That's excellent news and we'll be telling you more about the consequences in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>We've also sold Cruzan to Fortune Brands, we'll be telling you why and another important event since the end of the last financial period is the strong appreciation of US dollar against the euro. In fact in two months it's covered as much ground as it did in the previous 12 months. In fact we are actually right back where we were 14 months ago.</p>
          <p>Now for further details of all that I'm going to give the floor to Emmanuel Babeau our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pierre, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let's begin with our consolidated income statement. Just a brief look at it, just to show you the very positive trends that we've achieved over '07, '08, you'll see that net sales was up 8.7%, that's organic growth, and our bottom line that is profit from recurring operations rose 13.4%, again organic growth.</p>
          <p>This means that we generated a further five percentage point growth between our net sales and our profit from recurring operations. Despite the fact that we increased our A&amp;P expenditure by 12.3% and if you compare that figure with what our competitors have done over the same period, you will see that our A&amp;P expenditure rose much faster than that of our competitors. Now that is a luxury which shows that we are able grow our products very rapidly while continuing to invest and even increase our investment in advertising and promotion expenditure.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange and structure effects first of all, currency exchange, the impact was almost a negative 300 million on net sales mainly ascribable to the US dollar, but as Pierre said also due to the sterling, the Korean won and a number of other Asian currencies, which had a negative impact on the period. As for the impact of foreign exchange on profits from recurring operation, that was a negative &#x20AC;106 million.</p>
          <p>We were still penalized by the scissors effect when the dollar weakens against the euro because the position on our sales is bigger on dollars than our costs in dollars, which has a very adverse effect on us when the dollar strengthens as has been the case over the last two months. Of course that would be a very favorable effect this time around.</p>
          <p>As for structure effects, while the effect on net sales was a negative &#x20AC;104 million, the impact on profit from recurring operations was only a negative 11 million. This is because we either discontinued or disposed of non-profitable activities, co-packing in particular with our Lawrenceburg facility in the US. We discontinued our production agreement though and a number of our Spanish brandies as well that weren't performing particularly well, to say the least, and a wine brand called Canei, thus of course had a negative effect on profit from recurring operations.</p>
          <p>Now I was given the opportunity to talk to you in some detail about net sales at our last conference call in July. So I'm not going to go into the &#x2013; I'm just going to mention very briefly, very strong growth of 9% over the period, organic growth at &#x20AC;6.589 billion. Now really developed sales in three areas in particular, first of all in the emerging countries, 22% organic growth in '07, '08 in our emerging markets, which contributed over half of our top line growth.</p>
          <p>The top 15 brands, we are focusing more and more on our top 15 strategic brands with the exit of Stolichnaya and the arrival of ABSOLUT, data will change slightly in'09 but our top 15 grew 11% over the previous period. And the third area of growth is premium spirits, again very strong organic growth of 14% of our net sales. Premium spirits actually outperformed the average of our top 15.</p>
          <p>Because of all that, we were able to reap the benefits, because net sales also include the implementation of our value strategy that you know for many years with the sharp price hikes. We have improved our pricing power on the premium brands, and of course we also have improved the mix in a number of brands.</p>
          <p>Now because we can grow both our value and sales, you'll see that '07, '08, was particularly good in that respect, because with volume up 5%, sales were up 11%. Because of the positive mix and prices effects, we have more than doubled the growth of our volume &#x2013; or with our sales should I say &#x2013; with the top 15. That was also true last year, but the gap was only 4% between volume and value, or volume and sales if you prefer. So we have been working even more &#x2013; focusing even more on price in the '07, '08. So, the value factor will be something we will continue to focus on in the years to come.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to dwell on the extraordinary growth chart we showed you at the end of July. I'll simply mention the number of brands that achieved double digit top line growth, Chivas, Ballantine's, Martell, Malibu, Jameson, Havana Club, The Glenlivet, Mumm, Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t. So we achieved double digit growth at almost all our top 15 brands. '07, '08 was in fact an outstanding vintage for Pernod Ricard in terms of the business growth.</p>
          <p>So strong sales growth, of course, but just as importantly, we have coupled this with strong growth of our margins. '07, '08 was a remarkable year in this respect. If you look at our gross margin after logistics, costs totaling &#x20AC;3.766 billion, as a percentage of sales, that is 57.2% compared with a ratio of 55.7% the previous year.</p>
          <p>Now at constant currency rates, that's factoring out the dollar that would have been 57.6% in other words our gross margin would have been 2% more by comparison with the previous year. 2% of 6.5 billion all else being equal is &#x20AC;130 million additional operating income &#x2013; operating profit, which is almost a year's growth target for Pernod Ricard. So this is an area in which we can considerably improve, boost our profits.</p>
          <p>Now it's important to grow sales and increase margins, but without jeopardizing the future, so when we can, we also energetically increase our advertising and promotional expenditure, A&amp;P, as we call it. Over the period we spent almost &#x20AC;1.2 billion on our brands. As a proportion of sales that was almost 18%.</p>
          <p>If you compare that with the previous year and the percentage of the sales in the previous year, and indeed with the figures of our &#x2013; most of our competitors, you'll see that we have put a lot into A&amp;P and grown our A&amp;P expenditure more than the average of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we're focusing on our priority brands, the top brands, top 15 and of course the emerging markets where we believe there is upside potential. This is where we have increased most of our A&amp;P in '07, '08.</p>
          <p>Okay strong top line growth, a good margin growth part of which was reinvested in advertising and promotional expenditure. This all led to a big increase in the contribution after A&amp;P expenditure. Organic growth of our contribution was 10.4%, up to two &#x2013; to almost &#x20AC;2.6 billion, as a percentage of sales that rose from 38.6% to 39.4%.</p>
          <p>If you look at our figures over the last four or five periods you will see that this ratio has continued to improve. Year-in, year-out we have constantly improved our contribution after A&amp;P as a percentage of sales. That is a major trend.</p>
          <p>Structure costs, which in our growth model is probably the area where we have made the least spectacular improvement in '07, '08. At constant exchange rates, you'll see that structure costs as a percentage of sales only increased from 16.1 to 16.2%, factoring out currency exchange that would have been 16%. So we haven't improved as much as in previous periods, because we had to put a lot of effort into the emerging countries. Our structure costs increased 13% in the emerging markets, whereas elsewhere our structure costs were well contained and not exceeding 5% overall growth.</p>
          <p>This leaves us with profit from recurring operations of 1.5 to &#x20AC;2 billion. As a percentage of sales that is 23.1%, that's our operating margin and at constant currency rates that would have been &#x20AC;1.628 billion. Again as a percentage of sales that would have been 23.7% compared with 22.5% in '06, '07. That's an improvement of 120 basis points, again, a strong trend and of course a good combination of good stronger sales growth and good margin growth as well.</p>
          <p>If we now compare the half years and see what the trends are from one half year to another, you see that yes, of course, our sales growth was not as strong in the second half year. Organic growth of sales in the second half year, 7% in second half year, over 10% in the first half year. But the dynamics were very similar.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin after logistic costs rose 200 basis points in the first half year, but also rose 170 basis points in the second half year, so a very comparable trend. We significantly improved our A&amp;P expenditure as a percentage of sales, up from 16 to 16.9% in the first half and in the second half year this rose from 18.4 to 19.2%. This leads to profit from recurring operations that also rose quite significantly and quite similarly from one half year to another. 25.3 to 26.7% in the first half year, 19.1 to 19.9 in the second half year. So the dynamics are the same very, very similar from the first half year to the second half.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to the geographic breakdown of the performance. As you can see, all regions have contributed to growth in '07, '08. As you can see Asia and RoW, the rest of the world, have been the two main contributors. But Europe and France have also contributed to the growth and significantly, so emerging countries wherever they maybe in Europe, in Latin America or in Asia have been the main strong growth drivers.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at Asia, rest of the world, 13% growth in sales, 18% growth in operating profit. They're too were increasing our A&amp;P expenses Martell, Ballantine's, Chivas and Royal Salute are the key drivers pushing profit forward not to forget Imperial in Korea.</p>
          <p>But in India, we also have local brands that have been very successful. Royal Stag, Blenders Pride, we're looking at very strong growth rates. And that helps us prepare the opening of the Indian market, which is taking place and imported brands are going to pour in.</p>
          <p>Americas, sales growth 8%, profit from recurring operations up 18%, A&amp;P expenses grew faster than sales in the Americas, too. There are some favorable structure effects there. Chivas, Jameson and Malibu were the top three contributors to growth in gross margin, and there was an increase in the operating margin that was particularly significant over the period.</p>
          <p>Europe, a fine year in Europe and we clearly decided to significantly boost advertising and promotion mainly in Central European countries. You see that there's a very slight increase in profit from recurring operations over the sales from 24.2 to 24.4% for that reason, 7% topline growth.</p>
          <p>But we figure that Central and Eastern Europe are fast growing zones and that deserved significant stepped up investments. In Europe, the key brands that contributed to growth, Chivas, Ballantine's, Jameson, Jacob's Creek, Havana Club, but we also have local brands that are doing very well, Ararat in Russia, for instance.</p>
          <p>Finally France, a fine year in France and a fine year; it hasn't been the case in a long time. You see the sales were up 5%, gross margin jumped, we're happy with that. We did not reduce A&amp;P to achieve 11% profit growth. And the main growth drivers in France are the whiskies, all whiskies including top level whiskies and champagne. If you combine that with curtailed structured costs, you'd get the performance here that we're very happy with and that France had not experienced in a long time.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the geographic breakdown. As you can see our operations are well balanced between the various regions. Obviously, following the ABSOLUT acquisition, America will be a little bit larger. I did say a little bit larger, but we are well-balanced in three key regions; Europe, America and Asia, with similar shares as you've seen.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to financial expense and debt. For '07, '08 we have an expense margin of &#x20AC;360 million for net financial expense on our debt. That's a 4.8% average cost of the debt. We have &#x20AC;17 million in other expenses, 11 million ascribed to depreciation of banking commission paid for the implementation of the Allied Domecq syndicated loan that no longer holds and we had other banking expenses, but all that is behind us now.</p>
          <p>Our debt, well, our debt dropped from six billion, 515 million to six billion, 143 million. Let's take a look at the breakdown of the reduction. Free cash flow, &#x20AC;315 million, which is well below what our normal free cash flow should be in, and I'll come back to that in a minute and explain to you why such is the case.</p>
          <p>Disposals, acquisitions, financial assets and pension funds &#x20AC;277 million for that, &#x20AC;115 million that is the payment to the pension funds. &#x20AC;18 million of that are ascribed to guaranties pay to Fortune Brands in the acquisition. And there are various acquisition expenses 20 or so million euros including the acquisition cost for <mark type="inaudible" /> which Ricard acquired. Then you have dividends and acquisition of treasury stock &#x20AC;71 million there, so you have the dividend on the one hand and you have further proceeds from the sale disposal of treasury stock. And you have forex of course as you've seen in our P&amp;L, we were hit by the weakening in dollar, and it has a very favorable effect on our debt actually. So on a whole, net debt over EBITDA has significantly improved from 3.9 to 3.6.</p>
          <p>So the &#x20AC;315 million in free cash flow, sharply down from the &#x20AC;650 million we had previously, and well below what we &#x2013; what you'd expect from the historical Pernod Ricard scope, i.e. &#x20AC;750 million. There is a clear reason. I'll give it you, as you can see. Take a look at working capital requirement, &#x20AC;533 million. It's not normal at all. Most of &#x2013; &#x20AC;400 million of that is ascribable to the huge effort we made in '07, '08 to replenish stocks of <mark type="inaudible" /> brandy to face up to future growth on the market.</p>
          <p>Cognac and Martell, of course, we're responsible for that but we also replenished our stocks in whiskies, Scotch whisky, Bourbon and all whiskies. Also we increased our stock in champagne and so on. So we spent a lot on that, &#x20AC;400 million and there's an additional &#x20AC;50 million which is ascribable to normal working capital requirement growth. The difference between receivables and payables and there are technical effects too that are related to Stolichnaya and that are one shot obviously.</p>
          <p>Now if you exclude that, if you come back to what is more normal, regarding Pernod Ricard's working capital requirement, we'd be looking at &#x20AC;700 million, over &#x20AC;700 million in free cash flow generated by Pernod Ricard.</p>
          <p>For the coming year, '08, 09, let me be clear about this, mark my words, we've made the bulk of the effort now and now we're going to be very pragmatic and depending on which way the market goes. We're going to continue to adjust our stocks if necessary, but nothing comparable with the effort I just described.</p>
          <p>A word about our pro forma net debt as of the 30th of June 2008, as though the ABSOLUT acquisition had taken place over the period, had that been the case, our debt as we mentioned in the summer conference call would have amounted to &#x20AC;11 billion, 875 million. All this is calculated with $1 58 to the euro.</p>
          <p>So we knew that &#x2013; well we were expecting, you'd have plenty of questions on our debt. So we figured we'd give you as much information as possible upfront. I'm giving you the lay of the land as it were. So the debt breaks down as follows: 77% is in the syndicated loan, 20% for bonds and 3% miscellaneous. We have financing sources that are quite clear and rather concentrated.</p>
          <p>We have no refinancing problem in the short or medium term. By any stretch of the imagination, we are not exposed to swinging spreads. We have no refinancing before two years.</p>
          <p>The first refinancing we must do amounts to &#x20AC;1 billion and we must get this done by the 23rd of July 2010. When I say &#x20AC;1 billion, maybe it will be less than that. But apart from that, we're looking at longer maturity, as you can see five years primarily. So we have plenty of comfort ahead. We can focus on reducing our debt and we can sit back and wait for the markets to improve because they will improve, won't they?</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at how the debt breaks down according to currency, 42% of the debt is carried in euros, 57% in dollars, so that's the pro forma breakdown on the 30th of June 2008 based on $1 58 to the euro. So if the dollar were to strengthen against the euro, the share of our dollar debt would increase.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the way the debt is structured. Here you have a clear break down; here you have the variable portion of our debt. You have various currencies; you've them in the left hand column. Here you have the floored and capped debt in the middle column and on the right side; you have the fixed rate debt with a currency break down.</p>
          <p>So this gives you a detailed grasp of our exposure to any possible hike in interest rates, which is fairly unlikely in the short term. And you also see what kind of exposure we have should interest rates decrease regarding the floored and capped debt, to give you an order of magnitude for the euro we're anywhere between 3.8 and five, so the floor is at 3.8 , 3.84 and caps around five. Regarding the dollar, the floor, well it depends on the maturity, but roughly it's between 2.5 and 2.8 and the cap for the dollar is around four.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a look at the net debt with regard to the euro to dollar a parity we did crunch the numbers just last night, focus so we're giving you all these numbers with $1 42 to the euro, so if we were to take a look at &#x20AC;11.9 million in debt we'd have $12.6 billion based on those numbers. Clearly, as we'll see later on, there's the positive effect on our operating profit.</p>
          <p>H1, the first half is not where we reduced the debt because we're paying out the dividend also you have the seasonal rise in working capital requirement due to yearend sales. And on top of that in the first half of the year we will pay compensation to Maxxium and Fortune Brands. We're paying Maxxium on the 30th of September and the proceeds from the 25% stake sale will come in &#x2013; kick in in March.</p>
          <p>But in the second half through strong cash flow generation because there's this asset disposal program that will help us considerably reduce our debt. We intend to push our net debt or EBITDA ratio down. We want to be between 4.5 and five on the 30th of June 2010, after two years time, that is to say, and around for after three years on the 30th of June, 2011 and we'd like to confirm that based on current rates. Our cost of our debt is roughly 5.2% for fiscal '08, '09.</p>
          <p>Further, profit items &#x2013; small profit related items and corporate income tax we used to be at 22.5 now we're at 22.2%.  There were a few improvements in Spain, and Italy, and the UK.</p>
          <p>So I'll speak about tax, let me speak about tax on non-recurring items, we have &#x20AC;39 million influx. So there's a &#x2013; there's some deductibility in here; we'll have some tax saving. So the rights of third parties, this is the share of the profit described to our minority partners; Havana Club, Corby, &#x20AC;29million in '07, '08 for that. And all this gives us attributable profit up roughly 8% on a like-for-like ForEx basis. It would have been &#x20AC;967 million, i.e. up 16% which illustrates the group's performance over fiscal '07, '08.</p>
          <p>8% growth in net profit recurring operations, this is on a per share basis. We sold off some treasury stock as I mentioned. And alI told there's a slight rise in the number of shares that you have to take into consideration when you calculate EPS. I think the figures are fairly explanatory here.</p>
          <p>At the AGM in November we're going to offer a 5% growth in dividend reflecting our bottom line growth and reflecting that our leveraging ratios are high and in the coming months our &#x2013; one of our priorities is debt reduction.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring items now, first of all, other income and expenses &#x20AC;81 million, broken down as follows &#x20AC;26 million of restructuring costs, these costs are ascribed to sales teams and back office teams in certain countries, where we may be a little bit overstaffed. We've also streamlined commercial structures and some industrial restructuring, a number of things in that item therefore. And this is what actually helps us constantly improve our margin. We constantly improve wherever we can.</p>
          <p>Another major item is the Vin &amp; Sprit acquisition as you can see roughly &#x20AC;110 million in expenses over the year including &#x20AC;35 million for the early termination of the Stolichnaya distribution agreement. And &#x20AC;54 million in income due to excess stock &#x2013; excuse me, provisions, pension fund related and this is of course non-recurring.</p>
          <p>On non-recurring financial expense here you have &#x20AC;12 million due to the final depreciation of the Allied Domecq syndicated loan that was closed on the 23rd of July, and since there were &#x20AC;12 million in structuring costs that had to be depreciated; that we just wrote that off in closing the books in '07, '08.</p>
          <p>Now if you take all that into consideration and if you take Vin &amp; Sprit, which has nothing to do with our performance, we're looking at &#x20AC;840 million, a 1% on growth and growing our profit when we have the V&amp;S cost and it's very negative forex impact, illustrates a fine performance that we enjoyed over the year.</p>
          <p>Pierre, I'm going to hand over to you for the conclusion and outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Emmanuel. As we were saying earlier on, a year ago I told you on when the subprime crises emerged that, we were quite serene about our future. I would vouch that our ambitious goals but does that mean that we are, I'd say we are taking a very factual approach, very realistic approach to our outlook as we did last year.</p>
          <p>As for '07, '08, I'm not going to go back over what made the year a remarkable one, I'd simply say that the group's fundamentals are very strong, be it in terms of the brand portfolio, the distribution networks, the control procedures and system, the management system, which is based on the spirit of entrepreneurship in our management, which is something that is very, very strong. I think the first people to react are always the country managers, depending on the situations that arise. What about the prospectus for '08, '09? I think we have to acknowledge that the general environment is more difficult then the one of a year ago.</p>
          <p>That said we are still witnessing a strong growth in emerging markets. This is a proven trend. That said growth is not as strong elsewhere and of course the situation is quite contrasted from one country to another. For example, Spain is currently in recession, economic recession and of course the consumption of our products is also on a negative trend.</p>
          <p>The UK is in a more variable situation. The on-trade market is quite difficult but the off-trade market isn't really fairing too badly at all. As for other countries in Europe we're doing very well. Consumption in France is quite good, just like in Germany, Greece or other countries I could mention.</p>
          <p>Another aspect of context in the consumer market is that there is less pressure in terms of advertising and promotional expenditure. This is something we've weighed up. Of course if we wanted to defend our share of voice, we have a certain degree of latitude in terms of downsizing or maybe not growing our A&amp;P, not as fast as in the past and that is a very important variable, a very important lever to be able to act on, because we invest quite substantially over 1 billion in A&amp;P.</p>
          <p>Few words about currency effects and structure effects, we have looked at our models and based on the current exchange rates, as of yesterday, shall we say the dollar at 142. On that basis the currency impact would be positive for the traditional Pernod Ricard group. The impact would be a positive 30 to 40 million on our profit from recurring operations as Emmanuel said earlier on that works both ways, when the dollar strengthens against the euro, it improves our free cash flow and our profit  from recurring operations.</p>
          <p>But just to adjust your calculations, may I remind you that Vin &amp; Sprit's profit from recurring operations, which was based on the calendar year '07 at &#x20AC;252 million. Again the dollar was then at 137. At 142 that would have been &#x20AC;235 million. And I think with that information you can now calculate future developments.</p>
          <p>As for the Group's structure effect that will be negative, a negative impact of approximately &#x20AC;60 million on profit from recurring operations, largely due to the discontinuation of Stolichnaya distribution, another few minor aspects such as Canei and Spanish brandies, which accounted for a very small proportion of this negative impact. We can talk about that later if you want.</p>
          <p>That said and that was the really good news of this summer. It wasn't altogether a surprise for us. As you can imagine, we had been working actively on negotiations with Fortune Brands and Maxxium with a view to exiting the distribution agreements we had with them.</p>
          <p>Now this had an immediate effect, namely that the synergies had been appraised more accurately at a 150 million. We said 125 to 140; we can actually confirm 150 million in synergies that will be achieved much more rapidly than expected.</p>
          <p>We expected them over a four year period. We now expect at least 50% in financial '08, '09 and the full effect of these synergies in the 2009, 2010, financial year, same scenario as with the Allied Domecq where we reached 100% of the synergies in the second year.</p>
          <p>This is quite simply because we have recovered the margins that were paid to third parties, when you take back distribution, while you are talking back margins, which generates immediate cost synergies. We expect strong sales development of ABSOLUT VODKA. The brand has been stable or better in the US market and is achieving double digit growth elsewhere in the world.</p>
          <p>Finally, a technical aspect concerning ABSOLUT sales, we are taking the Maxxium network sales for the period from the closing of the deal on the 23rd of July to the 30th of September, which is the last year we'll be working &#x2013; sorry the last stage, I'd said we'll be working through Maxxium. So the sales would be directly realized by this network.</p>
          <p>As for the first quarter of this year that we'll be commenting in a month's time &#x2013; now we're already working on calculations, but what we can tell you is that the first quarter will be affected by a number of elements.</p>
          <p>First of all the fact that our first quarter in '07, '08 was particularly good also for technical reasons, remember that in the first quarter we were up 12%. So 12% growth we feel was very strong. So we're comparing our first quarter this year with a very, very strong first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>We expect lower growth in the North America. The environment is more difficult, particularly, in the credit market and if anything stocks are being downsized. Remember that the US market with its three tier system, between wholesalers and retailers, is a market that's carrying a lot of stock. More stock than any typical European market like France where most of the sales are through large distribution channels.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we're not increasing prices the last year &#x2013; as we did last year and of course sales rose last year. In Asia, we will not be implementing any price increase in the first quarter for Martell. There was price increase in the first quarter of '07, '08. And I think we made a mistake in one area, we were convinced that that Chinese Olympic Games would be a festive period, where people would consume our products. On the contrary they stayed at home, watched their televisions and people do not drink Chivas or Martell when in front of their televisions at home. So this had a negative effect, certainly was way below our expectations.</p>
          <p>Now all this leads us to tell you that for the first quarter, we expect moderate top line growth. Now we've taken out our dictionaries to see how that is translated. But it's what we're calling low-to-mid single digit growth, low-to-mid single digit growth. We haven't found the perfect translation for that in French, but low-to-mid single digit growth.</p>
          <p>What about our guidance for the full year? And this is of course based on the environment as it stands today. So providing there is no serious deterioration of the economic environment, and when I say a serious deterioration, I'm talking about a systemic crisis, or a major financial crisis. But that's not the scenario, that's not hypothesis we worked on. Now baring a serious deterioration, all things being equal as well we expect the year to &#x2013; year as follows.</p>
          <p>First of all concerning, what we call the old group, that's not including ABSOLUT. For the Pernod Ricard group &#x2013; historical group, we expect organic growth from &#x2013; or profit from recurring operations to be about 8%, so strong dynamic growth.</p>
          <p>Now with the integration of Vin &amp; Sprit and of course, the strong growth of ABSOLUT VODKA, plus the fact that the synergies will be generated quicker than expected; because of that we can target double digit growth of our net profit from recurring operations, that's attributable to a net profit from recurring operations. This is at constant currency rates, constant interest rates. So our objectives for the year are ambitious, but they're realistic, they are calculated on the basis of the situation, the economic situation as it stands and that brings me at the end. Thank you. And you now have the floor for questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And back to the level of synergies expected. You're really in the higher end of the bracket and achieving those synergies earlier than expected, but I gather these are costs synergies. Could you tell us what we can expect to take into account in terms of top line synergies as a result of the integration of ABSOLUT? Secondly, I'd like to come back to your strategy as regards value and improvements of the mix and the prices. If there are no price increases in the US and there are only limited price increases implemented in Asia, with &#x2013; notably in the case of Martell. What are we to expect of the volume mix and price developments over the next year, of the year coming? Finally, Emmanuel talked about the gradual opening up of the Indian market. Could you tell us a bit more about the situation as you see it now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, concerning the synergies, I'm not sure it could be entirely called cost synergies, because there are also downstream margins that ABSOLUT distributors generate worldwide. And we will be integrating the distribution of ABSOLUT in our networks. So, there's not just cost, but commissions that were paid to Future Brands for the restructuring in Sweden. But we also have downstream margins and additional sales harnessed as a result. This is all included in the &#x20AC;150 million.</p>
          <p>As for revenue synergies, or net sale synergies, we expect greater dynamics in countries where ABSOLUT is providing us with greater on-trade access, and of course elsewhere thanks to our clout, we can, I think pave the way for ABSOLUT. With acquisition, it's impossible to quantify this type of a greater access to markets. So, the &#x20AC;150 million are not strictly just cost synergies.</p>
          <p>As for the value strategy would you like me to answer that too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Please do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Value strategy, as a value of sales.</p>
          <p>Okay, this year we will be more watchful about price increase policies. There were a lot of price increases in the second half year. Big one last March in Asia, which will really only producing its full effect in '08, '09. So without any new price increases you can expect a big increase, thanks to the full year effect of the previous price hike. That will be the full year effect on the value of sales and sales growth where we expect a higher value increase than volume increase. We plan to improve our margins broadly speaking over our portfolio in '08, '09.</p>
          <p>a</p>
          <p>Concerning the Indian market, I don't think there's any particular event that actually characterizes the market. I would say that what we called additional taxes that had been abolished. This has increased our share considerably. That is an improvement. These factors are nonetheless still high.</p>
          <p>What we've seen is that in India, the middle classes are becoming wealthier. The middle classes are more and more numerous and they consumer premium brands in all areas, in spirits of course. But I think quite obviously India is conducting negotiations either bilateral or within the WTO [World Trade Organization] with a view to opening up its market. It has become a necessity. We see this in the &#x2013; reflected in the sales of Chivas for example, which is a highly reputed brand in India, where the volume of sales is constantly increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give you an order of magnitude, Chivas should exceed the 100,000 cases mark this year, but our growth is in excess of 50% it's a very strong growth. Okay, we're starting from a very low level, but we expect a very strong growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> If you could just clarify a few points, and one or two questions. First of all, the increase in net profit, you expect this year; as I understand this is at constant currency rates. When you talk about double digit growth of your attributable net profit, you usually give us your guidance at constant rates, could you quantify the variance between the two. What would your expectation been had currency exchange rates been constant? With regards to synergies 50% this year, the full benefit from synergies next year. Is that at year-end or do you expect 75, the first year, 150 the second year? Could you be more specific?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've thought we've been very clear, but apparently not. But I will clarify that for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally concerning currency exchange mechanisms &#x2013; okay, we are well familiar with the dollar situation. But sterling has quite an impact on your accounts. Could you elaborate on that? What proportion of your costs are in sterling and just help us understand that part of the mechanism, if you would?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, concerning attributable net profit, we felt that so far as we've come such a long way since last year's exchange rate to work on current exchange rates, rather than constant exchange rates. So I haven't calculated anything at constant rates, but I think when I give you the figures at current rates that will enable you &#x2013; particularly as you know the currency impact for the previous year, you'll be able to calculate the impact on financial expense will be. I think you have all the information you'll need in the presentation.</p>
          <p>In the terms of synergies, yes, 75 and 150 million &#x2013; 75 million this year, 150 million next year.</p>
          <p>And your final question was on the impact of currency &#x2013; sterling costs. Rather than give you a wrong answer, I'll get back to you. I won't give you the proportion of our costs in sterling, but I will try and give you more information on the impact of sterling, it's nowhere near the impact of the dollar for instance. A much smaller proportion of our costs are in sterling, but we also have substantial profits in the UK, which offset the cost base. So we have the costs in sterling sure, but we also have the profits of Pernod Ricard UK, which offset these costs.</p>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sanford Bernstein, two questions please. The first one to the extent that you can say have you seen any underlying trends in terms of a reduction in consumption in China? Or is it primarily these special effects? And the second thing you can say that given the environment and less pressure in advertising and promotion, you will be looking to grow &#x2013; the rate of growth will slow. Last year advertising and promotion went up 3.6% faster than sales. Do you think it will come down more toward sales or that you're actually maybe even lower than sales this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning China, as regards the earthquake in Sichuan and then the Olympic Games, yes, they were events that drove consumption down at the time of these events. And not just for the Sichuan region but elsewhere as well. There was a temporarily less consumption if only out of solidarity at the time, but as for the more fundamental trends in the market, well, our perception of the market is that whiskey is stable and that the brandy market is still growing. They are the two major trends, the two major hypotheses on which we have based our expectations of China.</p>
          <p>As for A&amp;P expenditure, what we've said is that in an environment, where there is less pressure on advertising and promotional expenditure, we have more leeway, more flexibility, more room to maneuver as regards downsizing, or should I say at least reducing the growth of our A&amp;P expenditure, not saying we're reducing A&amp;P expenditure. But we have more leeway than in the past. That means that we will be able to adjust our A&amp;P expenditure in accordance with the sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding China, Pierre, mentioned the two important categories of products but there are two emerging categories. Wine, which includes champagne, it's a small market but a growing market and secondly vodka, which could well be a big market. It's already on the move. There's a lot of potential, which could offset the stability of the whiskey market.</p>
          <p>I think we'll now take questions from people following us online, but I would like to point out for those of you who are following us online, this is not a webcast question. The questions are channeled through a telephone number that was sent to you when we sent you the invitation. The first question is from the Ian Shackleton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>We have first question from Mr. Ian Shackleton from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian Shackleton from Lehman Brothers. I'll be very interested in getting a little bit more insight into your plans for the ABSOLUT brand particularly in the US over the next 6 to 12 months and particularly, how you're going to cope with the number of flavors in the market and what your intentions are vis-&#xE0;-vis pricing on ABSOLUT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly regarding flavors, ABSOLUT's strategy is implemented by the ABSOLUT Company, which is the brand owner, headed by Ketil Eriksen, former CEO of this business. Within Vin &amp; Sprit and who knows the brand perfectly well. He has a remarkably good team working with him. We were struck by the quality of this marketing team and as a result we have renewed our confidence in them.</p>
          <p>As for the flavor strategy, they will decide if they will market more or less and how they will roll out that policy. As for the price strategy regarding ABSOLUT, I believe that in an environment, will probably be more difficult there will be no ambitious price increase policy in the US, but there will certainly be no discount strategy. We're very, very careful about the fact that ABSOLUT is and must continue to be a premium brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>We now have a question from Mr. Simon Hale from Dresdner Kleinwort. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Simon Hale, Dresdner Kleinwort. Two questions, if I can just following up on Ian's question on ABSOLUT. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about recent trading on the brand, perhaps outside the US, what sort of depletion rates the brand's been seeing in some of the markets. And also how you're planning to move pricing outside the US. You've commented on the US.</p>
          <p>And while we're on ABSOLUT should we be expecting to see any stock left in-trade when you come out of Future Brands and the Maxxium system on the 1st of October? And what are you thinking about the stock levels looking into Q4 of this calendar year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, can I just go to your guidance of 8% organic profit growth. I'm just trying to understand &#x2013; it looks pretty cautious against the backdrop of let's say 9% top line growth in the year just reported. You're still talking about seeing the full annualized benefits of price increases. You're talking about slowing A&amp;P growth, positive mix coming through from emerging markets. So I would expect gross profit to edge forward.</p>
          <p>Should we be expecting a really substantial fall in overall volumes globally? I'm just &#x2013; could you give me some flavor as to what organic top line growth you're looking for, for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Emmanuel will take the second part of that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Simon, I'm not going to give you any top line guidance. I think Pierre's already explained the general context within which we have set this objective, or set this guidance if you prefer. I think we'll stand back a bit from the market and take it as it comes. We don't really set ourselves unachievable goals. This figure is a reflection of something we're comfortable with, if I can put it that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Concerning ABSOLUT, first of all the non-US markets. Well you know all the panels, I think it could be said that the trend is very positive for ABSOLUT in all markets. And when you look at the sales volumes and sales value you will see that there is no pressure on prices. On the contrary, sometimes quite sustainable price increases have been implemented, so all in line with our approach to premium brands. As for the levels of stock in the US market, I can tell you straight away that the situation is extremely healthy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from <mark type="inaudible" />. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Two questions if I may. First question is on the price mix last year it was 6%. Well, for the coming year of course you can say nothing really on the mix because that depends strongly of the demand growth. However what are your plans, on average globally to do in pricing?</p>
          <p>Second question, I'm not completely satisfied with your statements on the A&amp;P. Can you be more specific on that? How you have analyzed &#x2013; how you've come to the conclusion? How the analysis is that your A&amp;P will not have to grow anymore so strongly? Is it because that &#x2013; it's because of benchmarking versus competitors? Maybe you can give some flavor here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning A&amp;P, I'm going to say what I've already said, I'm going to say it very simply. Put it differently, we have seen &#x2013; and you can ratify this if you read the panels, that is that there's a tendency for less growth or even a reduction in A&amp;P expenditure on consumer goods in general. I haven't given you any guidance concerning our A&amp;P expenditure. All I've said is that in a context where there is less pressure on advertising, we have leeway that we can reduce the A&amp;P expenditure growth, that's not a guidance. I don't think that I can be much more clear about that.</p>
          <p>Price effects, you mentioned what could we say Emmanuel, what could we say on top of what we've already said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, concerning price effects, I'm not going to give you a figure that wouldn't make any sense for the Group as a whole. But we've already drawn your attention to the fact that there already have been sharp increases in champagnes and brandies and whiskies in '07, '08. That these price increases will produce their full effect in '08, '09 because a lot of them actually took place in the second half year. So for '08, '09 we're not saying that there won't be any price increases. What we are saying is that in a more difficult environment, we feel that more realistically price increases would be more difficult to implement. And probably be closer to inflation in the various markets, however, in previous periods our price increases were well above inflation in many cases.</p>

          <p>Emerging markets and you talked about today about how the sort of impact of credit, what's sort of impact that's had on the US business? What kind of impact, is this had so far if any in emerging markets when obviously the industry has tended to move towards cash with order. And the second point, Emmanuel, just on the pension comment on a cash flow, I kind of lost that a bit, if you could just reiterate, I'm sorry I just missed it, the comment you made in terms of what contributions you made to various pension funds? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Well, first of all regarding, emerging markets and the impact of  the financial crises, maybe the financial community is in a better position than me to know what's &#x2013; what the story is, but I have come to observe this, where are the most significant exchange, or currency reserves in the world? Well, the answer is simple, China. This wasn't the case 10 years ago. And that is a fact. The crises that hit Asia in the late 90s, hit countries that did not have currency reserves. So situation was radically different. And today, as far as market trends are concerned well, things are looking very good. And that is a fact. Regarding pension funds, we paid &#x20AC;150 million to pension funds worldwide. &#x20AC;150 million that includes the UK, the US and Canada.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just two questions please. Firstly on free cash flow, you mentioned that excluding the exceptional spend on aging stock, free cash flow for the Group would have been nearer to 700 million. Could you give us a feel for how much of the 235 million of EBIT from Vin &amp; Sprit would be converted into free cash? Should we be expecting this business to be generating something in the region of 900 million of free cash flow potentially? And then secondly, on Vin &amp; Sprit, you kind of gave us the 235 million adjusted profit for 2007, could you give us a feel for what sort of pressure on that profitability increased input costs, particularly growing cost has had on V&amp;S? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Well, Chris regarding the V&amp;S impact, that's the magic of the transaction &#x2013; the magic of the transaction is that vodka generates cash, you don't have to generate stocks, there's not much CapEx. So if you have EBITDA around &#x20AC;250 million, there's roughly &#x20AC;20 million in depreciation there. So we're looking at a very strong conversion of that EBITDA into immediate cash flow. But of course we will add the synergies and the growth in operations. As for V&amp;S costs now has against &#x2013; well in 2007 there's 10 to &#x20AC;20 million described to rise in cost price. And that should kick in '08, '09, so that's an immediate impact. Its closer &#x2013; well it's anywhere between 10 and &#x20AC;20 million, probably not going to hit 20 but it's more than 10.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I have two quick additional questions. First of all, regarding what you're contemplating for structure costs going forward. You made major efforts in emerging countries already. Do you think it's necessary to make further efforts at the same &#x2013; to the same extent? And my second question has to do with your current asset disposal program. I appreciate you can't give us much information but could you gave us some pointers regarding the types of operations that you're contemplating, industrial assets? Maybe you've already sold a distillery or are you considering selling brands and wine &#x2013; how about wine in Spain? Are you &#x2013; can we expect major proceeds from asset disposals? It's about hide-and-seek basically or it's blind man's bluff, Pierre, actually?</p>

          <p>Our policy is not to comment on our acquisitions or on our disposals. We shall do so when anything materializes. Regarding structure costs well, you actually gave us the answer in your question, didn't you?</p>
