        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Conference Call of Deutsche Bank. I am your operator for this conference. Please note that for the duration of the presentation, all participants will be in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Joachim M&#xFC;ller, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning from Frankfurt. This is Joachim M&#xFC;ller on behalf of Deutsche Bank. I would like to welcome you all to our conference call on first quarter results. Our CFO, Stefan Krause, will lead you through the presentation slides, which you will find on our website, along with all other documents we issued today.</p>
          <p>Before we start, let me remind you of the cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements at the end of this presentation.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to hand over to Stefan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joachim, and good morning to everybody. I would like to highlight the following features from our first quarter results before I go into the details that you will see on the page two of the presentation.</p>
          <p>We also have a strong capital generation and increasing risk efficiency that resulted in higher capital ratios in the quarter. Solid CIB performance across all major business lines has demonstrated the strength of our global franchise, results of our focused investments and the synergies from our CIB integration.</p>
          <p>PCAM has had the best quarter ever, which reflects increased business volume in all products and the significant Postbank contribution. The integration of recent acquisitions is generating now already tangible results, with strong Q1 results across Asia Pacific, managing well through the volatility resulting from the Japanese situation.</p>
          <p>We are on track to achieve the &#x20AC;4 billion revenue target for Asia Pacific, as set out in our management agenda, Page 4.</p>
          <p>Obviously some key risks remain. The regulatory asymmetry, sovereign debt concerns, FX volatility, and the uncertainty in North Africa and the Middle East. But on this basis of these good Q1 results, we are well on track to achieve our &#x20AC;10 billion target.</p>
          <p>I would only like to remind everybody there is some confusion that our &#x20AC;10 billion target is the sum of our business division's results and not our Group pre-tax profit.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on into the group results on Page 4. I provide here the usual profitability capital balance sheet overview. I will comment on some of these numbers and ratios in the course of my presentation at different points, and therefore, I will just make a few remarks here.</p>
          <p>The pre-tax ROE according to our target definition, which in this quarter is has come down to 22%, but has been earned on a substantially higher capital base, given our &#x20AC;10 billion capital increase in the fall of last year. I would like to stress that our results are based on the continuously low level of value addressed.</p>
          <p>The leverage ratio remained flat at 23 times equity. I would also like to mention the fact that at &#x20AC;44.1 billion, our level 3 assets are down 88% of shareholders' equity, also down from 96% at year-end of 2010.</p>
          <p>On Page 5, we saw profitability once again at Deutsche Bank, and we have demonstrated our earnings power, both in terms of pre-tax profit and net income. Our quarterly pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;3 billion is above the level of the exceptionally strong first quarter of last year. On that basis, we're able to generate quarterly net income of &#x20AC;2.1 billion. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 29% and mainly benefited from the partial tax exemption of net gains following the change to the equity method of accounting for Hua Xia Bank, which I will come back to this when I talk about the Retail business.</p>
          <p>Taxes for the quarter did not include any impact from the proposed non-tax deductible German and UK bank levies. We expect our full year 2011 tax rate to be approximately 32%, excluding the impact of the bank levies.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our operating expenses. Non-interest expenses were &#x20AC;7.1 billion, and increased &#x20AC;1.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2010. The increase was mainly due to the three acquisitions we made last year. We are pleased to see that, for the first time in quite a while, G&amp;A expenses have come down versus the preceding quarter, and this is despite the fact that Postbank has now being included for three months, versus one month in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The decrease reflects some typical, mainly discretionary year-end spend in the fourth quarter of last year, but it's also a sign that our various efficiency measures are beginning to bear fruit on the non-comp side.</p>
          <p>First quarter's debt expenses were again impacted by the acceleration of deferred expenses related to career retirement rules, which were applicable to the February 2011 grant. Total impact was &#x20AC;369 million in the first quarter of 2011. Compensation ratio in the first quarter was 41%. Excluding the acceleration of deferred awards, the ratio would have been 37%. We anticipate that, starting in the second quarter of this year, expenses could be impacted by the bank levies in Germany and the UK.</p>
          <p>Let me now provide you with some more details on the cost development versus the first quarter of last year, on the next page. As you can see, the bulk of the increase, &#x20AC;877 million, was due to the three acquisitions we made last year. Other reasons were an increase in performance-related pay, as well as costs relating to the Cosmo investment.</p>
          <p>The complexity reduction program is nicely progressing in line with our plan. Sustainable savings of more than &#x20AC;150 million have already been realized. Based on the progress we made compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, and due to the further development of the program, we expect to achieve approximately &#x20AC;800 million in savings in full year '11, with a net contribution of &#x20AC;600 million to our cost base after investment spend. We're confident that by the end of this year we will have achieved our communicated target of &#x20AC;1 billion of ongoing savings per year, reaching the full contribution to our cost base in 2012.</p>
          <p>Compared with the fourth quarter of 2010, the increase in total expenses by &#x20AC;800 million, after adjusting for acquisitions, the aforementioned career retirement effect, and the non-comp cost reductions, is due to higher performance-related accruals as the first quarter saw an increase in revenues by 41% versus the fourth quarter, and the quadrupling of pre-tax profit.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on Page 8 to our capital ratio. The Tier 1 capital ratio came in at 13.4% at the end of the first quarter. The Core Tier 1 ratio, which excludes hybrids, was at 9.6%; up by almost 100 basis points versus year-end 2010.</p>
          <p>You may have noted on the slide that we are not referring to a 10% Tier 1 target any longer. We will come back to the market with a new guidance on what we think are adequate capitalization levels for the Bank, when the regulatory and market requirements have become clear.</p>
          <p>There has been some misunderstanding in recent weeks also regarding the changes we are proposing to our holding structure in the United States. Let me therefore say a few words on that topic. In order to meet new regulatory requirements in the United States, Deutsche Bank intends to partly reorganize the holding structure for its operated businesses in the United States. The aim of  such new holding structure, part of which we have put up for approval at our AGM next month, will not lead to additional equity requirements on Deutsche Bank Group level, nor does it require additional funding for the proposed second shareholder in Deutsche Bank New York.</p>
          <p>We also expect that there will be no negative tax effect as we are aligning our primary U.S. entities into a single tax grouping. We have agreed the new structure with the U.S. authorities. Let me also remind you that our client-facing regulated U.S. subsidiaries, DBSI and DBTCA, are highly capitalized systems for us now.</p>
          <p>On the following page, provides some details on the development of our Core Tier 1 capital and our risk-weighted assets. As you can see, the increase in Core Tier 1 capital was largely driven by this quarter's net income of &#x20AC;2.1 billion. Risk-weighted assets came down by &#x20AC;18 billion in the quarter, primarily due to &#x20AC;12 billion lower credit risk-related charges, including a &#x20AC;4 billion reduction risk-weighted assets related to derivatives in the Trading business, as well as &#x20AC;6 billion lending-related risk-weighted asset reduction in our classic banking businesses.</p>
          <p>The development of foreign exchange rates, obviously in particularly euro-U.S. dollar rate, impacted both capital and risk-weighted assets with only a marginal net impact on our Core Tier 1 ratio, as you can see on the two charts.</p>
          <p>We believe, and that's what we highlight on Page 10, as you know, the discussion on funding is at least as important for investors in the Bank as the capital fee. We would therefore like to point out again that the capital discussion has not negatively affected our funding advantage, both in terms of funding cost and access to all relevant funding sources.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost, we have issued &#x20AC;10 billion to the capital market in the first quarter, at an average spread of 56 basis points over LIBOR or RIBOR. We saw 40% of this volume through retail networks.</p>
          <p>The issuance activity included our second and long-awaited fund fees of &#x20AC;1 billion issued at a spread of 13 basis points, but again, being able to issue senior paper significantly tighter than CDS level, in fact, roughly 40 basis points tighter during Q1.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have gathered approximately &#x20AC;6 billion of funding from retail deposits from PBC's 12-month deposit campaign, where the influx from that continues into the first quarter. This campaign contributed to the accounting-driven volatility in our reconciliation column, which I will explain as a chart later.</p>
          <p>As a result of our first quarter funding activities, we can report that our 2011 funding plan of &#x20AC;26 billion, we have already completed 63% by the end of this reporting period. We would like to mention here as well that as of the 31st of March, we have &#x20AC;135 billion of liquidity reserves to ensure the Bank remains liquid in a stress scenario. For further details on this number and the structure of our funding sources, you can also refer to Slide 34 in the appendix of my presentation.</p>
          <p>So let's move on now to the first quarter results of our business segments. As usual, I'll start with an overview of the divisional performance. At first sight, there are three things that strike me when looking at this.</p>
          <p>Firstly, our Investment Bank has managed to achieve results which are not far short of the outstanding results in the first quarter of 2010. Secondly, the contribution of our Retail business has massively risen, even if you adjust for the one-off impact from our Chinese investment. And thirdly, the negative contributions from corporate investments and consolidation adjustments, which are not part of the results of our business divisions and therefore are not included in our &#x20AC;10 billion target, we have disclosed here separately. I will come back to all of this content going through the divisional results now.</p>
          <p>Let me start on Page 13, with CB&amp;S. In CB&amp;S, was achieved very good first quarter again, with strong performance across both Sales and Trading, and Corporate Finance, despite more difficult trading conditions in March driven by the events in Japan and the ongoing sovereign risk concerns.</p>
          <p>But I will comment on the different revenue lines on the following slides. Let me have a quick look at costs here.</p>
          <p>Costs were higher compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher bonus and retention costs, as well as IT investments supporting many of our strategic initiatives. Adjusting for these and the FX, most costs were broadly flat. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, first quarter '11 included a substantial increase in current-year bonus and retention charges, reflecting the impact of career retirement, as discussed previously. This was partially offset by a decrease in other costs.</p>
          <p>The Investment Bank remains highly focused on cost management going forward. We have also made progress in de-risking the business and increasing capital efficiency. We reduced the bespoke book in our credit correlation portfolio in the first quarter, and net monoline exposure has decreased through targeted actions.</p>
          <p>The reduction of our remaining IAS 39 portfolio, which largely relates to the Sales and Trading debt business, has made further progress in the first quarter. As you can see from the slide in the appendix, we've sold assets with a book value of approximately &#x20AC;700 million, recording a small gain of &#x20AC;80 million.</p>
          <p>Including redemptions and maturities, the overall difference between carrying and fair value came down by another &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;2.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We will obviously continue to take any opportunities to reduce our exposure to legacy assets.</p>
          <p>On Page 14, we show the revenues in Sales and Trading debt, and can report that revenues were only down 4% on a very strong first quarter last year. Improvement of RMBS and commodities partially offset declines across FX, rates, credit and emerging markets, mainly due to lower client volumes as a result of the geopolitical uncertainties, but our Client Solution businesses continued to have strong demand.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe this was a strong performance versus our key peers, particularly given that we have reduced risk further compared to the prior year quarter and have not seen a sharp decline in revenues. Please see the slide for further details on the revenue trends in the different businesses.</p>
          <p>On Page 15, I show that Sales and Trading equity revenues were flat versus the first quarter of 2010, which was a strong performance, given the declines for many of our peers. In fact, there was solid revenues from all businesses, despite high volatility in markets in March.</p>
          <p>Our equity result included again from the sale in Russian Stock Exchange, RTS. However, this was partially offset by losses during the quarter to the Japan earthquake, so underlying performance was also very pleasing. I would like to mention as well that we were both at number one in the Institutional Investors 2011 European Equity Research Survey.</p>
          <p>Let me go to Page 16. Primary business, we finished the first quarter ranked number four globally in Dealogic fees; our best ever start to a year. We gained market share in all regions and have top-five ranks in M&amp;A, ECM, in high yields, and investment-grade bonds, with particularly strong performance in cross-border M&amp;A, Europe and APAC.</p>
          <p>We played a key role in a number of transactions, including Fifth Third TARP repayment, the Hutchison Port's IPO, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Deutsche B&#xF6;rse New York Stock Exchange transactions. These are only a few of the significant transactions in which we were able to support our clients. They show our improved strength across the U.S. and Asia in how our clients benefit from the further integration of CIB.</p>
          <p>Let me now move onto GTB on the next page. GTB had a strong quarter, reflected in an EBIT increase of &#x20AC;137 million year-on-year, mainly driven by strong revenue growth across all major businesses. Specifically, Trade Finance continued to capitalize on strong demand for international trade products and financing; the Trust and Security Services profited from improved market conditions in the Depositary Receipts and Custody business. And the cash management revenues grew based on higher payment in the profit volumes, as well as an uptick in interest rates.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of the commercial banking activities from ABN AMRO made a small positive contribution in pre-tax profit in this quarter. Currently expect this business to roughly break-even for the full year. The net increase in cost versus the first quarter of last year was mainly caused by the acquisition. The interest rate, increased by the ECB, may provide further upside for interest income in GTB.</p>
          <p>So let me move now to detail. On Page 18, I start with Asset Management. Adjusted for the aforementioned career retirement effect, which was an expense of &#x20AC;33 million in this division, pre-tax profit in the first quarter was higher than in all quarters of 2010. Starting the year at this level, we expect further increases in quarterly EBIT, because the seasonality of our business that you can see in the 2009 quarter is something we anticipated to see this year again.</p>
          <p>This is due to the cycle of performance which typically come in the second half of the year. The overall business saw &#x20AC;6 billion of outflows in low-margin product, and &#x20AC;2 billion of inflows in higher-fee products; the most notable example in the quarter being the following.</p>
          <p>DWS in Japan raised more than &#x20AC;3 billion, one half thereof in the first quarter, from a new fund which offers an attractive yield pick-up for Japanese investors by offering them exposure to global infrastructure stocks. This fund is run as a White Label product in cooperation with Nomura, and combines the creativity of DWS with the infrastructure investment and expertise of risk. The net margin of this product for Asset Management is no less than 80 basis points.</p>
          <p>Overall, the net flows in the quarter expected to result in a &#x20AC;10 million positive revenue for the full year. Anecdotally, I would like to highlight that our core retirement products for the German Rister Rente has now sold more than 1 million times, with 1.1 million contracts sold by the end of March of 2011. The charm, if you know of these products, as in any of the other retirement structure, is there is a regular flow of client savings into it. If clients don't save, they lose the government subsidies.</p>
          <p>On Page 19, I show you the results of our Private Wealth Management business. Our Private Wealth Management business, including the Sal. Oppenheim venture, produced a very satisfying result of &#x20AC;116 million before taxes. This is due to the mix of good operating performance and some positive one-offs at Sal. Oppenheim.</p>
          <p>Excluding Sal. Oppenheim, revenues were up 16% year-on-year, driven by new money, market performance and a profitable shift in the asset mix. Provisions for credit losses were slightly up from a specific effect in the first quarter. We expect a normalized level to be around &#x20AC;10 million per quarter.</p>
          <p>Net new money was &#x20AC;3 billion relating to Germany and Asia Pacific, mainly. You may have noted that the numbers on this chart have been adjusted for BHF, which is due to our intention to sell &#x2013; has been transferred to the Corporate Investment segment as of 1st of January of 2011. As you know, during the first of 2011, we tried to conduct exclusive negotiations on this sale of DHS Bank with LGT, a Lichtenstein-based bank, and we regret that this transaction did not came about. Given that this transition had only been announced last week, it's really too early to now provide details regarding the integration of DHS into Deutsche Bank, which we will do then in the next quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me move onto Page 20, our Private and Business Clients business. PBC has now begun to reap the benefits from the acquisition of Postbank which, in the first quarter of '11, has been included in Deutsche Bank's consolidated income statement for a full quarter for the first time.</p>
          <p>Postbank contributed &#x20AC;221 million to PBC after costs to achieve purchase price accounting effects and minorities. The &#x20AC;78 million cost achieved in the first quarter included &#x20AC;38 million of infrastructure investment, SEB level, to prepare for the joint platform.</p>
          <p>The existing Retail businesses of Deutsche Bank also generated excellent results. One example of our distribution power is the very successful deposit gathering from Spain, which has already brought &#x20AC;10 billion to the Group since November of last year. 41% of the amount was new money to the bank.</p>
          <p>The change in the accounting of our stake in Chinese Hua Xia Bank, which we now hold as equity, triggered a net 110 gain through the P&amp;L of &#x20AC;236 million. This gain did not increase our book equity, however, as a gain had been recognized in the other comprehensive income previously, it did increase our Tier 1 capital though by approximately around &#x20AC;200 million post-tax. The ongoing equity pick-up was &#x20AC;14 million for six weeks of the quarter.</p>
          <p>As usual, in the third section of my presentation, I will now turn to some specific themes which deserve a closer look, in our view. These are the technical impact of the Postbank consolidation and how we disclose for its provision impact loan, something you know note for the future; performance of the exposure held in our Corporate Investment explains the accounting noise that was obviously substantially higher than in usual quarters in consolidation adjustments, and give you an update on where we stand with the &#x20AC;10 billion target.</p>
          <p>First, let's take a closer look on the accounting effects with the consolidation Postbank has now on our recording of credit provisions. We did record &#x20AC;373 million in provisions credit losses in the first quarter, including &#x20AC;206 million for Postbank. With regard to Postbank, it is important to bear in mind that we had to apply, at the time of consolidation, we had to put Postbank loans on our balance sheet already as fair value.</p>
          <p>Consequently, for these loans, no allowance was included in our account. As a result, any subsequent allowance releases that Postbank is booking in its standalone accounts, as a credit in provision for credit losses, are recorded in interest income in PB Group account.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, Deutsche Bank recorded &#x20AC;170 million of interest income in our consolidated account. For the first quarter of 2010, there was &#x20AC;46 million of Deutsche income. Adjusted for this accounting effect, which means that typing the other income credits to loan loss provisions, like is done in the Postbank standalone account, our first quarter provisions would have only been &#x20AC;256 million, including &#x20AC;89 million for Postbank. Please be aware that in future quarters, we will reflect similar accounting-driven effects where the provision for credit losses should be viewed in conjunction risk with related offsets in other interest income. Overall, our first quarter provision was better than normalized level.</p>
          <p>On Page 23, I show our impaired loans. As on the previous chart, I explained the accounting effect from the Postbank consolidation upon credit provisions; similar accounting is behind the increase of the impaired loans in the first quarter, which is fully explained by Postbank.</p>
          <p>Net consolidation. Again, all Postbank loans were recorded by asset fair value, and hence none was classified as impaired and none carried any allowance for loan losses. Let me walk you through this example question. Imagine a loan with a face value of 100 that was, say, 40% provided for by Postbank, and which was recorded in our books at fair value of 60. Then let us assume that the loan deteriorated in credit quality in the subsequent quarter, and additional allowance of 5 was needed.</p>
          <p>With that, whilst the loan remains as an impaired loan in Postbank accounts, the allowance increase triggered a first-time impairment classification in our &#x2013; notably the loan is included with this carrying value of 60 and about 8% allowance coverage in our accounts, while the additional allowance leads to no increase in impaired loans, but an increase from 40% to 45% in the impaired loan coverage ratio reported now by Postbank.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Postbank impaired loans came down in case previous credit concerns no longer prevail, whilst there's no corresponding reduction in impaired loans in our Group account. Consequently the coverage ratio reduced to 50% from 53% at the end of 2010, but as I said, important to mention these effects that distort somewhat our run rate result.</p>
          <p>Please be aware therefore that the risk buffer which is represented by the allowance at Postbank level booked before consolidation is reflected in lower loan values at DB Group level. Economically, basically it's the same thing.</p>
          <p>Let me now move onto Page 24, our Corporate Investments. Let me quickly give you an overview of our non-core investments. Actavis first. Despite the &#x20AC;55 million negative equity pick-up in the first quarter, we expect Actavis to deliver a reasonably positive result in 2011 after the restructuring of the firm we did in 2010.</p>
          <p>BHF has been transferred to Corporate Investments per the beginning of the year from CWN and, despite higher operating expenses in Maher Terminals due to severe winter weather, volume is showing signs of strong recovery.</p>
          <p>The results of this segment are also impacted by obviously the funding costs, policy participations, as well as the run rate cost level.</p>
          <p>Let me now go into consolidation and adjustment. Also certain volatility, obviously as you can see in our full precise, and which is admittedly very different for you to predict. This management reporting is generally based on IFRS, but there are some approved deviations from this principle where different accounting methods are tried between management reporting and IFRS in asset and liability management functions. In order to achieve IFRS-compliant Group reporting, these approved deviations are reverted in consolidation and adjustment.</p>
          <p>The most material example for different accounting methods relates to the economically hedged positions when these positions do not comply with IFRS hedge accounting requirements. In such instances, the underlying instrument is on a mark-to-market basis in the segment, thus mirroring the hedging derivative, but on an amortized cost basis under IFRS. The timing difference between the two valuation approaches is then reflected in consolidation and adjustment.</p>
          <p>The key thing to take away is that these accounting effects reverse over time, because both MtM and accrual accounting should result in the same life-to-date value for a transaction. In Q1, different accounting methods resulted in a negative impact of approximately &#x20AC;370 million. The main driver behind this was the significant increase of short-term euro interest rates in the quarter.</p>
          <p>More than 40% of the total effect was due to PBC, of which more than 50% related to term deposits, which were significantly increased following our successful 12-month deposit campaign that we launched in Germany. For the maturity of these term deposits, we expect roughly two-thirds of these effects to reverse in the current year. Another significant driver was the medium- to longer-term FX basis risk, which is due to the fact that DB rated the maturity of its funds in Europe and partially swaps into U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Finally, please bear in mind that consolidation adjusted is not included in our 2011 pre-tax profit target, and that overall, we expect it to be negative in 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me now go to the update on our 2011 target, as shown on Page 26. Understandably, the market obviously is very closely watching us on our way to achieving the well publicized target of &#x20AC;10 billion of the pre-tax profit, some of our business divisions for the full year 2011.</p>
          <p>With &#x20AC;3.5 billion for our business divisions in the bag, which is 35% of what we want to earn this year, I think we can say that we are very well on track to deliver. I would also like to point out that the pre-tax results of the first quarter were ahead of our plan for the quarter. Also, there was a negative FX impact of &#x20AC;120 million compared with the planned FX rates.</p>
          <p>We want to look for risk factors beyond FX movement, and there could be some of that. Markets obviously could develop less favor than we have assumed when we introduce the targets. Actavis was transferred to Corporate Investments at the beginning of this year; CB&amp;S will not benefit from the positive contributions we expected Actavis to deliver after restructuring in the last year in the budget.</p>
          <p>But that potential short term could at least partially be compensated by our well performing Retail business, which had a very good performance in the first quarter, even if I exclude the one-time effect from Russia.</p>
          <p>On the last slide, I provide you a summary of outlook that I'm not going to walk you through in detail. I just want to make you aware that this is some key advertising from my IR team. I want to make you aware that we have some workshops set up for CIB and PBC in June of 2011 that we hope you all can attend.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much, and I'll answer any questions you have.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi. A few questions; I'm afraid some of them more accounting-related. Just coming back to Slide 20 where you went through the accounting of your fair value accounting on the loan book of Postbank, can you just, if you may, run through it one more time to explain exactly how the booking works? And remind me of how much you have booked in terms of mark-up? As I understood, there was a mark-up from your presentation.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on Slide 25, can you maybe explain to me one more time the timing differences, how they accrue, and in particular, how this half of the &#x20AC;370 million has impacted your PBC business?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, can you run me through the Corporate Investment side, through the different assets? You mentioned Actavis should have an okay result. What does that mean? Does that mean a loss? Or does that mean it should break even for the year?</p>
          <p>Can you also talk about the other assets that you clearly have transferred over into this division? And what will happen with BHF? Will it stay here or will it be going back to your divisional numbers? And how should we think about it against the &#x20AC;10 billion target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start, Kian, with &#x2013; to answer some of your questions. Let me start on your slide &#x2013; let me go back to Slide 20. I think in Slide 20 what we tried to highlight in the Slide 20 is obviously the fair value of our loan book. First of all, what we had to do on consolidation, if we had &#x2013; 22, sorry, Slide 22 is what you have &#x2013; what we had to do on consolidation is the fair value, all assets and liabilities of Postbank.</p>
          <p>Of course, when you fair-value them in comparison to the single accounts of Postbank, we now have different value of the loan on the Group accounts versus the value of the loan on the individual Postbank accounts, meaning that while they have a loan, minus obviously loan loss provisions, we, by fair-valuing, obviously don't need the loan loss provisions. We obviously eliminate the loan loss provisions because we proactively represent the value of this loan at the initial transaction. And therefore, now you see this diversion fee between loan loss reporting at Postbank, at the individual entity level, and the loan loss recording at Group level.</p>
          <p>Because of course if &#x2013; and that's what I was trying to explain with my example &#x2013; if now Postbank, let's say, has, in a specific loan, a deterioration of the credit, a deterioration of the rating, and they additionally put allowances on it, obviously at that point of time we have to compare it with the fair value that we put at the loan, and then make a different assessment where we need additional or don't need additional provisions.</p>
          <p>On Page 22, what happens basically is as we now have taken provisions, and let's assume now the reverse, that there's an improvement in a loan at Postbank, and they are able now to release loan loss provisions they had made previously, of course the contrary effect occurs in which we now have an additional income that we are not able to &#x2013; on our net against loan loss provisions, but that we record then in other income.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in the future, I will always have to show to you so you get a good feeling what our net definition comparable net credit provisions are, we will disclose to you how much the impact is on the net income, and therefore you could see that also we have to report &#x20AC;373 million in credit provisions. The financially effective rate for the Group was only &#x20AC;256 million because we had an offsetting income on the other side. So there is no net impact. This is obviously in line with our definition.</p>
          <p>Let me go to your timing differences. And I really like to refer to the chart. Let me quickly go. It's Slide 25. Let me just quickly &#x2013; I don't know if you could look at the chart that we put down. Let's look at the Group column. In the Group column, you see that basically we have steady accrued interest rate, which we took an example of a funding instrument we had in place, and you see on what is the third line, you see this 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, yes, which is the assumption. This is the over-time accrued interest paid on a monthly basis, if you so want, yes? Or an annual basis you can take. Of course, it obviously depends on the terms of the interest.</p>
          <p>Now in the segment, you've seen our &#x2013; obviously the underlying mark-to-market. We have to mark-to-market this instrument. And you, in the assumption here, you saw a positive 15. So you see the positive 15 and then you see in C&amp;A, that in order to get to the Group which has &#x2013; we need to record 10, an interest expense of 10. You see that we have to compensate with 25 in C&amp;A. So if you take then the segment plus C&amp;A, I can record the 10 interest rate expense.</p>
          <p>And then of course we made just an assumption. Obviously you could make any assumption of how the MtM moves. And we showed some volatility here in this chart to just prove the point, how much it moves. So the subsequent part of &#x2013; there is then a negative MtM, and then you see that we have a positive in the C&amp;A. And that's how this volatility generates. But important for us to know is that over time, and we assume now this is a fixed-period instrument, it's an assumption, of course, that after the fixed period, it basically nets out to zero.</p>
          <p>And that's what obviously we continuously mean. So to some extent, if we had a quarter with significant impact, you can make an assumption that there's some positives coming down the road. And this is obviously something also to do with the front-loading of our funding that we have done.</p>
          <p>For PBC, the effect is overall neutral. Technically, we have also the hedging derivative on MtM basis. So at the end, therefore PBC, specifically in this quarter, the effect is more or less neutral.</p>
          <p>Then on the Corporate Investment side, let me walk you through the couple of assets that we have, and let me just refer to the larger one. Actavis actually has a positive P&amp;L and has &#x2013; in our plan, the assumption was that Actavis will have a positive contribution. It was in our insurance business. We now have made the management decision to run it out of Corporate Investment, and therefore, according to the rules in our segment reporting, we have to reclassify it, because our reclassification is guided by the fact of which segment one is in and give responsibility now for the business. So to that extent, we actually took out a planned profit from the &#x20AC;10 billion target and moved it into our CI segment.</p>
          <p>The second is we have our casino, Cosmopolitan, which in the first quarter had obviously its start-up losses. We inaugurated and opened it at the end of last year, and obviously, we've had now the first quarter. The business is doing well. We are moving ahead. But obviously we had to deal with the usual start-up losses, which also in its size were within our expected levels of the start-up of an operation of this magnitude.</p>
          <p>On our ports, on Maher, we have a good operational development. We &#x2013; obviously the improvement in the general economic environment, the improvement in import/export business has had a good impact on our port. We have gained additional volume. We've gained additional customers. Nevertheless, Maher continues to be impacted with relatively expensive funding that was done pre-crisis. And second, obviously this business, as it's asset-intensive, has to carry high level of depreciation, and that's why it showed a loss in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We did also have an impairment on our Taunusanlage corporate center headquarters building that, as you know, was transferred into a fund. And we had to do a mark-to-market on that as well. And we had a negative impact that is also a one-time effect that will not recur, which you need to know.</p>
          <p>And then with DHS, again, as I said in my slide, it's too early to tell specifically what's going to happen. We obviously are working on it. It's work in progress and we obviously were geared up to do the sale until last week, and therefore, obviously, I ask for your understanding that I don't have a fully lined-out plan at this pint in time, as it is still a work in progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the Corporate Investment side, is there any way that you can give us an idea of what the potential &#x2013; I mean, we know the divisional pre-tax target, but on the Corporate and Investment side, what we should assume could be the potential loss in that division for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can definitely tell you that the first quarter is not a good example to extrapolate for the rest of the year, and that you should expect that to be substantially lower than the multiplication of that quarter; I can give you as much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the corporate center, I assume, is going to be mainly purely impacted by these accounting changes which are &#x2013; over time, be going closer to zero? So &#x2013; but there is no underlying issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's no other effects. It's mainly &#x2013; again, obviously &#x2013; and I can give you some of that. Obviously, we are certainly bothered by the volatility. It's something you generally don't want to see on your accounts. It always causes concerns and suspicion around what's going on if you have a, let's say, a non-business division impact of this magnitude. We are working in reducing. You can somewhat reduce this volatility by complying better with the hedging requirements according to IFRS, and we are working &#x2013; Hugo and I are working to improve that and lower the volatility on that, and obviously that requires some investment into systems, and that's going to take a little bit of the time.</p>
          <p>But we believe that, I think, whenever we have a big negative on that, you can expect that down the line, there will be big positive, because at the end, this all will result in zero. And the second effect is the basis risk U.S. because of our funding between U.S., and we mainly fund in euro. And obviously we're supporting a strong business in the United States. That's obviously action stratagem but also there, our view is that we want to come to a better balancing to avoid the volatility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly, BHF, we should leave it &#x2013; in our forecast, we should assume it's staying in this division for now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes. We will &#x2013; obviously now we have the quarter ahead of us, and in this quarter, we will make the pertinent decisions. And my expectations would be that, as I update you on the second quarter, I can give you specifics on how we deal with it.</p>

          <p>Yes, next question?</p>

          <p>The next question is from Matt Clark of KBW. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. Firstly, on the guidance or outlook for the Postbank impact, I think you had said to expect a roughly neutral impact this year as integration costs outweigh the underlying contribution. And clearly, it's had a significantly positive impact in the first quarter. Would you revise that previous guidance and/or maybe give some guidance for how you would you expect integration expenses to change versus the first quarter level?</p>
          <p>And the second question is about the securitization deduction within your Tier 1 capital, which has stubbornly remained around the &#x20AC;5 billion level. I just want to understand your thinking there. I mean, in the past, I think you've suggested that there are some hedges that leave you pretty comfortable with the economic impact and valuation of that. But from the outside, it's a bit hard to see why you &#x2013; if that's so, why you don't sell those down? So could just comment on why you haven't been more aggressive in reducing those securitization positions? Is it because you think the market will recover from here? Or you just have a high degree of confidence that you can sell them down in the future without a loss and want to enjoy the revenue from them in the meantime? Or any other thoughts there would be appreciated, because it's a bit hard to digest. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. That's a good question. First of all, on the guidance, I happily revised my guidance. So far, we've had a good performance. And as we &#x2013; of Postbank, really a very good performance. Germany is doing very well. And you see it also, I think, in our classic or traditional Deutsche Bank business. We are investing. We are moving ahead with the integration. We are obviously working on it. But we definitely, at this point, can say that Postbank probably will contribute stronger than expected in the plan.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget that at the time we made the plan, we had not yet the full Postbank insight. We did not have the full working with Postbank because the plan was developed around the September-to-November timeframe of last year. And we then went into the consolidation, as you know, towards then in the December timeframe at the end of the year, and therefore obviously now, with the update of the plan of Postbank, with the insight into what their plan is, we definitely expect a better contribution.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, you're right. Obviously, some of the cost to achieve these synergies will increase throughout the year, but definitely gladly revise my guidance that obviously Postbank will help more.</p>
          <p>And on the securitization deduction, again, as you correctly pointed out, it's not at all an issue that concerns us from a financial point of view. According to the German solvency rules that we apply when calculating capital deductions on that portfolio, the rules are very much form over substance. And in this form over substance statement, obviously there is &#x2013; when we have a hedge at portfolio level that's not specific, we still have to apply the higher capital charge, although economically the position is financially protected and hedged, from our point of view. And therefore, the true risk in that portfolio versus what we have to report as capital charges, is no relation whatsoever. That's why we are not concerned about this book it all.</p>
          <p>The book is a positive book. The book is contributing, and therefore obviously, you are also right in your second assumption that obviously we have no specific hurry in selling this book, because it continues to contribute. And economically, or from a risk point of view, it is a protected book.</p>
          <p>We expect obviously by the end of the year the levels to be lower. Obviously you will have some maturity, and obviously any opportunity for us to sell at reasonable levels, we will obviously take. And obviously we are also continue to be confident that we will be able to sell at no real impact towards the part of the year.</p>
          <p>The good news again is that obviously some of these capital charges already kind of emulate or are comparable to what we will have to deal then in the Basel 2.5 framework. So to that extent, the step up then for us, when it come to Basel 2.5, will not be as significant as it might have been if this German solvency rule application would not &#x2013; we wouldn't have to have already done it since a couple of quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just follow up then? I mean, some other banks have said today they don't see any reason to mitigate aggressively at this point in time, and we should think about closer to the end of 2012 as being when they're really going to aggressively reduce their balance sheet. Is that the way we should think about this portfolio, that come December 2012, you can just kick it out the door then comfortably, or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would rather give you a different picture. This is a portfolio that is running off at a good pace. So because we don't expect it to have this, like we would be exposed to a big spike of assets that we have to get out. So our plan basically shows a run-off. Our plans shows also some sales activities that are ongoing, and not like heavy end-loaded.</p>
          <p>So we will continue to reduce, but obviously not necessarily aggressively, obviously. But our plan includes, via maturity in some shares, a run-down of this portfolio before the big &#x2013; before the big capital charges apply to the portfolio of this nature.</p>
          <p>And as I said, I would really like to claim that maybe versus some of our competitors, we started these efforts of reducing these assets much earlier. We've put this book on hold and started the run- off in reduction and sales activities much earlier.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Philipp Zieschang of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have basically two areas. One is, again, the 2011 targets, and the second one would be capital. With respect to your 2011 target, you've mentioned that due to the Actavis transfer that CMBS will lose some profits which hopefully are being made up by PBC. Do you have firm new profit targets for 2011 for these two divisions? That would be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is, coming back I think to Kian's point on the Corporate Investments, you said at the last conference call that we should expect a running cost of roughly &#x20AC;300 million for Corporate Investments. So will that change due to the Actavis inclusion? Because it's all basically stories &#x2013; you had a decent deal, but what do we need to deduct from your &#x20AC;10 billion target for 2011 on the non-operating side? So what is basically your new &#x2013; you've mentioned that it is in the Q1 run rate, but you've mentioned a firm number at the last conference call with the 300.</p>
          <p>The third one related also is, again on the consolidation adjustments side. Is there any reason why we should expect beyond 2011, to the normalized contribution, why we should have a structural loss in there? Or is it just the hedging noise which is probably reversing largely during the next three quarters, as you indicated? So basically whether they are new targets for PBC and CBS, and what should we plug in for the other two non-operating divisions for 2011? And is there any structural knowledge beyond 2011 apart from the running costs?</p>
          <p>And the second part is basically the capital base. You haven't put in a slide on your Basel III outlook, which you've intensively discussed in Q3. I was just wondering, given that you recently put out new disclosure of saying that 25% of CIB risk-weighted assets is legacy post-mitigation in 2013, whether &#x2013; and that wasn't in that form select when you gave your Basel III guidance of the 7%. And here in 2013, there's a 7% Core Tier 1 including deductions, and the 8.1% excluding deductions. I was just wondering, how should we bake in this new disclosure into the capital forecast? Is it something new in terms of risk-weighted assets which is &#x2013; which goes beyond your Q3 disclosure? And is there much more capital releases to be expected because it is said that it's post-mitigation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Philipp, let me start on the target. Now, we wanted to make &#x2013; while we have not set out new targets for our different business divisions on Q1 results, it's certainly something we may look into as we get closer to the second quarter. But at this time, we have said it's too early to make adjustments. I just wanted to make aware that in all fairness, as we transferred and took profit out of CIB's target, that it would be fair to mention it, that certainly to somewhat the stretch for CIB has been technically increased at this point in time, and that's something we would have to consider down the road.</p>
          <p>Second, obviously I wanted you to be aware that obviously we have opportunities within CIB, obviously as we &#x2013; in the budget also have good results. The performance has good results at GTB level as well as PBC level, that we have compensating effects. I would also make you aware that obviously we will have an issue as exchange rate impact in the first quarter, on the plan was already negative by approximately &#x20AC;120 million, and I wanted to also make you aware of this effect.</p>
          <p>But to answer your question, no, we have not given out new targets. We would like to stay with the current targets at this point in time. But you should understand how the targets have been impacted either by technical or by market-driven effect.</p>
          <p>Our Corporate Investment, that's why I say I wouldn't change their target either. As you saw, we had some additional one-offs in the first quarter, and obviously they may be offset then by the benefit we might have from Actavis over the year. So I would say around the same guidance that we mentioned and that we have given you.</p>
          <p>On the normalization of C&amp;A, honestly, that's a very difficult question to answer because the exchange rate and interest rate movement &#x2013; and as we mentioned, these are the balance sheet items behind this are almost trillion-positioned. And obviously any slightest move on interest rates will obviously cause very quickly &#x20AC;50 million to &#x20AC;100 million in volatility in these companies. And it's based on the fact of the large &#x2013; of this big size of the underlines.</p>
          <p>Basically, our view is that we want to reduce the volatility. When we used to have much lower, it was around rather the &#x20AC;200 million type of volatility instead of close to &#x20AC;400 million in volatility, and the management actions were taken to bring it down. By the way, in the peer comparison, we have seen that peers have similar effects that are pure accounting noise-driven. We just wanted to make everybody aware that this is really technically that we are not transferring any loss positions into these two segments to kind of improve our &#x20AC;10 billion target, because that would be definitely a wrong view on what's happening, both in CI and with the CMA adjustment.</p>
          <p>But you can expect that we are working on reducing the noise and that definitely the noise we saw in this quarter hopefully is one that stays at the higher end. And of course, I am making this statement under the assumption that interest rates, for example, or exchange rates, don't show substantial volatility, because that obviously could impact this structure.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, honestly no change to our capital. We have been &#x2013; we continuously monitor our capital plan. And we have given you just disclosure that we did at the MS conference. It was just meant to give you some additional disclosure around the topic, but our capital plan is unchanged.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we have monitored and continue to observe any impact and changes we have had. But I fact it's somewhat &#x2013; our current view is that we might be little a bit even somewhat better than we indicated in the third quarter in our forecast for our capital. So we are in line. We are in the process with our regulators to review Basel 2.5 implementation, but at this point in time, I can report to you that we have no material deviations at this point to report.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Derek De Vries, Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I just want to come back to a few things we've touched on already, and hopefully I'm not the only once still a bit confused. Starting with Slide 25, and I apologize, you've gone through this a few times, but I just want to make sure I understand it. The &#x20AC;370 million negative impact from the corporate center, that's pretty clear. And then it's pretty clear there is an offsetting positive impact through the segments. Can you quantify what that positive impact was in Q1? And then I realize these will reverse in Q2, Q3, et cetera, but did you quantify the positive impact through the divisions, because presumably it's not the full &#x20AC;370 million? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, just a follow-up on the Basel III stuff. I mean, obviously one of the positive surprises from this set of results was the risk-weighted asset reduction. But if I understood your answer to the previous questions, you're leaving your &#x20AC;125 billion and &#x20AC;190 billion net and gross risk-weighted asset under Basel III. Those numbers are unchanged. So as I am calculating my Basel III numbers, the only difference is I'm starting with a lower point and grossing it up the same; is that correct?</p>
          <p>And then I was just wondering, you mentioned the &#x2013; in the Equities business, you mentioned there is a positive impact from your sale of a stake in the Russian Stock Exchange, and that's offset by some negative impacts sort of associated with the conditions in Q1. I was just wondering, in terms of the stake in the Russian Stock Exchange, are we talking like a &#x20AC;20 million gain that's offset by negatives? Or is it something larger than that? That would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I know that this consolidation adjustment impact is &#x2013; but let's not forget that when we compare our division, it has no positive impact because the divisions are on mark-to-market for the underlying asset and the hedges as well. So I know its difficult to comprehend, but investments &#x2013; it's just a correction position between two accounting methods. That's all it is. It doesn't have necessarily a positive impact. It comes back to this question, is what's the true profit? Is it an accrual profit or is it a mark-to-market profit that you want to register? And that's why it's difficult to say that there was a positive impact, because it's just an accounting method of a new difference on how you define the profit of a division. And that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in your slide, you show the negative. So in your example, you show the negative &#x20AC;25 million impact in the corporate adjustment, and you show the positive &#x20AC;15 million in the segment. And in the next quarter, that's negative &#x20AC;25 million in the segment and positive &#x20AC;15 million. So presumably, the &#x20AC;370 million reference is equivalent to the negative &#x20AC;25 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if only I would assume that I have to accrue both these segments, which are segments I need to record on an MtM basis, it's only a correction position. If it really comes down, you can say, yes, what you correctly say. Of course, if you take my example, you would have to compare the &#x20AC;370 million versus the &#x20AC;370 million, of course. But now if you're asking, does it have a positive impact on profitability, the question, how you define profitability? And in a business segment, according to IFRS, we have to define profitability assessing mark-to-market for the segment, and then you obviously come to this &#x2013; to, at the end, a true profit representation of the segment. I want to caution you to assume now that there was a lifted-up profit in the division by that amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That we have from the hedging derivative. Obviously we have negatives. Let's not forget the IFRS rules that apply. We need to prove the effectiveness of these hedges according to IFRS, which is different than the effectiveness of the hedges that we do in these positions with the businesses applied to their results from a financial point of view.</p>
          <p>So you could have a hedge that the business implemented at different results levels to manage their asset and liability positions. It does not qualify for hedge accounting according to IFRS that we then have the correct in consolidation and adjustment.</p>
          <p>I don't want to leave anybody with the impression that there was an improved profit by &#x20AC;370 million in the divisions, because that would be a wrong view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Basel III stuff, yes, we stay unchanged. Of course we &#x2013; and let's not forget that some of this Basel III, we provided a view, where we stand at the beginning of 2013. So we gave you a sense of where we are. As we move on our de-risking activities, maybe some of it will occur sooner and maybe some of it will occur later than assumed. It's the timing between the start, which was where I disclosed to you the third quarter of last year and this point in time. That's why it would also be wrong to assume, because we have managed to reduce risk-weighted assets now, that these are on top reduction that we did not expect. It's part of our path of mitigation that will lead to the results, and therefore know, and feel very clearly, there is no change to the Basel III stuff in view.</p>
          <p>And again, we have been working with regulators, we have been monitoring. Obviously there have been corrections, there have been improvements, there have been more detailed views on our capital trend, but nothing material has changed at this point in time that we felt that we needed to give you an update on or a disclosure on.</p>
          <p>So it's just the progressing over time. And you know our mitigation effect volumes are substantial, so obviously it's good news that we are moving ahead early and starting to see this mitigation is working.</p>
          <p>And then the last question I now lost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was the sale of the Russian &#x2013; your stake in the Russian Stock Exchange and the offsetting losses. Just order of magnitude. And I can understand if you don't want to comment exactly, but are we talking tens of million here?</p>

          <p>The next question is from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. A couple of questions already. First, on Postbank. You've given us obviously the severance cost of &#x20AC;48 million, which I guess is in respect of the integration. Can you just give some clue as to what other integration costs you've actually taken? I can't find them in the text.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I know we have the PBC day in June, but can you just say, since December when you took full control of the Bank, what sort of milestone events have actually occurred to date in terms of the consolidation? That's on Postbank.</p>
          <p>And then the final question, coming at capital from a slightly different way, obviously you did give that data, you rightly say, at the conference, which was really helpful. Clearly the 8% pre-deductions was the number I think you were focusing on. Given what's happened in Italy, and obviously you saw what happened at Morgan Stanley last week with ratios being pushed up for 12,000 and a 2012 date, and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:30) possibly appealing to the ECB, does that put any pressure on you, given the fact that you obviously have an all-in 2012 ratio that looks weak compared to your competitors, but which I know you feel is not really an issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me start with Postbank. First of all, when we talk about this integration cost, it's not just a severance because second is, we are obviously putting some &#x2013; a system cost in place too. Let's not forget that basically the Postbank integration largely is first a creation of a common retail operating platform that we are working on, and that much of the initial cost is associated to that.</p>
          <p>And I just referred to the rest. I think you will find more disclosure on Page 20 in item number one. I think I give you some more numbers as to your question on the &#x20AC;42 million and &#x20AC;78 million that you asked.</p>
          <p>On the capital situation, I can only reiterate our feeling that &#x2013; and maybe at this point also I disclose  to you that obviously our effectively going into the AGM with capital authorizations, it's just standard practice. Because obviously we want to be, as a bank, in a position to have this authorization in place. Please don't misunderstand it. It's no indicated, we don't believe, and continue to believe, that we do not need to raise further capital outside of any significant acquisitions we may plan, for which, obviously, we want to have authorization in place in case opportunities present themselves.</p>
          <p>But outside of that, we continue to perform well against our capital plan. We do believe that we are sufficiently capitalized. We do believe that we will be sufficiently capitalized. And I can only say again, look at the combination of funding and capital. Because at the end of day, that's I think where we find the strength of the Bank and not at peer comparison, that we constantly are confronted with it.</p>
          <p>In our view, as a result of historic developments that work quite differently from us. It's not having taken state capital at any point in time, and just managing a reasonable tight capital. That always has had the philosophy that it's best business practice to have capital unutilized and surplus capital for long periods of time in an organization. That's financially not a sound and good concept, and that's why we continue to believe that to run the Bank on very high levels of capital, by the way right now, historically high levels of capital, and the strength of our balance sheet on the funding side, is a more reasonable approach to run a business on a sustainable basis. So again, only to clarify that.</p>
          <p>On your PBC question, I need to ask again, what was the question actually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I was just asking if there are any milestone events that have actually been released in the first five months into the full consolidation of Postbank?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to come back actually to a couple of things that we've been talking about here. Firstly, on capital, could you talk some more &#x2013; I know touched on it, but can you talk some more about why the RWAs came down in the quarter, given that your leverage ratio was unchanged? Was it a change of mix or of modeling, or did you reduce certain activities?</p>
          <p>Linked to that, is there a change in strategy on capital? Are you now seeking to more actively reduce risk-weighted assets and improve your ratios? Is there a change on strategy that you're implying here?</p>
          <p>And finally, could we come back again to this question of the central items, Corporate Investments and C&amp;A? And I think we didn't get a sort of answer earlier on. If we think about 2012, 2013, conceptually, what should we be expecting there? Does C&amp;A conceptually, through the cycle, average to zero? And what should Corporate Investments, on a sort of mid-term run rate, what should that be contributing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the third one. Obviously conceptually, long term, we intend to sell all these assets. That's on Corporate Investments and non-core assets, and obviously at the right time. When markets have improved, and when we obviously can sell it beneficially to shareholders, these activities will be all done. So long term, you should assume all these activities are done and there is no negative. And that's hopefully going to occur in the next three years, that we will be able to sell at given points in time. At good given points in time, these legacy assets that are non-core to the Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, while you still own them, is there any reason why they should be a negative rather than contributing profits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. They can &#x2013; obviously, we will be in a better sales position if we manage to turn these businesses around and be positive contributors. That's why we also made the decision to move it into Corporate Investments, because the team there, our associates there, these are professionals that obviously come in. And we have hired some industry experts as well that come in, and will help us to turn around these businesses to bring them to profitability. Because obviously, that will improve our sales position.</p>
          <p>We have some situations. As I said, on Cosmo we had a start-up. It's a start-up operation, and start-up operations lose money in the first year, and then obviously turn around and produce profits. I think the success of Cosmo, you could read in the press. It's well positioned. It is the hippest place in Vegas right now. Las Vegas is recovering, and I think we will be the newest facility in Las Vegas for a long, long time. There will be no other openings going on. And I think that's why we're not concerned that they will be able to turn around this business. Our target is after the restructuring on the capital base, as I told you already in the plan, for a positive contribution.</p>
          <p>On the ports, we still have obviously &#x2013; the issue is on a &#x2013; operating on a EBITDA basis. This business is already turned around, is positive, but obviously has to carry a significant funding charge which obviously will also run off in the near future. And obviously it is an asset-intensive business, so we will have depreciation charges to deal with. But as the EBITDA improves, recover of these depreciation charges will improve.</p>
          <p>And then again, we had one-off this quarter with the sale of our corporate headquarters. That impacted C&amp;A negative. So you should over time assume, and for the timeframe you've given me, certainly assume that this business turnaround might be positive contributors. And then we would obviously try to get out of them as soon as they are, because that's not profit for our banking or for the long term.</p>
          <p>And in terms of C&amp;A, again, we are doing anything we can to mitigate the volatility. It's &#x2013; the problem of it is it's not necessarily financially in non-accounting; it's just as I showed you in the chart, it's just a correction position. Nevertheless, as we are all discussing today, the market struggles with this type of volatility, and that's why we are taking measured to reduce it. But you should assume that in this range of around &#x20AC;200 million, that's something that may stay over the longer term.</p>
          <p>And again, I have to caution everybody, because I'm making big assumptions on interest rates and exchange rate movements as not being as sharp as they might have been on it.</p>
          <p>On the risk-weighted assets, I think we showed you also a chart, which was on Page 9. I think we disclosed to you the main effects. We had an FX effect that was favorable of &#x20AC;7 billion; we then had an &#x20AC;11.6 billion reduction in credit risk which, as I told you in the text, it was related to &#x20AC;4 billion out of derivatives; and &#x20AC;5 billion lending related; and &#x20AC;3 billion out of other repo securities and stuff like that.</p>
          <p>So we had a good development in credit, with a slight increase in market risk, and a decrease in operational risk. So that was the movement. So it was all movement across the board, but mainly a credit risk reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so I guess what I was trying to get beyond was then on that credit risk reduction, is that simply a reflection of volume reduction? Or is it sort of a rating migration or modeling effect or a mix shift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's mainly driven by exposure reduction. And that's what it is, yes. That's mitigation or exposure reduction. But it also has the components, as we see the credit environment improving, also there have been improvements there. And obviously &#x20AC;4 billion obviously of improvement of parameters that we had in our calculation. So it's also an improvement in the market data that we use in the models to asses that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my sort of follow-on question was, is there a change of strategy here? Does this reflect something that you're going to be pursuing further more aggressively than previously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Again, we are in line with our plan. We have disclosed that plan in the third quarter. We will, and I really promise, give you an update if there is material changes to this plan. As we all understand, that for not comprehensive financial but for general market reasons, there are so much focus on it. But with all the discussions and the progress we've had, at this point, there is no substantial material change to this plan of this. As we have learned more about the implication of 2.5, and then I have a discussion with the regulators, for example, we haven nothing to report that really substantially or materially affects this. Our capital plan going forward, our mitigation going forward, we have not changed our strategy around it. And again, also this refers to our plans on capitalization of the Bank. I reiterate the statement that we do not need, from our perspective in our capital, we do not need to go for a capital increase.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Sorry to go back to the Postbank number again, but is there anything else in the &#x20AC;221 million? I mean, for example, any other PPA effect on, say, some of the securities that you will have fair-valued? Because I would have assumed that there's been quite a big rally in the valuation of some of those assets in the first quarter, is the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question, just to clarify what you just said on RWA, so if we go back to the &#x20AC;90 billion targeted management actions, what you're saying, if we take the credit risk &#x20AC;11.6 billion that you've done about 13%, 15% of that already, so it's just that you're getting ahead of the plan compared to peers?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, on the Sales and Trading debt and the number, I think there's a &#x20AC;175 million one-off in there from the slide. But just to kind of understand, I mean, I wasn't aware the RMBS was a major product for you, but you do highlight it a lot of times. I'm wondering if you could just talk about exactly how strong it has been and commodities. I mean, how big are those two numbers in that Q1 number? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Postbank, PPA effect, number one of course at Group level, PPA effects do play a role. And obviously, there was a PPA contribution in the Postbank results, but we have decided to leave this and not to close it &#x2013; separate it. At this point, we had also costs to achieve in this number, so we had also some costs that were booked against Postbank. There's just different factors influencing the Postbank result.</p>
          <p>Postbank's individual accounts, obviously we will show their trade profit as they calculated. For example, when they obviously made certain additional reserves, which we from a Group level have already taken into account in our fair valuations, and obviously we can reverse them. And obviously vice versa, if there are improvements out of PPA. And we took charges that we just don't need. Obviously then the Group profit will be higher.</p>
          <p>There's a lot of movement in that position and a lot of details that we wanted to close more in detail, but I would encourage you to visit our workshop, because obviously we'll try to give you some more transparency around the functioning of this component, which certainly in a phone call like this would be too complicated to explain in detail. But I verify for you that we did have PPA effect in the first quarter results on Postbank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, how would we as outside observers then use that &#x20AC;221 million-based forecast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what we said; we understand it's obviously difficult to forecast because it has basically three components or four components. It has the operating profit of Postbank; it then has the reversal of any reserves they do that we have already taken into account from a Group perspective. We then have PPA effects that depends obviously on how the progress is of the asset that we fair-valued and how the development is, for example, of interest rates. And then it does include the synergy costs. So it is several components.</p>
          <p>Again, in the next quarter, in the workshop, we plan to provide you some more disclosure and guidance. But to be honest, some of these numbers will be difficult to estimate from an outside-in perspective over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just a matter of fact on how this accounting occurs. Second question on the &#x20AC;90 billion, again, no &#x2013; don't assume that this is then speeding up, or don't assume that it will &#x2013; we have the mitigation plan, which is challenging, that we have disclosed to you on &#x20AC;90 billion, and what you should see obviously over the quarters, how we get there.</p>
          <p>But don't assume that any step ahead or any improvement in risk-weighted assets is additional to the &#x20AC;90 billion, that would be wrong assumption, or assume that because we have started already showing mitigation that this means that we will be more successful with mitigation. I think all &#x2013; and that's why I would caution you; our &#x20AC;90 billion trend is still the valid number. It's a challenging number for us as a business. We have to work really to get there.</p>
          <p>But I'm happy to report that we have had good success and we are moving along it, and therefore, we are confident and verify again that the plan that I disclosed to you in the last quarter, we will be able to achieve at this point in time, and also in terms of understanding the rules a little bit better and working with the regulator. I can only then say, we haven't found anything that needs us to update the Q3 plan that we laid out at this point in time.</p>
          <p>But there's ongoing discussion. Hopefully some of them will even help us. And we continue to be positive on achieving the plan. But don't assume that we will be any faster or any better at this time on this early indication.</p>
          <p>On the Sales and Trading debt, yes, there was a one-off. We disclosed that one-off. And the disclosure around RMBS and our Commodities business, only to highlight that our RMBS has improved. RMBS has been so much focus. It's not highlighting the size of it necessarily, or the importance of it; it's only an effect that for so long-term we've had negative news on this business, and we see &#x2013; to give you an idea that we see improvement in this business. And we have, especially in this business, strongly improved versus last year. And the same we want to say, as we are in terms of towards our competition in the Commodities business, we in the past have not been such a big player that we show that we are having good progress with our organic strategy that we have in the Commodities business. And the team there is very successful in continuing to develop this business. And I just wanted to highlight that these are the two areas that really had a significant performance improvement versus previous year; not meaning that they are substantial businesses of the Bank.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I had one question around to Taunus, please. Can you just explain what you lose by losing the bank-holding status of Taunus? I mean, I know in the crisis Goldman's and Morgan Stanley were terribly keen to be bank-holding companies. So what do you lose in terms of access to the Fed, et cetera, by giving up that license? And related to that; do you get more intensive regulation of the U.S. branch now? So net-net, your regulatory burden remains unchanged? Or does it get lighter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two quick answers. We don't lose anything. And no, we have had enough regulatory scrutiny on all our entities and we don't expect that to change. They have not only looked at Taunus. Actually, Taunus was not that active, but they always look at the operating entities. And that's really the view and picture I would like to leave with all of you. At the end, the entities a regulator should be concerned of, in light of the subsidization discussion, are operating entities in the specific countries that at the end are the counterparties to the client in that specific geography. And these two entities will stress over and over, always being well capitalized. The entities that are under regulatory scrutiny and have to report are the entities regulators should be worried about, in terms of geographical concerns that may exist, and not a construct of the holding that had historic substances that obviously we now address and resolve, because it was creating so much confusion around a theoretical exposure to U.S. clients, to an undercapitalized Deutsche Bank subsidiary, which was not an issue ever.</p>
          <p>The main issue why it was not interesting to address for us, this issue previously was just an effect on the tax. It carried significant amounts of the DTAs that we could lose or carry forward that we could use, with the 20-year loss carried forward rule in the United States, and why that changes without no need. But after the all the discussions that Taunus has generated, we made a decision, okay, let's clean up our U.S. corporate structure. And we were able to achieve two things that we got rid of the Bank's Taunus, but we maintained the usability of our DTAs in the United States as well. So we are one &#x2013; we will be one tax group in the United States which is also progress. So it's just a very plain and simple improvement of our corporate platform in the United States with no negatives for anything, no negatives for our clients, no negatives for the regulator, and nothing of that. And obviously there has been some misunderstanding around what you wanted to address.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I have only a question on the higher end of the compensation expenses in Q1. There is only more or less a quarterly one-off from this February career retirement; is this correct?</p>

          <p>... higher amount. It's moved forward. And we have that every February, and it is just based on our plans. And the only difference in this year is, as we have been moving up and increasing, obviously the amounts of deferred compensation based on required laws and the regulations around the new compensation structure, we obviously have had to &#x2013; this number moves up. Conceptually just imagine the Bank used to defer about half of what we have to defer today, based on the new regulator's compensation rules. But the good news is that 40% of our 2011 amortization of these compensation already occurred in Q1, which now means that obviously for the rest of the year, we'll always have &#x2013; we now have to only amortize 60% of the deferred compensation of the tranche that is valid for 2011, which obviously, as you can assume, is helpful for the run rate ongoing for the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, so just one question on -- going back to sort of the proportion of earnings coming from Deutsche Postbank. If you look out to 2013 and 2014, what proportion of Group &#x2013; of the operating profits do you think will be coming from Asset and Wealth Management, TGB, PBC, versus the Investment Bank? Because I think one of most intriguing aspects of today's results is the rebalancing of earnings towards the non-investment banking earnings. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There's obviously two rebalancings that occur in the first quarter. It's a rebalancing, as you correctly said, between our classical banking and the Investment Bank, and then there's also an interesting geographical rebalancing that's occurring. Obviously we are getting more profitability also out of Germany, of course, because of the Postbank situation which, in current environment, is also pretty good, because obviously we have the good economic situation in Germany and therefore can expect further positive contributions thereof.</p>
          <p>If you ask me for a ratio, actually looking at the ratios that now we have, between what we call Classical Banking, at slightly below 40%, and the Investment Bank at slightly above 60%, that's pretty much the ratio we are targeting in the first step. And we have always said that over time, we expect it to be a 50-50 where we get to. But not under the assumption that Investment Bank will reduce, but on the assumption that obviously we will be able to continue with the new acquisitions that all have been in the Classical &#x2013; what we call the Classical Banking area of our business, that with contributions from these acquisitions, we will get to this 50-50% balancing longer term. But I think the first step, the near step to assume, is 60-40.</p>
