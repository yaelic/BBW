          <p>Welcome to Deutsche Bank's Annual Earnings Meeting here in Frankfurt. With me are Joe Ackermann, Chairman of the Management Board; Stefan Krause, CFO; and Hugo Banziger, Chief Risk Officer. Those of you who are joining today here in Frankfort, thank you for coming, especially those from London, congratulations that you made it. We had some cancellation in the last minute but we know they are all joining us now from the &#x2013; on the telephone from this new ski resort on the island.</p>
          <p>With having said that we would like to proceed as following. We will have three presentations by the <mark type="inaudible" /> members and then we enter into Q&amp;A and we start in the discussion of course with the room here and later we take some questions from the telephone conference call. And with that, no further ado, Joe, I hand over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wolfram, and good afternoon. I think we &#x2013; what we're really try to do in this afternoon is to give you as much clarity as we can on all the positions because I think the logic right now in the financial markets is &#x2013; and having talked to a lot of people in Davos of all circles, government officials, professors, bankers &#x2013; it's all the same. There must be much more in the balance sheets, hidden risks, hidden losses and one day that will pop up and then, of course, then we need more capital and the only way to go &#x2013; to ask for capital is to see the governments and then it's partial expropriation.</p>
          <p>And I think we said many times that we don't need that, but it's probably the credibility of bankers, some have suffered, and of balance sheets and of risks, exposures. That's why we said the only way to convince the market where we really are is to give just all the information in a very granular way. And that's what we want to do. That's the reason Hugo Banziger has joined Stefan Krause and myself and he will go specifically through some of the risk issues. We gave you the credit portfolio. We gave you the &#x2013; in a different way so you, much more from a risk perspective, not relying on ratings which some of you wouldn't believe either anyhow. So it's a different analytical framework &#x2013; go through the real estate portfolio what it means, the remaining trading assets and non-derivative trading assets also on level three and so that you're, at the end, hopefully have the feeling that things are really under control. Or then at least we get the right questions from you, that what you may still see as a major risk.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I don't want to go too much now in things you have already seen, the results in summary, I don't have to go through that. I think important is, here that we promised two things. Tier 1 ratio of 10 plus and a leverage ratio of below 30. We achieved that. We are now at 28. Based on our target definition, not on IFRS &#x2013; but I think it's fair if you compare ourselves with the USPs and not with IFRS which has a completely different accounting approach as we all know, the derivatives portfolio.</p>
          <p>And we said this morning and we're going to repeat this afternoon, our target now is 25. We will achieve that and then I think we are in line with the best in this industry and it should in my view stop talking about leverage any more which is anyhow a very, very doubtful concept. And you'll hear many central banks regulators being very unhappy with the whole discussion but if, you know, market think it's important and then we will do our best to get close to what is expected. It's an easy thing. I mean you just sell all your liquid assets and get out of repo and you're down to 20. But that doesn't help the pick. So actually and we are, I'm a strong believer that the Basel II risk rated assets approach is a more intelligent one and this is our primary focus. But we use the leverage ratio as a benchmark just to demonstrate that we take the assets serious and have, of course, contrary than what we did in the past, in the last six months very, very much focused on granular trading and balance sheet positions and that is what we want to demonstrate.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; I think in the context of the management agenda, you see that the net income is not quite in, aligned with our targets nor the net revenues, but a good thing is that despite these huge losses, we could increase our Tier 1 capital, which I think is very good. Without asking for taxpayer's money, without going to see some wealth funds, and without actually asking our existing shareholders for new capital. I think that is unique and should actually give us a lot of recovery fantasy if things turn around because we have no charges from any interest on government's money. We have no restrictions on dividends, on compensation, on the business model. We can grow wherever we want and we are the master of this little universe and I think that is a tremendously effective and strong message as soon as everybody understands that we have achieved that and getting out of the crisis without asking for this official help.</p>
          <p>Now the fourth quarter clearly comes from, now someone asked me this morning was it a kitchen sink operation, I am not &#x2013; I wouldn't be allowed to say that in the presence of all our accounting experts. We always have the right valuation. But it is clear that we were in some areas not trying to get the maximum out because at the end, it is pretty irrelevant whether you have a few hundred millions ups or downs if you are in, fighting in this league, as we are. The focus was on getting the 10% and getting the leverage ratio down. And, of course, getting risks down, as we start on a different platform into 2009.</p>
          <p>But the Asset Wealth Management we had huge impairments as you will see and the PBC we also had restructuring charges and PBC was actually the only good performer in the first quarter. There are some exceptions to the rule also in CB&amp;S, especially in the flow businesses, forex, money market rates and use of equity cash and fund services.</p>
          <p>And you see in the right-hand side where the losses came from and we'll go more into detail there, but you see it's a combination of markdowns, not that much, and primarily losses &#x2013; sometimes, you know, we were happy to say that we were relatively little affected in the first wave sub-prime <mark type="inaudible" />, and I always said, it's not a tsunami. People always talk about the tsunami. The tsunami, at least the way we have seen it in Asia a few years ago, was a big wave and then it stopped and it didn't come back. So those who were protected were a little bit higher up and those who were riding on the water were actually safe.</p>
          <p>And so we could have said, okay, we survived because we were somewhat higher up or further away from the shores. But unfortunately it was not a tsunami; it is a permanent &#x2013; it is a continuous series of earthquakes with constantly changing epicenters. So once we had to leverage loan, then we were hit, but that we survived and now in the fourth quarter after Lehman, things happened which really got to the franchise, to the core of our sales and trading business and that is primarily all these indirect risks and not the direction risk. We didn't have direction risk that's why we were relatively strong for a long time. But we had basis risk; we had correlation risk, and so on, and so on. And that is really what's got us into this difficult situation in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On top of it, of course, we decided to massively reduce exposures in liquid markets. That cost some money. But I don't want to say that this is the reason for the loss. The loss really comes from other areas and I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>Of course you'll see the relatively simple on this Chart, basis risk is really has gone through the roofs, correlation is up again, volatility is very high, and, of course, liquidity is very low. So that is really the bulk of our business and we always felt that our intellectual leadership is superior and it took some waves actually to test that. Well, at the end, it did hit us and here we are.</p>
          <p>So in the next page, this is the business model and the impact it had, of course, in the flow businesses we continue to do very well and we have actually a flight to quality where we benefited from.</p>
          <p>We had very limited toxic assets write downs because, as you will see, we do not have a lot of toxic assets. And we have the high growth and diversified revenue stream in many areas, Asia, Latin America and so on and so on. But there were two areas, prop trading, where the relative values strategy suffered from all that as we said and our assumptions were wrong in this very difficult market. Some would argue, they come back and make a lot of money and may well be, but we had a different approach. We said that we just can't afford that. So we get rid of it, we take the losses and want to start from a new platform. Even if in five years from now someone says, you know, opportunity costs would have been pretty important.</p>
          <p>The second one is scale. We have to win too big and that is something we have to work down, and we worked on, that why we came down in non-derivative trading assets from 460 billion some time ago to slightly over 200 and we will have a further cut in the first quarter of this year. We want to get the kind of exposure down so whatever happens we cannot have similar volatilities in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And the last point is complexity. And what I said with intellectual leadership, and so we had exposure to volatility in correlation rates, also something we have to control and monitor better.</p>
          <p>On the next chart, you have the details now a little bit where does it come from, and what the reasons are, and why we were particularly positioned in this area.</p>
          <p>On the next page you have the flow businesses, and how they developed, and I think that is also very good news for the future. Then TPB of course is &#x2013; continues to be strong. Asset and Wealth Management &#x2013; we had this special impairment issues in Scudder, then in the RREEF infrastructure asset, then in the Seed Capital, European Money Market Fund injections. Something we changed. We gave some guidance and so, some kind of performance guarantee. That costs a lot of money in this markets and we are not accepting this business now. In a different way we are just giving different guidance and people will then over time react. And then we have the Auction Rate Preferred, the settlement which was a voluntary settlement, if you like, but very much on the arm-twisting of the U.S. regulators.</p>
          <p>Then PBC, we had not only higher provisions and severance, but we also had lower revenues from investment products, in the, especially in the fourth quarter. So it wasn't only, and you know that as well as we do, that the certain trading people didn't do a lot in their business, it's also the investors, private investors, institution investors which really disappeared from the market for quite some time, and that, of course, had a major impact on our business as well.</p>
          <p>Now most important, what does that mean? Let me say one thing first. We strongly believe in our strategic model of being a strong global investment bank with a strong private client business, and I don't want to change that. Secondly, we are strong believers that the integrated and diversified business model, diversified along clients, along products, and along regions is the best and most stable business model. So we are not going to change that, but as we always said, we continue to strengthen our stable businesses and what is new, we are changing the direction of our investment banking business, especially of our sales and trading business. And that's what you see on this chart.</p>
          <p>What is the history? I think we told you many, many times that our prop trading is about 10 to 15% of our revenues, and we always felt that a relatively modest number. But in order to, if you take 10% out of 15 billion is only 1.5, but to achieve 1.5 billion, you need actually a risk allocation and the risk equivalent and capital equivalent of several times more. So let's assume it's a 20% return, you need five times more. So you're talking about seven to eight billion. And if you have strings as we had on this eight billion, you can easily lose two, three billion. And that is what we have seen in 2008 and something we don't want to see again. So the focus is going forward on the liquid businesses and you have see here what it is, then, of course, on the medium higher liquidity businesses, which are clearly reducing our high illiquid activities, and that you see on the next page. Well, actually on 19, come back to 18.</p>
          <p>That we have changed now the composition and we monitor that to its sub-limits and capital allocation, but the future will be much more based on the liquid and the high liquid business and we are reducing to a minimum the highly illiquid positions. And we have closed our exclusively dedicated prop trading desks.</p>
          <p>Now what does that mean in terms of revenues? The opportunity costs of this shift on the upper part is something between 1 and 2 billion. But as you all know this is highly complex, so cost allocations are relatively high and secondly bonuses were very high in this business. So the pre-tax impact will be even more. But we think that even if we have a billion or so or maybe less, 200 million less pre-tax contribution, but reducing the risk that in a worst case scenario, we will not have the same losses as we had in the fourth quarter 2008, it's a much better business model and we also are confident that the first two pieces can contribute much more.</p>
          <p>And I will show you that later on why. But let me say it first, just demonstrate what I just said. So the proprietary trading risk has been reduced by 90%. Then we have reduced our RMBS exposures by 50%. We have reduced the global market's balance sheet that's based on U.S. GAAP, so it's not taking the IFRS gross derivatives portfolio into account by 39% and global market head count is also already 30% down and there's a bit more to come in 2009. So this is a dramatic change in global markets.</p>
          <p>Now the corporate finance, we are repositioning, of course, the commercial real estate and the leverage finance business, the leveraged loans in the sense of giving commitments for two years and having no price flexibility where we had the huge markdowns, of course, is a thing of the past. No one &#x2013; no serious bank will ever get into that I hope. But it is still a attractive business and we just did some interesting transactions, and the price flexibility is different and so the market risk is managed differently.</p>
          <p>Commercial real estate the same and we think that we should invest in the financial institutions business. We just learned that we hired people from Merrill and Bank of America because some people say that U.S. banks will need $1.5 trillion in fresh capital. Governments will need up to $3 trillion in debt funding this year alone out of these programs. So there's tremendous need for investment banking activities, and of course, the M&amp;A business is also not dead. So in that sense, we want to be a beneficiary of that and as we believe that we are one of the very few banks which are intact in the investment banking platform under many &#x2013; in many ways, we should actually be a strong beneficiary of that development.</p>
          <p>On the transaction banking, we don't have to add much. We continue to grow. Here we are talking about bolt-on acquisitions. We still haven't the final decision on the Dutch business. I think the EU Commission also would like to go ahead. The Dutch government and Central Bank would like, if I may say so, recreate a Dutch ABN-AMRO. Let's see who is going to win. We are, of course, a little bit of service about, in this political fight between Brussels and The Hague, but of course we will be interested in getting it, no doubt about that.</p>
          <p>Asset and Wealth Management, for the first time we give you some more detailed information on Private Asset management. Private Asset Management actually had a good year, 15% up on operating level, but we had this settlement auction rate products and securities which cost us some money. But otherwise they had a good year. Also, the net new money with 10 billion up was good.</p>
          <p>Asset management had a difficult year. The operating side would have been 30% down but the &#x2013; we had specific impairments which I think is now a consequence of lower cash flow projections went the other way but also in infrastructure impairments where we have a piece in it never wanting to bite us but that was for funds but now we are partially owned and then have to take the necessary impairments.</p>
          <p>The European Money Market Fund, and I've already talked about that and then we have some seed capital losses as well in funds we have contributed some seed money. We were always very careful in doing this. It didn't go too far but you see even relatively small numbers lead to quite substantial impairments.</p>
          <p>We will re-engineer the platform, especially the money market side and the risk side and the hedge fund side which I think is under way and which also means cost reduction and efficiency gains.</p>
          <p>In Private Asset Management we're on the right track. We have continued to grow but of course you always have efficiency problems on the way.</p>
          <p>The retail business as we have seen in the fourth quarter, investment products are much lower but others have done better and it is very important that for us from a funding perspective because we got very important new deposits and helped us of course on the funding side quite substantially. And that's a very important part of our retail operations and therefore it has been successful in acquiring new clients.</p>
          <p>The Postbank situation that, I think you are familiar with it, we will have now the operation agreements in more details. You will get that in March but the run rate expected from this cooperation will be between 120 and 140 million within the next three to four years.</p>
          <p>On top of all that we are also going through a efficiency program especially in reducing complexity. The offshoring activities have actually been quite successful but not as successful yet in realizing the onshore benefits. The compensation we're working on a model as everybody else does although we've already had a system in place which was not that different from best practice in many ways. The bonus pool has clearly been down substantially, but in a very performance-related way. So there are businesses who had record results and there was a very good quarters and others got very little or nothing. So that is how it would work and I think that it was understood and accepted by our people.</p>
          <p>Some of the outlooks, I don't want to repeat, much of that has been said, including the revenue pool which we think is growing again, the global pool. And, of course, you have some potential of companies, some competitors which have merged or exited, and, of course, we think that they can gain market share just by exploiting this vacuum in between.</p>
          <p>We have had some positive results and progress in some of the areas we started only some years ago. That's primarily commodities, U.S cash equities and bank brokerage. We are benefiting now from the concentration which leads to higher bid offer spreads. You see here the before crisis and what we see right now. And it is the same of course on the CB&amp;S's. And the greater concentration which leads to higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Maybe to jump to the summary, the capital ratio is over 10%. We think it's solid. You know that regulators are actually not pushing us to do more because they are very much concerned about credit supply. So there is absolutely no need to do anything on the capital side. We have clearly reduced our exposures in legacy positions quite dramatically. Also, trading assets, and as I said we do more there. The liquidity and funding base has been very strong, almost no need to tap the capital market this year. And we have a reserve in liquidity, where Hugo will quickly talk about. We have several efficiency measures under way. And I think we have, we positioned our businesses to the current environment.</p>
          <p>As I said this morning, January has started well. Our revenues are 2.8 billion. That is slightly below the record in 2007, but much higher than any other year, of course including 2008. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much, Joe, and thank you. I've agreed with Hugo that what I would do is I would show you where we are right now and how we got there and then Hugo is going to walk through where we go from here, yeah?</p>
          <p>So in that sense, let me start on the group summary level. Again I think these numbers you are familiar with. We did disclose the net income numbers obviously in our talk release a few weeks ago. They have not changed, but now you also see the entire P&amp;L. So our loss in Q4 was pre-tax 6.2 billion and for the full year 5.7 billion. I don't think that any of the ratios do make much sense looking at the losses.</p>
          <p>The segment results here for the fourth quarter. You definitely see that in the fourth quarter the loss was driven by our CB&amp;S business, while as Joe mentioned already the GTB business was positive and we had a one-time effect driven loss in Asset and Wealth Management as well as the depressed profit in PBC. There was no impact from corporate investments. We obviously based on the bad market did not start and we had very limited sales of some of our industrial holding shares, which obviously with market values as they were in Q4 didn't contribute too much to our bottomline. And here you see the 6.2 billion in losses.</p>
          <p>The net revenue development on the next sheet shows for the first time a negative net revenue in Q4. I think that explains how severe the conditions were out there that actually where for the first time we had negative net revenues. That also obviously now depressed the bad performance in Q4, depressed the number for the whole year at 13.5 billion. If we add back to this net revenue number our markdowns, which were 7 billion for the year, that gives you what the underlying run rate for Deutsche Bank was in the year.</p>
          <p>Let me now go through the non-interest expenses and I have to dwell a little bit on this just to make sure you understand it. Obviously the cut in non-interest expense is primarily driven by the compensation and within the compensation primarily driven obviously by the reduction in bonuses. The bonuses, the dynamic in the bonuses we always have to consider. We did, as Joe also demonstrated, we did have quite a few well-running business, and then we had quite a few business that provided the big losses. As we have reduced bonuses all across the bank, we did not do it to a lesser degree obviously in those businesses that were performing, and obviously to a much stronger degree in those businesses that did not have positive results for the year. So that's why you will feel definitely, there is obviously a bonus pool that was used for last year.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, on our non-comp costs, also here it is explained there was quite a dynamic within it. We did point out for you some one-offs here in the chart, so you can do the yearly -- the quarter on quarter comparisons. But the main issue within this, that whilst we were doing a head count reductions and cost reductions in non-performing business, at the same time we were continuing to build out and develop our positive businesses.</p>
          <p>This morning we also had a question about cost of the platform. There was quite a bit of dynamic going on, so yes, we did cut the head count, we did cut costs in those areas that were lower performing, but on the other hand, we thought it was a good idea to invest into those businesses that not only in Q4, but that on a going forward basis will provide for good revenues for the bank.</p>
          <p>If we go to the next chart here, I have four, and I'll cover the fifth topic that I think we were busy the entire year on, right? These were the assets that we will call in your terminology, Joe, the first epicenter of the crisis so far in these topics. And what we want to allude is that really we have the risk here by year end, substantially all these positions. Some of it got re-classed, but obviously when we re-classed, we had a very high scrutiny on it that the true underlying value of these assets was high and was acceptable. It needed to pass all our reclassification standards, which meant that its intrinsic value needed to be much higher and substantially much higher than the current market value based on available market values.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, outside of this re-classes, we did have quite a bit of sales activity going on in some of the de-risking that also resulted in our balance sheet cut on a U.S. GAAP basis, obviously are linked to these positions.</p>
          <p>Now let me cover the Monoline topic, and I think we will provide because this is an area that we see you struggling the most, and we understand that you see the big difference that we have in our valuation versus other banks in the market. And that's why I just wanted to cover this in some detail. As we announced on the 14th of January we have taken additional significant provisions against our monoline counterparties on Q4. And these amounted &#x2013; again I will repeat this number to 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>And they are driven by three factors: specific additional provisions against certain monolines including those currently under restructuring, an overall increase in exposure to monolines to the decline in fair value of assets on which they have written protection to us, and a review of the loss given before the assumption in our normal credit valuation adjustments. So these were the three drivers that made us make this additional adjustment.</p>
          <p>Now the Slide Eight that you show here summarize on our monoline position as it relates only to the U.S. non-conforming mortgages, the most critical part of that monoline intraportfolio. There was a modest rise in our overall exposure in Q4 driven primarily by further markdowns on our remaining Alt-A portfolio. The limited size of these markdowns is explained by the quality of the underlying Alt-A positions, significant elements of which, and that's really would like to point out significant elements of which remain AAA-rated with high subordination levels. So we're looking into the asset quality that is in short.</p>
          <p>As you can see we've made further provisions in respect of non-investment grade monolines in the quarter such that our residual exposure is almost entirely or highly rated in performing monoline counterparties whose precision and performance is monitored and directly confirmed by our credit risk management function under Hugo's supervision.</p>
          <p>Our relatively modest residual exposure to non-investment grade monolines is also partially wrapped by other investment-graded counterparties. Now that's the critical part and we feel on the critical part these assets that we have provided enough and that we're well covered. And to be honest from no credit risk point of view, no finance point of view there is not any need at this point to provide further assessment where the reserves are written down on this.</p>
          <p>On Slide Nine, on the next slide, now we take out all the rest of the assets. We summarize our current exposure to monoline counterparties in respect to all the other asset classes that we have intra monolines. This exposure is increased from approximately three billion during Q4 reflecting the significant market dislocations and the sell off of credit-related assets that occurred. The positions protected cover a broad range of asset classes and in the main we are happy with the underlying quality of large elements of this portfolio. Due to the level of subordination that we enjoy compared with current and expected default rates, 70% of our protection here is with investment graded monolines. In addition, the majority of our non-investment grade exposure is through monolines which post-restructuring are expect it to be of significant improved credit quality.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we've made additional provisions in the quarter where we have concerns about counterparties' ability to perform based on close, in-depth reviews and of the current financial position and the likely degradation, or an a likely degradation of bank assets. Any further degradation is also mitigated in part by further broad bought protection.</p>
          <p>So in summary, therefore, given the high quality of much of our monoline protection, the good quality of significant elements of the asset base protected our credit review and provisioning approach. We feel absolutely good about the way how our monoline positions are reflected in our financials. I hope this additional disclosure provides you with the same comfort.</p>
          <p>Now let me go through the next topic that you have concerns about at this &#x2013; the topic around the Level Three assets, yes? And here is the first good news is and that we also would have to some degree expect it to come differently with this huge deterioration in markets. Essentially with so many markets basically drying up and therefore the non-availability of prices for so many markets. We would have expected this position to grow much more significantly. We were able to maintain it at the previous year's level.</p>
          <p>You see a change in the structure of it that is clear but that was all the impact that this aberration cost. And again wanting to be very clear on this too. Why we don't feel so uncomfortable despite the fact that we &#x2013; this is also a position that we will continue to de-risk. Don't forget we have on Level Three only assets &#x2013; those assets where only one significant parameter was sufficient to classify an asset into Level Three so far. One significant parameter that was not market observable was enough for us to classify an asset into Level Three. We then went through the model for features. All other determinants of this valuation calculation are market based. So that's why we feel that these positions are also largely, to a large extent, as good as any market pricing can be right now. Because in most of these cases it truly only was one, none of several parameters that moved this asset into this place. We did do some stress testing upon this portfolio and we will disclose the range of the stress testing as well.</p>
          <p>Capital and balance sheet, I think we covered the capital ratio so I can take time and jump over this slide quickly. I'm sure you will have some questions about Tier 1 capital development that are quickly shown here. Obviously the negative net income had a negative impact, but then we had several measures to improve our Tier 1 capital.</p>
          <p>On the IFRS balance sheet I think you're all experts on this topic by now. Hopefully you'll see the large market value of our derivatives the position that grew that actually drove growth of our IFRS balance sheet, but as you can see on the lower parts of this bar, on the light blue and grey bars, there you'll see the significant de-risking that we did throughout this quarter.</p>
          <p>On the next slide I show this development again in detail and we did want to disclose to you what the main drivers of this market value changes were and you'll see it was primarily driven by changes in interest rates. We showed in other charts the volatility resulted in Q4, same for credit derivatives and for lesser extent, also currency that we saw less of volatility in Q4.</p>
          <p>On the U.S. GAAP pro forma I think it's &#x2013; you'll see the total manage reductions and the good news is with a few exceptions it was, there were reductions across the board. Obviously you see the loan book did grow, and our cash and deposits with banks did grow, which is a good thing, and then obviously the net of our derivatives balances also grow, I think I explained the main drivers of it. And again Hugo's going to go into this position in his presentation to explain all the remaining risks.</p>
          <p>Now this chart in a very simple manner gets to the comparison between the balance sheet on a quarter-by-quarter basis and it tells you how the difference was and the most certainly amazing part of it, almost more than half of our balance sheet, IFRS balance sheet now, is market balance of derivatives and assets. That as you have seen throughout the year is subject to great market volatility.</p>
          <p>On the next slide we show our leverage ratio again which as Joe alluded to is more of a benchmark for us to see how we compare to U.S. peers. In that sense we do correct both our profit for U.S. GAAP including obviously fair value accounting for on debt, and we obviously correct our balance sheet in terms of making it comparable for U.S. GAAP basis. So you can really take this number, and as Joe alluded to our next near term level we will like to achieve is the 25%. I will caveat that gain because obviously in these numbers also exchange rate is always the unknown, you know a large part of our balance sheet is U.S. dollar denominated and then a little caveat that we have to put on these numbers always.</p>
          <p>Provision for credit losses, we had an increase but it was primarily driven by re-class effects. We have provided the re-classed numbers in the back for your reference, but here you see that it was primarily driven but we did also see some increases, especially in some of our credit portfolios outside of Europe, outside of Germany, sorry.</p>
          <p>Our problem loans are here in this statistic. They are obviously based on the current positions have increased, that it is a re-class effect in this as well. And therefore, the coverage ratio that you see lower here, is impacted by the re-class effect. It would have been around 61 without, if you eliminate the re-classing effect.</p>
          <p>Let me move now to the part that definitely continues to be our strength thanks to the good work of our Treasury Department. As you know our unsecured funding base, and I am showing you this chart in strength in several times, continues to be you know very strong. There's no weakening in this position at all. And the short-term funding that you saw here grey dark bar is cash, is covered by cash and liquidity and reserves, as you saw also on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So Deutsche Bank's funding position. So we will in the year '09 require only a small amount. Some of this is already covered, and you see that we continue to have, in light of the market conditions, still comparably acceptable CDS spreads.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Stefan. And I'd like to walk you through the big balance sheet items which are from questions. When I hear comments about Deutsche Bank's capital then at times I feel the discussions are a little bit academic, what is the right ratio? Is it 10%, 8%, 12%? The capital is a function of the rates that we carry on the balance sheet so, therefore, we need to talk about asset quality and what I would like to do is talk you through the big blocks, the big four blocks that make the bulk of our assets on our balance sheet so that you have a better understanding of our risk position.</p>
          <p>But before I do that, talking about these four blocks, which are our derivative portfolio and our non-derivative trading assets, then our reveres repos and securities borrowing and our lending and event loan book. Before I do that I want to lose the word on netting.</p>
          <p>The big confusion of all this encounter is that quite many questions which is the right accounting methods for derivatives? Is it U.S. GAAP or is it IFRS? I don't want to get into a debt debate, I'm not an accountant by profession, but I'm now in the derivative industry since 1990 and what is done in the derivative industry through ISLA and other industry bodies we have changed or have helped changing old bankruptcy procedures in every single industrial nation in this world and in many, many emerging markets. The bankruptcy loss in this world net now derivative exposure. So if a counterparty goes bust, all the positive and all the negative replacement values of a swap portfolio are automatically netted. So it really doesn't matter what the accounting says.</p>
          <p>In the nations, if something happens with the counterparty exposures, these exposures are netted down to a net number and that is the real risk because at the end of the day you crystallize a portfolio when a counterparty defaults and you crystallize it in a claim forward on the assets of that company and that claim is according to the legal procedures and the laws of the many countries of this world and net numbers. So therefore it's the right thing to do looking at the net number of a derivative portfolio. So therefore I'm only going to talk about net numbers.</p>
          <p>Can we move to the next slide please? This gives you an impression of how our derivative portfolio is composed. We have an exposure of 128 billion, which represents the replacement value of our derivative portfolio. So if we were to close the bank today and said we want to sell the bank, then this would be the value of this portfolio, what counterparty owes. And we can look at it as if it were a loan book. And as you have loan books, so you have mitigants. Nobody leaves their loan book without any securities or supporting documents or covenants, and that's exactly what we do. So we have, for instance, 16 billion of collateral that doesn't qualify to be netted against the portfolio. Under the accounting terms it's only cash that qualifies to be netted against a derivative portfolio.</p>
          <p>So therefore any security that we have shows up here, but the risk is substantially different because you actually have securities and you have securities with haircut, so we don't take the face value of these securities. Then 7 billion out of these 128 are exposure to exchange rates, where the replacement value as such doesn't really matter because you're going to deliver the physical good. That's very important. So cash never flows. The physical good is going to be exchanged, so therefore the exposure as such isn't a real exposure and these exchanges, these are institutions like London Clearing House, or whatever there is, so there are sufficient support and are supported by entire industry in order to make sure that we can exchange transactions without settlement risk.</p>
          <p>Then 10 billion out of this portfolio are to sovereigns, so to industrial treasurers, Ministry of Finance, central banks, so that is not a big risk either. And then for 34 billion we have other mitigants. And other mitigants, about a third of this 34 billion is where we rank senior to the entire pool of asset, and let me illustrate that with an SPV. So sometimes we have transaction where we swap the portfolio of an SPV, that SPV may be part of another group, or it may be one that we have on our balance sheet. It doesn't really matter, but the structure of these SPVs is always the same. We are senior to the entire pool of assets, so the recovery value of these assets would have to be close to zero before we were to sell the lot. And that's typically how the whole thing is structured. That's one third of the 34 billion.</p>
          <p>And the other around 20 billion are something that is, once you understand how netting works and how the accounting rules are, something easy to understand. Quite often we have net exposures so on a netted basis it's negative, but we cannot under accounting rule set it to a negative number, so we set it down to zero, and it is the difference.  So where you cannot collect already, believe across the accounting rules says this is too uncertain and you may not be able to collect it, in reality you know that because you owe that money, so you would not pay as a banker to a bankrupt company 10 million just because you owe them under contract. You would keep that money back and wait until you have the discussion with the bankruptcy judges. So that's something that we have too. Of course, accounting rules don't recognize that and, therefore, we overstate the exposure.</p>
          <p>But in reality what I have here is a loan book equivalent of 61 billion. And I split the 61 billion into the components that you get an understanding of the type of quality. And frankly when I look at the average portfolio quality of our loan book which is just between BB+ and BBB-, that's my loan book and that's the loan book of the entire banking industry. And this is a pretty strong loan book, and history actually shows that we have almost no losses on this loan book. So if I were to apply Basel II default rates on this then the result would be a gross exaggeration because we have never seen that and in what time, they're not in this one or in 2002 when we had to beat recession, would we see losses on the, and that would map to these ratings. That's a very high-quality book and I think that's something that should be mentioned.</p>
          <p>Now you could also say, well, this is derivative book, it's not a loan book, so it fluctuates. How do you control the fluctuation? How do you want to make sure that on a net basis it's not suddenly 300 within a quarter? And again, so the, if I give you the number, how it was in June 2008 compared to December 2008, in June 2008 it was 113 billion and now it's 128 billion. It's pretty impressive given the disruption that we had.</p>
          <p>And the reason why the book as such didn't change a lot is because we do a lot of derivative business with counterparties they use to manage their risks. And these various movements that we have in there, they have a tendency to net each other out. So equity usually doesn't move in the same direction as the rates nor does the foreign exchange move in the same direction as the commodities. And all these have a very damping and mitigating effect.</p>
          <p>When I go back to June 2007, before the crisis, that book, all right it was smaller at that time, was at the level of maybe 76 billion. So that tells you that this book is not a book where you suddenly wake up tomorrow and it's 300 billion larger than you assumed.</p>
          <p>Now we can still say a move from 76 to 128 billion within 18 months is a huge move, but then what happened it is. So Stefan has shown you what are the movers in these books. The movers in these books are not the commodities or the equity pieces, they are highly volatile. The movers are interest rates. We are the largest interest rate derivative house in the world and that is reflected accordingly. What did industry do 18 months ago? Industry believes that interest will go up. Everybody talked about inflation. What do treasurers do in such a situation? They start to hedge. They think interest rate levels will be higher so therefore they locked in interest at that point in time. So they were, if interest were 4% at that point in time, they locked it in and paid us 4% fixed rate and we paid them floating.</p>
          <p>Now we're living in a 1.5% interest rate environment. That's the whole difference. That's why the thing went up by so much. But even the fact that interest rates were cut by more than 50% over the last 18 months, the movements are actually relatively long. This is a big portfolio. A portfolio with one medium last rate in it and that's something that this should give you some confidence. We would have had accidents with so much &#x2013; such a big trade volume left, right and center if that book were not controllable and we feel actually very comfortable as to say and as I said our loss record is way, way below what you see on a traditional loan book for the single reason that this is &#x2013; has a lot of mitigants, can be netted and can be managed much better than a loan book can be managed.</p>
          <p>Let me move to the second clause I want to talk about. That is our non-derivative trading assets. Sorry I forgot one thing. Could we go back? One thing I wanted to say here. We as management team we are not happy with the fact that we still have 61 billion of unsecured exposure and what we are going to do, as you have seen that the book is growing as we started initiatives in order to collateralize this exposure too. It's very simple. Insurance companies and corporations in the past have never provided collateral agreements and that limits the amount of trading that they are willing to do with them, but that's true for the entire industry. So as we start these initiatives we will get more cash as collateral. We will even help them to manage moving cash collateral back and forth and that will immediately offset. So the management initiatives started will reduce the 61 billion further and the discussions that you currently can follow on European level, within America too, that derivatives clearing houses are considered to make established within the near future that would have a very beneficial effect, too. Once these exchange mechanisms are in place, you trade through a central counterpart. You put up margin, so then all your derivative trading is collateralized. So that means that most of these risk weighted assets would actually disappear.</p>
          <p>Let me move now to the second block, the trading assets. You have seen that we had substantial reduction of the assets from 532 billion on 31st of March to 247, and I have combined here the non-trading assets together with, I showed you that on the first chart, you don't have to look it up. This book is composed of various blocks. We have corporate bonds in it. We have bonds of financial institutions, of banks in it. We have commercial paper in it, government and agency paper, equities, traded loans.</p>
          <p>And you may wonder why do we need such a big book? And the reason why we need such a big book percentage wise is relatively simple. The biggest part of that portfolio is used to hedge our derivatives. So 30% are used as hedges against the derivative. So therefore that risk of that 30% is immediately mitigated because it just falls off, but not every derivative you find a good hedge. So sometimes it's easier to take a U.S. treasury to hedge an interest rate swap and taking another entity might be more cost efficient. So 30% of that book through all asset classes is used as hedges against derivatives.</p>
          <p>Another 15% of this book is used to produce ETFs. You know the exchange traded funds we were so successful with. The exchange traded funds have for our bank they produced a lot of good things, give investors access to specific securities and all that, but we have to lend our balance sheet in order to produce these ETFs. These securities that we produce synthetically, they actually at the end have to sit somewhere, and they sit on our balance sheet. As a matter of fact, they sit in SPVs which are dedicated to specific ETF that they issue, but as you know Deutsche Bank consolidates its SPV for a long tradition, and we told you that from the very beginning of the crisis that our SPVs are on our balance sheets. So therefore you see them in here. Another 15% are prime brokerage businesses, so we lend against various types of collateral. These are primarily hedge fund companies. We have very decent margins and very decent haircuts on that.</p>
          <p>And then the last 30 is &#x2013; or the last 30% is open trading. It means we have as a major market maker, we make positions and if you have no bread on your shelves you can't sell bread. So you need some inventory in order to be in the business. That's what we are needing.</p>
          <p>Now in order to talk a little bit about the 60 billion, for instance. The 60 billion government paid from the agencies is roughly split a third, a third, a third. A third are G-7 countries, a third are emerging markets and &#x2013; not really emerging markets, only where there are mature financial markets like Singapore, Korea or India. And then a third are agency paper.</p>
          <p>Now this is quite a large number. We have reduced that number as you see from 154 to 60. We can reduce that number further and we are in an exercise to determine how much inventory really do we need in order to make markets. Do we need per paper 20 million, 100 million, 200 million? Of course for the investors it's wonderful if you have billions of inventory because then they can execute trades but it comes at a cost. It comes at the cost of balance sheet. It comes at the cost of leverage. And you are currently optimizing it and you are not there yet. So you will see further reduction in this.</p>
          <p>The second big block's 94 billion. A big number again, 94 billion. That's &#x2013; in there you find our bonds that we have for banks, corporations. You find some of the SPVs that we have. You find, for instance, the monoline exposure in there that Stefan just alluded to. You find some commercial paper because you are a big commercial paper market maker. And you find odd things like a 65 million CLO executives which under accounting rules accounts for four billion of that whole thing. So you find all sorts of things. But let me talk a little bit about the risk. Let's talk about bank this quarter of bank stock that are in there.</p>
          <p>Why do we have banks in there? So we produce credit default swaps. If you produce credit default swaps, and Joe said it very clearly, we don't take directional risk. We don't ride fence. And on the other side of the balance sheet you go short that banks stock &#x2013; that banks fund. And because we do these type of things we need considerable amount of that. Another thing that we are doing is our &#x2013; both our money market desks as well as our bonds trading desks, they trade in this paper. So the money market trades for instance in commercial paper. They trade in money market funds. They trade in bank CDs. They trade in the short dated bonds. I mean a bond is short of 12 months then it gets in there. And that's a typical type of thing we do. So that's something that we do this in order to suit the purpose. We don't do that in order to have carry trades. Now again this one quarter is necessary to do that. So we are not flexible on the CDs, but in order to make market, how much do we need? That's a debate that's going on and you can be assured that this number is coming down.</p>
          <p>Another third after this number is corporate. There the story is exactly the same thing, but in the corporate side the stuff that needs to produce CDS is much larger than financials because you're write, when you look at the product offering of Deutsche Bank you write more corporate CDs than we write the financial institution CDs. And the other things that I refer to. I would say financial in corporates, this is one number that we see that in the future that's going down because we know there is stuff that they can reduce further that we don't need all the inventory and as we have committed to 25% leverage, this will be one of the areas where the deduction will come from.</p>
          <p>Then the next one is equities. Very similar story again. I can actually repeat that again and again so out of these 44 billion, a quarter is prime brokerage, another quarter our EPS, another quarter are for producing indexes in our global Equity Derivatives addressed for smaller price. Again it's very similar. I personally believe that this number will not come down because we don't have that much inventory. That will remain and as we build our equity business and become more a cash equity house as is our strategy, that number will probably go up because we need a little bit more inventory.</p>
          <p>The traded loan is exactly the same again. So once again a quarter is for prime brokerage because we finance loans for hedge funds. We do that. Some of that are structured trades. We structure trades for clients and then issue a credit link notes to the clients because they want to have exposure to certain loans which can only be done in certain jurisdiction. So we give them synthetic exposure that's exactly the same, so there is close through the balance sheet, but as diverts as it's on the balance sheet and therefore you see it and I don't want to hide that five billion out of this are still of our prop trading, which we have marked so much and that the residual provision, which we are going to sell and as you know selling everything you needed is not possible, but that is going to be disappeared by the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>The other is relatively simple, we started to go into the commodity business. If you're in a commodity business you have to be able to trade physical commodities otherwise you can't trade them. Two thirds of that are the physicals that we need in order to do that. So what I wanted to tell you with this is this will not be the final number. We will be much tighter in what we give with our traded as inventory. We have curtailed them a lot. We didn't really focus on the inventory we traded. We didn't lose money on these things, and when you count them back from 532 to 247 it wasn't that difficult to cut it back. So we don't need the inventory at the level it was, and we are going to reduce it until we are at the right level, and that's a little bit trial and error until we are there. But again today, the 247 number will be lower, I believe will be lower probably at least 60 billion. And that will help us to achieve our leverage target of 25.</p>
          <p>The next one is the third block. Our re-provisions that we're doing, and I'm showing here what's on the asset side. So here we lend money against securities. Just by looking at the chunk of sovereign issuers, that is a huge part equities. These are all very liquid equities. That's a very liquid book. It is up to 93% can be liquidated within three months. And what is equally important, more than 90% of that book is Central Bank eligible, so if you want to purchase, we can. But the bank fulfills a very important role in the financial system. We take securities of other people and advance cash against that. And it's actually a very profitable business and has become a more profitable business over the last 18 months, because we are one of the few banks which have the capital strength and the funding strength to be in the business. And believe me, there are a lot of people who need liquidity. We provide it at very decent terms, and that's one of the businesses that we are going to stay in.</p>
          <p>My fourth slide is, that's the last one, that's the risk composition of our loan book. And I think in this room we all agree that whilst the crisis for fair value banks for the trading book may come to an end, the crisis in the loan books is going to start with the recession biting all around the globe, so it's worth having a look at this loan book and what makes it different.</p>
          <p>I got asked after the press conference this morning why our loan loss provisions have increased so sharply, and some analysts have expressed concern. It's not because our loan book deteriorated, but when we re-classified certain assets and moved them in the banking book, so we made sure that they are in that banking book at the right price, to hold them to final maturity. And that required about 350 million of additional loan loss provision flowing through this. When you look at the loan loss provisions, adjust that for that number because the run rate, the true run rate is actually much lower. And that true run rate will help your understanding the quality of the book, which I think is particularly strong.</p>
          <p>The biggest block in this loan book is the German mortgage book, the loan-to-value ratio that we have in this loan book is on average 68%. It's very low. In Germany, we have never been in the home equity business. Consumers didn't leverage themselves up through their house prices. As you know, the house prices were flat over the last ten years and the clean out of the &#x2013; the clean-up of the real estate bubble in the late 90s hasn't been forgotten. So that's a very strictly managed book.</p>
          <p>We are still cleaning that book up, so contrary to other banks which have enjoyed for many, many years loan losses of one basis points in their mortgage book, we have every year 30 basis points. And it comes very slowly, but the areas of Eastern Germany, the ones where young people leave because there are no jobs, this is something that we have for years. It's very predictable, but it goes slowly and we will, even in 2009 we will have another 30 basis points on this book on loan loss provisions. And you can calculate yourselves how much that is.</p>
          <p>The next big book is our investment grade and German mid-cap book that we have and as you know, we have decided to hedge this book, so more than 50% is hedged. Anything above on average 70 million is hedged, so we have no concentration risk and we do that through a various type of instruments, that's a CDS, we did that through CLOs.</p>
          <p>We were even able to place a CLO in early 2008 when the markets were closed. People liked that product and we will continue to do so, and that means that we have not the type of concentration risk we had in that book, in the credit crisis 2001 and 2002 where big hits like the names that you're familiar with, WorldCom, Enron was hit, hits were taken, still hit us. But they will hit us at much lower concentration risk. And we believe that the losses in this book, they shouldn't exceed somewhere around 100 million in a worst case. So we may have three companies that toppled, but that will make that up and that is in line with both bottom up and top down analysis.</p>
          <p>The next big block is our GTB book. That's something completely different. That is intra-day finance, working capital that we need to run our cash management systems. It doesn't mean that it's totally risk free, but our experience is that we almost never lose any money with this. That's a track record that goes back almost 20 years. And then we have our trade finance business that liquidates itself. So, and that has quite often a cash component in it specific of any due advance payments, so for the loss experiences I can personally only remember of one loss in 2004 in Peru and that was a single-digit number. And then the other thing that is in there are structured exports credit. And they're all covered by government guarantees. So we don't finance exotic projects in emerging markets and our government guarantees each cover always 95% of the risk.</p>
          <p>Then the other block is our, in the German language you call that Lombard credit, margin credit in our private wealth management business that is fully secured. The loss experience there we have is almost nothing. The next 15 are the small businesses that we have in our retail business, you know the dentist, the lawyer, the two people repair shop, these type of things, which because they have retail characteristics we have put them in there. I would say that the amount of money that we could lose in there shouldn't exceed 150 million in 2009, which is roughly 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now the reason why it's higher, we have a small portfolio, it's less that half a billion of construction exposure in Spain. I think with the current recession in Spain it would be an illusion to believe that we won't lose money there, but it is an amount that is digestible and the exposure small. None of that has defaulted yet, but then I would be surprised if it were not.</p>
          <p>Then we've had 12 for corporate investment you want to write at these. It's very simple. We helped rescue high real estate and that's no secret that the signed up for this amount is government guaranteed and over collateralized. There's nothing that's going to happen there. Then you have substantially collateralized by government secured in other mitigants. This is just a structured business that we have time for to achieve certain tax transactions, or tax benefits, and they are all collateralized, have no credit risk.</p>
          <p>The next one is an interesting one. We talked about that 18 months ago when completes were the big theme. And you remember that we said that our completes were all consolidated, we have on the balance sheets, here they are, they're part of our loan book, you see them here. But that's externally financed with commercial paper, and as you remember from the discussion. So we take client receivables in and refinance them on their behalf, these appropriate haircuts. And the haircuts are actually pretty steep. We stressed this in this portfolio several times, and it's almost impossible that they could run a loss. In addition to that we have asset replacement clauses. If you don't like an asset, you can ask the corporate customer to replace that asset with something else. And then the consumer finance business is small in Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>We have no indication in our key risk indicators that things deteriorate. Compared to other countries, our performance is almost impeccable. We lose on that book only 200 basis points. So usually in good years, American banks lose 450 to 500. We find similar rates in the United Kingdom. And I'm sure in the recession that will go up. We have no indication that, that would be the case. And we think therefore that, that book will probably have about 300 million losses, it's largely compensated by the margin. The margin after credit losses is above 5%. So it's a good business.</p>
          <p>Then we have a couple of collateralized structures, 14 again. So these are tailor-made corporate finance deals. We have specific types of collateral in order to achieve this. Sometime it's bridge financing, sometimes we take the shares of a company, sometimes we take other receivables. That's the type of business.</p>
          <p>Then the 8 billion that we have, these are the deals that we did with a couple of institutional investors to sell some of our leveraged finance transactions. I told the press conference this morning that some of the sales is supported by partial financing, this is this financing against their haircut. It has equity in it and we believe that, that they will perform well.</p>
          <p>The two areas which probably carry the highest risk are our leveraged loan book and our commercial real estate book. The leverage loan book we talked many times about. It was for the longest time, 5 billion. The fact that we have now 14.billion, 9 more, is due to the reclassification of some trades. We only moved over what we were 100% sure is not going to default. And some of the stuff we're actually restructuring because it provides good corporate finance opportunities and for that reason we want to keep the whole thing together and not sell it piecemeal because it has much more value to us this way.</p>
          <p>And commercial real estate is the same story. The good thing is our exposure to commercial real estate in the United States has by and large disappeared. Remember we had quite a bit in the beginning, we have now two very small pieces in where we financed transactions and we have one single one which isn't that big either in the U.K. other wise it's continental European stuff, it's not in Spain and it's safe and solid.</p>
          <p>And I think about the other, see I don't want to talk because it's insignificant in appearance of size but what I wanted to convey you is that when you go through that loan book, is it conceivable that they are going to lose more than the 750 million through loan loss provisions that we had in 2008?. It is conceivable, we will have hits in the investment grade loan book, we will have hits in the S&amp;E business in Germany. We will see a hit here and there in the leverage finance but I think that the loan loss provisions will maybe be a third higher than the run rates that I used, the 750 million, but they will not double, or they shouldn't double because we prepared that book that well and it will definitely not reach the sky rocketing high end level that you see in other banks.</p>
          <p>With this, I conclude my remarks and I think we move now to the question-and-answer session.</p>

          <p>Yes. Thank you Hugo, Stefan and Joe. I think we covered a lot of ground but as Joe said in his opening remarks we are fully aware that the market asked for this transparency and we try to be as supportive, as helpful as we can.</p>
          <p>Now we go directly into the Q&amp;A and I will take questions first here from the auditorium in Frankfurt and then later, if time permits from the telephone conference. So we start here and may I ask you to press the button and state your name and company. Thank you. Dieter?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. It's Dieter Hein from Fairesearch. I know it's not an easy time for you to present in these times, all the figures and you tried to give us some confidence and therefore I've decided I appreciate very much that you gave us very early, a guidance for 2008. Nobody could oversee the market developments and therefore I would like to ask you Dr. Ackermann to join with your expectation for the current year. I'm sure you have a scenario calculation and regarding maybe pre-tax profit or operating profit or whatever you want to tell us what's your view, what is the maybe best case and what is the worst scenario, worst case scenario, what you expect for Deutsche Bank in the current year?</p>
          <p>Second question, I asked it I think three weeks ago at the telephone conference, it's investment banking. I think you was prepared very well in the early financial market turmoil in the second-half of 2007. And as a result from CB&amp;S were very good. I think you have expected, this is my interpretation that we got a turnaround last year, which did not come. You, my understanding is that what you said, you want to be one of the early birds when we have a turnaround in the investment banking business. And that you expect then Deutsche Bank very well prepared and master of the universe.</p>
          <p>How sure can you be that at such a turnaround the level playing field of investment banking is still the same? If I look to the current crisis and what other governments have to do to help the banks, I could think or I guess that there will be some restrictions. Maybe not in the first-half year, but when the crisis is over that the governments say we want to avoid a similar situation that we had with similar losses for this stage. Therefore is there a risk that there could be restrictions for investment banking business model. Could you maybe give us your feel on this as well?</p>
          <p>And then, sorry, my last question, regarding Postbank, I can understand very well that you want to balance more your result mix and to increase your retail banking business. What I do not understand, that you give your three years time to decide to take it over or not. So if you want to take it or increase your retail banking business, maybe we could discuss if Postbank is the right one? But maybe I think you should do it very early. So I do not understand why you need three years time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to answer to all three questions. If I knew less, I could say more. They're all very, very dangerous questions. Let me start with the turnaround restrictions. First of all I think I'll gladly admit, well not gladly, but I admit that we felt that in the second quarter last year, beginning of the third quarter markets are beginning somewhat to normalize. In hindsight maybe it would have been better to continue aggressively to cut positions. We did so at the early, at the start of the crisis as you remember, especially in the sub-prime situation.</p>
          <p>But then, of course, you felt a little bit that especially those areas where we got hit most now we discussed that and we felt that this is really the core franchise of the bank and if you cut here too deeply and things really turn around we may regret that. So we cut all the positions, but not the ones, which were not really in the middle of the storm. And in hindsight it was wrong, but you also don't want to be naked when the situation starts improving.</p>
          <p>Then of course Lehman came and changed the whole picture within hours. And then you couldn't move and it, I was asked by journalists what was the most difficult part in the fourth quarter. The difficult was that you were stuck with possessions you couldn't liquidate and you just saw how much value they lost every day. And normally I am very eager to see the daily P&amp;L. I tell you before Christmas I stopped looking at it, it just was awful. And every day you lost that much and you couldn't move anywhere.</p>
          <p>So yes the turnaround was expected and it didn't happen. And now we are of course in a somewhat similar situation, because there was some turnaround in January, that's why these very good results, especially in sales and trading, so pieces came back, but also the flow business was doing well. And you ask yourself to start again, now a change or is it just an interim phase and hits us again, and that's why this time we are reacting differently. We even set aside reserves in January and said reduce exposures whatever it costs.</p>
          <p>Now maybe this time we are overly conservative, but based on what we have seen this is the right approach, so it's a little bit of dilemma you are in. Now the restrictions going forward, I don't think so much will happen. First of all, investment banking as a business will be needed to finance corporates but, also to finance emerging economies, you need a certain change in businesses. So what will change? You will certainly have going forward some more scrutiny on risk rated assets, measurements in the trading business. We have gotten some indications, of course, already from the BIS and that would not be dramatic. Yes, you will need some more capital over time but we are talking about a three, four, five-year time horizon and would absolutely will not be traumatic. In that sense we would not expect too much.</p>
          <p>In the short term absolutely nothing happened. So on the contrary regulators and I can tell you that, frankly we our angry with some analysts for pushing the bar too high. They don't want that because we are now at 10%. There are still some big banks hovering around 6, 7, 8% today, and to push them over 10 means that they have to reduce risk-rated assets and of course add, certainly, not value to the credit supply situation that we are in.</p>
          <p>So absolutely no understanding we had at BIS conference with central banks and some banks regulate this. And there was a lot of anger about the fact that the financial markets are asking for higher capital ratios than the regulators do and they don't understand it. Actually, on the contrary, there are some saying we should reduce capital requirements in order to push banks to lend more money and to support the economy. That is much more the general feeling.</p>
          <p>In terms of products, yes, most likely we'll see some skin in the game will be required. That is, in our case, already happening in many cases and Hugo and I once discussed it to see what that means. That is not a material impact on our business if the originators assume that it would be foolish to retain certain pieces. Many clients do that anyhow already.</p>
          <p>So from that point of view I don't think that will be crucial. Markets are a little bit more important probably ask for more transparency and less complex products, but that is something we already decided to move ahead like this anyhow, as I said at the beginning. So I wouldn't expect too much from them. No, I'm pretty sure that all those who are always criticizing investment banks unfortunately will be dead wrong. Because those who will hit now will be the banking books and the commercial banks and not the investment banks. And the investment banks will get out much, much quicker.</p>
          <p>And of course you have just much more, much more leeway to make 30, 40, 50% jump in revenues in a month that can not happen in retail nor in private asset management or in asset management because it's very difficult to gain market share and to have this kind of momentum, in sales and trading, and you can do it then. And we have seen that unfortunately in both ways and that is the risk in that as we have seen in the fourth quarter. But now of course it's for the time being going the other way around again. Now Postbank, well I think I will answer that question once in five year's time. It's just much better. It's just much better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you still then at Deutsche Bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, not me, not me. I will call you from my retirement. To be very honest many banks have things to digest and it is better to have time and to do it together over time and I think that is the real answer, maybe a little bit between the lines. Nothing bad, nothing, but we all know that products, structured products and some portfolios the way we do our valuations, the way we do our, it's a challenge. And I think we want to see some time to digest that and that is the real reason. And the second reason is that it is not so easy now to do the full financing. I mean our capital costs would be very high too.</p>
          <p>And the third reason is in the current election year to go through a restructuring is not the easy thing. I think you have seen that before. 2009, well of course you have our plan, but the plan we don't want to disclose is very difficult to say. I think it would clearly be wrong to analyze annualize generally. It will probably also be too conservative to assume similar trends as we have seen in the fourth quarter and even if it happened would hit us less. So our expectation is that we are having a, I would say, a somewhat good year from today's perspective, but not a record year as we had in 2007. I think that is something we will not see for a while.</p>

          <p>While we take the next question, in the interest of time I would ask you to limit maybe to one question if possible. Joachim, next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Joachim M&#xFC;ller, Chevreux. I have a question regarding capital management. I'd like to ask you with a view to value creation. You've got 19 billion of capital allocated to your investment bank. I mean that's still 50% of your capital that you have and I would argue that the cost of capital for certain types of businesses has certainly increased, so that's probably also why you are shifting out of some business while you are shifting towards more the liquid products.</p>
          <p>Could you give an indication on A, the total level of equity assuming flat risk weighted assets, of course that you deem sort of like sufficient for the investment bank, and you want to allocate going forward because I would argue quite possibly banks tend to go out of some businesses because of higher cost of capital related to that where value creation is minimal. And then B, from the mix shift that you have outlined I think on page 19, could you tell us how much risk weighted assets reduction you actually expect from that? Because I would assume that it is lower risk business. And then finally on your overall capacity to reduce risk weighted assets also relates to the reduction in your leverage ratio to 25, maybe you can outline what you expect there in terms of overall development? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hugo will you take some on the risk related assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I talked about the derivative book, when I said that we started a couple of initiatives, for instance with the netting rules, if you can net so your capital charge will be calculated under a net basis. So therefore, we started a program to move more of the trades from jurisdictionary component to ones where we can net. So that's something you can negotiate with the client. We will increase the level of securities that we ask, or collateral that we ask to support trading. And we will fold trades together.</p>
          <p>In other words, if you have a big portfolio and, for instance, you trade with 19 subsidiary of a financial institution, then you have everywhere 19 time the net numbers. So you can collapse in one financial sensor, you face Deutsche Bank as one entity. So therefore, all these trades net out. These synergies, when you go through them, have actually substantial risk-weighted asset benefits in it because your exposure is shrinking and it helps you in achieving that leverage ratio. It helps you saving risk-weighted assets. How much it will be, I can't tell you at this point in time, because we're doing the work. But we believe that we will have sufficient capital to support all the growth initiatives that you outlined through these internal initiatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I may just follow-up. Do you think of the business in terms of capital allocation or more in terms of risk-weighted asset allocation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well at the end, it's almost the same. So risk-weighted assets translate into capital. And we now, as you outlined, the split, which is in the investment bank, that is as we currently are. So we need to develop businesses so that will be an overnight thing. We cannot just say, okay, now it's one-third-investment bank and two-third the rest. That doesn't do the trick. We really need to build the businesses, do it organically and that will then achieve the capital allocation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Matthew Clark, Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. Can I just ask a question on equity derivatives? You lost a lot of money there in the fourth quarter. I would suggest that maybe you haven't been charging your clients enough as a spread for those products and services. Do you think you could continue to have the pretty strong market share of the equity derivatives market going forward if you do charge your clients more in order to compensate yourselves a bit better for the risk there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's quite likely that they're going to lose a little bit of market share because I think your point is the right one. The complex equity derivatives transactions require a number of hedges. Sometimes there are maturity mismatches. Sometimes you have to dynamically hedge the position. That means we have to go in market when the markets are very adverse. And as you all know, the price of options is the biggest lever and the price of options are actually, the volatility. And instead of having to price the options at, volatility of average 25, we have to pay the price of 100. And that money's lost forever. So will we be able to do that in the future? Yes. But we will have to charge a price. We'll have to build bigger reserves for these things and that will change the price.</p>
          <p>The good thing is everybody's in the same business. So that, it wouldn't effect or just hit Deutsche Bank. We had a big book and therefore got hit disproportionally, so one of our conclusions is not only that we were too complex and didn't have enough reserves, one conclusion is we did too much borrowing wise, and that is what we're going to reduce. And that helps us then with other things, balance sheet deduction, leverage reduction. Again, so it ties into the same rate and makes our business less complex.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the trading book, I mean this substantial reduction in inventory, what do you think that's going to do to your client revenues, both absolute and relative? And how are you going to achieve the kinds of market share gains if at the same time you're massively reducing your ability to provide clients with product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's obviously the reduction has some impact on clients, especially if you do it around year end, and I think it's fair to say that we did have some discussions with clients, but they understood it. But in other policy, we're very, very active and we really kept the lines open and were perceived as a very loyal and trustworthy, competent counterparty. So I don't think it has a major issue on clients. And in addition, some of the assets you used were simply &#x2013; a little bit simple carry trades, where we said that's easy to make some money on that, but that's not what we want, and let me get out of that. So it was not so much client related, and certainly not as important, not loan book related, especially important in Germany.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh hello there. I had two very quick questions. The first one is on Level Three assets. You will give a sensitivity analysis of the unobservable parameters in report and account, and I think in '07 it was a delta of plus three and minus two billion. Could you tell us what the '08 figure is please?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question is on provisions. Thank you, Hugo, for the extra disclosure. That's very useful on the loan book. If I understood you correctly, you were saying you didn't think provisions could be higher than a billion in '09. But if I take out the IAS39 impact in Q4 it was 400 million already in Q4 and annualizing that gives me 1.6. So what's going on in Q4 that I shouldn't be annualizing that figure and comparing that with your one billion possible run rate for '09, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stuart yeah, hi this is Stefan, I'll start to your question on Level Three assets, yeah. So this number by the way is still a work-in-progress, as I said, but expect around a billion plus/minus on top of the old numbers. That's kind of where it's coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the loan loss provision is relatively simple. When we transferred the assets in the banking book, so we adjusted it, and because you hold them to maturity so you have to adjust them to the price that you believe it's feasible for maturity. We do not foresee this type of loan loss provisions on these assets for the year 2009. I personally think, if you want a number, so I think it's a loan loss provision number of 1.1 billion is probably a reasonable number for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the Q4 provision was 591 and if I take out 185, for the IAS39, then that's giving me 400 for Q4. And I guess most people think the world is going to get worse, not better so annualizing Q4 would give me 1.6 not 1.1. Or is there something else other than the 185 that you've adjusted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that, all the stuff that we adjusted that you would recognize as loan loss provisions but which aren't really loan loss provisions or they had to do with equity underwriting and similar things. But the true run rate for the year was 750 million in loan loss provisions, which were comparable to what you saw last year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. On your IAS39 reclassification assets, could you tell me what's the mark-to-market unrealized markdowns would be if you would mark-to-market.  And secondly, the details that Hugo provided were very useful, but if I look at your hedging losses of roughly four billion, about 20% of IB capital. And I look at your fluctuating losses at around 12 times your value at risk, I wonder how should I look at the risks that is in the IB going forward in a stress scenario that we had in the fourth quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And there's the P&amp;L effect, there's the risk weighted asset effect. There is a loan loss provision effect and the asset effect. And there you will see that in the fourth quarter we reclassified with 11 billion much less assets than we did in Q3. And then you'll see their respective numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kian, on your question about the risk in the investment banking and the instant trading. So let me start from the back. I think we all agree that VaR was never good in stress times. You know that VaR is calibrated over the last 360 days. It's benign. And it shoots only up once here in the middle of the crisis. So I think VaR level, I hope it never derives comfort in the bank from the VaR level that it just doesn't tell you the risk level. So therefore it's probably a debate that's not worth having. What really happened in investment bank is basically very simple.</p>
          <p>So the prop loss is very easy to understand. So we had loan positions that were devalued and the loss is 1.4 billion as you can see from it. And that business has been largely shut down, so you've seen from the charts that Joe showed that this credit and equity prop rating has been de-risked by 90%. So, you can make your own numbers and you'll see that these events can not be repeated even on the worst circumstances. The second thing is, what happened really with credit trading and equity derivative trading. And again, it's a chart that is very important to understand that is when you look at Joe's presentation is the basis risk.</p>
          <p>We all know that Deutsche Bank is a wholesaler, that means we produce financial instruments. These financial instruments on the one side of the balance sheets are always hedged with physical instruments, or an index on the other side. Where we had physical instruments let's say Euro to CDS that was hedged with the corporate bond on the other end, where we had that we were exposed to a type of risk that nobody else had faced in our life and which our models did not properly capture either, and I think that's true for most banks. That's the basis risk and the basis risk between cash and synthetic products went to over 300 basis points on average. In our example it wasn't that much, but that was the driver.</p>
          <p>So what we have to do is in the fourth quarter we have to rapidly close that basis risk and we were actually successful but it took us a while to find counter parties who were willing to take that basis risk away from us and to close it. At this point in time it's about 80% closed. It's closed in a way that we can lift these hedges off of some of the &#x2013; off of this basis should it come back in a favorable way even when the basis improves, at this point we haven't lifted anything. So, you can look at the bank where basis risk is much better controlled and much better managed then it was before.</p>
          <p>But as I said though, Lard doesn't tell you the story now and didn't tell you the story before the blow-up of Lehman, and therefore we need to talk about what really happens in the bank.</p>

          <p>In the interest of those on the telephone. In the meantime Joe Ackermann had to leave us but we are prepared to continue with the call and take your questions. Maria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Philipp Zieschang, UBS, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions. One is on asset wealth management and also the retail bank. I mean stripping out the underlying, or the one offs basically, the underlying result looks roughly breakeven for both of these divisions. Could you just comment how you see those develop going forward in a tough market environment? Whether Q4 was a particularly bad quarter, and whether there were other effects in there which drove the underlying result, that one?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just quickly on the &#x2013; again on the Slide 28. You said that the mark ups basically left you with a positive revenue number. The footnote on the risk-weighted asset number, which says additional capital demand, am I right in assuming that basically it's 10% of the 3.2 billion is the additional capital hit? So, is it fair to say that the entire exercise, if I apply a tax rate of whatever, 30%, to the 3.3 billion pre-tax, and deduct the 10% of equity to be allocated to the risk-weighted asset growth, led to about a two billion increase in your common equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is, of course, the &#x2013; I can't follow exactly your math. But, of course, that's exactly this incentive, the IAS reclassifications have as you go on. If you look on Page 28 and you see the relationship between the October re-classes, the amount of it, and the risk-weighted asset charge that we had, and then as we moved on &#x2013; our experience, that we are getting higher risk-weighted asset pressure on any re-class assets. That has something to do there, obviously, in the October ones where we certainly had the lower hanging fruit and now it will work through. So there is in this incentive, also by the way, as you've seen in the loan loss provisions, that obviously had increased as well and then we have to take, when we re-class this positions. So I only can say yes, it does drive up our capital need. And therefore you see also in our behavior already, why in Q4 that number was substantially lower.</p>
          <p>Don't forget also that obviously the financial incentive was higher in the October re-classes because we had this going back to July 1 valuation, which definitely was positive on the P&amp;L &#x2013; on a going forward basis, if you re-class on the day of the reclassification, you're re-classing to current market value so there's is not this big impact anymore that was a result of this going back to July 1 valuations.</p>
          <p>So overall, this re-class issue, I think it's &#x2013; sometimes as I read some of the comments blown out of proportion, I think this would stay minimal. It is a tool that puts us at even playing field with U.S. GAAP at the end and that it makes both accounting standards more comparable. And again, we have put some strong rigor in it, Hugo also alluded to it that we don't want any assets here to be re-classed with intrinsic value is not correct. And to some extent, it's not positive and therefore to some extent, our view on this is that this is the most, the proper way on how to assess the value of these assets. It does not contain some of the market exaggerations that we saw on some of the assets. That's bottom line on what it is.</p>
          <p>But underlying here, this is good credit quality, good underlying loans to good companies that are paying, that are well rated and so on. And so the mark-to-market valuation here was just really exaggerated. So that's how we look at it but you will see that as we move on, there might be just less volume. Also what I'd like you to contemplate, 36 billion of assets re-classified versus our total balance sheet size is certainly not a big number of re-classes.</p>
          <p>On PBC, your question on the underlying, obviously that's a good question and that's obviously a core question that we have been asking ourselves. I think to take Q4, Q4 was just the worst of the storm. And to extrapolate now from Q4 numbers into a whole year, at least in our view, would be definitely exaggerating. There was obviously in PBC, the whole brokerage business dried out of course. If a storm like this occurs that creates a lot of customer uncertainty and we basically saw no customer, or very minimal customer activity. We were betting a little bit on that legislation, tax legislation change in Germany to see some more customer activity. But think about, if you even wanted to restructure, pre this tax change your portfolio, you would have had to take some losses in the worst quarter you could as a customer. And it was clear that not many customers went out and changed their portfolio and realized losses that they would have.</p>
          <p>And in asset and wealth management, of course, we lack now the performance fees. The performances fees weren't there. We didn't have the performance that was expected. So most of this performances fees was performance fee-driven and they dry up. So we don't, and actually in our planning and our looking forward, we don't expect that Q4 is, in these businesses, in any way representative of the underlying business.</p>

          <p>Yeah good afternoon. In the investment bank in Q4 it looks like, from your very helpful disclosure, 100% of the underlying revenues actually was made by FX, money market and rates, if you take off some of the one-offs. I was just wondering to what extent do you think 2.3 billion in FX rates in money markets is a sort of sustainable number or was that just an outstanding quarter? Because it seems to be 2.5 times last year's. And then secondly, to what extent, as you go into January, have you started to have a slightly more balanced makeup, particularly with the tightening of credit in the investment bank? Thanks.</p>

          <p>I think Joe showed in his chart where he is alluding to the mix of business that will have in our investment bank. He alluded to that's exactly the part of the business that we expect to see continuous growth. Now give and take some volatility but at the end, you know, the target, as you saw on this chart on how the new structure of the business will look like, that's the areas we expect to grow. So it was not a single aberration, we think that we will see continuous growth in these areas.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I would like to ask a question on basis risk. As far as I understand you haven't had write-backs on basis risk to say so in the fourth quarter. Am I correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the fourth quarter we put in the hedge to avoid further losses on basis risk and we haven't lifted that hedge yet. It has significant upside potential in this hedge, provided the basis risk drops to where it was before Lehman. But we aren't there yet and therefore it's completely premature to talk about the lifting of any these hedges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and maybe we would like to go back to the auditorium here in Frankfurt. Are there any more questions you would like to &#x2013; Stefan [Dresdner Kleinwort], maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I would like to come back to the question of market risk control, where, I have to say, you provided a lot of very helpful information about your risks but, actually, still very little about this risk which, I guess, provided the near death experience in the fourth quarter. You said on the one hand side that you're aware that valued risk doesn't tell you much. At the same time you said that, when you were asked about capital allocation, that you're using risk-weighted assets which are using a value-at-risk driven measure of risk.</p>
          <p>So, independent of what the Basel II or Basel III will tell you, given what you have experienced in the fourth quarter, where you have basically lost your value-at-risk every day, how are you going to approach this philosophically, culturally, in terms of changing your risk management on the market risk side? I guess there has to be some kind of reaction, and then probably a big scaling up of the risk capital that you hold for market risk, value-at-risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the &#x2013; it's a little bit different. So we never manage the market risk with value-at-risk. That's a number we use for regulatory purposes. And if you go through the industry, there's broad consent that you can't manage market risk with value-at-risk, for the simple reason that it doesn't tell you the full truth. So it has two major shortcomings. So it has historic data, which don't tell you what the stresses actually are. And the second is a lot of that risk that we have diversifies away, so, therefore, as soon as the correlation goes to one so your actual numbers are quite, are much, much bigger than they are in this model.</p>
          <p>So we never use that as the primary measurement. We use stress tests, and our entire economic capital is based on stress tests. The economic capital for market risk, for instance, was, in the month of December, somewhere between &#x2013; I can't remember the exact number, 4.5 to 5 billion for market risk alone. That gives you a very different picture. And it's calibrated to a one-off event, where we say it can really be a very remote tail event, but it wasn't enough either. So, did we really expect that we will have basis risk of 300 basis points? We have used stress scenario in many, many areas and they were not sharp enough, so that will change.</p>
          <p>Now our internal capital allocation, whilst we reported to the outside world as risk-weighted assets, it is actually based on our economic capital. It's not based on VaR. So the way that the regulatory VaR for market risk is so low, so we will never do that. So we have much, much higher capital in the investment bank, because it's based on our stressed scenario-based economic capital. We don't need to change it, but would we have to have sharper stress tests underlying our parameters for basis risk? The answer is yes.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I just would like to come back on the NPL and risk provision trends. You mentioned that you've somehow changed your loss-given-default assumptions for the monoline exposure. Have you done anything similar to the rest of your loan book? Have you changed your expected loss assumption? And I mean, you gave very good disclosure on the top assets in your loan book, but have you done a stress scenario and leverage what you get to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you can't take for everything a stress scenario otherwise you get completely unrealistic numbers and what is then the stress scenario to use. So what we do we review these assumptions all the time and now under Basel II you have to look at your history all the time in order to gauge the number that's used for the regulatory process. And the &#x2013; in every recession the recovery rates come down. You see that all the time, so you need to adjust them anyway. And I think our process will capture the lower recovery rates without needing additional stress tests.</p>

          <p>Carsten Werle of Oppenheim [Sal. Oppenheim]. Question relating to the Asset and Wealth Management business. When we look at your net new money figures I think they're actually quite disappointing in Q4. It looks like that you had quite significant outflows in Germany particular on the asset management side and private wealth more outside Germany. What do you consider the reasons for this? And I'm also looking for what would you consider the remedy? I mean is there a risk that we see declining margins, because you have to make more contribution in terms of prices, etc.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well one of the things they did, so they moved money out of equity funds and stuff like and moved it in our deposits. So we saw a climate where people thought just, there's too much risk out there, let's go into the safety of deposits, so some have compensated like this. And others went even further and moved the money then into TBs directly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, to add to this, first of all there was a different development a little bit between Private Wealth Management and Asset Management. Asset Management is certainly stronger impacted by this. And in the position obviously only to clarify also the market value component is in there. It's not only customers leaving, but it's also the valuation of the portfolios which shows the downturn.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I have two risk management questions, if I may. The Asset and Wealth management, I would like to dig a little bit deeper in the 217 million REIT infrastructure asset investment write down. Is it really a one-off, is more to come? Because Hugo you were telling us that it was something you took for the fund management part, but which meant it didn't go to the fund. So I would like to dig deeper into if it is really done with or not? Second is on the capital, on the structure of your capital on Page 13, the 1.2 billion uplift in Tier 1 in the presentation. There is, part of it is full pension fund assumption changes. I would like to know how is the quality of this and what you have changed exactly? So is it coming back? Or is it really a ongoing issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On this impairment, this &#x2013; the one big impairment in there, it issued at close this number, yes, that's a one-off. And that part of it is done with, but that's the problem of one-offs. They tend to come unexpectedly. So at the end, it's very difficult to say if we will have other one-offs, but this one in particular was taken care of. Now the pension fund issue. Again, I alluded to, under IFRS one of the big problems was comparing what you owe to your employees in terms of pension commitments versus what you &#x2013; what the value you had against it, what the asset values against it, as you know. You then have a positive or a negative. Deutsche Bank has always had a policy, to be very conservatively funded and always be in a net-positive position so that the value of our assets is higher than the liabilities that we have to appease.</p>
          <p>Now you know that, on the liability side, on the pension liability side, there's a lot of math that goes in that drives this number. Obviously it's certainly also the discount assumption on the one hand, it's a big impact on the other hand. It's also the age of human beings tends to increase as so on, that's a volatile number. And then on the other hand, market valuation of the assets is the other volatile, so on both sides of that calculation you have volatility. And that's why the old system in IFRS was to avoid an extreme P&amp;L volatility for that component, was to provide this corridor system. So 10% plus, 10% minus of that volatility change you did not need to record for P&amp;L as a gain or a loss. If it went above this 10% corridor you would have to take the hit but over the remaining life of that liability. So, which was not a big impact but had to take it and then continue on.</p>
          <p>So IFRS always intended to take volatility out and kind of with all the developments it didn't quite work and therefore there is this other option, which was provided the same as option three, to which IFRS will finally migrate to, which is basically just to take the full impact but take it directly to OCI or take it directly to capital. So what for Deutsche Bank basically happened is we decided to make this accounting change, by the way which I had done previously years ago, yes and it basically all it does is it now moves the benefit, the current benefit we have to equity. Will this generate now volatility in terms of equity, yes, of course. Yes, as you know these parameters are highly driven by these calculations, it will.</p>

          <p>This is a very short question. I'm Andreas Weese from UniCredit. In Q3 conference call you gave the first indication for the incremental risk charge and I would be interested if the 50 billion increase in risk weighted assets by the end of 2011 is still valid?</p>

          <p>Yes, we had no change to that number but again what has changed in the whole, is in this time we were discussing and there was a lot of question whether regulators would act quickly in changing systems and changing &#x2013; I think what we have seen over the last couple of months and the last couple of weeks that everybody understands that currency and capital ratios, current systems are basically sufficient. We've seen a mind set change, it doesn't make sense, I think that's what we understand the regulators have concluded, is to change systems at this point in time and to kind of put even more pressure on banks and worsen the situation in the general norm. I think everybody in the first mode to react to something had a different view so to be honest we had more this feeling that if changes come they will come, certainly much more later than we did expect even a few months ago.</p>
