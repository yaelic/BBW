      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report very strong results in the first quarter. They reflect disciplined execution across our businesses. Now, since we reorganized the company 18 months ago, we have consistently focused on market-driven innovation, differential allocation of resources, and productivity. And this focus continues to pay off. Each reporting segment contributed to our robust performance this quarter, and as a result we are raising our full-year earnings guidance.</p>
          <p>Sales were up 18%, with double-digit increases in every reporting segment and in every region. The largest volume gains were in our growth segments, Safety &amp; Protection, Ag &amp; Nutrition, and Electronics &amp; Communications. Success on the top line is directly connected to DuPont's innovation that our customers want. And I'd like to share a couple of examples of how our businesses are driving growth and differentiation through new products.</p>
          <p>The first example comes from Safety &amp; Protection. We work closely with law enforcement and military to address their needs for protection, and we took our groundbreaking Kevlar XP technology that was already commercial for law enforcement vests, and we extended its unique construction of Kevlar fibers for hard armor application. This new material enables weight savings up to 20% while maintaining essential ballistic protection, a significant benefit for the soldiers and the officers who risk their lives every day. Most importantly, this innovation allows lighter, thinner helmets than ever before, and it's designed to work in helmet manufacturers' existing equipment. Kevlar XP for hard armor is also going to benefit from the new capabilities and supply from DuPont's Kevlar facility expansion in Cooper River, South Carolina, which is on track to start up at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>A second example is from Performance Polymers. Last spring, Diane Gulyas announced the launch of a new family of products branded as Zytel PLUS. These resins provide a step change in heat-resistant properties and open up new opportunities for metal replacement in automotive application. Thus they reduce weight and improve fuel economy. During the past 12 months, commercial adoption has been 75% faster than previous launches of a similar nature, and the size of the development pool is over 60 programs, which is outstanding this soon after launch. Last fall, General Motors won an award from the Society of Plastic Engineers for the most innovative use of plastic based on Zytel PLUS. And in short, there's just great momentum with this family of resins with the innovative approach to light weighting, which is squarely in the sweet spot of the mega-trend to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels.</p>
          <p>Now, there are plenty of product examples in our Ag business, and since Jim's on the call today, I'm going to let him talk about how innovation is contributing to their strong performance this year.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, growth in the quarter was broad based. One of the standout achievements was our performance in developing markets. Many years ago, we recognize the importance of these markets, and we laid the groundwork with the basic sales force and people skilled in application development. And over the past five to six years, we added research and development laboratories in locations like Shanghai, Hyderabad, and Paul&#xED;nia, Brazil. Localizing the science is a very important part of our growth story. And through these labs, we're able to identify and directly service local needs tied to the mega-trend of increasing agricultural productivity, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and protecting people and the environment. And the result of these efforts is that for the full year of 2010, developing markets represent 32% of our total company sales. And in the first quarter, sales to those markets grew by 30%.</p>
          <p>Moving to the bottom line, first quarter earnings per share were up 23% versus prior year, and if you peel back that to the segment level, pre-tax operating income excluding pharmaceuticals was up 31%. Earnings benefited from price increases significantly outpacing higher raw materials and energy costs. And furthermore, we remain vigilant in our focus on productivity with respect to fixed costs, variable costs, and working capital. And we are tracking well against our full-year targets in all three areas.</p>
          <p>So let me elaborate with one example of how our Coatings business is seeing their productivity efforts fall to the bottom line. This quarter they reduced total fixed costs as a percent of sales by 380 basis points compared to the prior year. This resulted from a combination of restructuring actions and plant-based projects driven by DuPont Production Systems. In addition, the business improved their working capital in the area of payables by nearly 20% using tools and best practices through DuPont Integrated Business Management &#x2013; we call it DIBM. The team drove payable productivity through a detailed review of contract terms and through Six Sigma Lean projects.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to give you an update on Japan. DuPont was very fortunate that our employees and their families are safe and accounted for, and comparatively speaking our production and research facilities were spared from major impact. Our Utsunomiya manufacturing and technical facility was the most impacted, and it's well on its way to being repaired and restarted. The DuPonters in Japan and around the world have been working tirelessly with our customers and our suppliers to provide assistance and develop workaround solutions and get back to business. This is a challenging situation, as always. Our focus is on the customer. We continue to help our Japan-based customers and partners restore operations and productivity in the markets they serve. It's too early to estimate the full impact of events in Japan. We'll continue to monitor and stay very close to the development there.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to Nick. Nick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>I'm delighted to report that in the first quarter, DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter, and we're off to a great start for the year. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation we laid over the past two years. You can see that the momentum from the previous two years is continuing into 2011.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals. And we'll start with Slide 2, which is the summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share on both a reported and an underlying basis was $1.52 compared to $1.24 in the prior year. Consolidated net sales of $10 billion were up 18% versus the prior year, comprised of 9% volume gains, 8% positive local price increase, and 1% benefit from portfolio changes. Volume was up in all segments and in all regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions, reflecting our continued strong pricing discipline.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the corporate view of the first quarter, looking at earnings per share analysis on Slide 3. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.27 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable costs, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to be very proactive implementing price increases in the face of anticipating increase in variable costs. Excluding volume, currency, and portfolio impacts, first quarter raw material, energy, and freight costs were up 8% versus last year's first quarter. For the full year, we now anticipate an increase of about 10% to 12% over 2010. This is up from our initial guidance in January of about 4% to 5%, with about 3 percentage points of this increase being metals-related. Volume improvements resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.28 per share compared to the same period previous year.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all segments and major regions, with double-digit increases in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and EMEA. There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 4. As we told you during our Investor Day in December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed costs productivity in 2011, and we're on track to meet that commitment. Year over year, currency was a $0.01 benefit in the quarter. We believe this will continue as a tailwind for the second quarter and full year at current levels.</p>
          <p>The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.07 variance. Reduced Pharmaceutical earnings were a $0.14 negative impact. First quarter pharma earnings were $50 million, in line with our expectations and about $170 million below what the prior year's performance was. Our full-year 2011 estimate for Pharma pre-tax earnings remains about $200 million, approximately $290 million less than that in 2010. Next on the waterfall is higher shares outstanding, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. On a fully diluted basis, we had 941 million average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2011 versus 912 million shares last year. This includes a 5 million share repurchase that we enacted in the first quarter. The last point on the EPS waterfall chart is our first quarter 2011 base tax rate, which was a benefit of $0.04 versus the prior year. This base tax rate this quarter was 21.3% versus 23.4% in the first quarter of 2010. We continue to expect a full year 2011 base tax rate in the 20% to 21% range.</p>
          <p>I want to highlight the difference between our first quarter base tax rate of 21.3% and the effective tax rate of 15.2%. The difference in rate is caused by taxes generated from our balance sheet hedging program we refer to as exchange gains and losses or EG&amp;L. When the tax benefit on EG&amp;L is matched with the pre-tax loss, the quarter-over-quarter impact of the exchange gains and loss is $0.05 benefit, and it's included in the Other category of our waterfall. We've provided more detail on Schedule B in the news release to show you the exact impact of our hedging program and the effect it had on our effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 5. First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $1.8 billion. Higher net income was offset by increases in working capital to support the strong revenue growth and capital spending for expansion projects. At the end of the first quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis, versus first quarter 2010, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by 14%, reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity gains in the area of working capital this year.</p>
          <p>Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that. We paid our 426th consecutive quarterly dividend in March. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. In summary for the first quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started in the fourth quarter 2009 continued and expanded. This, along with our market-driven innovation, pricing discipline, and productivity focus, delivered strong quarterly results.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to the second quarter 2011. We expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue but in a more moderate pace than we've experienced to date. As you'll hear from Jim and Karen, we continue to see strong demand globally across most of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Slide 6 for our full-year 2011 outlook. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. We're raising our guidance from a range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share to $3.65 to $3.85 per share. This excludes the impact of the planned Danisco acquisition, which could reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis. The main driver for the increase in our guidance is stronger business results, especially in Safety &amp; Protection and Performance Chemicals, as well as in the developing markets. In addition, we see some benefit from the currency from weaker dollar. These are somewhat offset by increased pressures on raw material prices, increased share count, and the Automotive &amp; Electronics supply chain impacts that we've seen from Japan.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to talk more about Ag &amp; Nutrition segment. Jim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nick.</p>
          <p>Ag &amp; Nutrition is off to a strong start for what we expect is going to be another year of growth across our businesses. On Slide 7 you'll see sales grew 18% to $3.8 billion, and earnings grew 21% to $1.1 billion. Our teams delivered volume growth in seeds and crop protection products, good net price realization in seeds, as well as good execution and integration of our PROaccess strategy. Earnings growth were underpinned by increased sales, which more than offset increased costs.</p>
          <p>Starting with seed sales, first quarter reached $2.6 billion, an increase of 19%, with 10% higher volumes, 6% U.S. dollar price gains, and 3% impact from portfolio changes. While each region posted solid sales growth, two-thirds of the results reflected strong performance in North America and an early strong start in Europe.</p>
          <p>Specifically in North America, sales increased moderately as we continue to relentlessly execute our "Right Product, Right Acre" strategy. The growth represented net price gains, underpinned by new product introductions, as well as volume growth, on top of a strong start to the season in the fourth quarter of 2010. There are numerous North American successes unfolding in the 2011 selling season. A few examples include the successful integration of five PROaccess partners, the fast penetration of P-Series corn hybrids to about 40% of our lineup, and the continued strength of Pioneer brand soybeans.</p>
          <p>But perhaps the most exciting is the most traction of the industry's first integrated and reduced-refuge product for below-ground insects, Optimum AcreMax 1. The product, which is initially targeted for northern Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas, will be on more than 3 million acres this summer. And this is simply a phenomenal product launch. Growers saw it in demonstration plots in 2010, and they're planning it in big numbers in 2011. And remember, this is our first in a line of integrated reduced-refuge products that we'll bring to the market. Our sales teams are again placing demonstration products of our 2012 commercial launches with key growers as we speak.</p>
          <p>For example, we're demonstrating Optimum AcreMax above-ground insect protection products and Optimum AcreMax Xtra above- and below-ground insect protection products. We're planning to have well over 1,500 growers gaining firsthand experience with these products this summer. Both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax Xtra products are pending EPA approvals, which we estimate to be in around the third quarter of 2011, in plenty of time for 2012 planting.</p>
          <p>Turning to our European seed business, increased corn sales reflects a nice rebound to the ag economy, net pricing gains, coupled with an early start to the season, which creates some timing differences that significantly favor first quarter. Ag crop protection sales were up significantly, as higher volumes more than offset portfolio changes and weaker U.S. dollar pricing. The strong volume performance was a combination of continued penetration of our new products and an early strong start in the Northern Hemisphere, and the channel stocking in response to high grower demand for crop protection.</p>
          <p>On a product segment basis, volume is up across all of our segments of weed, disease, and insect control products. Within insect control, Rynaxypyr continues to strongly contribute to our growth, and based on the rapid penetration we're seeing across all markets, it will grow another 25% in 2011 to $500 million in sales. Importantly, we're on track with investments supporting the registration and launch preparation of other new products in our robust pipeline, such as land management herbicides and our new fungicides, as we continue to rapidly capitalize on new innovations.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Nutrition &amp; Health business, their transformation work delivered improved productivity as well as improved mix toward specialty products. All in, the execution of their plan delivered higher sales, earnings, and margins in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to second quarter for the Ag &amp; Nutrition reporting segment, we expect sales growth of about 10% and earnings percent growth to be in the mid to high single digits as compared to the same period last year. This reflects strong business performance, but also reflects the jump on the season we saw in the first quarter, which we're estimating at about $0.04 to $0.05 earnings per share impact. Specifically, the seed business anticipates a strong finish to the North America planting season and lower sales in the EU, purely due to the seasonal shifts we saw into first quarter. Crop protection also anticipates broad geographic and product volume growth &#x2013; however, at a reduced pace. Also considered in our updated outlook are absences of one-time net proceeds from a second quarter 2010 divested crop protection business, offset by one-time net proceeds for a sale that was transacted in April of 2011.</p>
          <p>With the seasonal nature of Ag, explaining quarterly performance is always challenging, so let me leave with you an updated full-year Ag &amp; Nutrition picture. We anticipate performing at the upper end of our long-term commitment of 8% to 10% sales and 13% to 17% earnings growth. The plan we put in place back in 2006 and '07 has delivered success year in and year out. The businesses have never been stronger, as we continue to focus on our customers, delivering innovation, and driving disciplined execution.</p>
          <p>Karen, I'll hand it back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Jim.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Slide 8 in Electronics &amp; Communications. Sales of $811 million improved 29% compared to the same period last year, with 9% volume improvements and 20% higher prices, primarily metals pass-through pricing. Pre-tax earnings of $111 million are $6 million higher than the same period last year. Strong performance was led by Asia Pacific, with 26% volume growth. Photovoltaic sales were up substantially, and strong demand for smartphones and tablet PCs also contributed. The business continues its investment in capacity expansions and new products, with a focus on innovation for the PV market. For the second quarter, Electronics &amp; Communications sales are expected to be substantially above prior year, driven by the anticipated impact from metal price pass-through and demand in PV and consumer electronics, with earnings up slightly, reflecting potential Japan impact. We continue to anticipate significant market growth for photovoltaics for the full year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 9 and Performance Chemicals. $1.8 billion in sales was a year-over year improvement of 27%, with a 21% increase in price and 6% on volume. Pre-tax earnings of $394 million were $204 million greater than the same period last year, with PTOI margins climbing to 22%. Robust global demand across TiO2 refrigerants and fluoropolymers gave lift to this segment, and all regions demonstrated growth rates above 20%.</p>
          <p>Though TiO2 gets much of the attention these days, let me emphasize that our Chemicals &amp; Fluoroproducts business also performed impressively. Our Teflon fluoroproducts demonstrated nice growth going into many industrial applications like cabling and coating. Additionally, our industry-leading refrigerants, ISCEON and Suva, were in high demand as we ramped up for the summer. I'd like to recognize our operations teams in Performance Chemicals this quarter. Several of our businesses are experiencing high sales-to-capacity ratios, and our teams ran the plants extremely well to maximize our output.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the second quarter, this is the peak season for many of the segment's products. Performance Chemicals sales and earnings are expected to grow substantially year over year, given tight supply in the face of strong demand for several of our products. Productivity efforts through DuPont Production Systems should continue to deliver additional capacity to better serve the market.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Slide 10 and Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $993 million increased by 10% on stronger pricing and volume gains. Demand was driven by growth in the global automotive market and continued strengthening in the heavy-duty truck market in North America. Pre-tax operating income was $65 million, 44% above prior year on stronger sales and improved operating leverage.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be up modestly year over year, with earnings up moderately. The increases will be driven by seasonal patterns in the automotive aftermarket and continued strength in the heavy-duty truck segment, offsetting a significant decrease in second quarter auto builds due to Japan impact. There's still a lot of uncertainty around Japan. With respect to auto builds, various third-party reports anticipate a 10% to 15% reduction in second quarter versus prior forecasts, or all in about 6% below last year. The expectation is that most of the reduced builds outside of Japan will be made up during the second half of the year, with builds inside Japan not fully recovering until 2012. Full-year global builds are still expected to be up about 4% after a good start in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 11 and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $1.7 billion were up 11% on 7% higher volume and 6% higher price, offsetting a 2% portfolio change made in 2010. Strong demand for high-performance polymers like Zytel and Serlin drove sales into automotive, electronics, and packaging applications. In particular, European automotive performed very well this quarter, as our innovative plastics helped customers reduce cost and weight.</p>
          <p>For the segment, pre-tax operating income was $288 million, a 25% increase versus prior year, including benefits from cost productivity. For the second quarter, we foresee sales growing modestly and PTOI declining slightly versus a strong comp period. Prior year included a $27 million benefit from a gain on a sale of a business and an insurance recovery. As a result of the Japan earthquake and tsunami, automotive markets will have some intermediate-term impacts that are not fully known at this time. However, we see continued strength in other regions of the globe which, we expect to largely offset the near-term revenue impact from Japan.</p>
          <p>Lastly, let's move to Safety &amp; Protection on Slide 12, where we see continued evidence of the mid-cycle recovery. Sales climbed 22% on 14% volume growth with 1% price and a 7% increase from the MECS acquisition, which is integrating nicely into our Sustainable Solutions business. Nomex, Tyvek, and Kevlar all contributed to segment growth, with strong demand from industrial markets. Pre-tax operating income climbed $43 million to $145 million on higher volumes and increased operating leverage. Despite gross spending on Cooper River and other investments, the business delivered a 200 basis point improvement in pre-tax operating margin this quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to second quarter, we see sales increasing significantly and pre-tax operating income growing substantially with, continued operating leverage. We have a positive outlook for industrial and automotive markets overcoming a sluggish housing market. Additionally, our Cooper River facility continues on track for an end-of-the-year start-up.</p>
          <p>And with that, Ellen, I'll turn the call back to you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, Karen.</p>
          <p>And before I close, I want to address the Danisco transaction. All regulatory conditions have been met to complete our tender offer, and we've made our position clear: Our offer is full, fair, and firm. Danisco shareholders have a choice to make between the certainty of our offer or the risks of the deal going away, and that offer period is scheduled to end on April 29th.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to recap my key message points.</p>
          <p>First, DuPont is executing well. We have very clear strategies and plans for each business and strive to constantly raise the bar and outperform our competitors. On Slide 13, you can see an abbreviated version of the 2011 directives that I use with employees to drive focus, to drive performance, and to drive accountability. We also have business-specific commitments that are aligned with these directives and are externally benchmarked for each business in the major markets they serve. We have a disciplined managing process to evaluate progress against these targets, to evaluate new opportunity, as well as contingency plans. We have the discipline and flexibility to respond to dynamic conditions and unforeseen events, such as the tragedy in Japan.</p>
          <p>Second, we remain focused on our customers and our markets. Our relationships and important market insights translate into a number of critical work processes. They range from new product development to customer service to supply-chain decisions. Our customer-focused organization structure also enables us to respond quickly to opportunities, and it's why we're able to deliver 18% sales growth and 23% earnings per share growth in the quarter. A very strong start to the year gives us increased confidence in raising our earnings outlook to the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. And obviously this excludes any impact from the planned acquisition of Danisco.</p>
          <p>Finally, you heard Nick discuss the various headwinds and tailwinds that lie ahead, and I want to leave you with this: In a dynamic and at times uncertain environment, you can count on DuPont. My leadership team understands the levers we can pull to respond to the challenges we face. And whether they're unmet needs of a customer or servicing in a tight market, participating in Japan's recovery, or countering a competitive threat, I believe we've demonstrated as much over the past two years. We're very proud of the track record of executing well, and we are committed to building on it.</p>
          <p>So with that, we are now very happy take your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Nick, I have a question on volume growth, the potential for continued operating leverage. If you look at Slide 16, it shows DuPont's sales volumes are back up to the pre-recession, 2008 levels. I'm just wondering, if you take Electronics out, where are the rest of the businesses? Are they back up to their 2008 levels? And what sort of volume growth prospects do see going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So some of the businesses are back to the 2008 levels or exceeding the 2008 levels, and then there's a couple of areas where there's still opportunity for continued growth. DPC is certainly not at the 2008 levels, because we haven't seen the recovery in the automotive market, although it's been there &#x2013; not at the levels that it was back pre-recession. S&amp;P, because it entered into the cycle late and is still mid-cycle pulling out of that, they haven't reached the pre-recessionary levels as well. But many areas of the corporation have. Ag &amp; Nutrition obviously never really experienced that dip, and they've continued to show that steady growth. And then Performance Chemicals, they're well above the pre-recessionary levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on Performance Chemicals, are you running flat out in TiO2? Just wondering what opportunities you have to increase volumes there with de-bottlenecking. Or is all the growth going to be price related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The business is extremely tight, as the industry is extremely tight. When you look at the high-quality TiO2, it's a tight industry and market altogether. But what we've done and continue to do is drive DuPont Production Systems. We continue to look for remounts of our facilities by utilizing DuPont Production Systems methodology, and that's allowed us to maintain our ability to keep up with customers' demands. But even with that, Don, the market remains very tight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Don, to put some context to it, if you think of the last five years, through DPS and <mark type="indiscernible" />, we've liberated over 100,000 tons of TiO2 from our current production facilities. And so that's the kind of impact that DPS has had on that business and enabled them to really meet customer needs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I have a quick question on Ag. You talked about seed prices going up, but looks like crop protection chemical prices are down. Now, in seeds there is inflation in manufacturing of seeds, and that will be reflected in your payments to the contract growers. So with all that, what's your pricing strategy for next year to offset that inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, P.J. On the seed side, as you know &#x2013; first of all, on the cost of goods question that you mentioned &#x2013; couple of things that we do there. One, I think you're aware that we use a hedging strategy as part of the price setting to help us manage margins, and also continuous effort like we have across the rest of the company around &#x2013; productivity improvement around cost of goods. So those two things are helping us mitigate the impact. And the other thing always to remember on the seed side is it's a high science business, not a commodity business. And so pricing decisions really are primarily driven by the value we're delivering to growers. And we're continuing to bring additional value to growers, which are giving us pricing opportunities in what we expect to be in excess of cost increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just following up on seeds, you said AcreMax 1, the uptake was good. I guess you planted 3 million acres. Your competitor is also introducing new RIB products. Do you see a big shift in grower preferences towards these RIB products? And what does that mean for market share? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, P.J. Yeah, as you know, we're pioneering the idea of refuge in a bag. We had pretty broad exposure with below-ground insect control last year, and that's one of the reasons why AcreMax 1 has taken off so strongly this year. And we're going to have a couple of more products added to that lineup next year. So first of all, we started with below-ground insect control. That's the toughest one for farmers to manage. The refuge has to be in the same field, it has significant yield impacts, et cetera. And so with AcreMax 1 dealing with below-ground insect control, that's been very, very popular. But next year we're expecting to have integrated, reduced above-ground and integrated and reduced above and below. So we think it's going to be a significant opportunity for extra value for farmers and growth for us. We feel very good about our position and our momentum in that space.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ellen, on TiO2 pricing, what's your thinking about how high can prices go? Are we in a period of 20%-plus pricing for the next couple years? And how are you thinking about demand destruction at these higher levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>TiO2 market is a classic commodity chemical that price and &#x2013; goes up and down. You know I ran that business in the middle '90s and experienced both sides of that cycle. And so if you take a look at where price is today, certainly it's unprecedented, but at the same time, the inputs are much higher than they were before, or prices today versus a decade ago on things like that. So the economics there are pretty constant. If you look on a constant, dollar basis, we're not back yet to the '80s in terms of pricing.</p>
          <p>So it's a hard market to predict because there's a lot of things that come into play, but capacity utilization is the major one. And companies are trying to de-bottleneck. We're certainly well on the way to analyze our needs there over the next few years, but it's a dynamic situation, which I personally experienced, which is one then that helps me not predict straight lines in that industry because it's an industry that does &#x2013; that can turn on you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ellen, feedstock-wise, what are your prices up year over year? And are you having trouble getting any feedstocks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the beauty of our production capability is that we can utilize a very wide range of feedstocks, from the very low end to the very high end. So we have an ability to move in the market to where there are feedstocks and really get what we need &#x2013; and obviously, considering our scale, at a great economy. So that capability really positions us well in any kind of ore market, and I think that's one of the key differentiators for us.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Your shares outstanding were up about 30 million shares year over year. Do you have a philosophy in terms of whether your &#x2013; do you have a philosophy in terms of whether your share creep should be controlled or whether it shouldn't be controlled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jeff, this is Nick. How you doing? Thanks for your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, yeah, we do have a philosophy on that. I mean, when we look at the shares that result in outstanding shares relating to the compensation program, our position is we really don't want to see that result in a dilution effect on the earnings basis. But it's not a one-for-one type thing, Jeff. It's not something that every share that's issued right away is repurchased.</p>
          <p>When you look over time at the shares in this category, and you look over let's say a 10-year period, we've actually issued and repurchased just about essentially the same number of shares. So we're right in that line of compensating for any shares that are issued there. But long term, certainly that is our position is to maintain that impact of having no impact from the shares issued with the compensation program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, then if I can follow up, so that's your philosophy over a 10-year period, but what might be your philosophy about controlling share creep over a one- or a two year period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and again &#x2013; well, we bought back 5 million shares in the first quarter of this year. We bought back 5 million shares last year as well. So obviously we have activity to address that creep that occurs, and we're acting on that through some of the shares we've repurchased. It's just not a one-for-one sort of exchange in the exact period.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. First, a question on seeds and traits. I guess, could you address directly the trends that you're seeing in Roundup 1 soy pricing and how you expect that play out over the next couple of years as generic product comes available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. First of all, I don't really see a pricing segmentation based on an individual trait. We're using Roundup Ready 1 trait in our soybeans, but the value that we're delivering with things like Y Series and the disease package it brings, that's &#x2013; we're creating value there. We're seeing net price increases as we continue to bring improved performance and value to customers. So you ask about the post-patent period. That's a few years away, so it may be a little early to predict precisely what'll happen there. But clearly, from our point of view, it's a combination of proprietary traits that we will have, other intellectual property, a continued drive on adding value every year to performance, other services. There's a whole family of things in our relationship with growers that are delivering value, and we expect to continue doing that, and we think farmers will respond to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I guess just more broadly a question on the different segments. To what extent are each of the segments individually implementing pricing ahead of raw materials? I mean, can you characterize which ones are lagging and which ones are keeping up or staying ahead of raw materials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. If you think about it, the segments are very different from each other, but the common element in it is that our pricing philosophy is around pricing for value to the customer. And so from that standpoint, again, if you see, we had made great progress across the board. Electronics is an area where with the pass-through nature of the metal, that you see maybe a margin decline there. But the vast majority of that is based on the metals pass-through. Chemicals is clearly ahead, Performance Polymers is clearly ahead, and in Ag, again it's a value play, so it's something that as we continue to innovate, I think we'll be able to stay ahead of that curve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Jim, in the Ag segment, it sounds like there could be some timing issues. If we consider those in the aggregate, do you feel as though there was any profit pulled forward from the second quarter? And if so, how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as &#x2013; I think I mentioned it, but I'd estimate maybe in the range of $100 million of sales but probably $0.04 to $0.05 of earnings per share that were moved. Of course, we'll know more completely with how the second quarter develops, but that's our best estimate right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then, Nick, on TiO2, any mileposts on your brownfield expansion plans there in terms of site location?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We continue to look at that. Obviously the demand is very high and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> is very tight. So we recognize the need here, continuing to drive remounts of the facility, but we haven't come out yet with the stated location of a brownfield site as to where it would be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Nick, you mentioned that Performance Coating and Safety &amp; Protection are two areas where you have some slack, but outside of those areas &#x2013; and TiO2 is certainly one of them &#x2013; are there any other businesses where you're essentially sold out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; yeah, when I was answering that question, Ed, I was talking about how it related to pre-recessionary time period. It wasn't necessarily saying that every area was sold out except for those two. So I was just trying to point out that those areas are back to or exceeding the pre-recessionary levels. I think you're right in your characterization, Ed, that TiO2 is certainly a tight area. And I would say the other one is probably &#x2013; fluorochem is a tight area right now for us as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe a question for Ellen on the pricing environment. You're enjoying very strong price momentum now. If you were to qualitatively judge it, are you more confident in your pricing power today than you were three months ago? And how would you put this into context, the current environment, in terms of pricing power versus your history at DuPont?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; I kind of hesitate when I hear the word pricing power, because I think people think about that in a certain way. It's just leverage that you have. Our pricing power doesn't come from leverage. It comes from innovation. It comes from incremental improvements in products, new Solamet pastes in Electronics with higher efficiencies, the examples that we gave in Ag and in Safety and in other areas. And so to the extent that we continue &#x2013; and that's why that metric around a number of new products and the percent of our revenue that comes from new products is very important for us, because to me, that's an indicator of the strength of our connection to the customer and the strength of our ability to continue to have higher value for our customer and hence move that price line.</p>
          <p>So that is the goal. That is what we focus on constantly, and I think that some of the momentum that we've seen with the introductions we had last year in terms of across &#x2013; most of the businesses had very, very strong innovation years last year, and we're seeing the results of that in our volumes per share and our price line this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, Jim. I had a question regarding RIB products for '12. I don't think it's a question of semantics. You did not mention AcreMax 2 specifically, although you did mention other lines in the lineup. So where do you stand with respect to your anticipated approval of AcreMax 2 going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Probably a little confusing, Mark, in terms of names. In the early days, we were talking about AcreMax 1 and 2. We've actually changed the name. So the AcreMax Xtra is going to be the above- and below-ground integrated reduced refuge. I think that's the one that you might've originally thought about as AcreMax 2, and that's on track. As I mentioned, we're expecting registration later this year and launch in '12. And then of course the just plain AcreMax will be the above-ground. That's also on track for integrated reduced and a launch next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it was semantics. Second question has to do with how to think about price and mix overall in the seeds business for '12. With the strong tailwind from crop prices &#x2013; and of course your need to pass on cost of goods sales increases &#x2013; do you think you can get real price increases in '12? That is, over and above inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer would be yes. It's a little early to say particularly, because we haven't finished this season, let alone set prices for next year. But I base that on a couple things, Mark. A key is what we see coming through the pipeline of increased performance in hybrids, plus the couple of new products, plus further expansion of AcreMax 1. I think all the different elements are bringing additional value to farmers is really what gives us the opportunity to capture more in terms of price, because we're delivering value to farmers. We feel very good about what's coming through the pipeline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a question on some of the feedstocks, especially the U.S.-based with the shale gas coming through. Can you talk a little bit about your leverage between, say, the propylene and the ethylene molecule, how you're set up there, how you're taking advantage of kind of this windfall that we're seeing now? Your competitors up in Midland today announced a new cracker in the U.S. Can you guys go more upstream? Or does that seem more attractive to you to lock in some of this advantage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So obviously raw materials are on the move, led by oil. And as you know, we're very natural gas based in the U.S. on the Gulf Coast. Our sourcing and our people are heavily involved in making those decisions on a day in and day out basis, and we're positioning ourselves to really try to create the most we can do. But we're only involved in it to a very minor extent that we just purchase some of this as inputs to the value-added products we make. So we don't play in that end of the chemical arena. And so we're dealing with it just to try to get the lowest cost raw materials we can to be able to compete effectively in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so when you think of the two molecules competing &#x2013; because obviously you use propylene derivatives, you use ethylene derivatives &#x2013; where do you see the most substitution happening now that the ethylene molecule on a relative basis is so much more attractive to propylene molecules?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Okay. I'll stay away from the olefins. Jim, based on the expected acres of corn planted in 2011, do you expect your market share to go up, stay the same, or go down?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Based on the expectations, we would expect market share increases, particularly on the PROaccess side, but overall on the seed side. And I don't know if you were focused just on seed, but crop protection growth as well we expect to grow a little bit more that the market.</p>

          <p>All right. Terrific. And, Ellen, obviously DuPont had a stellar first quarter, beating consensus by $0.15. Maybe 4 pennies was a pull-forward from the second quarter. But your guidance for the full year increases by that similar $0.15. Are you being conservative here? Or are there potential headwinds that you see out there that are giving you a little bit more cause for concern as we progress through 2011?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. So obviously we have to kind of call it where we see it, and what's going on today. Nick talked about the headwinds of Japan and share dilution and rising raws. And so I think that &#x2013; and the tailwinds are the &#x2013; kind of where we are from a business standpoint and currency a little bit and things like that. So I think that's why we take a range and we narrowed the range and took off the bottom end a little bit more, and really tried to put it in there. And so that shows we've got some increased confidence by narrowing that range, and the headwinds and tailwinds are just as we discussed.</p>

          <p>Thanks, and I'm sorry to ask about TiO2 again, but it's my understanding that you guys are working to re-up your fixed-priced contracts, although they're not up yet. My question is how likely is it that we can maintain the high margins we've got now when those contracts do roll over? And second, how much of your tonnage are you taking out of Florida, and how sustainable is that? I've lost track of your reserves down there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As have I. So we continue to drive Florida, but that's less than 10% of our total ore consumption. But it's nice to have, and we're advantaged there, and so that's a good thing that we'll play that out until that line's exhausted. The ore industry is moving. Our ability to utilize a wide range of ores gives us a little bit more maneuvering capability than others in the industry that are just focused on high-grade ores and the like. And so I think it's all a relative issue. It's relative to our competitors in that industry. And I think that we're advantaged with our manufacturing process that'll enable us to, whatever the situation is, be able to handle it very, very efficiently.</p>

          <p>Okay. Quick follow-up on cellulosic. We know that M&amp;G now is saying 13 million gallons by the end of 2012. How does that compare against your project?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thirteen million gallons by the end of 2012?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think when you look at our cellulosic ethanol, we have our facility in Vonore, Tennessee, and it's about &#x2013; 250,000 I believe, is the number there. It's been running now for well over a year. We continue to gather the data there. And we're looking really to move forward with the commercial plant. We've already identified that it'll be located in Iowa. We haven't announced the specific site yet. And you can expect to see commercial feedstocks and construction there in that 2012 time period. On the biobutanol side, the alternative fuel that we've been driving, it's meeting all of its milestones, the facility is up and running in the UK, and it's about one year later than the cellulosic ethanol timeline.</p>
