        <plist>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, good morning, I think we are on time. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our Analyst and Investor Conference. I hope you have all had a nice evening yesterday and enjoyed the two presentations.</p>
          <p>As usual, we start with a statement from Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management of the BMW AG. This will be followed by a statement from Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, Board Member for Finance, who will discuss our financial performance in 2011, and a Q&amp;A session. Afterwards, you're all invited to join us for lunch.</p>
          <p>And now, the podium is yours, Dr. Reithofer, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
          <p>We move people, we always think and act globally with a long-term focus. It is, of course, our responsibility towards our shareholders and stakeholders. It is also a key part of our corporate culture. With our Strategy Number ONE, we are aligning the BMW Group with two targets, to be profitable and to enhance long-term value in times of change. And this applies to technological, structural, as well as cultural aspects of our company.</p>
          <p>Since 2007, we have been implementing various initiatives in keeping with the strategy's four pillars. The four pillars, growth, shaping the future, profitability, and access to technologies and customers. Today, we are benefiting from our foresight. 2011 was the most successful business year to date in our corporate history. We achieved new record sales, revenues and earnings. Already in 2011, we exceeded our profitability targets laid out for 2012. We are once again the leading premium automaker in terms of sales and the most sustainable car company in the world. We have a sound financial basis which enables us to invest in future growth.</p>
          <p>Very important for us, we deliver on our promises. As we see it, our success in 2011 is one step on our path towards the future. In 2016, BMW will be 100 years old. This is a historical milestone for our company. For all of us at the BMW Group, it is a responsibility and an obligation to ensure future success.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we are facing tremendous challenges. The world continues to change at a rapid pace. In many countries, individual mobility remains a focus of political regulation and national industrial policy. The shift in society requires new mobility solutions. Volatility has long become a constant in our everyday business. Markets and consumers alike remain uneasy about the significant public debt and the Euro crisis.</p>
          <p>Given these developments, we carried out a strategic review in 2011. All trends were evaluated and our strategy was accordingly adapted. Based on our findings, we are now looking far ahead again. So, what do we intend to achieve? More than 2 million cars sold in 2016. In the long term, I would really like to highlight, in the long term, we aim to reach an EBIT margin in the Automotive segment in the range of 8% to 10% and our clear vision for the year 2020 remains to be the leading provider of premium products and premium services for individual mobility.</p>
          <p>So, where do we stand with regard to the business year 2011? We achieved Group revenues of &#x20AC;68.8 billion, a pre-tax result of &#x20AC;7.4 billion, a profit of &#x20AC;4.9 billion and EBIT margin in the Automotive segment of 11.8%. Our Motorcycle segment contributed &#x20AC;41 million to the Group result and our Financial Services segment accounted for &#x20AC;1.8 billion. These key figures are proof of our product desirability and the strength of our brands. For the first time ever, within one year, about 1.67 million customers decided to buy a BMW, a MINI or Rolls-Royce and this means new record sales for all our brands. BMW, 1.38 million cars; MINI, over 285,000 cars; Rolls-Royce, not so many cars, of course, 3,538. So, we exceeded the previous record from 1978 and reached a new all-time high in Rolls-Royce's 107-year history.</p>
          <p>Motorcycles, we sold more than 113,500 motorcycles of the BMW and Husqvarna brands. BMW Motorrad, winner of the J.D. Power Motorcycle Competitive Information Study 2011, is now the market leader in 15 countries.</p>
          <p>In 2011, the BMW ordinary share held strong in a challenging and volatile environment and proved to be a sound long-term investment. All in all, the share price developed better in 2011 than the German DAX. And since the beginning of 2012, it has increased in value by more than 30% over the 2011 closing price.</p>
          <p>Our shareholders benefit from our positive business development in 2011, and so do our associates who participate in the employee share program. At the Annual General Meeting, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board will propose to raise the dividend to &#x20AC;2.30 per ordinary share and to &#x20AC;2.32 per preferred share. This is the highest dividend we have ever paid. This holds us &#x2013; this holds true for the employees' profit sharing program. All permanent staff at German locations will receive a bonus for 2011 that exceeds the previous record set in 2010. I am convinced that all associates will once again demonstrate peak performance in 2012. It will be a challenging year and we will deliver, one, we have to deliver once again.</p>
          <p>That brings me to my next point, what are our goals for 2012? It is uncertain whether the current economic conditions will continue. Our expectations for 2012, new record sales on Group level, new all-time highs for all three car brands, a new record in pre-tax Group result, an EBIT margin in the Automotive segment in the range of 8% to 10% and we are off to a promising start. This is the best start to any year we have had. In January and February 2012, we delivered nearly 240,000 cars to customers. Our product portfolio is young and attractive, is young and attractive. Before the summer ends, BMW and MINI are going to launch 12 new models including variants.</p>
          <p>At BMW, 2012 is clearly the year of the new BMW 3 Series. The new sedan arrived at dealerships in mid-February. For the first time, we launched a model at the same time in all markets. We are delighted, of course, with the media response. So far, the new 3 Series has come out first in all comparative tests against competitors worldwide. Our 3 Series has always been an EfficientDynamics pioneer. The BMW 320d EfficientDynamics Edition is the new CO2 champion in its class. 163 horsepower, fuel consumption at 4.1 liters per 100 kilometers and 109 grams of CO2 per kilometer. EfficientDynamics, ladies and gentlemen, is a success story. EfficientDynamics makes our cars even more attractive and keeps their value at a high level for a long time. We want to maintain and strengthen our lead in the future.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look back. What did we achieve in the first phase of EfficientDynamics? In 1995, our fleet average in Europe was over 200 grams of CO2 per kilometer. From 1995 to 2008, there was an agreement among EU car companies to reduce average CO2 emissions by 25% across the fleet. We were the only car company in ACA that fulfilled our promise. What's more, we went beyond this goal, achieving a 27% reduction. At present, the BMW Group fleet in Europe emits an average of 148 grams of CO2 per kilometer. At the same time, we increased performance as the average of 173 horsepower shows.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead at 2015, the EU has set a new CO2 target of 130 grams per kilometer for all European cars. We are totally confident that we will meet the target set for the BMW Group. Our new highly-efficient engines and new models such as the new BMW 3 Series will enable us to achieve these goals. As well, the BMW ActiveHybrid models are another step in this direction. Our intelligent, full hybrid drive concept will be available in the new BMW 3 Series, the new BMW 5 Series as well as the updated BMW 7 Series.</p>
          <p>Now we have a clear focus for the year 2020. This year, the EU will discuss the planned regulations concerning the 95 grams CO2 per kilometer average across the European car fleets for 2020. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a significant challenge. Looking at the global situation, the U.S. government has already set new CO2 targets for 2025. Our EfficientDynamics technologies put us in a better position regarding these new regulations. Offering electric cars will also give us additional credits.</p>
          <p>In order to reach all these goals, we are now starting on the second phase of EfficientDynamics. We want to maintain our product portfolio mix and continue offering our customers both, and it's very important, both large and small cars in the future. Because of this, we need new technologies to complement the fleet through Plug-In Hybrids and electric cars such as the BMW i Family, we will make further progress significantly reducing CO2 emissions across our fleet. And if you see the CO2 target for the year 2020, ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary. In 2020, we will have reduced the BMW Group fleet CO2 average by half. To achieve these targets in Europe and worldwide, we will continue investing in many areas, this includes developing innovative drive technologies and light-weight construction.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the next point, does Premium have a future? Our activities are based on the following assumptions. Individual mobility will remain a basic human need. The number of wealthy individuals continues to increase globally. Naturally, this leads to stronger demand for Premium mobility. Currently, growth in the Premium segment exceeds that of the overall car market. Premium's key strength, quality, product substance and design will continue to be in high demand. We have been adding new attributes to the mix, such as efficiency, responsibility and sustainability. A very interesting point for me is the next one, the number of young drivers is increasing. According to a recent study of the Institute of the Automotive Industry in Germany, the share of 18 to 24-year olds applying for a driver's license has risen to almost three out of four. Five years ago, the number was much lower.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, premium is and will remain our business model. We will continue to define premium and refine our business model accordingly. Let me give you four examples. First, innovation and sustainable production; second, balanced market performance; third, strategic alliances; and fourth, safeguarding expertise.</p>
          <p>First, innovation and sustainable production. Our industry is experiencing a period of technical transition. We want to be both a pioneer and a driving force in this transition. Therefore, we are achieving this through two distinct and complementary paths, evolution and revolution. The further development of high efficiency combustion engines and hybrid drives, this is what we consider evolution. Zero-emission mobility combined with production and the innovative use of materials and new services, this is what we call revolution.</p>
          <p>With our new BMW i Family, we position ourselves as the leader of innovation in the field of e-mobility. We are the first car company to design mobility from the ground up around an electric power train. Our BMW i Family will be the first cars made of carbon fiber in serious production. The power of the assembly of the BMW i3 and the i8 at our Leipzig site will come from regenerative forces. We are convinced that sustainable mobility can only be created within sustainable structures. This is one element of our premium promise.</p>
          <p>Our business success will remain the foundation for our ecological and social activities in the future. For years, the BMW Group has been in top positions in all major sustainability rankings, including the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the Carbon Disclosure Project.</p>
          <p>In our current ad campaign, our own associates show how we implement sustainability at all locations. A new approach towards individual mobility creates a new opportunity to offer our customers a range of services. This applies especially to the generations that have grown up with social networks. In cooperation with research partners in cities, we are developing innovative services, giving young people in particular access to our brands. More than 17,000 members to date, take advantage of our DriveNow car sharing project in Berlin, Munich and D&#xFC;sseldorf. Further cities will follow. The acquisition of ING Car Lease Group has been another important step in designing attractive mobility solutions and services.</p>
          <p>Second, balanced market performance. Today, our market position in Europe, Asia and America is much more balanced than 10 years past. This gives us a significant competitive advantage in light of volatile markets. We are now laying the foundation that will allow us to meet our growth targets laid out for 2016. The BMW Group will define 2012 as of the year in which we further extend our global footprint. We will raise capacities in China, the U.S., South Africa, and India. At the same time, we are evaluating potential locations in the so-called BRIKT markets. In the five BRIKT markets, Brazil, Russia, India, Korea and Turkey, we have increased sales by 1,000% in the past 10 years.</p>
          <p>When deciding, of course, on new locations, we always consider a long-term perspective. Basic conditions need to be met to ensure a win-win situation for both the country and the BMW Group. Germany remains the backbone of our production. We are not outsourcing shops abroad. In Germany, plant investment for 2011 and 2012 stands at &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>Third, strategic alliances. Future mobility has many elements, and we need to prepare for this. Let me give you three examples. In cooperation with the SGL Group, we opened a new production plant for carbon fibers in Moses Lake in the United States, in 2011. At our Landshut plant, we have recently commissioned the first carbon fiber production. We have expertise using carbon fiber parts in automotive engineering, and we can draw on this competitive advantage in lightweight construction. Our joint venture with PSA Peugeot Citro&#xEB;n is right on track. Together with our partner, we are developing components in the field of electrification and hybridization.</p>
          <p>We intend, third very important point, to take basic research into lithium ion technology to the next level in cooperation with Toyota Motor Corporation. At the same time, we will provide Toyota Motor Europe with high efficiency diesel engines. Strategic alliances are part of our Strategy Number ONE. These ensure access to technologies, pool expertise and generate cost savings.</p>
          <p>Fourth, safeguarding expertise. To achieve our goals for future mobility, we need the smartest minds and most suitable skills. This is why we are hiring new staff. This is why we are increasing the number of young people we train and this is why we are increasing our investment in continuing education for employees.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we hired more than 4,000 new associates. That way, we ensure that we have relevant future skills at our disposal. This year, we have planned to bring on a similar number of new employees. I view training young people to be particularly important to our future success. During the economic crisis, we continued to train a significant number of young people. In late 2011, we actually raised the total number of apprentices to around 3,900. All apprentices who successfully completed their training in 2011 were offered a job with the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we are investing in continuing education. In 2011, 87,000 associates participated in programs offered by our training academy. Our spending on training courses reached the highest level in seven years in 2011. Actually, they doubled within only two years. This, ladies and gentlemen, is premium as well. Last but not least, our business model for premium products and services also requires a flexible, high performing organization. Last Thursday, the Supervisory Board announced a realignment of the Management Board.</p>
          <p>The new Management Board structure, beginning the first of April 2012, will set the course for our company's future development. By separating responsibilities for the brands BMW as well as MINI and Rolls-Royce, we are focusing on the dynamic growth and the autonomy of our brands. The current board members in charge of the Development and Purchasing divisions will change roles. This guarantees the best possible use of experiences at their respective place in the value chain. And we brought in a seasoned executive with external expertise and new perspectives to join our Board. Mrs. Milagros Cai&#xF1;a-Andree will start on July 1 of this year.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, what can our customers expect from us in 2012? The Geneva Motor Show provided the stage for the world premiere of the first ever four-door coupe in the history of the BMW brand. The BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe. This car is our vision of aesthetics and luxury in the premium segment of the top range Automotive market. The BMW X6 and our flagship model series the BMW 7 Series have been updated. BMW M is launching the BMW M6 Coupe and the BMW M6 Convertible, by the way, 560 horsepowers and in 4.2 seconds from zero to 100 kilometers per hour.</p>
          <p>Our new BMW M Performance models are geared toward customers looking for high performance for everyday use. With the new MINI Roadster, the MINI Family now has six members. From the fall of 2012 &#x2013; do you like the car? Something different. From the fall of 2012, MINI fans can look forward to the new special edition MINI Clubman. This is the first lifestyle transport vehicle in the premium small car segment.</p>
          <p>And now, to the top segment. Rolls-Royce is about to launch the Phantom Series II in the second half of 2012 following the Phantom Series I from 2003. This means, updated design, new top technology and state-of-the-art networking services at Rolls-Royce. You see, our product portfolio covers the entire range from the premium small car segment to the ultra-luxury class and M models.</p>
          <p>Corporate success builds on many individual factors. As we see it, this includes growth, profitability and efficiency, as well as social responsibility and acting sustainably. We owe our success in the business year 2011 to the commitment and performance of our associates. So, on behalf of the entire Management Board, I would like to thank all our associates across the globe for their commitment and performance.</p>
          <p>We continue to implement our strategy, Number ONE, which allows us to think and act globally and with a focus on the long term. We will continue to define what premium is. We will strive to be highly profitable. We will continue to design individual mobility for today and tomorrow. This is the foundation on which we build the future of our company as well as shape our industry. Everyone, ladies and gentlemen, at the BMW Group will strive to achieve these goals with dedication and passion. This is BMW and that is what you can expect from us. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome from my side as well. Our results demonstrate once again how successfully we have realigned our company since 2007. Our profitability has improved significantly. We are now using our financial strengths to prepare for the future. We benefited last year from strong demand for our attractive premium vehicles. Our premium business model is solid and primed for growth. Before we look at the numbers in more detail, I would like to draw your attention to a change in our Group balance sheet. We have altered the method we use for the valuation of leased products, vehicles we have leased to our customers in our 2011 Group balance sheet, the Automotive and Financial Services segments are not affected. As a result, we have adjusted the previous year's figures for some items in the financial statements. You will find more information on this in our Annual Report on page 95 under item number 8.</p>
          <p>Now, let me start right away with the Automotive segment. Automotive revenues climbed to &#x20AC;63.2 billion in 2011, an increase of 17%. We reported an operating result, EBIT, of almost &#x20AC;7.5 billion in this segment, an increase of 72%. Our EBIT margin in the Automotive segment was 11.8% in the fiscal year 2011, easily exceeding our target range of 8% to 10%. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we generated revenues of more than &#x20AC;16.8 billion, so this represents an increase of 8% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Our EBIT of &#x20AC;1.54 billion was slightly lower than last year. Our Automotive business faced high expenses for new products, among others, for the start of production and the market launch of our new 6 Series sedan, as well as for the preparation of future business sales. The valuation effects of currency and raw material derivatives also had a negative impact on the financial result.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we achieved a single-digit EBIT margin, as expected of 9.2%. Here, you can see where last year's increase in earnings came from. Higher sales were the main factor combined with our high-end model mix. The strong momentum from our products is also seen in the average revenue per vehicle, which rose once again.</p>
          <p>We also achieved better pricing. Sales incentives were again slightly lower than the previous year. The net effect of currency and raw materials produced a gain of &#x20AC;92 million. While rising raw material prices posed some burden, we were able to benefit from favorable currency hedges. We will be continuing our successful risk-hedging strategy as we have done in the past. We expect earnings to benefit again from a strong currency tailwind this year. Raw materials are likely to produce an adverse impact once again in 2012, although positive effects from currency hedging should offset this.</p>
          <p>More stable, used car prices in 2011 allowed us to adjust some of the risk provisions we had accrued for our end-of-lease vehicles. This had a positive impact of &#x20AC;85 million on earnings in the Automotive segment in the second quarter. Segment earnings were impacted by an additional &#x20AC;247 million charge for personal costs, mostly from higher profit sharing and employee bonuses.</p>
          <p>Efficiency improvements and lower manufacturing costs also had a positive effect. The measures implemented as part of our corporate strategy contributed over &#x20AC;0.5 billion, mainly triggered by the launch of new models. Wider use of modular components, leverage synergies and economies of scale can further reduce our manufacturing costs. We will continue to optimize our cost bases over the coming year.</p>
          <p>Expenses for new products and the development of new business areas rose significantly from the previous year. This included further development of our traditional drivetrain technologies as well as alternative drivetrains and the use of new materials. An additional &#x20AC;468 million of cost for future business projects was reported in the Automotive segment. This impacted our fourth quarter earnings in particular beyond the typical seasonality. A substantial portion of the cost came, for example, from upfront investments in the new BMW i sub-brand and as well as for the BMW i3 and the BMW i8.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, as Dr. Reithofer discussed already, we are developing the BMW Group in two directions: evolution and revolution. That is a dual approach with which the BMW Group aims to remain the world's leading premium car company in the future. We are making crucial investments in our future today. We are taking the necessary steps to be able to refine our business model. We have the operational and financial strengths to shoulder these expenses. We have reached a high level of profitability and have already exceeded our profitability targets for this year by the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Despite rising upfront investments, we expect to continue to meet our profitability targets going forward. Our investments are mostly funded by operating cash flow. Versus prior year, it was impacted by the accumulation of around &#x20AC;1.2 billion in working capital for the large number of model launches.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we have increased stocks and provided an adequate supply of vehicles. Nevertheless, we once again generated a strong free cash flow in the Automotive segment. Free cash flow amounted to &#x20AC;2.13 billion in fiscal year 2011.</p>
          <p>As you can see here, three major capital outflows reduced free cash flow in the Automotive segment. First, the capital increase in BMW Bank of &#x20AC;625 million in the second quarter. Second, the prorated acquisition of the ING Car Lease Group, which also resulted in the outflow of &#x20AC;249 million in quarter three. And finally, the purchase of SGL shares in November with an outflow of &#x20AC;487 million. Adjusted for these items, free cash flow totaled &#x20AC;3.5 billion, thus achieving our target of over &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>Group liquidity amounted to roughly &#x20AC;10.1 billion at the end of the year. This increase in liquidity from 2010 was secured primarily in the second half of the year. This gives us greater flexibility in the face of sustained uncertainty on the capital markets. We attach a great deal of importance to maintaining an adequate level of liquidity and stable financial base, both enable us to respond to market fluctuation in a fast and flexible manner.</p>
          <p>Last year, we renewed our syndicated facility of more than &#x20AC;6 billion with an international banking group which can be accessed at any time. We also continue to enjoy excellent access to various financing sources on the capital markets. In light of our positive business and earnings performance, we will once again be returning more of our profit to shareholders than last year. This year, dividend payment totals &#x20AC;1.5 billion and is therefore more than 70.5% higher than last year. This amount represents 30.7% of our net profit for the year.</p>
          <p>We optimized our capital employed once again in 2011 and created headroom for investing in key future projects. Our CapEx totaled &#x20AC;3.7 billion. Due to the increase in revenue, the investment ratio of 5.4% remain the same as the previous year and below our upper limit of 7%. We invested in machinery for new models to enable future growth. At the same time, we focused on efficient processes and reutilization existing machinery.</p>
          <p>We also started with the creation of necessary production structures for the BMW i3 and the BMW i8. We also made our development processes even more efficient. We are now developing a growing number of derivatives in a shorter space of time and with lower one-off costs.</p>
          <p>In doing so, we will rely on modular components as well as virtual simulation and safety technologies. This gives us the additional financial latitude to invest in the future. Last year, we reported a charge in the three-digit millions for key future projects in our income statement, as many of these expenses are not eligible for capitalization. In 2011, or expenses for research and development totaled more than &#x20AC;3.6 billion, the R&amp;D ratio of 4.9% was higher than the previous year's figure of 4.6%, and just below our target range of 5% to 5.5%. We invested a total of about &#x20AC;500 million in research and development, more than in 2010.</p>
          <p>We expect R&amp;D expenses to continue rising over the coming years, and foresee higher capital expenditure, however, our cooperation with other companies will generate synergies and cost benefits. Within the company, we are working on modular kits for components, electrification and engines. The main R&amp;D challenge lies in our multifaceted approach in developing drive technologies. As Dr. Reithofer explained, we have initiated the necessary measures that will enable us to meet European emission standards in 2015. We are preparing for even stricter requirements in 2020. We want to maintain our leading position in CO2 efficiency. In doing so, we will continue to offer our customers in the EU a broad product mix, our efficient drivetrains and light-weight construction will ensure that our customers will not have to do without larger cars or sheer driving pleasure.</p>
          <p>We are maintaining our targets for the ratios for capital expenditure and R&amp;D over the medium term. We are confident that we will be able to meet both target ratios, a CapEx ratio of less than 7% and an R&amp;D ratio of 5% to 5.5%.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the Financial Services segment. This is another area where we exceeded our targets. Pre-tax earnings for 2011 reached &#x20AC;1.79 billion. This figure included a one-off effect of &#x20AC;439 million from the adjustment of risk provisions. The segment boosted its profitability once again. On the basis of our balance sheet equity of more than &#x20AC;7 billion, Financial Services earned an ROE of 29.4%. Adjusted for the one-off effect from the adjustments of risk provisions, I mentioned before, the ROE was 22.2%. Thus, Financial Services easily exceeded our Group target of over 18% for return on equity.</p>
          <p>Financial Services also profited from competitive refinancing conditions in the capital markets in 2011. Lower interest rates and in particular, lower credit spreads in the first half of the year enabled our Financial Services business to deliver solid profitability.</p>
          <p>The risk situation for the segment continued to improve after the financial crisis. Our measures aimed at supporting residual values and our Lending business also had a positive effect.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our business activities in this segment. We concluded almost 1.2 million new contracts with retail customers in 2011. This represents a 10.5% increase over the previous year. The number of contracts in place with dealers and retail customers reached almost 3.6 million in 2011. This also included almost 253,000 contracts from the ING Car Lease Group.</p>
          <p>The total business volume, as disclosed in the balance sheet, increased by 13.6% to &#x20AC;75.2 billion in 2011. The penetration rate for the financial year just ended was 41%. The overall risk situation in the Financial Services business continued to improve in 2011.</p>
          <p>The used car prices in North America have further stabilized. In the United States, in particular, residual value losses were much lower than in the previous years and ended below the previous year's level. The German market also remains stable and residual value trends now look better than before the crisis.</p>
          <p>Thus, on European countries, on the other hand, saw a negative development overall in used car prices. Residual value losses increased again over the course of the year but were still within the predicted range and covered by the corresponding risk provisions.</p>
          <p>In recent years, we have been more conservative in our calculation of residual values when concluding contracts and have consistently reduced the number of off-lease vehicles. Unless the economic situation in our key markets changes drastically, we expect used car market prices to remain mostly stable.</p>
          <p>The credit risk situation continued to improve. Our worldwide credit loss ratio fell to 0.49% in 2011, a significant decrease of 18 basis points from the previous year. For the first time since the crisis, the credit loss ratio was almost back at pre-crisis levels.</p>
          <p>BMW Financial Services underpin this development is consistent receivables management. We expect a continued stabilization overall in credit and residual value risk in 2012. Also, the risk situation will remain heightened in the Southern European countries most affected by the debt crisis. In light of this, we increased our risk provisioning in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our goal remains to have a robust Financial Services business with access to competitive refinancing. That is why we are proceeding to expand the BMW Bank into an European Bank. This will allow us to make better use of customer deposits in our financing mix, for instance. Our German leasing company was successfully integrated into the BMW Bank in August 2011. Our acquisition of ING Car Lease in 2011 expanded our fleet management business significantly. Over the course of the year, our joint vehicle portfolio grew by almost 9%. Alphabet had almost 475,000 vehicles in its portfolio at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>The integration of the ING Car Lease Group is proceeding according to plan. We expect to complete the integration process over the course of the coming year. BMW Motorrad sales performed very well in 2011. The Motorcycle segment increased its revenues by over 10% to &#x20AC;1.4 billion in a declining overall market and despite negative effects. As expected, the segments profit before financial result decreased to &#x20AC;45 million, this resulted from the higher cost of restructuring Husqvarna and repositioning the brand. These activities are at an advanced stage, and the brand portfolio has seen refinements.</p>
          <p>We anticipate further growth in the Motorcycle segment as a result of offering new models in growing market segments. For the first time, the Husqvarna brand launched two new street bikes outside of its traditional off-road market in December. And BMW Motorrad will move into the area of urban mobility in 2012 with two maxi scooters.</p>
          <p>In the eliminations, profit before tax decreased to &#x20AC;1.1 billion year-on-year. The negative effect resulted largely from the eliminations of Financial Services in the segment profits driven by growth in new leasing business, lower manufacturing costs and higher profitability of new vehicles contributed as well.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group remains confident about the future. Our strong 2011 financial results confirm that the company is on the right track. We aim to continue along this route and we are targeting further cost reductions and improvements in efficiency. Our profitable business will enable the investment needed for key future projects over the next few years. From a strategic perspective, we will continue to forge ahead with both evolution and revolution.</p>
          <p>Now is the time to prepare for the future. The measures we have implemented with Strategy Number ONE over the past five years and the steps that we have taken will ensure we will achieve our targets. We will be able to maintain our target quotas for research and development and capital spending despite the high level of upfront investments needed.</p>
          <p>We have already set our goals for 2016. We aim to sell more than 2 million vehicles. In this time period, we will renew about two-thirds of our product portfolio. We will continue to offer attractive new products, which will benefit from our efficiency improvements. Despite the necessary expenditure ahead, we aim to remain profitable at a high level.</p>
          <p>We will maintain our EBIT margin target range of 8% to 10% in the Automotive segment. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, very few car companies have so far managed to achieve such a high level of profitability on a long-term basis. This is an ambitious goal we are aiming for, provided conditions remain stable. Our goal is long term and not just focused in earning the highest possible short term returns.</p>
          <p>With the level of investments and outlays we are making today, we are paving the way for our company's sustainable future success. If conditions are right, that will of course also benefit our profitability. We aim to increase both our sales volumes and earnings again this year, with our three premium brands once again growing faster than the global premium segment. We anticipate new sales records from all three brands. Our new and attractive products will generate further growth. We have a young product line-up on the market this year that will support our earnings momentum.</p>
          <p>Sales performed well in the first two months of 2012. If the current trend continues, we expect increasing earnings in the Automotive segment and the EBIT margin to be at the upper end of our 8% to 10% target range. The launch of BMW i and the new BMW i3 and i8 will result in rising costs this year. Our ventures into new markets and business fields will also require additional expenditure. For this reason, we anticipate higher capital expenditure and upfront investments in 2012. Key future projects are likely to result in a negative impact on earnings stronger than last year.</p>
          <p>BMW Financial Services will contribute to our overall sales performance. We anticipate further growth in this segment. Earnings are expected to remain under the 2011 level with its substantial one-off effect. We are standing by our ROE target of more than 18%. In our Motorcycle segment, we expect to see an increase in sales. Sales since the beginning of the year have gone exceptionally well. Overall, from macroeconomic perspective, we are also aware of the volatility on the markets as well as current signs of market weakness. We expect to see a positive trend in the United States and China, as well as in the Asian growth markets. However, in Europe, particularly in Southern Europe and in certain emerging markets, we expect restrained growth. In the BRIKT markets of Brazil and Turkey, for example, only moderate growth is forecast as a result of high import duties.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Strategy Number ONE has made our company much more flexible and resilient during volatile times. We have become more profitable. We need to capitalize on our current competitive advantage for making the company stronger for the future. At the same time, we are carefully managing risks and ensuring that we remain highly profitable with a solid financial standing. Thank you very much.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Just a quick clarification, did I understand you correctly just now that you are targeting to increase the Auto's EBIT in 2012 when I look at your speech, Dr. Eichiner? Yeah. Okay. My other questions are when we look over the last 10 years, it's been pretty obvious that Mercedes had a bit of a struggle, basically not growing and BMW and Audi grew pretty strongly. Do you expect this trend to continue or is Mercedes becoming stronger competitor?</p>
          <p>The New A-Class looks very strong, different to the old one, clearly targeting the 1-Series and the Audi A3. And then 2014, 2015, we get a new C-Class and a new E-Class coming. So, would you expect Mercedes to come back much stronger over the next four to five years? And then also, just very quickly, can you confirm the &#x20AC;1 billion gross efficiency gains for this year, and are you again targeting a free cash flow in the Autos division north of &#x20AC;3 billion for 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, for me, a very straight answer, Mercedes will be a stronger competitor in the future, that is my opinion. If we see the three German premium car manufacturers, Audi, Mercedes and BMW, a lot of people focus in recent days on Audi and BMW, but we should not forget Mercedes. I mean, they will have new products, the new A-Class was one example, the new B-Class, they will have more derivatives. In the A-Class segment, in my opinion, so, and as you said, Mercedes would be a stronger competitor. But the answer from my side, we will have product ideas as well, and as you know, at the moment, we are creating two modular structures, one for smaller cars, and one for medium-sized and bigger cars, and of course, we will be able to develop derivatives faster compared to five to 10 years ago, and you see me smile, we will have product ideas as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, well, of course, we want to grow sales and EBIT in the Auto segment, that's what I would like to confirm. Free cash flow, definitely the target is to be north of &#x20AC;3 billion this year and the last question was about the efficiency gains. It will be definitely a three-digit million number high to &#x2013; middle to high number what we are expecting to achieve this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. Good morning. Thierry Huon from Exane BNP Paribas. First of all, I'd like to know why the penetration rate of the Financial Services went down last year from 48% to 41%. And secondly, you mentioned in your speech that the residual value losses in the U.S. went down but I thought that the residual value went up in the U.S. last year, at least according to, not J.D. Power, the Manheim Index. Last question is about PSA GM story, so Mr. Reithofer, you had questions yesterday about this. I could understand that you cannot answer at this stage but what could you imagine as a major benefit that BMW could get from being involved in this alliance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it' a very early stage. I said it yesterday during the annual press conference. And it's for me too early to make a comment. I said yesterday we have a very successful engine cooperation and the engine cooperation, let me say, will go beyond the year 2015, I think 2016, 2017. Then we have to decide will we carry on with the engine cooperation. That means PSA and BMW together. And as you know, we will have a new model engine concept with three-, four-, six-cylinder engines and we have to ask ourselves, can there be offer to work together with PSA?</p>
          <p>So, the second point is the electrification joint venture. We started successfully and Mr. Varin and myself, we think we will carry on in a very successful way. What does the new cooperation between GM and PSA means for BMW and PSA? It's too early to comment.</p>

          <p>The second part, Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, your question about the penetration rate. The major effect is the consolidation of our China business. The first time we consolidated China into this number, and in China, we have a very low penetration rate. So, that washed it down to a certain extent. Now we see the were losses in the U.S. Fortunately, we experienced a much better market momentum for used cars, so more pricing power comes with it. And I think the major reason for the improvement was we heavily reduced the number of leases. So, in the crisis, we shifted from leasing into loan, and so far, nearly one-third of the volume was taken out of the market and that had a really a positive effect on pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, next question Fraser Hill and then Daniel. Fraser?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. The first question is on pricing. At the 3-Series launch event in November, you speculated that pricing was the biggest risk to your progression this year. After the strong start to the year, how do you see that risk today and is it still something that you are worried about? Is your order book perhaps giving you a lot of confidence that that's now a minimal threat?</p>
          <p>And secondly on China and your dealership rollout schedule, can you just update us where you are and maybe looking forward over the next four or five years, when you think you're going to be at a stage that you're potentially fully penetrated in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the pricing risk is really something we take very serious and the background of our thoughts is really the development, especially in European markets. So far, we see growing pricing pressure in Spain, in Italy, so in the markets around the Mediterranean Sea. But the question is, will it spill over to markets like the UK or Germany, and that is not quite clear. That's where the risk is. It's driven by competition; it's driven by reduced demand. So, those are maybe the drivers.</p>
          <p>We are really decided not to push the new products via pricing. So, we are really aware that that would be the wrong strategy going forward because we have a very attractive 1 and 3-Series now being launched and I think more pricing discipline is mandatory for those products. But having said this on the other hand, you cannot sacrifice too much when it comes down to market share and you have to make sure that your dealers still make some business and money and their cash flow is okay. So, that is the balance we have to look at. But what see with the beginning of the fourth quarter that the pressure on the pricing front increased. That's what we can see. Where it will end is at the moment not very clear.</p>
          <p>Then your question about the strategy for the dealership rollout in China. So, actually, we have around 290 dealerships in China. So, we increased a lot in 2011, and we think we have to expand the dealer network further in China. 2012 we are talking another 40 to 50 dealers to be added to our network. It's now the strategy to move more into the Western part of China where infrastructure investments are going on and the consequence we can follow with our business. So, that's more or less the strategy for 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Daniel Schwartz, Commerzbank. The weak demand for the Chevrolet Volt, has that any implication on your positioning and pricing of your i-models?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...which is normal for such projects. Is it more on the material side or is it more on the drivetrain side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now we understand. Mr. Eichiner? Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with the challenges. As you know, I mean, our marketing slogan is the car is Born Electric. So, we really have a concept and a construction that is focused on electric car. It's not just a conversion of an existing car. We not only put an electric engine on an existing concept, so it's really something new. Now, with this &#x2013; with those new technologies, of course, and risk came along like the broad usage of light-weight construction and the whole drivetrain development, those are from our perspective challenges. And we are not only planning for thousands of cars. We are really planning for series production, and that is another challenge that has to be mastered within the development process. But we have every confidence that we will be successful with the knowledge we have so far. So, that's about the challenges.</p>
          <p>And now about the positioning, as always there's a new concept now coming. A new market is expected to develop. Our view is this market will develop because if you look at the long-term targets, if you look at what the governments ask us to do over the long period of time, without electric battery, electric vehicles, the targets are not achievable. That's what we can see. We cannot improve the combustion engine so much further that the 95-gram CO2 in the European community in 2020 will be achievable without adding electrification. So, electrification is a trend that will come and we need it in order to be compliant with those targets.</p>
          <p>We think the market will develop but it, of course, as always, if a new concept comes to the market and a new drivetrain comes to the market, the customers will be hesitating in the beginning. So, from our perspective, the cars are really convincing once you drive them and if you got the right concept around it. So, it's not just the car, you have to rethink about all the services around the car, about the charging, about the cost, maybe how you handle the cost of ownership and all those things are important to think about and to act &#x2013; there's a kind of a service to your offer in order to really make it something very interesting for the consumers. And within our project, we think about all those things and our view is that the i3 definitely will make a difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, Max and then Georges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Max Warburton from Bernstein. I've got two questions, the first is on the guidance, the second one on China Brilliance. In Dr. Eichiner's statement, he says that Automotive EBIT will increase or you're targeting an increase but you're still aiming for the range of 8% to 10%. To me, this looks arithmetically impossible and I'm sure it's not a mistake. I'm sure you've said this deliberately because you want to keep a cap on expectations. But arithmetically, you'd need to do &#x20AC;77 billion revenue in the Auto business for the two things to add up. So, are you happy for us to take away from today real guidance that you're going to come in above the 8% to 10% range? The two things, they're both not possible unless you get 20% plus revenue growth. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question on China Brilliance, we have this greater discussion now about the local brand of Brilliance and Professor Milberg is talking about it in his statement even in the Annual Report. So, I hope it's not premature to ask the question. When will this brand launch and what will it cost BMW? I imagine you'll have to develop this car for them; most of it will be done in Germany. What sort of development expense does developing a new car and a new brand, even if it's on an existing platform, cost BMW? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think we start with the guidance discussion. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course. So, I mean you made your calculation about I see it to understand that at this point in the year after two months, it's very &#x2013; and the uncertainty we lined out already today, it's very hard to give, let's say, a really clear guidance on the returns. That's why we said what we see so far is we had a good start into this year. We gave you the guidance that we expect growing both the sales and the profit. And now it depends a lot on two factors: one is the one-off expenses we have to carry in order to bring our future investments forward and the other is really the uncertainty around things like pricing and market development.</p>
          <p>So, that will amend &#x2013; be the decisive factors about the real growth on the sales side, and at the end of the day, on the profit. I think we can be more precise after the results of the first quarter in May. But as you see, we have some confidence because we guided you with that our view is that the EBIT margin could be on the upper end of our corridor. And I think this is a signal we delivered, we gave to you, and normally, you understand our signals very well. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>I mean, I would like to start to come from a different angle to give you the best answer. I mean, if you see the newest political development in China, and a new energy vehicle is necessary to do business in China. And I mean, if you have at the same time as Board of Management of a global company, the earnings in your mind in China and their earnings in China are very good, then a new energy vehicle is a must to do &#x2013; to do business in China. So, it is very simple. We have no other choice than to do it. So, and of course, we will think about what can we used from our model as systems as well from our electrification systems, but we have to develop a lot of parts as well in China because it's part of the new regulations.</p>
          <p>So, again, new energy vehicles are necessary to do business in China in future. We have to have a new energy vehicle in our joint venture. It has to be a local brand, that means a local Chinese brand. So, again, our earnings in China as we all know, earnings are very good. It means we have to develop a new energy vehicle. So, that is one part of my answer. And the second part of my answer, yes, you can do a new energy vehicle to satisfy regulations. Or you can say, let's do it and use it in future as a business opportunity. Because if you look over there, you can see the BMW i3 and we develop at the moment the technology to do &#x2013; to have in future battery electric vehicles. Of course, you can use these technologies as well for other vehicles. Is that good enough as answer for you?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean just one follow-on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost for BMW, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean the cost for BMW but also you're talking about the new energy vehicle. My understanding is there's going to be a gasoline-powered range of cars or at least a gasoline-powered car sold under the local brand, is that incorrect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, first of all, it has to be a new energy vehicle. It has to be a local brand first. Second, it has to be a new energy vehicle. That means it can only be plug-in hybrid or a battery electric vehicle. And if you would like to have a higher volume, you can do cars with combustion engines as well under the new brand name. So, that means it has to be a new energy vehicle. It has to be a local Chinese brand and to have a higher volume and to have better economies of scale, let me use economies of scale. You can do cars with combustion engine as well under the new brand name, and I mean to discuss at the moment development costs.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we give one comment to the development costs just to know where it's allocated. So, it's clearly allocated within the JV, the joint venture. And from our planning, the cash flow is strong enough in a JV to carry the burden. So, there's no need to subsidize from the BMW Group. Yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Georges Dieng, Natixis. A follow-up on China. First, if you could update us on the trend for local production, where you stand today and what you see coming in the next two years, local production and local content? Second, on the issue of investment for the future in the bridge for the Auto operating profit, you showed &#x20AC;468 million. What should we expect for 2012 and 2013? Could that amount be more or less doubled?</p>
          <p>And last point on Financial Services, you had to take some risk provisions for Southern European countries. Could you quantify what was the number in 2011 and should that number be further upped in 2012? And very last point maybe on Financial Services, you also had &#x20AC;600 million cash injection on BMW Bank, is that over or should we expect further injections, for instance, related to Basel III or these kind of things? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Georges. I think Dr. Reithofer will answer the first part of your question. Dr. Reithofer, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to start with the local content. The local content in China is about 40%. We have two plants at the moment in the city of Shenyang. One plant is Dadong. Production capacity is 100,000 units. Our new plant in Tiexi will have a production capacity of 100,000 units as well. That means together, 200,000 units. Let me say from the year 2013 onwards and midterm, both plants together, 350,000 units.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second part, Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, your question about the future investments, so I think we definitely will double the number, so we'll be close to &#x20AC;1 billion in 2012. Then the Financial Services risk provisioning for &#x2013; especially for the dozen European countries, it was a number around &#x20AC;100 million. And then the cash injection in the Financial Services business for equity, I mean, I think we are very well &#x2013; well, we have the right equity base now and we are already in a position to fulfill Basel III requirements that will come for the entire FS business, so you should not expect further injections. So, those are I think the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, next one, next question, Christian Breitsprecher and then Michael Tyndall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. Going again into this one future, when you talk about doubling in the current year, does that mean we again have incrementally something like &#x20AC;470 million or does it mean it's going to be a negative impact of year-over-year &#x20AC;800 million in the current year, just to be clear whether the doubling is the year-over-year impact or the absolute amount?</p>
          <p>And the second point, in terms of the changes that you've done in the accounting for the leasing portfolio, I've read the note a couple of times. I didn't really understand it. Maybe, could you explain a little bit why that drove up the book value in your consolidated accounts and what's really the difference in terms of revenue &#x2013; profit recognition between the past and now going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it's coming back to the question about the burden in 2012. So, we're talking a number between &#x20AC;800 million and &#x20AC;1 billion as the affected burden in 2012. Just to make that number clear, for the future investment with the i3, the i8, all the electrification stuff and light-weight construction stuff we have to bring forward. That is a solid number I can give to you.</p>
          <p>Now your question about the accounting. Well, in a &#x2013; just to explain a bit the methodology as far as can do it in this room. Now, in the past, costs incurred for sales support, for example, so the measures for those support &#x2013; those support measures automatically reduce Group earnings at the time the lease contract was ended &#x2013; just at that point in time, we have taken those measures into account.</p>
          <p>According to the new methodology, costs incurred for sales support measures are distributed evenly over the term of the lease. Now, we have a three years lease contract. Now we have to distribute over those three years. And in the old days, the methodology was to take it out in the first year. So, that is the major difference you have to take into consideration.</p>
          <p>And now, as we had to adjust the &#x2013; also 2010, now that had brought the effect in the balance sheet because definitely, we had to write back. That was what we had to do in the portfolio and that was the amount, the &#x20AC;1.3 million you mentioned.</p>
          <p>Now, if you would understand more, I'll go into more detail, I would ask you &#x2013; kindly would ask you to talk to our Investor Relations people. I think they can give you every detail about this methodology change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; may I quickly follow up on that, just &#x2013; so the &#x2013; in terms of the BMW ONE future, the incremental impact this year year-over-year will just be &#x20AC;400 million, the incremental burden 2012. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the incremental burden will be &#x20AC;800 million to &#x20AC;1 billion. Incremental, that is what &#x2013; if you will look at the &#x2013; at the picture we've seen for 2011, in the place you've seen the &#x20AC;400 million. Next year and possibly better than &#x20AC;800 million or &#x20AC;900 million. But that is what we expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and secondly on the marketing expense, the way I understood now if you had a subsidized lease, that was &#x2013; the subsidy was basically taken as a marketing expense in the Automotive segment right away. And now you're telling me that it's basically distributed over the cost of the lease? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>True. That's true. That changed &#x2013; that is a major change in methodology that we have to distribute it, although it's &#x2013; now, we've been too conservative, if you want, so, right? That was the outcome of our discussions with the Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel. All right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you very much. Next question, Michael Tyndall [Barclays Capital Securities], and then Horst Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Just two questions. One, back on China again. I just wonder if you can talk about your dialogue &#x2013; it's over here, thanks &#x2013; your dialogue with the Chinese government. It seems like foreign car makers and the Chinese government make pretty uneasy bedfellows and that they're making life tougher for you all the time. And then when I look in your Annual Report, I see that consolidated you're making roughly 19% of your revenues in China, but you've got no fixed investments. So, I'm just wondering you appear to be the most foreign of the carmakers in China, so if you could talk about how you're getting on with the Chinese government and with the change of politicians coming through in autumn of this year, how you feel that potentially presents a risk or doesn't present a risk?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is to the future investments, if I look at you R&amp;D capitalization, it has fallen year-on-year, which I seem is related to these investments. Am I right in thinking that you have to expense these upfront because of the business case not being there going forward? And if so, can you give us some color as to what these investments are that there's no future revenues or profits to come from them? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then we start with your last question, further investment, Mr. Eichiner and then Mr. Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean looking back, I think you see really the consequences of our efficiency programs. As I already lined out, we've made real progress in R&amp;D. The way we are developing cars now is much different from the ways we did it in the past. So, we are using common architectures that enable us to really bring CapEx and R&amp;D spending down per unit. That was the idea and it works out quite well for us. And in an environment where the revenue is growing, so the ratio as a consequence went south.</p>
          <p>Now, having said this, what we see now based on this I would say outstanding profitability, now we have to add a certain burden for future investment that comes on top which was not so much reflected in 2010 &#x2013; 2009, 2010 or 2011 in our ratios because as Dr. Reithofer lined out, we are now on our way to prepare for 2020 and that means we have to start development programs for further electrification, light-weight construction and many other things that are very relevant for our success in 2020 and now we ran that up. But the good news is and I just want to give you our confidence that the ratios will be in line with our guidance.</p>
          <p>So, we will be &#x2013; we will keep the ratio between 5% and 5.5% on the R&amp;D spending side and we will keep the ratio of being well under 7% for CapEx despite the fact that we have to carry this burden. So, that is possible because for our base program, we are as efficient as we are demonstrating with the existing numbers and so we can add something. We have some head room to maneuver for the additional requirements in the future development. So, that's how we look at those investments. And now, China &#x2013; China?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second part, Mr. Reithofer, about China dialogue...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean your question regarding the China dialogue with Chinese government. I mean to do business in China is always give and take. If you would like to take, you have to give. And I mean, my first visit in China was in the year 2002, and since 2002, the business in China was always a moving target. We started with the CKD operation in China then we had to realize a local content above 40% then certain components, <mark type="ph" /> priced (86:15) parts and, and, and &#x2013; it was a constant moving target but it was always give and take for both sides. In principle, you can say, if I see the course of the last 10 years, it was really a win-win situation. It was a win situation for China and it was a win situation for the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>And at the moment, I can tell you we are in very constructive discussions with the NDRC, with the Planning Commission. And we think we will find a good solution for both sides. As I said, it has to be give and take. So, and I mean, coming back to the question of Max Warburton, I mean you can see a new energy vehicle as I said it as a threat. That means you have to do it. Or if you will look ahead, let me say into the year 2020, you can see it as a chance as well. Is it a challenge? A challenge, yes of course it is a challenge. It is a constant challenge.</p>
          <p>But we think if I see really the last decade, I mean it was for both sides, as I said, a very balanced give and take situation. And I mean, what I learned during the last 10 years, yes, you have challenges, but a challenge can as well be a good opportunity.</p>
          <p>Will be a new energy vehicle &#x2013; develop a new energy vehicle a challenge? Yes, of course, it will be a challenge. Can it be opportunity? Yes, it can be opportunity. Is China a constant moving target? Yes, it is. It is a constant challenge for Board of Management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question, Horst Schneider and then Sabine Bl&#xFC;mel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Horst Schneider from HSBC. I want to come back to the issue on pricing and also mix. You mentioned in your speech, Dr. Eichiner, that sales incentives declined in 2011 again. Could you quantify how much net pricing has improved in 2011 versus 2010? And I've understood that you are talking about risk in Southern Europe for 2012. But on balance, and taking into account that you have got the new 1-Series and 3-Series out, you plan with the neutral pricing, positive pricing or negative pricing for 2012?</p>
          <p>And in that context, I would also like to know if the mix effect will be neutral or slightly negative this year? And what I have also not yet fully understood is to which extent we should plan the small one-off cost now in 2012, for example, related to the launch of the 2-Series car. Have you booked the majority of these costs now in 2011 or were there some left in 2012? And the last question I have is on capacity growth. To which extent is the consolidated capacity growing in 2012 versus 2011? So, I would like to exclude here, please, the China angle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Capacity growth, I think Norbert Reithofer and then the second part Mr. Eichiner. We'll start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, if you see the capacity growth worldwide then, of course, we will grow in the United States of America. To what extent? In the year 2012, can be 290,000 units, 300,000 units, it is one part. Then if you see China, you ask, especially China, our plant in Dadong was able to produce in the year 2011 roughly, really roughly, 100,000 vehicles. So, we will add Tiexi this year, it can be a production volume because we are in the start-up phase of the plant in 2012, can be roughly 40,000 units, 50,000 units in Tiexi. That means both together, Tiexi and Dadong in the year 2012, 140,000 units, 150,000 units. So, that means additional in China 40,000 units, in the United States, roughly 20,000 units.</p>
          <p>So, then if you see Europe, our plants in &#x2013; especially in Germany, are chock-a-block full I can say, above 100% capacity utilization. But you can be assured we will be able to support the marketing and sales division. In the year 2012, we will deliver the cars, what they need because one thing should not happen that the production cannot deliver. And it will not happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your question about pricing and mix, we could improve pricing in 2011 by roughly 100 basis points. And our idea was, of course, to further improve pricing in 2012 because as you know, we are introducing our volume cars in 2012 and this should make a difference at least in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Now what we see actually is that the pressure, as I have mentioned already, is increasing especially in Southern Europe and the question now is where we see the balance at the end of the year. Of course, we still want to improve, but as I mentioned, there is now a lot of volatility out there and we see increasing risk in specific countries. If this will be isolated to the &#x2013; to Spain, Italy and Southern European countries, then maybe we can do better again in 2012, but if it spills over to bigger markets like UK or Germany, it will be difficult. But basically, I don't think that we will see compared to 2011 a huge burden coming from pricing. It's a question how far can we really improve looking at the circumstances, especially in Europe.</p>
          <p>Well, that's the first few on the pricing question, then your question about the mix. Actually, the geographical mix will be strong. We foresee a growing business in China. We foresee a growing business in the U.S. But on the other hand, we have to be clear that we have recently introduced the 1-Series which is a car in lower segment and the 3-Series will be introduced and they will be in volume, especially in the second half of the year. But overall, if you look at the number revenue per car, I think there would be not a huge deterioration in 2012.</p>
          <p>So, now, your third question was about the launch cost. I mean, basically most of this is digested because we are now already in the production phase. That's what you have to see. There is still a certain burden because we have to build up the pipeline for the derivatives. Just to give you one example, in order to avoid an interruption for the all-wheel drive in the U.S., we have to build up a stock for all-wheel drive cars. We are talking 50,000 units that have to be pre-produced in order to secure our offerings, especially on the East Coast in the U.S. So, those &#x2013; is the kind of burden that's left. But basically, I don't think that you will see a lot of this going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question, Sabine Bl&#xFC;mel and then Adam Hull.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sabine Bl&#xFC;mel, Creative Global Investments. Follow-up on the pricing in November, the 3-Series event, you pointed out that you also see a negative pricing effect in the beginning of the year because of the 3-Series. So, could you quantify that and also compare it to the fourth quarter because full year 100 basis points, that came in exactly as you targeted but as I remember in the third quarter result you said, third quarter was better than expected, so the fourth quarter by implication must have been worse than you expected?</p>
          <p>And on China, I mean, we are talking all about the joint ventures but the real money you make by exporting cars and if I'm not completely mistaken, you make a pre-tax profit per unit sold exported to China north of &#x20AC;10,000. So, if you broaden your portfolio and introduce smaller and smaller cars, at some stage, the unit profit will go down. So, what is your time horizon on that? And will you, going forward for the next years, will you maintain the same import share or trying to maintain the same import share as you have done before <mark type="ph" /> for 260? (1:36:02)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The pricing, I mean, we already discussed it. We had a certain burden in pricing in the second half of the year 2011. So, at the end of the year, in the average we achieved those 100 basis points but we lost a bit in the fourth quarter. That was what we discussed already I think. And now in the first quarter 2012, I think the burden will be around 50 basis points. There is still the run-out of the old cars to be managed as I explained to you. And there's always a certain burden because it's a staggered launch until we really have replaced all the old cars, will take a while. That's what we discussed already in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, the profitability in a Chinese business, I think &#x2013; now just to give you an average number. I think we have to look at the Chinese business as a combined business. I cannot just separate the export business from the import business because if we were able only to export, they would not allow us to do it, so it will be restricted. So, you have to keep the balance. Dr. Reithofer mentioned it, it's a give and take and one of the gives is to build up local production in the local market. Having said this, I just want to remind you all the local business is profitable. It's not only the share we get out of the joint venture, and by the way, the joint venture is quite profitable. We get royalties paid and we are selling kits to the joint venture, so there are many other sources of profitability that we count into our overall China result.</p>
          <p>Of course, the stronger profit comes out of the export business and we have not said that we want to go away from the export business. What we will have to do is we have to increase the share of the local business. But this does not avoid a growing business for exports. So, both streams will be &#x2013; will have to grow the local production and the local business as well as the export and in average &#x2013; my guidance would be in average. If you look at all units being sold in China and we look at the contribution, it is stronger than the average contribution in the rest of the world. That's what we can say and I think this will be true for the next couple of years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Adam Hull from WestLB. Three questions, firstly on the warranties. If I look at the balance sheet, I think your warranties actually fell slightly year-on-year on the balance sheet and your warranty charge in the P&amp;L, &#x20AC;918 million, down slightly from &#x20AC;928 million. That is only &#x20AC;550 a car, roughly, for possibly a three-year warranty. I mean that's an impressive achievement, but is that the low now? I mean should we expect that to rise from here?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, if I look at your Auto cash flow, I understand how you have a &#x20AC;577 million provision add-back. I think that's mainly to do with the payment of the employee bonus coming in Q2. What is that cash actual amount that we are paying in Q2 on the employee bonus and roughly how is it calculated? Is it a formula linked to PBT? It used to be linked to dividend. What's the method there? And then finally, when you talk about &#x20AC;3 billion of Auto cash flow in 2012, just in broad terms, what is your thought on working capital within that? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. &#x2013; yeah, we can start. Yes, warranties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can start with Mr. Eichiner. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with warranties. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, while the story behind warranties is quite easy I mean and very well, promising to us, we could improve the product quality of our cars and that is reflected in the warranty number. And that is a very positive trend, and it's reflected there. Now the bonus, how high was the bonus? That was your question. It was a high three-digit million amount in 2012 paid in quarter two. And your question about working capital, well, we see &#x2013; at least in quarter one, trying to decrease the working capital over the course of the year, we have to wait how the markets will develop.</p>
          <p>We could not rule out an increasing working capital because if the market momentum holds on, then you have to supply your growth. And that means it depends a lot whether market growth takes place. So, for example, if it's overseas then you have to ship the cars, you have to fill the pipelines and this has clearly an effect on the working capital. That was already true in quarter four.</p>
          <p>If you look at the increasing working capital, which is reflected in our numbers, that was voluntarily done in order to really supply our overseas business in Asia, in China and the U.S. And it was the right thing to be done because now we get the benefit out of this with the very good numbers in the first two months of 2012. So, that's something we have to take into consideration going forward if you look at the working capital development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just &#x2013; on the warranty, I mean, it's a low number. I mean, the point really is that you have such a big rise in revenues and unit sales and to see an absolute fall is quite impressive. I mean, can that now &#x2013; will that now have to go up as an absolute number or can it stay at this sort of what seems a very impressive level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, with the new product we are bringing to the market, we had very tough target for the quality we want to achieve, and that is more or less now reflected in the numbers. Of course, you cannot go further, further, further down. In a growing business environment, this number in the long term definitely will go up a bit. But if you look at a per unit number, I think the improvements will proceed, that's what we are expecting. Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, next question, we have Philip Watkins and then Charles Winston.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. Philip Watkins from Citi. I wonder if I could just ask about the further expansion of the Bank within Europe. You mentioned you want to increase, I think <mark type="ph" /> and I suggest this (1:42:58) that you want to increase the amount of customer deposits, what is the sort of the maximum amount of customer deposits you think is appropriate for your Financial Services business? And are you going to be able to offer these in several countries beyond Germany?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if I may, will that &#x2013; how much of a difference will that make to your capacity to borrow from the ECB? What is the amount of eligible collateral you have now at Financial Services? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are two targets when it comes down to financing. The first target is to accumulate deposits and use it for financing. Actually, all together if you look at the European Bank and the U.S. Bank, we have roughly around &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;12 billion deposits, that's always the level we want to go for. And we use it within our refinancing for the different markets.</p>
          <p>Now having said this, there's another target we want to fulfill and it's more about the Leasing business where we want to ramp up assets in the Bank and prepare ABS transactions. So, with a structured ABS transaction, we then are capable to approach the central banks. And we will do it only in the case of a liquidity shortfall, so it's a preparation for the crisis because this is a very, if you want &#x2013; a very efficient measure in order to protect our liquidity buffer we need for the overall business. And that is the major idea behind it. That's why we are looking to integrate more and more portfolios into the Bank and to move it forward this way. That's the idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a &#x2013; what is the amount you could borrow now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually the &#x2013; it's very low because we are on our way to build in our European Bank. We are on our way to build up systems and processes and to prepare for ABS transaction. So, we will go for the first transaction this year, and then prepare the whole structure to a bigger amount, then we are talking billions for 2013 in order to be able to really &#x2013; to realize this strategy. That's &#x2013; and actually we are in a preparation mode, all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we are on the customer deposits then, so it will stay as &#x2013; the proportion of funding from customer deposits will stay quite stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's what we &#x2013; what you can expect. Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much because it's a quarter to twelve. Next question, Charles, and then David Cramer [Berenberg Bank].</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Charles Vincent from Redburn. Thanks. Just &#x2013; I'm sorry to come back on the high triple digits in terms of the future cost. But I just want to make sure I'm not going to double count. In other words, I'm guessing a chunk of that is captured in your R&amp;D guidance of the increasing to 5.4%. So, I just want to make sure how much of that figure is in the R&amp;D guidance you've given and how much of that is going to be additional to the R&amp;D? And I guess perhaps in terms of how much the &#x2013; of the future costs we saw in 2011 fell into the R&amp;D figure as well. Just secondly, just given your negotiations with IG Metall, what you might be able to think in terms of the HR costs in that bridge, what that might do in 2012?</p>
          <p>And finally in this forum last year, you gave us a fairly wide range in terms of profit from China. I think you said it was 20% to 30% of Auto's profit and I think as we went through the year last year, it emerged it's probably quite towards the upper end of that 20% to 30% range. I was wondering if you might be able to give us some sort of update in terms of the percentage of profit from China in last year. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, our future investments, clearly, the &#x2013; all the numbers, the absolute figures we demonstrate are part of the ratios. So, that's why I said we still have room to maneuver in the ratios. We are below 5% in 2011. The target range is 5% to 5.5% and the CapEx is really north of 7% and we have another 2% headroom to maneuver. So, that is what we are guiding all the time, that despite those burdens we have to take into account for future investments, the ratios in R&amp;D and CapEx should be cut. That is our overall target.</p>
          <p>Now, HR cost, yeah, that's due to the negotiations with the unions actually and we have to first finalize negotiations and we can see how big the bill is. But we can expect something coming from this side. That's absolutely clear, you know what they are requesting and it's, I would say, really an issue. Our share of China profit, our guidance 20% to 30% still holds on and I can tell you last year, we've not been at the upper end of this range. We've not been at the upper end of this range, just to make that clear, all right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I noticed from your Annual Report you have a currency exposure of around &#x20AC;7 billion &#x2013; over here &#x2013; around &#x20AC;7 billion to the Chinese renminbi. Is that a number you can keep stable over time as you grow your local production or should we expect that number to increase? And then maybe can you talk about what actions you can actually take to hedge against volatility on that currency? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think this exposure will grow over time as long as the economy is growing in China and as long as the markets are growing in China. Of course, we are hedging with the investments for the new plants and the ramp up of the local business, but as I said, as long as we are in a growing environment, as long as we see double-digit growth numbers there, the exposure is expected to grow. That's why we have to be prepared. But nobody knows how long this will take place. We have to take into account that this could end at a certain point in time. But for this year and maybe the next year, we still think that the business will see a chance to be grown in this country.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. I'm Laura Lembke from Morgan Stanley. I just have one question, you talked about returning money to shareholders. So, I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of an update on your dividend policy going forward, and also, if maybe a special dividend for 2012, I mean, financial year, would be compatible with your internal liquidity requirements? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, we promised to you that we will bring the dividend payment into a range of 30% to 40%. We've taken the first huge step for 2011. Now we are at the lower end at 30.7%. So, we reached the range and we kept the promise. And I think we will look for the same approach for 2012 as well. If everything goes right, I think the range of 30% to 40% is something where we want to hold on, but I just ask you for your understanding before we talk of huge dividends. We first want to see how this year works out. We have now a few on two months of 2012 and I mean, this will be a discussion maybe we should have again at the end of the year when we are much more clearer what we really can earn in 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Fran&#xE7;ois Maury, Oddo Securities. I have a question regarding the battery technology, the battery will represent a huge share of the &#x2013; in the value chain of cars in the future. It seems that you are investing a lot in the battery field in the design, the chemistry. Does that mean that you intend to be fully integrated in the battery in the future? I mean in terms of production in terms of development? And could you remind us what are for you the main opportunities and the main risks to be integrated in this field?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the battery technology, you have to differentiate in principle between two parts, one part are the cells and we see the cells at the moment, as a part we buy from another company. At the moment from SB LiMotive, as you know, the joint venture between Bosch and Samsung. So, that is one thing. What we like to do in the future and that was one of the reasons for the cooperation between the BMW Group and Toyota, to understand more about lithium-ion technology; to understand more what technologies can follow beyond lithium-ion; to be able to achieve for the car as a whole a better range in future, let me say, in the year 2020 or 2025. So, that is one part of it. At the moment, cells we buy from another company.</p>
          <p>So, if you see the battery, we do the battery by ourself or let me say, in the joint venture, between BMW and PSA. And we will develop the battery, we will buy the cells, we will develop the battery, and what we will do as well, we will produce the battery. So &#x2013; and as you said, I mean, the battery will be a very important part in future battery electric vehicles or as well plug-in hybrid cars. And we have to understanding &#x2013; we have to understand how a battery can develop further. So, it has to be in our hand from a research and development point of view and from a production point of view. And as I said, cell technology at the moment, our knowhow is very little but we would like to be better, let me say, in five years, and that was one of the reasons for the cooperation between Toyota and BMW.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, it's five minutes to twelve. I think, Philippe, you have the chance for the last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Please, follow-up question, first one regarding ING Lease, what do you expect in term of full-year contribution in 2012? Some deconsolidation of ING Lease? Second point is regarding the underlying topics behind the guidance of higher pre-tax profit. What do you expect in term of impact of derivatives as in 2011, there was a strong write-down regarding your derivative and financial currencies, what is the topic on that for 2012?</p>
          <p>And the last question is regarding also the underlying profit of the contribution of the Chinese JV in 2012. Due to the expansion or introduction of new plant in 2012, do you think that the impact will be negative regarding the contribution of full year of the Chinese JV in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's start. Well, ING Car Lease profit contribution. ING Car Lease was always profitable even in the crisis. And it will contribute to Alphabet's profit with the beginning of 2012, that's absolutely clear. So, our expectation is that the profit of Alphabet will be in a low three-digit million number for 2012 and as I said, they will contribute. And both companies merged together are combining different strength and our market performance so far is promising. They could even grow the business in the fourth quarter by 9% and what we see for the beginning of this year makes us quite confident that the strategic target of this initiative will be achieved.</p>
          <p>Of course, coming &#x2013; in addition to the operational profit, we still have to carry some burden for the integration IT systems, processes and all those kind of stuff. This is something we have to take into consideration when you look at the overall profit. Now your question about the FX impact, especially stand-alone derivatives in the financial result. Well, that is always hard to predict because if you look where the dollar was on the last day of December, it was at $1.30/&#x20AC;, now it changed already. And you have to see just to make you understand why this is something we have to carry as a certain burden. It's part of our hedging and risk management strategy.</p>
          <p>So, just to give you an example, we look at the buying power equilibrium when it comes down to the FX management, and in a situation where the currency is under weighted, I think undervalued, we go for options because at least there's some upside open. In a situation where it's overvalued, we go for forwards.</p>
          <p>So, basically, that means you always have an amount of options as a kind of a worst-case protection in your &#x2013; on your balance sheet. And this leads to a certain fluctuation in the financial result and we've seen this on the currency side with the strong dollar in 2012, which is good news on the other side because it means we had a positive influence on our revenues.</p>
          <p>And your last question, China contribution. Well, I already &#x2013; we discussed this already. I mean, we think also in 2012, the profit contribution of China will be in the range of 20% to 30% because our strategy is not to be dependent on China as much as maybe others are. We will not see a quite well-managed distribution of sales and profit around the globe in order to be more flexible at a point in time, where a crisis or a downturn in a specific region could come in. And that's the reason why we think 20% to 30% is still a very solid guidance for 2012.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question just related to the contribution in the financial result of the Chinese JV mean that the impact in the financial result, the contribution of equity from the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the joint venture, the equity. Okay, I mean our expectation is that this contribution will grow because we see a growing business within the joint venture. And at the end of the day, this will really have a positive influence on our financial result in the Automotive sector definitely.</p>
