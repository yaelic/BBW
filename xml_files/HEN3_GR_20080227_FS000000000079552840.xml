        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our analyst and investor meeting for fiscal '07. Before I give you an overview of Henkel's performance during the past year, I would like to address two current topics. You have learned that we have decided the basics of a program designed, both to enhance our efficiency and to optimize our processes and structures.</p>
          <p>We have taken this decision against the background of changing market conditions, especially with regards to even stronger competition and increasing cost pressure. This where -- way we prepare for oncoming developments and ensure the future viability of our company from a position of strength.</p>
          <p>The program, which will be initiated on a worldwide level, is to define projects in all business sectors, regions and functions with the aim to sustainably strengthen both Henkel's profitability and long-term competitiveness.</p>
          <p>The initiative with a volume of about &#x20AC;500 million is designed to generate annual savings of around &#x20AC;150 million from 2011. Based on experience from similar programs in '01/'04 carried through in the past in these two years, these measures could result in the reduction of about 3,000 jobs.</p>
          <p>We are fully aware of the particular responsibility entailed especially with this part of the considerations. The program is not about mere reduction of costs but about an investment in processes and structures with future viability to which we are committed due to our corporate responsibility.</p>
          <p>As in the past, and in accordance with our tradition and values, possible job reductions will be carried out in a socially responsible manner. We will finalize the details of the program following the developments of single project ideas and the subsequent discussions with both the works council and the employees likely to be affected.</p>
          <p>Another topic, which I would like to address, is our intention to either fully or partly divest our stake in Ecolab. We have decided to start a corresponding process. This decision must be seen in connection with the financing of the plant acquisition of the National Starch businesses.</p>
          <p>No final decision has been taken at this time as to the size, the timing and the method of any such divestiture, which would be carried out in accordance with the stockholders agreement between Henkel and Ecolab. We will keep you informed on the next relevant steps of this process.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I will now give you an overview of Henkel's performance during the past year, going into a little more detail with respect to certain important financials. Next, I will address some specific topics, along with an outlook of what we expect to see in '08.</p>
          <p>My colleague, Lothar Steinebach, will then give you a more detailed presentation of our financial performance in last year. Wolfgang Gawrisch, our Chief Technology Officer, will later, will giving a presentation outlining our leading role in the field of sustainability. And afterwards, we have the opportunity to discuss '07 results, financials and our expectation for '08.</p>
          <p>Let's start with a review of the year '07, 131 year in Henkel's history, so a long history. We were again able to continue our good development in the year '07. We were encouraged by our organic sales growth and further increase in profits. Details as follow: Sales increased by 2.6% to &#x20AC;13.07 billion. In organic terms, total sales adjusted for foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments rose by 5.8% with all our business sectors and regions making a contribution.</p>
          <p>We were again pleased with the development of our growth regions, Eastern Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. We increased operating profit, EBIT by &#x20AC;46 million to &#x20AC;1.344 billion, an improvement of 3.5%. And again, all business sectors contributed to this growth in earnings. After adjusting for ForEx the rise was 5.8%. Net earnings rose from &#x20AC;871 million to &#x20AC;941 million. Earnings per preferred shares increased from &#x20AC;1.99 to &#x20AC;2.14, which is an increase of 7.5%.</p>
          <p>In view of this strong performance, we will propose to the Annual General Meeting on April the 14th that it approve a dividend increase of $0.03 per share. That means a dividend payout of $0.53 per preferred share and $0.51 per ordinary share.</p>
          <p>I would now like to address some other topics that are of particular importance to us. Henkel today is already one of the world's most internationally aligned companies. Our world of customers encompasses more that 125 countries in which retailers, distributors and industry, all trust in our brands and technologies.</p>
          <p>Being internationally active also means recruiting our employees and top management personnel from within the international recruitment marketplace. Within this context, the structure of our company where at least one person from the Management Board has to be an unlimited liability for the full debt burden of the company, must be regarded as being outdated.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we intend to establish a corporation, which is Henkel Management AG, which will function as our personally liable partner. This will have no effects, either on the identity of our company or the rights of the Supervisory Boards, the Shareholders' Committee or our shareholders themselves. The only thing that will change will be our name. In future, we will be known as Henkel AG &amp; Co KGaA, instead of simple Henkel KGaA, what is already difficult enough?</p>
          <p>A further advantage of appointing a legal entity as a personally liable partner lies in the permanency of its existence. In future, there will no longer be any risk that, due to unforeseen circumstances the company might suddenly find itself without a personally liable partner. The changes to the Article of Association, links with this measure, will be presented to this year's Annual General Meeting for approval.</p>
          <p>Fiscal '07, was again characterized by our innovations. We will continue our innovation offensive, successfully begun in '06 through '08. Our goal is to become the innovation leader in all our markets. In '07, the initiative focused on simplifying, aligning and optimizing the processes that had been instituted, enabling us to select and pursue the best innovation projects from the large number of ideas submitted. To achieve this goal, we established the so-called Henkel Inno Gate process. Through it, we have succeeded in making our innovation projects more transparent across the company, enabling them to be more systematically analyzed and effectively prioritized.</p>
          <p>This year, the emphasis will be on further increasing the quality of our innovations. To this end, we also intend to intensify our external collaboration activities, in the firm belief that our developments mean that our future lies in project based co-operation, and the guiding principle is here to acquire knowledge wherever available. It does not matter whether it's inside or outside, however its project based. The success of our efforts in this area is demonstrated by the fact that today, our share of sales from products that have been in the market for less than three years, already exceeds our initial target of 30%.</p>
          <p>Innovation power and sustainable development together are key for the future viability of Henkel. Consequently, we are continually scrutinizing our processes to ensure they satisfy the sustainability criteria. In order to be able to meet our own ambitions, we need to ensure the success of our company going forward. For only healthy businesses have a future, are able to employ people and can meet their social responsibility. Hence, we will again be aiming to further improve our business performance in '08. We expect the planned acquisition of the Adhesives and Electronics Materials businesses from National Starch to make a major contribution to this improvement.</p>
          <p>Following the approval of the North American antitrust authorities, we also received the consent of the European cartel authorities on February the 15th, taking us a further step towards the successful closing of this transaction. We envisage completing the takeover as planned at the beginning of April. We will be doing everything in our power to combine these excellent businesses with their outstanding employees and products, quickly and smoothly with our organization.</p>
          <p>Back in August last year, we agreed with Akzo Nobel on a purchase price of &#x20A4;2.7 billion, English pounds, for the National Starch business, and that is equivalent to around &#x20AC;4 billion. We intend, as we communicated, to initially finance the purchase with a bridge loan, the conditions of which we negotiated with a syndicate of banks in December last year. And Lothar Steinebach will later address the structural financing, following the bridge financing.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to the outlook for '08. Overall, we intend to continue to achieve profitable growth as we move forward, which means increases in operating profit EBIT and earnings per preferred share, EPS, in excess of sales growth. And this means we expect to achieve organic sales growth, after adjusting for foreign exchange and acquisition divestments of 3 to 4%. That's like a rotation of our plans we made for '08. And Lothar Steinebach later will comment that we, over the course of the year, are happy to adjust these figures.</p>
          <p>We expect an increase in operating profit adjusted for foreign exchange in excess of organic sales growth. We likewise expect an increase in earnings per share in excess of organic sales growth. And this guidance, to clarify it, does not take into account the effects of our planned acquisition of the Adhesives and Electronics Materials business of National Starch. We anticipate today that we will be able to specify in early May, both the affects of this acquisition and the influence of the two aforementioned current topics on our outlook.</p>
          <p>Let me now summarize what I have presented. '07 was another successful year for Henkel. Thanks to strong organic growth, we were able to further increase, both sales and profits as well as further expand our presence in the major growth regions of the world. We achieved all this in what was often a difficult market environment, due not least to both increasingly stronger competition and increasing cost pressure.</p>
          <p>These positive developments reaffirm our strategy of striving to attain the position of innovation leader in all our markets by remaining true to the concept of sustainable development, a core component of our corporate philosophy right along the value chain. We have also made important preparations for our future. The planned acquisition of the National Starch business will substantially strengthen our portfolio. Together with the announced efficiency enhancement measures, this move will significantly improve our competitive position, as well as our prospect for growth in products.</p>
          <p>Plus, the change I have described to you with respect to our corporate structure will extend the scope of our flexibility and further strengthen our competitiveness in the search of managerial talent. Even if we do not expect to achieve our target EBIT margin of 12 in '08, we have established an excellent platform for further profitable growth through the measures I have described. We are, therefore, optimistic as we look ahead and I'm confident we will exceed the 12 in the near future.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would now like to hand over to Dr. Steinebach, who will describe for you in more detail the financial affects and figures of last year of '07.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, as usual, I won't read the disclaimer, because I don't think we're any better with this disclaimer than anybody else. That's pretty standard. If you have a proposal for improving it we're happy to take it. We're going into the first quarter initially then look at total year's financials. I'll give you an update on status of the National Starch acquisition. I'll give you some more background on our program to achieve global excellence, to improve our global excellence and finally, we'll take a look at the outlook for 2008, and particularly as to how we look at the expected economic development in our markets.</p>
          <p>First of all the highlights of the fourth quarter, organic sales growth of 3.8%, with all business sectors outgrowing again their relevant markets, and particularly strong again in our emerging markets 12.9% organic growth. We have improved our prior year our gross margin by 150 basis points. We have an improvement in our adjusted EBIT, and I'll provide the detail on that later, by 2.1%. We have an adjusted EPS improvement of 14% and something about which we're particularly proud, our improvement net working capital to sales ratio by 180 basis points to 11.5%.</p>
          <p>First of all sales growth by business sectors, obviously you see three business sectors, Laundry and Home Care, Personal Care, Adhesives Technologies. We're having and have experienced in the fourth quarter, 2.6% organic growth in Laundry and Home Care, which was slower than in the prior quarters. But obviously we had a very strong first quarter, heavily influenced by the actions and activities for the Persil centenary. And, therefore, we did not expect and I've always communicated that we do not expect that high rate to persist.</p>
          <p>We had a strong 5.4% organic growth for our Personal Care division, which was particularly strong in hair and in body, and particularly strong with organic growth also in North America. Adhesives Technologies were again 5.6% and if you miss the line, some of the business units &#x2013; some of the business units has been organic growth of 4.6% and we had a negative impact in the carpet, bringing that down to 3.8%, but what is important obviously is some of the business units with 4.6% organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>Sales growth drivers, particularly in the fourth quarter, we have provided this level of detail since third quarter. We have little or no price effect in Laundry &amp; Home Care and in Personal Care most, if not all of organic growth is from volume and we had 2.4% price and 3.2% volume in the Adhesives Technologies. There again, an impact from price increases and we've seen that development over the full year in a similar fashion. Organic sales growth in Laundry &amp; Home Care, once again growth mainly in Laundry, stronger development in Eastern Europe, double-digit high teens in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Personal Care, Hair Retail and Professional, particularly strong in emerging markets and I mentioned good organic growth, above the average, in North America. Adhesives Technologies, all business segments, contributing to organic growth, strengthen emerging markets. We've seen weakness in the fourth quarter in our business, particularly North America in the building sector and also the automotive sector.</p>
          <p>That translates into a sales growth by region for the fourth quarter, 5% organic growth in Europe, Africa and Middle East, obviously with a big contribution from Eastern Europe, North America 1.6% with the Adhesives and Detergents division pretty flat and strong performance by Cosmetics Toiletries. 6.5% organic growth in Latin America and 7% in Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>All of this coming together with Eastern Europe, which I mentioned earlier with an even stronger growth, obviously above the average of 12.9% for all the emerging regions. 12.9% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 bringing our sales share &#x2013; total sales in the fourth quarter to 35%. That is obviously exceeding the targets that we have set ourselves for 2008 of 30% and that has obviously also ramifications for the appropriate structures that we need to employ in our business going forward.</p>
          <p>EBIT growth by business sector. We have EBIT growth and EBIT margin growth in the fourth quarter in the Adhesives Technologies division and we had slight downturn in the Personal Care division and an increase in Laundry &amp; Home Care. First of all, the fourth quarter in the Personal Care division was impacted by the divestment of our Fine Fragrance business, which has a strong performance in the fourth quarter because of Christmas business, so therefore, on a total year level that has not much of an impact but obviously in the fourth quarter it did.</p>
          <p>Strong sales growth in our Adhesives Technologies division with strict cost management and lower restructuring charges compared to last year resulted in an EBIT margin improvement of 180 basis points to 10.5%. Adjusted EBIT for the fourth quarter comparing that to fourth quarter 2006, we had adjustment in the fourth quarter 2006, one-time gains of 43 million and restructuring charges of 38 million. Fourth quarter '07, no one-time gains and slight restructuring charges. Adjusting for those figures, we had an increase of our EBIT margin to 10.2%, 30 basis points over prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin improvement over prior year quarter by 150 basis points. We've seen the 45.3%, that is lower than in the third quarter where we've been at 46.5%. You also have seen that our sales in the fourth quarter have been below third quarter; so therefore, we have been lacking some operating leverage in the fourth quarter resulting in a slight reduction in our gross margin in the fourth quarter. We've had over prior year &#x2013; over the same prior year period positive price volume impact and lower restructuring charges. You'll obviously remember our disclosure of the last year &#x2013; of the fourth quarter of last year that we have taken substantial restructuring charges with an impact on the gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>Income statement; gross profits to EBIT, we've seen and experienced in the fourth quarter a reduction in marketing and selling and distribution expenses, lower administrative expenses and much lower balance of net other operating income and other charges. First of all, why did we spend less in terms of marketing, selling and distribution expenses? We did experienced less launching activities in the fourth quarter. We've had huge activities in the first three quarters and therefore as scheduled, we did have fewer launching activities.</p>
          <p>We did experience a reduction in administrative expenses. We did have some special expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006 with consultancy projects, which did not recur, and we've also intensified our efforts at cost savings, which have resulted in a lower charge, administrative cost in 2007 fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Earnings quality, net other operating income, other operating charges obviously very low, only 25 million in 2004 &#x2013; in the fourth quarter 2007, and that's about a normal level. Last year it was impacted by one-time gains. EBIT to net earnings, we have an improvement in financial items by 23%, almost 24%. And the tax rate in the fourth quarter was significantly lower, also significantly lower than our expectations.</p>
          <p>First, with respect to the reduction in financial items, fourth quarter of 2006 was impacted by the charge that we did and had to take with respect to our line participation. We had divested our line participation in 2006, so therefore, that was a one-time effect in 2006, which did obviously not recur then in 2007.</p>
          <p>Tax rate, three or two different effects. First of all, the impact of the German corporate tax reform on deferred taxes. That is one-time impact because we have recalculated our deferred taxes with the effect from the German tax reform going forward. So that's therefore, one-time impact of about 15 million in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the information was not available until the tax reform was really enacted and, therefore, that's one-time impact in recalculating deferred taxes.</p>
          <p>The second impact is from lower tax rates in other countries, especially emerging markets and obviously, you also observe a strong increase in our sales volume in emerging markets, but also the increase in our profitability in emerging markets. So therefore, we are obtaining a bigger portion of our earnings in emerging markets with lower tax rates, so that's lasting impact in 2007. That was an impact of about 9 million, but that's something which we expect also going forward.</p>
          <p>2007 then in complete view, highlights, sustained strong organic sales growth of 5.8% with the growth regions now for 2007 reaching 34% of total sales. Ulrich Lehner has already pointed out our success in increasing our innovation rate to a 31% and we have disposed again our marginal businesses with the sales volume of about &#x20AC;175 million.</p>
          <p>We have improved our gross margin over prior year period by 110 basis points. We have improved our EBIT adjusted by 8.2%. And the margin then again I'll show you the details were 10.5% and adjusted EBIT by plus 14.5%. And obviously, year-end figure for net working capital to sales ratio of 11.5%, that is a tremendous success for our efforts in improving our performance in that particular area.</p>
          <p>Our scorecard 2007 compared to the outlook that we had updated over the period of 2007, organic sales growth right within our outlook of 5 to 6%, EBIT growth adjusted for foreign exchange effects by 5.8%, slightly above or at organic sales growth and EPS growth 7.5%.</p>
          <p>Organic sales growth acceleration, that's, therefore, to stay. That's something which we have turned the tide on Henkel. We had the decreasing rate of organic sales growth culminating in 2.9% in 2004. Obviously, that's a situation, which we had to address and have addressed very successfully. We've turned the tide on Henkel. We're now at a range of 5.8 to 6%, and that's very encouraging.</p>
          <p>Sales growth drivers, this now is a look at the total year. I've provided the same figures for the fourth quarter. As you can see, again the situation for the full year reflects the situation that we pretty much had in the fourth quarter. Little or no price effect in Laundry &amp; Home Care and Personal Care, all sales growth from volume growth and in Adhesives Technologies it's about one half price and one half volume, HPC therefore volume driven and Adhesives both price and volume.</p>
          <p>Let's look at total Henkel Group as it has evolved over 2006 to 2007. In particular in respect of the ratio of sales in emerging countries which we had in 2006, 31%, 2007 now 34%, very much because of the strong growth, strong organic growth that we are experiencing in the emerging markets. And you know that our definition of emerging market is Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.</p>
          <p>And we have excluded from those definitions obviously, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, and other emerging countries, that's why we have in this chart reflected sales in those countries in others. As a result of the strong increase in emerging markets, obviously mathematically the other regions go down in terms of share of sales, although we have increased our sales volume.</p>
          <p>Innovation rate, once again, when we started our efforts at increasing our innovation rate 2006 designating 2006 as the year of innovation, we did not even dream that we would be able to increase our ratios that fast and that sustainably. We have reached a level of more than 30% for the total company. We've exceeded our target, which we thought we would be able to reach in a period of three years. So, that's again very good success, innovation efforts, the years of innovation which we have announced where we have put the total company on notice to help us improving our performance in that respect is paying off.</p>
          <p>Disposals, I've mentioned for 2007, a volume of 175 million of sales which we have disposed marginal businesses, which have no particular relevance for our core. And we've taken actions in 2007 to dispose of our oils and fats business in Turkey, fine fragrances in Italy, and private label business in Luxembourg and the UK. We are continuing with our drive towards streamlining our portfolio getting rid of marginal businesses.</p>
          <p>We have disposed already earlier this year in the first quarter, our industrial water treatment business in Europe. It's been an isolated business, could have been an interesting area, but we eventually decided that we should focus our efforts on the other businesses. That was too small for us to be eventually gaining any meaningful market position. So, therefore, that's a sales volume of 52 million, which we have disposed off. And we're in the process now to dispose off our consumer adhesives brands in the US, Duck, Painter's Mate Green, and Easy Liner, which we have signed an agreement to dispose of.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBIT and earnings per share, again the adjustments that we have provided earlier, one-time gains, restructuring charges, resulting in an EBIT in 2007 adjusted of one billion 370 million, and an improvement of 8.2% over like-for-like period of 2006 and the adjusted EBIT margin reaching 10.5%, again comparing that with the prior year period, 60 basis points above prior year. Gross margin, that's again a very important area for us to improve.</p>
          <p>For total year we have reached a level of 46.4%, 110 basis points over the prior year period. And obviously failing strong increase in raw materials, which again have had an impact on us that could have been even better and some of the outlook will deal with the question, how we will go forward. We had in 2007 been able to over compensate raw material price increases through a positive impact from pricing activities, but also strong volume increases.</p>
          <p>Net working capital, obviously an important area for us, because our financing situation is greatly supported by that improvement, if we compare 2007 -- end of 2007 with the situation in 2003. We have improved by eight percentage points, 800 basis points, which translate roughly into 1 billion financing, which otherwise would have been necessary in order for us to finance our net working capital. That, therefore, is an outstanding net working capital improvement, which we have achieved in 2007, again earlier than what we had targeted 2008. That has positive impact also on our net debt, obviously net debt compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>We have strong free cash flow and we have cash out for dividends. Other financial transactions is the foreign exchange effect on the internal financing of our subsidiaries, resulting in a reduction of net debt of -- by about 700 million to a level of 1.7 billion. That's a very good basis for us -- or has been a very good basis for us to negotiate the bridge loan to which Ulrich Lehner has already alluded.</p>
          <p>That will come in our brief look at the National Starch status, we have established a strong project organization with top management involvement, strong program management offers and integration teams and synergy teams, which are working very hard already in order to prepare for the eventual takeover, which we still expect to be able to achieve until -- in April of this year. We're very close to monitoring everything. And, therefore, we're very convinced that we will be able to achieve our targets which we have communicated. Our jobs until closing will be to -- for now Akzo to carve out Adhesives and Electronics business in cooperation with us, because tax driven structures obviously may have an impact on the way we receive the entities. We're looking at 88 different countries and entities in which to carve out businesses, and in which to then structure the transaction. So that's a huge job to be done.</p>
          <p>And, therefore, we need to differentiate between the integration team that prepares for the structure that are needed in order to receive the entities, and the business people who need to keep focused on customers in order not to lose sales in the process. We're preparing for day one in order to move full speed once we have full ownership. You have heard from Ulrich Lehner that we have received antitrust clearance in the major jurisdictions, US and the EU.</p>
          <p>We've also received clearances in other countries. So, therefore, from a regulatory point of view, we're on very good path. Following closing, our job will be to ensure smooth combination of both businesses, the business of Henkel and the former Akzo ICI business. We want to safeguard continuity of the combined ongoing businesses so that we're not -- competitors are not using the opportunity to chase away some of the business. And we will capture the first synergies from the combined businesses.</p>
          <p>All of this is heavily supported by consultants, because we need initial resources in order to move up the speed with which we combine the businesses and then realize synergies. We have confirmed, in all the work that we've done with respect to that acquisition, the synergies, 240 to 260 total volume. All of this has been done by bottom-up planning, by experienced management, both from our company and from the National Starch people. We've met the National Starch people already.</p>
          <p>They are very, very good management team. We're very happy, not only to get the business, but also the people. It's been validated by industry experts that we will be able to reach that level of synergies. And we have provided the incentives that are needed in order for the integration team to pursue the targets that we have identified for the company. Part of the targets of this year of all Adhesive Technologies managers not just those that are directly involved in the acquisition, are tied to achieving the synergy targets that we have set for this transaction.</p>
          <p>Bridge financing accomplished, Ulrich Lehner has alluded to that already. We had signed an agreement in December with banks to provide the bridge loan of &#x20AC;2.6 billion, its divided into two tranches, one 1.6 billion, tranche A, with a duration of 12 months, and an extension option for us of another 12 months, and tranche B, 1 billion, with a duration of six months, and another six months option for us. The remainder of the purchase price will be financed initially through extend or utilizing our commercial paper program. We're right now pretty much at zero utilization of the program. Total volume of it is 1.4. We need just 1.2, because of the decrease in value of the British pound, as compared to the euro. So therefore, the GBP2.7 billion purchase now translate into &#x20AC;3.8 billion, and we do not expect that to change dramatically.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, that's the amount that we need to finance in order to pay the purchase price, and we have signed off on the purchase price, providing us high flexibility in refinancing this amount.</p>
          <p>Now, how do we propose to refinance? We've talked about this many times. Our position was that we will divest non-core assets in our existing business, that we will increase our debt level, which right now is at 1.7 by up to 2 or &#x20AC;2.5 billion. And we've now taken the decision to divest some or all of the Ecolab stake. That pretty much obviates the need for a capital increase, because if you look at the market value of the Ecolab stake, which is in the range of &#x20AC;2.5 billion, that's obviously more than enough, even if we assume that part of the Ecolab stake will be taxed.</p>
          <p>That confirms our commitment to maintain the A rating, and I think that this portfolio of asset disposals and the Ecolab stake, and eventually some more debt, will be available during the rest of the year. We don't have an exact timeline for, obviously, the divestment, and that's been communicated in our press information. All the discussions, all the ramifications that need to be taken into account will be discussed now among others with Ecolab.</p>
          <p>The first step in moving that process ahead is the decision that we've taken earlier today, and all other discussions will now start.</p>
          <p>Global Excellence program, why do we do this? We have had a good year. We've been successful in 2007. And the question is then, why do we propose to go into our structures, provide changes in our structures and processes, and thereby improve our situation, our profitability?</p>
          <p>First of all, we do expect that the trading environment will be more difficult in 2008 than in 2007. Obviously, the impact of what we're seeing in the US and elsewhere is not at all clear, but it is clear for most of us that it will be more difficult.</p>
          <p>Second, there'll be another round of significant raw material price increases. We did experience price increases in 2007, but we have seen oil prices climb to more than $100 per barrel. Once again today, therefore, our expectation is that, at least for quite a period of time, that's going to be the level oil price at which we need to make our budget.</p>
          <p>That's beyond the level that we had expected even three months ago. And if you look at the communication of those who pretend to be experts in that area, that's also far beyond the level that was expected at the time. So we have to take that into account.</p>
          <p>We'll see another round of raw material price increases, which will impact us, and where the flexibility to deal with changes in our formulations is lower than it was when we started the whole process of dealing with raw material price increases. So that's an area where we need to do some structural changes in order to gain more flexibility.</p>
          <p>We need to also strengthen our competitiveness. You've obviously seen that we will not reach our target of 12% EBIT margin in 2008. And we need to do a big step in order to move ahead and jump beyond the level that we had achieved in 2007.</p>
          <p>And then, one of the most important aspects is the speed with which we've been able to build our business in the emerging countries has surprised us ourselves. We're now at a level of 35%, and it's likely to increase at the same speed that we have experienced in the past two years.</p>
          <p>We had expected the level of 30% for 2008. So, therefore, we need to reflect the additional investments that are needed in these emerging countries in order to be able to take advantage of our strong sales performance, not only strong sales performance, but also improving our EBIT margin also in the emerging countries.</p>
          <p>So that, therefore, requires ourselves adapting our structure to the change in our regional portfolio. Therefore, we're looking at all structures in all countries, with a view to improving our processes and structures to reflect the changes that we see in our regional portfolio.</p>
          <p>We'll look at all functions in the company, manufacturing, marketing, G&amp;A. There'll be many projects across all regions, business sectors and functions. We have not defined any detail yet. We have defined a volume -- total volume of cost savings that we target. And we have defined a total volume of restructuring charges that we expect we would need to take in order to reach that level of savings. And that's, therefore, the amount of 500 million that we have communicated.</p>
          <p>That translates into roughly 300 million cash out, 200 million special depreciation, plant closures and all the rest of it. That's based on the prior projects that we have undertaken in 2001 and 2004, with a similar distribution of cash out and depreciation. And the savings target of 150 million per annum, which we expect to achieve then after three years. Building up over that period of three years, and then reaching a run rate of 150 million requires, in our experience based on the prior projects that we have done, an amount of about 300 million cash out.</p>
          <p>We'll update on more specific information on projects that we will work out over the next months on May 7th, 2008. The processes will be initiated following today. We obviously will have to approach the bodies of the workers and the workers' councils, in order to discuss with them the ideas that we have, and then we'll provide the detail that is needed.</p>
          <p>Outlook 2008, first of all trading conditions 2008, industrial output we're still moderately positive and optimistic about general industry and packaging. That continues to expand, particularly in the emerging countries.</p>
          <p>We do expect a moderate increase in the automotive business. That again is mostly driven by emerging countries. Electronics has moved to a large extent already into emerging countries, into China. We do expect an encouraging growth there. Construction will be weak in the US, but will continue on the strong level in the growth regions, particularly Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Private consumption, Western Europe, we still expect a moderate increase in the US. Obviously, some of the consumption, at least, in durable goods was driven by home equity loans, which will not be available and, therefore, there will be an impact on durable goods expansion. But other than that, there will be still some growth in the US. Emerging markets strong growth, as we have experienced in the past.</p>
          <p>Raw material prices or raw material costs significantly increasing were also with an impact on us, our current expectation pending the development of the oil price increases in the mid single-digits compared to 2007. Outlook 2008 organic sales growth, Ulrich Lehner has provided that already, 3 to 4%. That's how we go into the year. And we will update as we experience organic growth and results in the quarters, as we did in 2007.</p>
          <p>Financial targets 2008, although we're not yet through with 2008, I think it's appropriate to say that some of the targets will be achieved, and others will not be achieved. Organic sales growth, we've been exceeding our targets -- long-term targets, which we have communicated with a view to 2008. But that was not a number just for 2008. It was a long term target leading to 2008. We've been strong in 2006 and 2007. So, that target well exceeded.</p>
          <p>EBIT margin 12%, we'll not reach that target in 2008. We're at a level of 2 -- 10.3%. And I think I've communicated that we're taking strong steps to improve our profitability. Return on capital employed 16% target, 2008 15.4%. We're close to that. EPS growth, once again, that depends on EBIT improvement and, therefore, that's an area where we need to improve our situation, improve our cost situation, our structures through the Global Excellence Program and then move ahead.</p>
          <p>How do we define our priorities 2008? 2008 will be characterized by integrating -- combining our businesses with the National Starch businesses. We'll see another strong effort at offsetting raw material price increases, not only through working on the cost structure, but also on increasing our prices to our customers in all our businesses.</p>
          <p>We will focus on the Global Excellence Program, which I have described in broad terms. And we'll continue with the disposal of non-core assets, and I've given the examples early in my presentation. So that, to us, means to continue to deliver on our promise.</p>
          <p>The way forward for this year, today we're providing the outlook for 2008. We still expect in April to close the National Starch business, the transaction with Akzo for us to acquire the National Starch businesses.</p>
          <p>With our disclosure on the first quarter 2007, in May 7th, we expect to be able to give you an update on our targets and on our target achievement for the rest of this year on the combination of Henkel and the Adhesives and Electronic Materials business. Also, we expect to be able to provide more detail on the program for Global Excellence, which I have only been able to describe in broad terms. And we'll obviously update the outlook then for the total company on 2008.</p>
          <p>The outlook that we have provided has not included National Starch. It has not included the impact from financing National Starch, but not included the impact from potentially divesting the Ecolab stake. So, therefore there will be a number of changes that we need to reflect in the next updated outlook.</p>
          <p>And we expect to be able in November 6, our strategy and financial targets. Obviously, we're running out on financial targets 2008. Some of which we'll continue, because they are meant as long-term targets not just one chart in 2008.</p>
          <p>But obviously, there's a question as to when are we going to reach our 12% target? What are we doing in order to get to the 12%? And therefore, what are the changes or the continuity that we will implement in order to reach the more challenging targets, which we've not been able or will not be able to reach in 2008? So, we'll provide an update on that situation then in November 6 with the third quarter disclosure, which we expect to hold in London and that's it for me.</p>
          <p>I'll hand over to Wolfgang Gawrisch to provide you with an out -- insight into the sustainability of Henkel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, satisfying the needs of a continuously growing world population, while ensuring the availability of water, energy and other resources is a major concern to the world's governments. Sustainable development is thus a global challenge. At the same time, in macroeconomic terms, it is also an opportunity.</p>
          <p>Henkel has a clear position on this topic. We view sustainability as a commitment for our company and for our activities in the markets we serve. Furthermore, we see sustainable development as a global challenge. However, we can only strike a healthy balance between economic, ecological and social objectives if each and every one of us does our best to promote sustainability and social responsibility at a local level.</p>
          <p>Henkel is dedicated to sustainability and corporate social responsibility. We have made this principle binding for all of our employees and anchored in our corporate values. This is because we are convinced that effective and environmental protection and social responsibility are essential for a long term success of our company.</p>
          <p>What matters, however, is how we put this principle into practice. We continuously ask our self how we conduct our business and whether our activities truly reflect our values. But we want to do more than that. We want sustainability to be the keystone of our brands and technologies. When we publicly emphasize in our corporate vision that we are a leader with brands and technology that makes people's life easier, better and more beautiful, this is based on our consistent implementation of sustainability at the product level.</p>
          <p>In generating our sales and profits, we strive to conduct of all our business in a socially responsible manner throughout the entire value chain. We are convinced that the integration of sustainability as a core element of our corporate policy has an increasingly positive effect on our business in a number of dimensions, including our economic performance.</p>
          <p>I would like now to explain this in more detail starting with the social aspects. To us, corporate social responsibility starts with our obligations as an employer towards our employees and their jobs. Our employees have already been and will continue to be the pillars to our success. It is therefore, essential that we systematically faster develop their talents and skills, in order to generate and retain the enthusiasm of our employees. We invest in their knowledge, creativity and social competence.</p>
          <p>Regarding social commitment, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention another aspect of our activities. As a responsible corporate citizen, Henkel provides financial and in kind support for projects in the areas of social welfare, the environment, education, science, health, sport, art and culture. Such contributions are made by our corporate headquarters in D&#xFC;sseldorf and by our local sites.</p>
          <p>Since 1998, moreover, we have actively supported the volunteer work performed by our employees and retirees through our worldwide MIT initiative. That means make an impact on tomorrow. Henkel supported a total of more than 1,300 projects in more than 60 countries in 2007. In view of demographic development and growing competition for qualified employee, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure that Henkel is perceived as an attractive employer by the relevant target groups. This includes seeking out talented students around the world and addressing them on a personal basis. For example, we career-tracked student recruitment program.</p>
          <p>Diversity management has a long tradition at Henkel and is a component of our corporate culture. This -- the proportion of employees working outside Germany is steadily increasing and it's currently around 81%. The difference cultures and skills of our employees help us to understand our markets better, underpinning along our long-term success, responsible employees makes a major contribution to safety.</p>
          <p>So next slide shows the trend in occupational accidents per million hours worked. Worldwide, we have reduced occupational accidents to just 1.7 per million hours worked. Our target is clear zero accidents. This has a positive impact in both human and economic terms, because every accident causes pain and suffering to the employee concerned and the time lost through absence from work costs money. Coming back to the recruitment, we have special programs to attract scientist as well. Our competence centers for research and our human resources policy enable us to make considerable contribution to innovation. Each year, we honor the best research projects with our Research Technology Invention Award.</p>
          <p>Recently in January of this year, a total of eight teams received this award for their pioneer projects. Each of these outstanding projects provides Henkel with new potential of business development and cost reduction. Take the like one example, low temperature Protease project for example. Using the new screening system and genetic engineering techniques, our scientists have dissolved a totally new enzyme for liquid laundry detergents. This example is particular, illustrates the link between economic and ecological advances and I will return to it later. Such achievements can only be accomplished by highly qualified and motivated researchers. They work in interdisciplinary international market-oriented teams whose efforts make an important contribution to securing our future liability.</p>
          <p>Let us now look to the ecological aspects in more detail. Ecological advances are not just good for people and the environment. They are also bringing economic benefits, largely due to first, improvements in production processes, so that less energy and water are consumed and less waste and wastewater are generated. This results in greater efficiency and lower costs. Second, improvements in product performance and third, improved customer benefit.</p>
          <p>We have continuously improved the performance of our production processes in recent years. Over the past five years, we have achieved considerable reductions per metric ton of output. In the period from 2003 to 2007 alone, we have been able to reduce energy consumption at our production sites by 2.1% per metric ton of output and the associated carbon dioxide emission by 15%. In 2007, we again carried out a large number of projects to -- to improve energy efficiency at our sites, making numerous major and minor contributions to climate protection.</p>
          <p>Our six Italian sites, for example, already achieved a cumulative energy reduction of 18% per metric ton of output between 2002 and 2008 -- 2006 by taking numerous individual steps. In 2007, the sites launched a systematic energy audit program with the aim of drawing up an energy balance for each site. We anticipate further significant improvements. We will present a detailed picture of our sustainability performance in our sustainability press conference in March 13th.</p>
          <p>At this point, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the current public debate concerning carbon dioxide emissions, focus almost excessively on emission values in the production processes, and that's not consider the total value chain on the product performing -- performance during end use and the associated customer benefit.</p>
          <p>I would like to explain this using a laundry detergent as an example. This chart shows a lifecycle analysis of Persil Megaperls with energy consumption at the left and water consumption at the right. It makes clear that consumption is greatest during the product uses. The product's economic and ecological significance is, therefore, mainly associated with its performance rather than its product -- production. We recognized this many years ago and continuously improved, not only the production processes but also, and especially, the performance of our laundry detergents. In concrete terms, we improved the washing performance and at ever lower temperature. You can see the results of these improvements in the next slide.</p>
          <p>Over the past 30 years, we have been able to dramatically reduce the laundry detergent dosage and the water and electricity consumption per wash cycle. Consumers and environments have both benefited from this performance. But the focus was not and will not be simply at performance, however. Consumers can make valuable contribution to sustainability with other products, for example, by using less energy and water. And because consumer awareness of sustainability is steadily growing, we are sure that our sustainability concept will increasingly enable us to utilize our competitive advantages. As you can see from the chart, since 1970, our innovations have made it possible to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions associated with laundry washing by 1.5 million metric tons in Germany alone. We owe these results to the sustainability innovation culture in our companies. And I can promise you that we will continue along this road.</p>
          <p>I mentioned earlier that eight teams were readily honored with our Research Technology Invention Award. One of these projects comes out our -- comes from our enzyme research activities. I should perhaps point out here that the steadily improving washing performance at ever lower temperature is entirely contributed -- attributed to new enzymes. Enzymes, the washing active substances are today produced on an industrial scale, using genetically modified bacterias. The necessary research competence has -- is well established in our research department. Last year, the Federal Research Ministry agreed to support our activities into -- to enhance the performance of bacteria used to produce enzymes. This was in the context of a major collaboration project, in which the excellent University of Aachen and the ULI center are also participating.</p>
          <p>The project that won the Invention Award succeeded in significantly reducing the research time for -- and science screening, by using a special screening method. Work that previously took three years can now be completed in one. And I can reveal that we have already obtained new insights and results that will allow us to improve performance still further. The requirements of corporate social responsibility are incorporated and firmly anchored in our research and product development activity from the very start. The focus is on novel product concepts that combine excellence, performance and improved environmental compatibility, while also providing customers and consumers with tangible added value. Our aim is to continue to make people's life easier, better and more beautiful through innovative brands and technologies. This strategy requires a high degree of innovativeness to succeed. In 2007, Henkel invested &#x20AC;350 million in research and development. Worldwide some 2,800 employees work in research and product development.</p>
          <p>Allow me ladies and gentlemen to give you a brief insight into the advances in environmental protection that we owe to our researchers. Let me take you back in the time, the way things were almost 50 years ago. Here you can see piles of foam on a river. They were caused by the foaming laundry detergent surfactant that represent -- present in wastewater.</p>
          <p>This problem was obvious and our researchers developed low form biodegradable surfactants, which they incorporated in our detergent formulations in the 60s. We have solved this problem. Our innovative pioneering spirit was also demonstrated by the launch of phosphate-free laundry detergent in the '80s. Our researchers had also discovered in the '60 that phosphate in laundry detergent acts as a water softener. It can also result in nutrient rich surface waters. This encourages excessive growth of algae, which may seriously disrupt aquatic ecosystems.</p>
          <p>A research program was started, which resulted in the development of Zeolite. Our brand name is Sasil, a phosphate substitute. This was a milestone in the history of laundry detergent. Comprehensive product safety and an environmental compatibility are just as essential as first class quality as convenience and excellence product performance. We, therefore, assure ourselves during the research and development phases that our products and technologies are safe and will have no negative effects on health, on the environment when they are used as intended. In this presentation, I have explained our philosophy in word and action using detergents as an example. Naturally, this philosophy is found anchored in all our business units. To illustrate this, here are just further examples from Cosmetics and Adhesive Technology business sectors.</p>
          <p>Increasing numbers of consumers value products with natural ingredients. To satisfy this consumer demand, we completely relaunched the US range of Pure &amp; Natural personal care product in 2007. The new soap and shower gel formulations contain up to 98% natural ingredients. Great care was taken to select only plant-based care and fragrance extract that are suitable for sensitive skin. The ingredients used are also readily biodegradable. And the cardboard pack in which the soap is sold is made from 100% recycled paper and, therefore, combustible. Electronic devices have become an indispensable part of our daily lives.</p>
          <p>Traditionally, soldering pastes containing lead have been used to connect the individual components of these devices, chips and circuit boards electrically to one another, as early as 1997 collaborating intensively with our partners in the electronic industry, we began to develop alternatives and offered lead-free processes to manufacturer trials.</p>
          <p>Building on this we have able to successfully market the first lead-free soldering materials in 2002. In Europe, the use of lead in the electronics industry has been drastically restricted by law since 2006. In 2007 we introduced the third generation of Multicore LF 600 with an even better formulation designed to meet increasingly demanding customer requirements. Multicore LF 600 has enabled us to further increasing our share of the market for lead-free soldering pastes.</p>
          <p>With our OSI Green Series, we have launched a number of green adhesives and sealants in the US market. Throughout the product range, we have cut the percentage of rate of volatile organic compounds from 25 to 35% to less than 2% while simplifying ease and use. We are, therefore, able to meet the requirements for certification by the Greenguard Environmental Institute, an independent organization in US, which establishes indoor air quality standards for various kinds and products.</p>
          <p>The use of the OSI Green Series also helps to qualify buildings for certification of their energy efficiency in accordance with the leadership in energy environmental design rating system. Ladies and gentlemen, when we consider our situation at Henkel today, it is evident that our sustainability culture has been anchored in our values from the very beginning. This commitment to sustainability and to success is, I would say, is part of our DNA. The DNA is of our employees.</p>
          <p>We are therefore, convinced that we have all the attributes required to shape our future successfully. Innovative drive and sustainable business practice provide the basis for securing Henkel's future. We constantly review our processes to ensure that they satisfy sustainability criterion.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, I have always considered it essential to examine how we earn our money and whether our actions in this regard truly reflect our corporate values. We see this as part of our corporate social responsibility, to which we are dedicated through the world. And we fully embrace the commitment going beyond the governmental requirements and acting as a good corporate citizen.</p>
          <p>Sustainability and social responsibility cannot be left solely to the endeavors of companies. We must play our part, all our part, but the impact ultimately depends on the collective responsibility of individuals, which each person making a conscious decision to buy the more sustainable product and alternative.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me close showing you with one chart. We have always said that sustainability does not exclude success. In the future, we will say that our ability to integrate suitability in our business policy is the guarantor of our future competitiveness and, therefore, of our success. Thank you very much</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Guillaume Dalibot from Credit Suisse. I've got two questions please. Few months ago I had the impression that your view was to do some ongoing restructuring rather than go through a bigger plan. I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what has prompted you to go through a third restructuring -- big restructuring program. And the second question is on the gross margin, you said that in Q4 the lower gross margin compared to the previous quarter was due to lower operational gearing. Given that you are guiding for 3 to 4% growth in 2008, which will be a slowdown from 2007, is the level that we've seen in Q4 '07 a good indication for what you could achieve in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to the first question is, indeed, we said we are not planning. However conditions have changed since then. We have communicated that we have the so-called agenda 12, where we had addressed various projects to improve our profitability expressed in EBIT margin. We realized over the course of the years that the environment had changed, that the speed of change is higher today than it was yesterday, and especially as Lothar Steinebach said, facing tremendous pressure in terms of raw material price increases, moving industries and additional changes in the emerging markets. And therefore, we decided that it is the proper time to put additional pressure in profit improvement, in margin improvement and launch this program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to GP1 margin, we obviously have budgeted an improvement of 46% level that we had achieved in 2007. There is obviously also a question with respect to what's going to happen as a result of the raw material price increases. If they come through there is usually delay in our ability to pass on price increases and thereby, an initial impact, negative impact, on the GP1 margin. So we're pretty much unable to have GP1 margin prediction per quarter. But for the full year, we're confident that we are going to exceed the level that we had in 2007.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy Fialko at ABN Amro. I've got a couple of questions. The first one is on the restructuring savings. Do you expect the full &#x20AC;150 million of savings to drop down to the bottomline? Or do you expect to reinvest a portion within the business? And the second question is on raw materials. Can you just quantify your expectation at the moment as to what the year-on-year increase in your raw material bill will be? Thank you.</p>

          <p>First question, restructuring savings, the 150 million that we're targeting in the first full year operation once we've completed the program. The current expectation again is based on the experience that we've had with the other programs. We think we're going to be able to realize the full amount of savings and also realize the full amount of savings in our bottomline. The other question, which you haven't asked but I will answer anyway, that is how does the rest of the bottomline develop? Well, obviously that's not the only impact on the bottomline. The other will be from raw material price increases and as we cope with them, our own price increases as they have an impact on volume and therefore our expectation or I should say our outlook is for the time being that we'll be looking at a tough challenging year 2008, within which to deal with the new impact from strong raw material price increases that we assume that follow in 2008. We do not see another huge round of price increases, another $150 million per barrel, but unfortunately I'm not better at predicting that kind of development than the experts. So if we at least for a period of time, stay at a more reasonable level without the huge increases in oil and the resulting raw material price increases, we should be in a good position to benefit completely from the savings, from the restructuring. With respect to quantifying the impact from raw material price increases, first of all, I would like to make a distinction between what I call the gross effect and the net effect. Gross effect is, if we simply assume the volume of spend on raw materials and packaging materials of 2007 and pretty much no change in the portfolio, how would that impact us without countermeasures, without changes in terms of sourcing other materials, sourcing from other vendors and everything. And that's what I mentioned to be in the mid-single digits. And if I may translate that, that's between 4 and 6%. That's the usual definition of mid-single digits. If you look at the volume of raw materials and packaging materials that we have in the Group, its about 3.2 billion raw materials and 1.6 billion packaging which adds up to 4.8 billion total volume. So, that's the volume on which to apply percentage rates.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Harold Thompson, Deutsche Bank. I've got two questions for now. The first one is you mentioned that there are more disposals highlighted in the first quarter in the US consumer adhesives. Could you just give us an idea of the level of sales of those assets? I seem to remember that duct tape was about $200 million of sales. And of course, if you sell those assets, assume a good price, the amount of Ecolab shares you need to sell, given the free cash flow you will generate over the next 12 months is very limited. So, is it fair to say that your plans to sell Ecolab are limited disposals rather than large disposals, so first question? And then the second one is on the tax rate, you were saying that effectively there is a kind of one-off benefit of German tax reform in the fourth quarter. So, we're going to see a slight reversal as we go into next year. But also if you sell Ecolab shares which are net of tax in your P&amp;L, does that mean your tax rate next year would actually be higher than it is this year? Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer is, yes. The long answer is, for the first two questions US consumer adhesives, I think it is north of &#x20AC;150 million. And what exactly it's going to be will then depend on the ForEx rate of exchange, once we complete the deal. And I rather prefer to communicate about the detail once we have completed the deal. Whether that means that we have a limited or large portion or all of Ecolab for disposal. That's entirely open. Our communication is not without purpose the way it is. And, therefore, I'm not going to say anything else than what communication says. If the situation, or if situations change, you'll obviously know that we may adapt our communication, but for the time being that's what it is. The tax rate, perhaps a little bit more in detail. First of all we have -- or had a one-time impact in the fourth quarter, and we have also in addition to the one-time impact a sustainable impact. And I mentioned that the sustainable impact which is from the lower tax rates in other jurisdictions where we have stronger business development will persist. So, therefore, for the time being our expectation without the other changes that you alluded to would be for lower tax rates, our guidance would be for the full year in the range of 25 to 26%. Now again, then if we were to dispose of all of Ecolab that would have an impact of between 1.5 to 2 percentage points, up on the tax rate. There will be an impact, likely impact from the restructuring program, once we have identified that in more detail; that should have a positive impact. Again, that's one-time impact. So, therefore, 2008 operative is what it is and what I mentioned, there will be some changes over the year, which we will then have to reflect in our updated outlook on the tax rate also.</p>

          <p>Yes, Martin R&#xF6;diger from Cheuvreux. Two questions to Mr. Steinebach, first is on net working capital. You have reached now 11.5% compared to sales in 2007. Do you see further room for improvement and maybe you can share us how much? Second question is on emerging markets exposure. You now have seen 34% exposure to emerging markets on Group level, can you provide us what is the exposure for the three divisions: Adhesives Technologies, Detergents, and Cosmetics to emerging markets and how do you think it also, to continue here?</p>

          <p>First question, we've not yet defined new targets for net working capital as we've not defined new targets for the total company in other areas. So we'll provide that again also in November. Do I see room for improvement? Obviously yes. The simple answer is yes. I do see room for improvement and I think that will provide more challenging targets than as I mentioned in November. With respect to what you call emerging markets exposure, which I would call emerging markets opportunities, obviously you have observed that we have 34% for the total company. We have a slightly higher level in our Adhesives division and therefore a slightly lower level in the other two divisions.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Elise Badoy from Goldman Sachs. I have one question on the restructuring program. Could you contrast the one-off P&amp;L cost that you will incur with the potential cash cost?

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First remark, we have not identified the detail that is necessary to really answer the question. Therefore, I can only refer to our prior experience with the other two big programs where we have had the cash out in a similar distribution between the total volume of restructuring and the cash out and depreciation. And our experience is &#x2013; and that's no surprise that the smaller amount will be in the first year and the biggest amount will be in the second year and then there will be a tail in the third year. What exactly that's going to be, we'll have to obviously rough that out once we have the detail of the individual projects. As we develop them, we'll update that communication. But it's clear, cash out will be, I guess the lion's share of cash out will be next year rather than this year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst, several questions. First question to ICI Adhesives, you now state to current exchange rate, it's only purchase prices 3.8. Actually I had in mind that you hedged a bigger part of the acquisition price and therefore can you update us here what did you with the hedges and would that impact that? Second point on raw material costs, can you little bit clarify how the raw material cost increase was in 2007? If I look into your annual report you obviously state raw material costs and here I see just an increase of 1.7% year-on-year and how does that fit with the numbers you actually provide? Did you state volumes or can you a little bit explain on that? And third question, last question actually is on cosmetics, so you had obviously a EBIT reduction in the fourth quarter of 30 million, you claimed that fragrances cost you the money. I have to say, I doubt that 50 million sales can fully explain the 30 million shortfall so to say. Question is, can you update what were the other impact here on &#x2013; sorry, 30 basis point was actually. But can you update was there any other impact here on your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question with respect to the 3.8 billion, a little bit more background. We have indeed taken hedges on 75% of the purchase price in November when the transaction were between Akzo and ICI cleared and therefore we had certainty of transaction, which was the basis for being able to take a hedge. We did not take a hedge in August when we signed the agreement. So the decrease in value of the British pound between the period of August and November, that's -- that is resulting in the decrease of the purchase price. In other words, roughly &#x20AC;200 million less that we need due to the fact that the British pound has decreased in value between August and November. We still have 25% of the purchase price open. So, therefore, for another 25%, roughly one billion, we still benefit from the further decrease of the British pound versus the euro, while we have logged in the other rate of exchange for 75%. Obviously, taking a hedge means that the hedge has a market value, between November -- and now the British pound has decreased in value. So, therefore, we have a negative value on the hedge, which is reflected in equity. Eventually, that, therefore, will be part of the purchase value of the acquisition. Had we not taken the hedge, obviously, from today's perspective, it would have been even more beneficial, but that's the character of taking a hedge. You lock in a situation as you see it at the time and, therefore, you don't benefit if it would have improved, but you also do not suffer if it had gone the other way. So that's, therefore, with respect to the hedge. Raw material costs as they are contained in the Annual Report. The material costs, and that now goes into the real intricacies of accounting, material costs as they are contained in the annual report is based on the Gesamtkostenverfahren. That's a different methodology from the Umsatzkostenverfahren, which is the IFRS methodology. And the difference, Gesamtkostenverfahren material costs includes changes in inventories. So we did have a big swing in inventory between '06 and '07. So, therefore, there was positive impact on material costs in '07 compared to '06. And, therefore, material costs as it is contained in the Gesamtkostenverfahren did not increase as much as in the Umsatzkostenverfahren. So, the correct view is Umsatzkostenverfahren, the material costs that relates to the sales that we've achieved. And, therefore, as we look at the gross margin, obviously that contains the cost of goods development. And I may now come back to maybe it was something which I haven't completed, that's the difference between gross and net. Gross price increases in 2007 were in the range of more than 4%. Through lots of measures, including changing suppliers, changing materials, changing formulations, we've been able to decrease that impact based on the portfolio of raw materials that we had experienced to -- in the low single digits, so between 1 and 2%. So, therefore, that's the impact as it arrives in our figures. And, therefore, that's, as far as we're concerned, the view that we need to take in order to deal with raw material price increases. Finally, the cosmetics, 30 basis points that we...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I can jump in, if you want? I think I got a shock with the 30 million. So, it's &#x2013; the 30 basis points are solely due to the perfume business. Anyway if you even adjust the EBIT for currency, even after high EBITDA last year, so adjust for currency, we were above last year. And the margins <mark type="inaudible" /> 13.3%, the highest quarter margin of the year, so far on the margin cosmetic Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just looking at your Western European growth in Q4, if you extract the very strong growth from the developing markets, it would appear that Q4, your growth in Western Europe was negative, sort of 1 to 2%. Can you explain the cause of that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, that depends on the level of, particularly in the HPC businesses, on the level of launching activities that have been scheduled for a particular quarter. That's why we usually take the position that a -- one particular quarter is no more than a coincidental share of real life. One needs to look at the total year. We're not managing the company according to the quarter in order to look good in any particular quarter. We have scheduled activities and actions over the year and even if then in the fourth quarter our growth in Western Europe, for example, is lower. We have experienced very strong growth in Eastern Europe, for that matter, also in the fourth quarter. And I mentioned earlier that we had strong organic growth in North America and in our cosmetics business. So all in all, we've been quite successful in our businesses in organic growth, not necessarily in all regions, but that's due to the fact that we have certain schedule for activities, which are sometimes more stronger, with a stronger impact in a particular quarter. There is no particular negative impact from market developments or anything of that sort.</p>

          <p>Hi, Mark Christensen from Morgan Stanley. In November, as part of the Adhesive presentation, you had a slide which suggested your financial target or your per annum target for that business is 5% growth each year. I was wondering if, perhaps, Mr. Lehner, you are able to comment on your confidence in that target for 2008?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm sorry. There was a slide in your November presentation on Adhesives, which suggested that a ongoing per annum target for the Adhesives division is about 5%. I was just wondering if you're able to comment on your confidence in that target for 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we obviously differentiate between long-term targets and short-term outlook. The short-term outlook contains some of the insecurities that we face when going into a particular year. Long-term, we expect to be able to grow with our Adhesives business much stronger, far stronger than our markets, which is due in part to the fact that bonding applications are being substituted by adhesives. That's a very important aspect and part of our success in our Adhesives business. And that's a long-term development. If you look at the totality of bonding applications, about 20% only, are done through adhesives. All others are done through nuts and bolts, rivets, welding, soldering and everything. So therefore, there's an ongoing process of substituting traditional methods of bonding through adhesives. And, therefore, our stronger growth in market is due to the fact that we're substituting traditional methods of bonding. If you also look at changes in materials that are necessary in some of our industries, lightweight materials that can only be bonded together with adhesives, a good example is the aircraft industry. If you look at huge aircraft, which do not employ a lot of aluminum anymore, instead they are using carbon fiber. All these materials can only be bonded with adhesives. And that goes on in the automotive industry, if you look at the necessity to cut down on weight in the automotive industry without losing strength. There's a lot of interest in methods of bonding, even lightweight materials still added to the automotive bodies. That's a development that long-term will certainly continue, very much because of the impact on fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, and everything, but also on the ability for an airplane of the size that we see to lift off the ground. Otherwise, it would not be capable of doing this. So there are lots of ideas that we generate in order to substitute existing applications. There's also another element that makes it more difficult to have a specific prediction of how much that is going to occur in any particular year, because the duration of a model in the aircraft industry is 15 years and car industry is four to six years. So, therefore, there are changes in the industries, which have strong impact in a particular year, but then for a number of years, that may not happen. So, therefore, long-term that's clear expectation for us. Short-term sometimes more difficult to predict for that particular year and that's why we update the outlook with which we into the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your 3 to 4% target, and I'm thinking both long-term and short-term, obviously, you now have 35% of sales coming from emerging markets, growing in low double-digits, so that alone gets you into the middle of that range, is, over a longer term perspective, this 3 to 4% not a very conservative target? And on a more short-term note, can you maybe talk a little bit about how the year has started? And can maybe Mr. Van Bylen and Mr. Stara talk a little bit about the innovation pipeline this year, are we still going to see the 40 and 35% we've seen last year and what are other big ideas in the pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, with respect to 3 to 4%, isn't that a bit conservative? I think it is inline with Henkel. So, therefore, that's my characterization of how we go about the outlook for the full year. I think that our structure to employ the long-term target, which we have identified, and which we may or may not adapt then in November into a particular year, and then update it as we get more experience and information about what is really happening in the industry -- in our industries, but also in the consumer sector it's a sound one. I don't think it's particularly conservative, but it's certainly something which we think is appropriate for our company. How did the year start? I think that one important element for our communication is discipline. We're not talking about the quarter before we have finished the quarter and obviously that's a big issue sometimes in communication. I guess that sometimes you would be interested in annual -- in monthly results or daily results eventually. And eventually maybe we could even provide that level of detail. I don't know whether you would be well served with it. It maybe enough for us to be happy or unhappy about what is happening in any particular month. And that's why I think one quarter is the smallest, reasonable period of time on which to communicate, because a weakness in any particular month can obviously be corrected and address it in a month, but even a quarter is quite short. So therefore -- just started, yes. We can confirm that. With respect to innovation, we obviously have put a huge emphasis on that area and I think we've shown that we've been able to achieve tangible results, not only in the innovation rates, but also in terms of improving our topline performance. A big portion of our topline performance is obviously driven by innovation. There's another element that Mr. Lehner from time-to-time addresses. That is sometimes maybe you can exaggerate innovation. You can have too many products -- new products, not only confusing your customer and consumers, but also increasing the level of complexity that needs to be addressed in order to go back to a more normal level. So, I think there is a -- there is probably an optimal level of innovation, which drives the sales level to the extent that we can manage it. And then at the same time does not drive complexity to levels that we can not manage down to a more reasonable level. We're in the process of obviously increasing our innovation rates in a shorter period of time than what we had thought with more than 30% for the total company. That's quite an achievement. We do not at this point intend or propose to increase that rate beyond the level. We know that some of our peers communicate about higher levels of innovation, particularly in the homecare sector. But I think that also for us and for our company you see that we have higher levels in Personal Care and in Homecare than what we have in Adhesives Technologies. I think that the mix, that we have achieved right now, we would consider -- the level that we think is appropriate and conducive to the company so, therefore, why we want to solidify the results. We don't think we're there yet in terms of being able to sustain that level. So, therefore, more efforts are being needed and are being expended, in order for us to remain at that level. But I think with the level of 6% organic sales growth with a margin improvement that we expect from the Global Excellence program and our own efforts we're in very good shape moving forward.</p>

          <p>Thanks, it's Alex Smith at Lehman. I just wanted to follow up on Jeremy's question actually about the retention of the 150 million of new savings, which you said would fall to EBIT. I was under the impression these initiatives were put in place to help mitigate cost pressures and increase competitive activity. Does that mean you're actually targeting a higher gross level of savings and the 150 million is a net number, which you expect will fall to EBIT?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the time being that is based on prior projects. I'm unable to make that type of differentiation. I think our experience is clear enough that we will be able to achieve that level of savings with that level of expenditure. But we don't really have the detail available to back up each number. Eventually, it will all add up to at least 150 million. And therefore, again I refer to I guess, your patience until we've developed the level of detail that is necessary in order to back up the numbers. Right now, we're basing our expectations on prior experience with similar programs. So therefore, I think it's a very solid basis, but I don't think I can provide more detail as to whether that's something net or gross or what. So, we'll provide that level of detail.</p>

          <p>Yes, just a couple of follow-up questions. The first one is on National Starch. Can you share with us any information on how the businesses you're acquiring traded in the final quarter of 2007? And the second question is on the Ecolab sale. Is it right that you pretty much have up to two years in which to divest your part, or all of Ecolab, given how long that -- how long the bridge financing would last for, or still, what minor elements of it? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>According to our information of National Starch business, which we are going to acquire, is doing fine at least according to the business plans which were used to run our acquisition calculation. And if I understand your question concerning Ecolab, well, it is always difficult to decide when and what. And we have all the flexibility to fine-tune the decision. As Mr. Steinebach said, bridge financing is in place and it's now our job to optimize the proceeds of Ecolab as far as volume, time and method is concerned.</p>

          <p>And may I add to the bridge financing? If you look at the detail that I have provided, the two tranches, it's obvious that part of it will be probably retired earlier and that's our current expectation. We have taken the additional options because we want to be safe -- on the safe side with respect to our flexibility in retiring that amount of debt. In addition to having the option to extend, it's not an obligation. It's an option for us. We have the ability to retire debt at any time with reasonably short notice. So therefore, if we complete the Ecolab transaction earlier -- and I'm not sure that we need two years, but even if we were to need two years, then that's the way it is. If we don't need it, then we retire debt earlier. That's no problem.</p>

          <p>Alex, did you have a follow-up question?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I did. Thanks. It was about your margin outlook for -- or guidance for 2008. I think if we go back a year, you were indicating that you expected margin progression in 2008 perhaps would be slightly better than 2007. You did 60 basis points of underlying margin progression in 2007. Does that mean we should expect slightly better in 2008, or has the world just changed because of the input costs environmental, or have I misunderstood something?</p>

          <p>I think the bigger item is not that the world has changed already, but that the world is not clear as to where it's going. That's the big issue. You've seen -- I'm sure you've observed communication by our peers. It's been pretty strong in terms of their expectations. I think it is fair to say that the mood in the US is pretty subdued. We've seen some of the discussion when we were in consumer conference in New York in January, and it was a lot of talk about a recession. There's was a lot of talk about dealing with a potential recession in the US. And I think that as we look into an election year, there will be lots of promises and actions, in order to cope with the negative development. But that's something which is very hard to determine from our perspective. We don't know who is going to be elected. That's going up and down. And therefore, I think for the time being our best expectation is the way I've described it. And we'll have to again, watch it and update it as we see a more specific situation evolving. I don't know that anybody knows that any better than what I described. Reality is that you'll find almost opinion going forward and we've provided our own outlook for the time being.</p>

          <p>And it's all very difficult to provide comments on outlooks. We have outlook. This is the outlook and you look at the outlook as you do, otherwise you are paid for doing nothing.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, actually two questions. First of all, on the Ecolab sale, are you allowed to sell your complete stake to one entity? Or is it required that you place it broadly in the market? Is there -- are there any obligations under your agreement with Ecolab? And secondly, again on raw material and input costs, does your assumption of low single-digit increase or mid single-digit increase -- sorry, imply any further change of raw material prices or oil prices from the current level? Or are you basically assuming prices to stay at the current level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the Ecolab stake, are we permitted to do one thing or the other? I always recommend to those who have questions about the Ecolab stake to read the agreement, which we have with Ecolab, which is certainly worth reading. It's about 100 pages, difficult stuff. I've -- unfortunately, in my prior life been forced to do that, so I know quite a bit about it. Reality is that we'll go into the process of selling part or all of Ecolab starting today and, therefore, what happens is not clear yet. It is interesting for us to talk with Ecolab about it, to see what their contribution could be and will be, in order to complete the sale that obviously would be quite helpful. The indications are that they will help us in disposing off the stake. But again, that's something, which we need to explore starting from today, because up until this morning our position with respect to the stake was that it's a long-term holding. And, therefore, there was nothing to discuss about the long-term holding until we changed our position, which was this morning. So, we're now in the mode of optimizing the transaction or a potential transaction and, therefore, optimizing the proceeds from that transaction. It is not only important who exactly it could be the seller or will be the seller. It's also very important that we have the time and flexibility to react to market developments, that we have the time and flexibility to optimize the situation and that we have time and flexibility to negotiate with Ecolab and others. So, that's a complicated process. It is heavily determined by the legal situation with respect to a big holding, such as that, and the legal situation resulting from the agreement that we have with Ecolab. And, therefore, that's something, which we can't be more specific before we've been able to do the discussions and negotiations that are necessary, in order to arrive at final results. With respect to raw material price increases mid single-digits, that's our expectation based on the current oil price. It's also our expectation based on the current US dollar rate of exchange. Current oil price I'd say is slightly below 100, 95 or so. Now, if it goes beyond 100 again that may have another negative impact in addition to what we had budgeted in our expectations.</p>

          <p>Being here, I guess, '07 was a good year for Henkel, as ordinary it was not good enough. We started the acquisition of National Starch, which we hopefully will realize this year and then integrate two strong businesses. We will finance it by selling full or part of Ecolab. And I think that is also to state, as Mr. Steinebach did, there will be no capital increase unless, of course, this program of Global Excellence, which will help us to improve our operational performance.</p>
          <p>So, '08 will be another good year for Henkel. And we do hope that we are able over the course of the year to manage the three top issues, which I addressed. And then we are happy to see you in May and November to update you on our progress. Thank you very much again.</p>
