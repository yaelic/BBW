        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Friedrich Lauer and welcome to our Q2 results conference call and thank you for joining us.  I'll begin by saying that I am pleased with our performance at Daimler through the first half of this year.  Our second quarter results are good. Our unit sales are up 10%.  Our revenues grew by 6%, 11% when adjusted for exchange rate effects.  And our EBIT is driven by the impact of the Chrysler participation, just slightly lower than last year.  I'll take you through the details in a moment.</p>
          <p>Daimler has performed well in an increasingly difficult environment. It's an environment driven by a combination of negative exchange rate effects, higher raw material prices, higher fuel costs, changes in regulation on emissions and slowing economic growth in many of our markets.  Yes, light vehicle market for example declined by more than 18% in June, year-to-date 10%.  The car market in the European Union in June were down by 8%, year-to-date 2%, with the decline of nearly 20% in Italy and more than 30% in Spain, both numbers in June.</p>
          <p>The global commercial truck market is very much a mix picture.  Sales in Latin America are very robust, Europe is holding up but the truck markets in the U.S. and Japan continue to show chronic weakness.  They are off 30 and respectively 14% year-to-date through May.  Still through the first and second quarter mainly due to our sale successes and efficiency programs, our internal performance improved at a rate that kept us out in front of that gross change in the external environment and we made our forecast accordingly.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we had to reassess our situation.  We expect the challenging environment to develop to an extent that we can no longer completely compensate with our comprehensive and successful programs.  We are still moving forward at a good pace and in the top league in our industry but the going has gotten tougher.  As a result, we are adjusting our profit forecast for the year.  We now expect EBIT from ongoing operations excluding Chrysler of more than &#x20AC;7 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's go back to our second quarter result.  The Group's EBIT was &#x20AC;2.1 billion, both Mercedes-Benz Cars and Daimler Trucks report strong EBIT numbers at the level of the previous year.  Our Vans and Buses units delivered improved result, whereas Daimler Financial Services reported lower earnings.  Our Group earnings were somewhat lower than the prior year due to charges of &#x20AC;0.4 billion related to our stake in Chrysler.</p>
          <p>Let's look at our key financial results.  Our EPS was &#x20AC;1.4 down from 1.74 in the prior year period again related to the Chrysler impact. We had a positive free cash flow in our industrial business of &#x20AC;0.1 billion during the first half of the year.  The sharp decline against the prior year period reflects &#x20AC;4.5 billion from the transfer of equity interest in EADS and the sale of real estate properties by Mitsubishi Fuso both of which were included in the prior year.</p>
          <p>In 2008 cash inflows of &#x20AC;1.3 billion resulted from the sale of the Potsdamer Platz real estate complex during the first quarter of this year.  In addition, the acquisition of our share in Tognum and the established credit line called by Chrysler lowered our free cash flow by 0.6 and &#x20AC;1 respectively.  The net liquidity of our industrial business fell from 12.9 to &#x20AC;8.8 billion reflecting our share buyback and the dividend payout as well as the positive free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn to the performance of our divisions, starting with Mercedes-Benz Cars.  In the second quarter, our Car division increased total unit sales by 11% to 354,000 vehicles.  Unit sales of the Mercedes brand grew by 9%.  Unit sales of smart were up by 24% primarily due to its successful market launch in the U.S.  In Europe, unit sales slightly exceeded the prior year level.  In Asia, unit sales were up 28% primarily driven by the emerging markets, above all China. Russia was also substantially up.</p>
          <p>In the U.S, retail sales of Mercedes-Benz were almost at the prior year level against a significant slowdown of the economy and respective market contracts.  Including the successful sales of smart, Mercedes-Benz Cars increased retail sales in the U.S. by 12% outperforming the market and the competition.  Based on our increase in unit sales, total revenue posted by Mercedes-Benz Cars was at &#x20AC;12.9 billion, that's up 3% compared to the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 5, the division's EBIT slightly improved to &#x20AC;1.2 billion resulting in the return on sales of 9.4%.  EBIT benefited from higher unit sales and further improved efficiency.  Those more than offset the exchange rate effects, higher raw material prices and increased expenses for the development of technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  Given the difficult back drop, we continue to further drive our efficiency initiatives.</p>
          <p>Our recently started program Go for 10, defines a comprehensive approach to ensure continuous improvement in our entire business system.  It specifically identifies six specialty disciplines: quality, safety, comfort, design, customer satisfaction and environmental friendliness.  In terms of efficiencies, we further pursue the successful path placed by core.  This means we continue to implement our material and modernization strategy, our engineering for manufacturing initiative, and last but certainly not least our quality offences.  Between 2004 and 2007, our warranty and guaranty cost per vehicle fell by 30%.  We continue to bring those costs down.  And we continue to keep the momentum with our product plan.  We expanded the C-Class model range with fuel efficiency models.  We recently launched the new generations of the A and B-Class.  In June, we began offering the B170 NGT BlueEFFICIENCY, a B-Class that runs on natural gas.</p>
          <p>In fall, both model lines will offer BlueEFFICIENCY versions with the ECO start-stop function.  With the A-/B-Class successor models we'll expand our product range in this segment to four models and attract new young customers.  They will be assembled in the new plant we'll build in Hungary.  We will improve our cost position and competitiveness by increasing commonality with our other model lines.</p>
          <p>We also recently unveiled our new GLK, which will extend our SUV model range with a very attractive, smaller and fuel efficient SUV.  At Mercedes-Benz Cars, we're executing our road to the future and stride for green leadership.  While smart is making sales at home in the U.S, we have a fleet of better electric smart cars operating in London.  We plan to launch production of our electric smart in 2010.  That year we will also launch a Mercedes-Benz model with a full electric powertrain and a limited production series of fuel-cell drive B-Class cars.  In addition, our first hybrid powertrain will come in the M-Class and S-Class next year.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to Daimler Trucks, which also performed well overall, in spite of some very challenging regional markets.  In the second quarter, Daimler Trucks sold 123,000 vehicles beating the prior year level by 10%.  Trucks Europe, Latin America increased unit sales by 17 to 46,000 units.  Truck Asia sold 49,000 units, 3% more than in the prior year quarter.  Trucks NAFTA increased unit sales by 11%, however, this increase came against the weak prior year quarter, when new emission standards became effective.</p>
          <p>So far, the U.S truck market isn't showing any signs of recovery.  Due to overall higher unit sales and an improved model mix, Daimler Trucks' revenue increased from 6.9 billion to &#x20AC;7.4 billion.  With EBIT of &#x20AC;608 million, Daimler Trucks slightly exceeded the prior year result which was positively affected by a special gain of &#x20AC;68 million due to the sale of real estate property in Japan.  We achieved a return on sales of 8.2%.</p>
          <p>Daimler Trucks also made significant progress in improving efficiencies across its business.  The managing the cycle initiative, part of the Global Excellence program is clearly working.  By using common global vehicle architectures and platforms, we are strengthening the integration of our worldwide operations and brands thereby increasing economies of scale, standardization, modularization and flexibility.  We are also accelerating our region expansion to improve our long-term competitiveness as we are doing for example with our joint venture with Hero in India, and we are investigating opportunities for growth in Russia and China.</p>
          <p>Our new Trucks and Green technologies are hitting markets around the globe.  We launched the third generation of our Actros heavy-duty truck in Europe at the beginning of this year.  We recently proved at the Nardo test track that there are new Actros with BLUETEC 5 technology is the most fuel efficient forty-ton truck in the world.  We also offer fuel efficient hybrid trucks.  In North America, our Freightliner brand recently received an order from UPS for 200 hybrid, another 300 natural gas delivery and freight vehicles.  Daimler is the leader in alternative drives for trucks and buses, it's already delivered 3,000 such vehicles to customers.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Vans.  Mercedes-Benz Vans sold 79,000 units in the second quarter, that's an increase of roughly 7% and sets a new all time sales record.  Our Van business revenue increased from 2.3 to &#x20AC;2.6 billion.  Due to high demand for Sprinter models, we decided in June to invest a total of &#x20AC;177 million in the expansion of our van plan in D&#xFC;sseldorf and Ludwigsfelde.  Daimler Buses wrote another chapter in its success story in the second quarter increasing unit sales by 7% to 11,000 units and retaining its market leadership.  This was primarily due to very positive market developments in Western Europe, where we increased market share from 24.7 to 28.8%.  Strong demand in the Brazilian market once again resulted in sales that exceeded the very high level of the prior year.  Daimler Buses revenue increased by 23% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion</p>
          <p>Market and product success drove the earnings contribution of our vans and buses units to 262 million and &#x20AC;170 million respectively.  However, the EBIT of the vans, buses other segment as a whole decreased from 257 to &#x20AC;148 million, reflecting lower contributions from EADS and a charge of &#x20AC;373 million related to Chrysler.</p>
          <p>Let me explain what's behind the number related to our stake in Chrysler.  We took a negative charge from Chrysler at equity result in the amount of &#x20AC;356 million.  As the group accounts for Chrysler with a time lag of three months, that equity result mainly relates to developments in the first quarter of 2008.  The aforementioned 356 includes restructuring related special reporting items in an amount of &#x20AC;93 million.  In addition to the &#x20AC;356 million, there was an impairment of rights related to residual values of Chrysler vehicles in the amount of &#x20AC;17 million.</p>
          <p>Overall, the book value of our stake in Chrysler Holding LLC has reduced from &#x20AC;547 million on March 31 to 171 million on June 30, 2008.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Financial Services, new business increased by 6% to &#x20AC;7.8 billion.  The division's contract volume grew by 4% to &#x20AC;60.4 billion reflecting a 9% increase in the Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific region and exchange rate adjusted growth of 11% in North America.  The reorganization of our U.S. financial services activities is ongoing.  This includes the reallocation of decentralized functions to larger and more efficient operating units.  Higher cost of risk influenced our earnings.  Additional burdens resulted from setting up a new financial services organization for NAFTA.  Increased contract volume had a positive on EBIT, which at &#x20AC;183 million was down from &#x20AC;220 million in the prior year period.  Following the reorganization, our U.S. operations will have an improved cost position.  To further reduce cost in other areas, we are accelerating the captive's number one initiative.  The sharp focus here is on operating expenses and global integration.  We are also looking at exploiting growth opportunities for Daimler Financial Services.  So, overall, we had a strong second quarter in terms of both sales and earnings, also markets that become more challenging in the last weeks.</p>
          <p>Against this background, we reviewed our sales outlook and adjusted our production pattern.  We continue to expect unit sales from Mercedes-Benz Cars in the full year 2008 to surpass the levels of 2007 despite increasing the difficult market situations.  In the second half of this year, we expect a new sales stimulus from the full availability of the C-Class Estate and from our many new models.  For Daimler Trucks, we also expect rising unit sales in full year 2008, reflecting positive market development in Europe and growth in Asian markets.  We expect to set a new sales record for Mercedes-Benz Vans and for Daimler Buses to match the high-level of the prior year once again.</p>
          <p>As the year progresses, we assume the world economy will continue to lose momentum.  Emerging markets should continue their solid expansion also at a less dynamic pace.  As a consequence, we now anticipate that the slowdown of major markets will continue through year-end.  Therefore, we also have revised our earnings expectations for the rest of the year.  Mercedes-Benz Cars that change market perspective, higher raw material prices and negative exchange rate effects will result in an increased burden on earnings.  Significantly, improved efficiency cannot completely offset this burden.  EBIT for Mercedes-Benz Cars is therefore expected to be below previous year's level.  Return on sales is expected to be around 8%.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Trucks, we expect our positive sales development to partially offset higher material costs and the effects of the weaker U.S. economy.  Overall, we anticipate full year earnings to be in the range of &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Financial Services, we anticipate a moderate increase in our worldwide contract volume in full year 2008.  We expect to achieve the return on equity of at least 14% in the full year despite the expenses connected with setting up our own financial services organization in North America.  We expect the Daimler Group in 2008 on the basis of those projections for our divisions to post EBIT from ongoing operations of more than &#x20AC;7 billion. That does not include effects related to Chrysler.</p>
          <p>In closing, Daimler achieved strong results in the second quarter and we continue to build on a very solid foundation.  The adjustment in our expectation for the remainder of the year reflects a realistic assessment of factors we can't control, namely the downside risk in the market and economic environment.  In those sectors we can control, we are building on our positive momentum.  We continue to increase our efficiency and productivity; we have exceptional products rolling out of a full product pipeline in all vehicle categories.  And we are fully committed to and invested in meeting the tough environmental challenge before us.  Thank you for your attention.  Now Bodo Uebber, Andreas Renschler and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much Dr. Zetsche.  Ladies and gentlemen, you may ask your questions now.  I will identify the questioner by name, but please also introduce yourself with your name and the name of the organization that you are representing before asking your question.  Let me add two practical points.  Firstly, please avoid using your mobile phone as this distorts the quality of the call for everyone and secondly please ask your question in English.  Before we start the session, the operator will explain the procedure.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  I have three questions if I may.  First of all on your renewed Mercedes guidance, Mr. Dieter Zetsche maybe can you help us to understand a little bit the swing factors in here? Hence how high is the production cut that we are about to see?  Secondly, since you were much more optimistic just a month ago what has happened in this month that you are seeing such a dramatic decline in Mercedes earnings now?  Is this product mix, is this engine mix?  So maybe just give us a little bit more clarity on what has come new to the table within this month to make you revise your earnings so dramatically?  Secondly, with regard to this revised guidance what is the consequence of this? Does this mean you are stopping your buyback program, do you potentially even look at your entire cash return to shareholders maybe a word on that.  And thirdly, just some clarification of housekeeping on the numbers, in the first half earnings before the impact of Chrysler were around &#x20AC;4.9 billion, so in the second half you are anticipating less than half of that.  Is this is the correct assumption?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question, questions.  Let me start with the first question.  The change of our forward-looking assessment is mostly related to markets, I am come back to that in a second.  Beyond that, the expectation on the exchange rate has deteriorated as well, it seems that we are kind of stuck at this 155 to 160 exchange rate and further pressure has shown on the raw material side namely steel being a major driver there including oil with its consequences as well.  But the main point is clearly the markets and there we have seen May with some slow down, where as far as our sales are concerned, we saw that it's mainly, good, okay to good mainly related to some internal issues like A-/B-Class availability and CLC availability.  But the overall market conditions seem to be okay.</p>
          <p>In June, obviously this deteriorated significantly.  When you look for instance at the major European markets like Italy, in June, down more than 20%, Spain down more than 30%, UK at that time down at about 10%.  U.S, we see, we saw and we see an increasing decline as well.  The most recent forecast from J.D. Power was taken down by another half a million now to 14.2 million for the year, which of course has an higher impact on the second half of the year as it's an annual amount.</p>
          <p>In July, we see a continuation of this trend and now even further markets adding to this slowdown for instance U.K in July so far shows performance of about 20% down as Italy and Spain directionally are as well as South Africa is another market, Japan is another market to June and July are performing very poor.</p>
          <p>So, we are mostly reacting or I could say exclusively reacting to external facts we are seeing in which we for the full year consider more negative than we thought 4 or 6 or 8 weeks ago.  Our internal performance hasn't changed; if anything then to the better.  As far as our productivity gain expectation is we see something like 10%.  As a possibility for this year in the third year in a row, we see very positive performance on the material cost side expect for raw material prices.  And we continue to see very good reception for our products namely the new products in all of those markets.</p>
          <p>To the extent that for instances in the U.S, we have including smart significant increase &#x2013; excluding smart more or less flat sales in this down market so far of about 10% year-to-date.  So, what led to the adjustment of our forecast is a more critical assessment of the market development for the remainder of the year then we have seen it 2 months ago.  It might be 2 months ago, we were too optimistic, it might be that today we are too pessimistic.  But in trying to give you the most realistic forecast, this is what we think we should tell you today.  Our strength as far as the brand of Mercedes and the business system of Mercedes is concerned is not changed in our forecast, in our assessment.</p>
          <p>Talking about &#x2013; and I totally accept when you say that it's a dramatic change, I would at least state that the expected 8% return on sales for the full year is not really a miserable performance in tough environment given by exchange rate, I don't have to repeat all of that what you know anyway.  Consequences, other than continuing and if anything even increasing our home book in doing the best to get our costs down and to have on relative terms a good performance, I don't see consequence at that point of time specifically as you address the buyback program.  I don't see any reasons to change the plan which we announced a few weeks ago and which we're executing on right now.  As far as your last third question is concerned, Bodo Uebber will answer</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You also can confirm but Dieter said regarding the share buyback program we are doing so as we have done in the last couple of weeks.  Regarding your statement of 4.9 billion in the first half, it's not precisely right.  This number is 4.6 billion because you have to take into account all the special reporting items for the whole six months and of course also to exclude the Chrysler figures and that makes then 4.6.  So it's not the 50% but it gets to this number, so it's not 50% is what we can expect in the second half with the guidance of over 7 billion, it is somewhat above that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to add one element, which I forgot to answer.  You were asking about the production cuts.  We see it as most important that we act with Mercedes as a premier brand and that we deal in the markets accordingly.  So far, year-to-date, which means through June, we have spent on market support exactly overall what we planned to in the beginning of the year.  We want to maintain that for the remainder of the year as well.  As we see the slowdown in markets, we have made an assumption how the sales numbers could develop going forward and we decided for production cuts to assure that under those assumptions by year end, we will have an inventory which is in line with our plan and with last year's.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We take next question from John Lawson, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From Citi.  Could I first ask just whether this new plan has any implications at all for your longer-term initiatives for reducing cost and improving profits such as go for 10.  I mean is there any slippage in terms of timetables that you might see from that and secondly I wondered whether I could ask you to remind us of the basis on which Chrysler is accounted as an associate.  I mean, if we look into your notes, it doesn't look as though you are running down the cost supply agreements between the two companies.  Is it possible for you to withdraw your director, have you made promises to Cerberus that you will keep this association for a specific period, that would be helpful.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as your first question is concerned, go for 10 is a program and a goal which we have not set up as a monthly flavor, but as our strategic direction with a clear timing, which set starting 2010 in average through the cycle.  This is valid and continues to be our clear goal.  The only point but this is nothing new, I should make is that if in 2010 we were in a very depressed economic situation we obviously would then not be in the average of the cycle.  But that's nothing I can assess today and that's nothing different from what we said in the past.  Second part, I think Bodo could or should answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course we have, there is no timing on our investment in terms of the 19.9%.  So there is no agreement of having the two, three or four years.  There is nothing what I can tell you, of course from a disclosure point of view, disappointing that we have to disclose these kind of book value movements, which have no cash impact in that.  And of course we said it before last quarter that we'd try to change it but there are certain elements, which I do not have to repeat in this regard.  But most important, I do think it's a message, it's book value and it's not impacting cash.  Although, I have to state the 1.5 billion was drawn of course but that was transparently confirmed as a part of the agreement last year in August.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Of course, and deducted the net liquidity, you are right.  So, when I talk about that we have this $1.5 U.S billion which is roughly &#x20AC;960 million, which impacted net liquidity and free cash flow.  And on top of course we made our investment in Tognum which was &#x20AC;640 million; then it sums up to roughly 1.5 billion.  On top we had the new management model with &#x20AC;100 million in outflow and therefore it means our operating business in Q2 had positive numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everybody.  It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse.  Firstly, on net pricing, which is something that I think you can control.  You have increased at Mercedes discounts in the U.S. by roughly 40% in June and you are now offering the highest discounts and this came as a huge surprise to many of us and to many of your investors, since you have been pretty actively promoting your conservative net pricing policy.  So, what happened there and also was the Stuttgart office in full control of this incentive hike in June and will these discounts come down in the remainder of the year? This is the first question.</p>
          <p>And second just generally on 2009, we know that you are not giving a precise outlook, but everything we can assess now is that demand will be weaker next year, currency will be a bigger problem, raw materials also becoming a bigger problem as the truck markets are more likely softening at least in Europe, where you make your many.  So is there any, I mean is there any reason why we should assume next year could be better or on the level of this year for Daimler as a whole and then also on Mercedes, would it be fair to assume that the second half this year is probably a better guidance for what we might see next year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as our sales support is concerned, I made the statement which is valid that on a worldwide basis for our total sales year-to-date through June, we were exactly according to plan.  Secondly in the U.S, first of all, but I don't want to stress that, those external numbers typically give an indication, but especially if you look at different surveys you get different numbers are not a precise reflection of what's going on in the marketplace.  It's true that in June, our support went up for Mercedes.  This was related to special programs related to the announce in terms of this outgoing model year.</p>
          <p>We intend in the U.S, like through the rest of the world, to stay within the limitations which we have set in our budget and to generally take, as I said before, the approach to support our premium and to protect residual values and not to do anything to protect volume at whatever price.  So yes, in June the incentives went up but overall we will, I am pretty sure see throughout the year a lower incentive level for Mercedes than for most of our direct competitors.  We are today at Q2, and we have just made statements about our assessment of the remainder of the year.  We are not at a point of time to give guidance for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't ask about guidance, I was just asking about your general feeling of where the industry is trending?  And then maybe on the discounts just also to be precise, will discounts in the U.S. come down from the June level, please?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The latter one, yes.  The first one, of course we can discuss expectations for exchange rates for material prices for economic development and in consequence, for markets.  And I don't know who has a better insight, you or me or us.  At that point of time, I personally would not expect that the exchange rate would stay at today's level through next year; that is the speculation, I don't know.  I would not expect further increase of the dynamics in the raw material field.  But of course the raw material development throughout this year, if it would stay where it is today, would have a higher impact on 2009 than in 2008 obviously for mathematic reasons.</p>
          <p>And as far as the market is concerned that's certainly very much related to the overall economic development, which we have seen being revised by many participants and observers in the frequent and short notice.  So, I can't make any assumptions what we see for next year.  I would expect that yes, starts to recover.  I would expect that the emerging markets continue to have strong dynamics, perhaps at a somewhat lower level than throughout this year.  And I would hope that the very strong volumes we see in Spain, in U.K and some European markets will get under control and will follow into a more positive path again.  But once again those are assessments and I think we are in a better position to judge about that towards the end of the year when we then typically make statements about next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks.  Good afternoon, it's Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley, just two questions.  The first, a follow-up on the buyback, I think you were pretty clear, Dr. Zetsche, earlier in this conference call that you see, I believe you said no reason to stop the current program.  I guess my question is, what do you need to see or what kinds of indication, be it cash burn or something in the macro economy or your own business that would convince you guys that this may not be the best time to be investing in an auto stock having profit warnings heading into possibly an unprecedented type level of slow down, that's my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is a bit philosophical about being a publically traded company in Germany, as I am sure you've witnessed over the past couple of weeks, we are kind of learning how, what can happen some of the risks that you take being a publicly traded company in Germany without a long-term blocking controlling shareholder.  Of course, I am referring to the Scheffler Continental situation.  I guess a question to you would be are you at all concerned that maybe someone already owns 30 or 40% of you hypothetically and just hasn't disclosed it yet?  I know we might laugh at that but technically it's legal in Germany to do this kind of thing.  Does that concern you, is it relevant at all?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for those questions.  To your first one, I think we should keep things in perspective.  First of all, I don't know why anything what we are showing here could be described as cash burn.  We expect strong cash development throughout this year on our operations.  We said that it's our objective to optimize our capital structure our balance structure mostly looking to our WACC to our cost of capital and we are clearly not there, we are clearly not there.  Now there is the chance to have at low cost a share buyback program and I think there hasn't ever been a better chance and a better prospectus to invest into our stock.  So, that is the perfect moment and therefore if at any time we would have a reason to go for share buyback, it's right now.  To your...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we take the second one, sorry to interrupt.  You are basically saying then burning cash would be an indicator that this might not be a good idea, is that what you're watching for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't said that.  You said that while we're burning cash, we should question, continue the share buyback.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not what I said.  That's not what I said.  I am just asking what indicators are you look for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay then, I might have misunderstood you and I apologize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have a hard time to imagine a scenario unless the sky falls down.  Why we should change our mind on the announced current share buyback program with a size we were talking about, which of course and I think that is really clear,  the speed of its execution is totally flexible and we can accelerate, we can slow down at any point of time whatever we see appropriate.  But once again I wouldn't see any indicator or once again as I mentioned there is no motivation for the share buyback.  The most recent balance sheet half year has shown an increase in our equity ratio.  We are now at 48%.  So once again the motivation to do what we intend to do has increased and not been reduced.</p>
          <p>To your second point, first of all of course we try to have sensors to see what's going on in the capital markets relative to our shares.  Their transparency is not unlimited or not total as you just have seen.  While what's -- the activity you were referring to, to my best knowledge cash settle swaps which theoretically do not give you or practically do not give you the right to own the shares.  For practical reasons that will be the consequence but it is not as a technicality the direct relationships but it's basically related to the share price, the option contract you are taking.</p>
          <p>This kind of arrangements I don't know how you can observe or detect beforehand.  So, in this regards I cannot give you any satisfying answer other than that, yes, I think we have a relatively good transparency.  If I would tell you any activity of that kind is absolutely impossible, I would have to lie.  On the other hand I see a number of reasons why I don't consider that in any form a likely scenario and of course we have tried to make our homework as well and think of first of all the sensors and secondly defense mechanism if such a scenario would arise.  I don't see a high likelihood.</p>

          <p>We take next question from Christian Breitsprecher please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, it's Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim.  I have two questions, firstly on the volume outlook for the second half.  I mean obviously for your 8% operating margin target you have apparently a precise volume view for the second half.  Can you share anything with us how strong the decline in the second half is going to be, you know after the 11% growth in the first half, the decline in the second half could be dramatic and you would still end up with volume growth.  So maybe you can give us a bit more guidance there what you're really implying in your 8% margin target?  And secondly on the free cash flow, if we assume &#x20AC;7 billion EBIT number what do you think is or could be the free cash flow number for the full year?  I mean you have stated that you expect a significant free cash flow for the full year, maybe you can also there give us a bit more of a number what that could come out based on current margin assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your first question you know from many repeated experiences that we do not give precise forward-looking volume forecast.  We have stated and I can repeat that, that our expectation for the full year is a sales number above last year's number for Mercedes.  The second one cash flow, which is typical CFO question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, don't give free cash flow guidance.  We have our EBIT guidance in the market and we did that of course you can do some assumptions of course from last year to get a typical number which of course then depends on some inventory, some growth aspect and so on and so forth, but the main cash flow inflow will be in the second half.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Just going back to this what's happened between June and now and this market development, what is your order intake telling you, I mean, have you seen this dramatic drop off in sales of Mercedes Cars which I thought, you know customers of Mercedes Cars were supposed to be more resilient to these economic factors.  And perhaps is there a dramatic change in the mix?  I think there was a question asked before, but you seemed to side-step it to a certain extent.  I mean, I think Ford and GM seem to be indicating that in the U.S anyway perhaps some of the customers who bought luxury vehicles couldn't really afford them.  And that now they are just swapping from directly from big cars to the smallest cars.  And maybe that's some thing that you've experienced as well.  And then just on the European market, you said that some kind of -- decline is continuing in July.  What's your assumptions for France and Germany, I mean how worried are you about those markets, those markets have been holding up but are you assuming that those markets actually start to turn down in the second half and into 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our sales through June, we have reported so they are transparent.  And we have, for answering the U.S (47.30) market as you were just referring to luxury sales buyers of luxury vehicles maintained basically our volume compared to last year independent of the additional smart sales and have seen some but under-proportional mix shift relative to the market.  So for instance when you look at our M-Class sales, and obviously the SUV market, it has been hit much stronger than the overall U.S market.  In our case we basically have seen flat sales.  So we could perform against the market to some extent in line with the luxury segment but beyond that and better than our direct competitors, and that is not related the already discussed June incentive program, which was a one month program obviously but it's reflecting the overall strength of our product line up in our brand throughout the year.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; our forecast is related to the market performance which we are seeing and our thought that on the long run we cannot expect to go totally against those market developments and we'll see more impact on our sales than we have seen so far.  That is the basic assumption.  I have to make one exception that is France.  As you were mentioning that France, the market is holding up, we saw quite some decline there which was very much related to the very strong CO2 taxation which does not have any relative elements to segments but is absolute limitation, which has created significant mix change in this market which by the way has some market share applications between domestic and imported cars but that's just at the sideline.  So in this market we have seen worse performance from Mercedes than for the market overall.  But in general as I said before our new outlook is related to the market development we are seeing and we are therefore expecting today different from eight weeks ago.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as we don't report the exact numbers we don't report the exact mix as we consider that competitive data or competitive relevant data.  As far as the measures are concerned, we have positive situations generally within our plants in Germany that we have relatively high flexibility as far their amount of labors concerned in both directions.  So we can put labor onto accounts and draw from those accounts again, which allows us relative to the high production numbers that we have seen in recent years and months to some extent (51.37) for sometime to draw from those accounts and therefore without any drastic or significant measures to execute those reductions, those production reductions in all plants affected they are including Sindelfingen.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Stefan Burgstaller from Goldman Sachs.  Can I just come back to the profits warning, that's what it is I guess.  Can you just help on the, what I think is the way you present this today just on the logic.  You are saying you are downgrading your global growth expectations, yes, I can see that.  You are saying, you are blaming the market but then when I look at the way you phrase your volume guidance for the Mercedes Car Group there doesn't seem to be a difference first quarter, second quarter.  And when I try to quantify basically the 1 billion shortfall you are presenting today, are we seeing a 6 to 7% decline in unit sales relative to your original guidance or have you effectively bet on the U.S. dollar got caught out or have you bet on raw materials and got caught out.  If you could just help explain the 1 billion, that would be really helpful.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all if you got the perception that I want to blame anybody or anything that was not my intention.  I was just trying to describe the developments which we are seeing in the markets and the change of our forward-looking assumption regarding those markets from the past for the end of the year to today for the remainder of the year.  And as we reported that we have a 10% increase in the first half of the market making the statement that we see growth for the year altogether obviously includes the possibility or basically indicates a less strong volume development for the remainder of the year that is I think pretty obvious.  And that is certainly the main driver for the change. Beyond that as I said before I don't think we have betted on the dollar, to the opposite we have tried to hedge to high extent but not fully and for the remaining portion some weeks ago as the banks and the markets we did not expect the current exchange rates to stay throughout the year.  Today, we make that assumption, this might still be wrong but that is what we are assuming today, which has a certain impact.</p>
          <p>Similarly, on the raw material side, or on the material side we continue to see our procurement efficiency versus the plan and versus the beginning of the year except for raw material, if anything, to further improve so we are making our targets in somewhat more with an attempt to offset some of those material cost increases.  But we have seen further increases on the material cost side since we discussed last.  So it's a combination of all of those factors there.  The main driver clearly is the market, to a minor extent the material cost and the exchange rate is adding and we are not dramatically but slightly further upping our R&amp;D cost as well as an active measure to become even more proactive facing the overall transition in the markets towards more fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>

        <plist>

          <p>I don't know, and I don't know what you are referring to.  As far as the E-Class is concerned, we expect a very strong reaction, positive reaction to our new E-Class being launched next year and we consider that to be very competitive in the light of a more fuel consumption focused public and customer base and we have not changed our business model.  Of course all of those CO2 measures, not all.  Some of them you can do without adding content or features to your product.  But the majority of those have to different extents cost involved when you talk about a start-stop device for instance of course you are improving your fuel efficiency, but you are adding cost as well.  So far, we have tried to price for those changes so far successfully.  We will see to which extent this is possible in the future.</p>

The 7.7 billion last year is based on the 8.7 we achieved as booked and we deducted here the EADS, the Chrysler and the impact from the new management model which was 7.7.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so you cannot be more precise than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, of course, you see also our divisional guidance, of course which helps you to gives you direction for the MBC guidance and also for truck of course we were very specific into our financial services and of course than that should lead to this guidance of over 7 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The second question relates to what Dr. Zetsche said about the incentives level in the U.S.  If I correctly understood, you said that you expect incentives level to go down and the cost of H2.  How this could happen given the current market context in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As it was discussed before we are taking about incentives levels specifically in June 2008 it's not for H1 but for June and it's nothing unusual in the U.S. that you have special sales month, summer sale is something which basically all manufacturers announce during summer time, that's not a surprise.  And it is very much related to the model year change.  In this change from the '08 to the '09 model year and steps and actions which are taken by different manufacturers differ.  This year obviously what has been done in the EADS for Mercedes for June has been somewhat more expensive.  This does not affect what we are doing going forward.  We by the way have had higher list price increases throughout this year than our competitors and we intend to continue to go for pricing to the extent possible and rather lose some volume than seeing our contributions deteriorate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So last question, could you make any comments about the real (61.00) value situation in the U.S. and it is likely to have specific provisions before the end of the year to cover this risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thierry, we had the same situation as we had in Q1 and Q2.  We are adequately reserved for this situation and as long as the market is where it is right now, we don't have to do further actions so to say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>We take next question from Edward Taylor [Wall Street Journal] please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  I have a general trend question.  There seems to be downsizing among customers especially North America in smaller engines and smaller cars.  In the past, you've said you've had no desire to take the A and B Class into the U.S. and given the dollar-euro exchange rate, the margins probably wouldn't make sense.  But is there, there does seem to be a fundamental shift in customer demand.  How much more is there to do in terms of rolling out more fuel efficiency measures?  Has the full extent of start/stop technology, has that kind of thing been rolled out or is the lion's share of that is that to come.  And from what I get from our previous comments, it seems that you are trying to price for that.  So it seems to that you are trying to ask more money for that which would be different from your competitor BMW.  And then speaking of BMW, cooperation with BMW in smaller volume cars, the way if you gain better profits, economies of scale, do you have any news on any cooperation and progress on and alliances for specific products that you can talk of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in general terms our objective is to make our product lines with our current mix more fuel efficient and that on an accelerated pace and we see good progress in this regard and the lion's share as you call it is rather ahead of us even though we are in most products we are competitive already by today.  We do have obviously the smart in that (63.23), which has a tremendous demand which we can't fulfill by any form with our production capacity as far as the A and B Class are concerned, we made the decision and that's valid, that the current generation A and B Class is and will not be offered in the U.S.  We said as well that for the next generation we are asking ourselves this question again and as we have more different body sales (63.53) for this next generation, there is some likelihood that we could come to a different answer which means that we could decide to introduce one or two of those models in the U.S.</p>
          <p>As I said, we intend and so far we have successfully took price for this incremental technology.  So far basically covering the cost I don't know and I would be somewhat skeptical &#x2013; or I would be skeptical that we could price fully going forward for what we have and want to do in the future for instance hybrids that so far probably by nobody has been priced according to the cost involved but directionally we wants to price for the fuel efficiency measures and where that is not in line with our competitors that's a question to ask to them and not of course you can ask us but I can't answer what and why they are doing in this regard.  There are no new news to our talks with BMW.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Philippe Barrier from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;nerale.  Just a questions for you regarding the guidance, can we characterize this guidance as valid comparison between H1 and H2 and just if you would take to account the guidance you give by division, I think the 8% margin or &#x20AC;2 billion for trucks.  Actually you mean that you expect some deterioration in rate of the business in the second half of the year.  So actually does it mean that you may have some exceptional items in H2 or &#x20AC;270 million Euros is an absolute minimum which I think can be exceeded?  And that's the first question.  Second question is regarding the truck business.  There was also some worry regarding the profitability of the truck business.  In fact what factors did change in the last months regarding this business?  As we know, we made understand that the European plants have fully used and already you didn't expected any rebound in U.S market.  What is the main factor regarding the decrease in the guidance on the truck business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question.  To the truck area the main reason is our revised forecast if the NAFTA market is concerned.  If you remember we said all the time we expect a latest recovery in the second half of the year.  Now it looks like that first of all 2008 will be on a level or lower than 2007 and to recover we off to market this foreseen end of the year or maybe beginning of next year.  That's the major thing besides everything else like steel price, exchange, raw material and everything.  But the market issues in the United States, as you know we changed our forecast that this is one of things we had to face.  We reacted already in the United States and decreased our capacity again in Saint Thomas when we laid off a shift in addition to what we have already done.  So this in combination again but major issues in the market in NAFTA.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Philippe, to your first question of course all our guidance is related to the ongoing business first of all.  So it excludes special reporting items from the first half of course.  And of course as of today we are not aware of any special reporting items of the second half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course that's all our guidance and we wanted to give you a guidance which includes all our estimations and risk assessments of the second half as Dieter Zetsche pointed out and that's the guidance of over 7 billion.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Daniel Schwartz from Commerzbank.  One question concerning Mercedes, if the markets remain weak as they've been in June, at what point will the ability of your Mercedes plants be consumed and you would have to reduce your workforce?  And the second question is concerning financial services, in second quarter financial services again included cost for the build up of financial services in the US after the separation on Chrysler, when will this process be concluded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question is concerned, we took a new look to the markets as I mentioned and stated various times by now, trying to make the most realistic assumptions going forward.  This has not changed at all.  Our very high confidence in the competitiveness of our product, in the draw and attraction those especially new and remodel products will create in the marketplace.  The strength of our brand, our technology, the determination of our team all of that is totally intact, valid and we are very confident in the strength of the Mercedes brand altogether.</p>
          <p>What we have done in making a new assessment about the markets relative to the changes we are observing that's allow me to say all even though I understand that your action is differently.  Plus the one billion which was mentioned before is according to my math in the correction not one billion either going from off the last year to 8% as an expectation.  But anyway this doesn't matter and we are not discussing 100 million up and down.</p>
          <p>I have no reason whatsoever now discuss scenarios to what happens if things are getting further worse and what have you.  We tried to be responsible in our forward perspective and not to build any blue sky and false hope.  We saw that is the responsible way to go forward.  That's why we made this statement.  Internally, as I said before with all the strengths we are seeing in our company and our brand and especially in the Mercedes division, nothing has changed whatsoever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, your questions regarding DFS of course there are two aspects one is the separation of the Chrysler Financial which we have done now in two steps.  One step of course was in 2007.  The second was more or less related to the IT system award which we have done in April.  So, regarding to this we had some costs to separate from Chrysler Financial.  Of course this will not repeat any more because we are now independent of doing our business in the U.S.  Now it comes starting into the next phase looking at our cost position overall worldwide because of course, we have diseconomies of scale due to half of the portfolio.  Of course, some costs are fixed costs, of course which we have to look at right now.  So, we are looking right now at IT costs for example, at the worldwide structure we look at global integration for example regarding IT and so and we do know the couple of the next one to two years addressing this in terms of permanent efficiency improvement.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Michael Shields from Reuters in Frankfurt.  I have two questions if I may.  The first is I am wondering whether you are concerned about the rising levels of defaults on car loans and lease payments now because I know a lot of analysts expect this to be the second wave of the tsunami of the credit crunch.  And the other question is whether you are considering changing your admirably transparent system of guidance now?  I know some of your peers have avoided the problem that you face today by focusing let's say on margin targets perhaps rather than absolute numbers and I don't know if you consider doing something along the same lines.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael to your first question of course, yes, I am too concerned.  I was in the first quarter concerned about the development in the world economic wise, in the second quarter concerned but I have to state that all our credit delinquencies and credit losses, especially credit losses, did on a worldwide basis somewhat better than the in the first quarter but of course we're talking about basis points here.  With a little bit of deterioration in the truck finance area in the U.S. a little bit doing better, little bit doing better in the passenger car business in the U.S. which offset each other and of course we see some markets which are not as favorable like South Africa for example and of course Spain is on the watch list, UK as mentioned also these markets might go into some difficulties.  But overall we are on the more or less same level than in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as guidance is concerned not having analyzed in detail as you of course doing the reports of our competitors but my best understanding is that as far as the first half is concerned for the company and for Mercedes in return of sales terms we have shown about the strongest performance of the main players if not the strongest.  To the extent, I listened or I read all competitors made statements about the deterioration of markets and the concerns reflecting from this situation.  The only difference is that we said this will have an impact on the further development of our profits, which might be not limited to us but that's the difference I can see.</p>

          <p>We take next question from Frank Biller [Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg], please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Hello, just a quick one on your material costs again.  Earlier you mentioned it's an sharp increase in the fiscal year 2008 versus 2007 more than &#x20AC;500 million coming in the accounts in 2008.  Maybe you can give the figure how these additional costs are coming into your accounts, is it more to await in 2009 and what's the figure here in 2007, is it a 7, 8, 900 million and how you are treating this, the new steel contracts, some of them rated in autumn to be new negotiated and some next year maybe.  And the next thing coming to your prices, your car prices, you already said something about the pricing in the U.S. coming to the pricing in the other markets, are you estimating price increases in your cars just to put through these additional material costs for part.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we have in the raw material area of course we have not homogenous approach of course Daimler might.  For example, when you look at the U.S. in our Truck business of course we have more direct impact from raw material price increases to the Truck business, which we of course try to pass over to the customer as it is possible and of course we have in Europe, not kind of such of kind of contracts, but the question is whether we reopen these kind of contracts or not for the sake of 2009, which is not decided yet.</p>
          <p>Of course, looking at the raw material side, also there we have a Euro impact, a currency impact.  So the burden here of course the volume is higher for course for the whole company but the burden is somewhat lower than we see it in the U.S. because it's on one hand U.S. dollar basis.  The price increase on the U.S. dollar basis on the U.S are higher than the increase, higher than here in Euro.  What you said is right, we estimated our impacts as of May with all what we could see in this regard roughly with 500 million on top of the year 2007 that is right.  Currently with our latest assessment, this number is higher due to the fact of the last six weeks increases in the markets.  Therefore, we expect even a higher burden as is 500 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as prices are concerned not only the car industry but certainly the car industry we see some resurgence of cost inflation not just limited to the raw materials but this is certainly being by far the biggest element of it.  And absolutely, we have to look at prices, list prices and then of course support those list prices with not increasing incentives to better reflect this environment, we are living in then it is right now.  On top of that, as I mentioned before, we consider Mercedes the strongest car brand or the strongest brand in this industry and this has to go along with a premium pricing, with price leadership, of course supported by the quality and the character of the vehicles, the value of the vehicles and from that perspective as well, we will certainly not be the last to move forward on the pricing front but rather on the other hand.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> is concerned, I think this is one of the issues steel prices in one of the markets we acted already.  That was in Japan because there the steel price increases were the most if I am looking from a global point of view.  And next year we will see some more activities there as the rest of the market is concerned and in Japan to give you on an example our competitors followed our increase because of all the kind of things we on the truck side now, we have to give at least as much as possible also to the end customer and again competition already followed in certain regions.</p>

          <p>Next question from <mark type="inaudible" /> please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I have two questions.  The first one is can you give a rough figure for what you are paying in terms of R&amp;D money for this emission to meet emission regulation standards, and what is the delta compared to last year because to me it looks like one of the reasons why you are so more nervous than your competitors concerning the rest of the year. And secondly there are some people in the market saying that the order intake for trucks in Europe is declining by double-digit figures since a few weeks.  Can you confirm this, the statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I don't consider myself or my colleagues being nervous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is a clear difference in how you treat the environment at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I said before, as I said before, we have taken a re-assessment on the markets with the result we have reported and that's a fact of course and I don't argue that.  As far as R&amp;D is concerned, and as mentioned before, we are increasing our R&amp;D expenses.  On top of that higher percentage in the past is invested in the field of fuel efficiency and in the remainder we are benefiting from the increased efficiency in our R&amp;D efforts so that the output in the sense of new products and model years and so on can be maintained even though the percentage of the total spending is reduced.</p>
          <p>Even if we wanted to increase our spending dramatically, we couldn't so because obviously R&amp;D is very much related to head count as well which you can't abruptly change going forward.  So I mentioned before, that among the cost elements which are going up, R&amp;D is one element, but not in a different way then we intended to do a few weeks ago.</p>
          <p>Incoming orders, you asked, indeed it's true that incoming orders specifically for Western Europe are going down, partially compensated because this is not part of this one also from the Eastern Europe.  There the dynamics are little bit lower but still there is growth and you have to have in mind and also Mercedes-Benz is selling in other country.  So overall, we are still there in a good position if order intake is concerned.  And this is also meaning, this year the market will grow still also in Western Europe including Eastern Europe much more and so we will see some overall market growth in Western Europe, Eastern Europe for the truck market.  Overall there is a reduction as I said.  This is depending on also emission regulations and some incentives different states in Europe gave and stopped again.  But basically, we are still convinced also for 2009 that it goes down but on a very slightly level.  That means from our point of view more to a normal situation in the truck market also in Western Europe next year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  Thank you for taking my question.  Just two quick question, the first one is regarding the truck, just to come back on the previous one, just wanted to know if you are currently seeing a slowdown as the guy was asking on the order intake.  We saw yesterday that Volvo was reported a drop in the order intake of 54%, so would you say that the drop of order intake for you in Europe is less than that or around this figure.  This is my first question and related to that, do you think that the market should drop in 2009?</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding residual value and the market in the U.S., what is the current rate of cars coming off lease in the U.S. and how do you see the current situation under used car market in the U.S. and especially for Mercedes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start with question if I got you right that we, where we are compared to our competitors and on any, once sentence, we are less than that.  So we are better than the others.  We have better order intakes still and if 2009 is concerned better than the competitors. That was the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If 2009 is concerned, I can only repeat what I tried to say before, 2009 will go slightly down from our perspective.  At least in Western Europe, the economy growth, the dynamic of the economy growth in Eastern Europe will also go down but there still is expected to that the markets are growing in Eastern Europe but the dynamic and the percentage of growth are going down.</p>
          <p>Basically, like I tried to say before, we had very, very strong two years now in a row or let's say three and we expect that the market is going down to so-called normal level and that should not be a big change for us.  We always said, okay, we have to focus everything what we are doing in a more normal level and not on the peak years.  So, for 2009 summary it will go down but more or less to a normal level like we have experienced years before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up if I may on the Truck, somewhere we have read that somewhere that your customer of the Truck division where some of them were having difficulties to have access to credits, do you confirm that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to hand over this question to my financial service colleagues because it gives the credit.  I put it on.  So, I have not heard that one.  As far as I am concerned, we try to support our customers and I don't have any signals that some of our customers didn't go to credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course one thing is clear but I don't think I can refer that to the current capital markets.  But of course as our repossessions are going higher, we have some more customers that say, so to say in trouble which we support and restructure if possible.  So, the overall situation in the U.S for our, in the U.S are somewhat more difficult.  In Europe, we don't have, I don't see here, these issues we have in the U.S.  It's doing well right now.  Even in the second quarter which was slightly better than in the first quarter and there of course also in Germany not the issue as in U.S and far lower rates than they are.</p>

          <p>The volume of leased Mercedes Cars in the U.S 2008 is in the magnitude of 100,000 vehicles, which is considerably higher than last year and this is in line with our luxury competitors, who all went at similar lease rates in the past as we did.  We have very positive development based on changes in the relation with our dealers and the bonus system to our dealers that the percentage of off lease cars going through our retails dealer network versus their auctions has increased significantly if not dramatically, which helps us a lot on the residual value front to the extent that second quarter is if anything slightly better or basically flat on residual values compared to first quarter.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon.  Just to clarify input prices, I apologize if I missed that out.  Is there some back list, some tailback in terms of accepting fuel price increases so what volumes are sourced at old prices and what are already sourced at new ones, so what will be the additional impact on EBIT in 2009?  Thank you.</p>
