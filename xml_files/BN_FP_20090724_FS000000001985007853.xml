        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. This is Pierre-Andr&#xE9; Terisse, CFO of Group Danone speaking. Before, I start a few points, number one could you please switch off your telephones in order to avoid any interference and since this conference is webcasted. Second thing, I'm here with Robin Jansen, Head of Investor Relations, of course. We have here as well on the first role, two people <mark type="inaudible" /> first. She's now &#x2013; she's going to become very shortly, Deputy Investor Relations. She's coming from the Group, she's occupied many positions within the Group. And she will be replacing Laura Palmeiro, who is not leaving the Group, staying within the Group, but taking over other position within Finance. So a quick word to them, thank you very much now for the contribution and welcome to Maya.</p>
          <p>This being said, and then moving to the presentation of the first half. Running you through the presentation and then we'll be going through questions and answer, taking questions from the floor first and then from the conference. One I mean the result in a nutshell first with three main elements. The first is about cost reduction, which has been very strong for the semester and I'll come back on that.</p>
          <p>The second important element is a progressive reinvestment of this cost reduction which we have been proceeding with during the semester and which have gradually resulted in an increase of sales. The third element is that, this recovery or increase of sales has been obtained through a volume growth, which have strongly rebounded from 1.1% during the first quarter to 3.6% during the second quarter. And you can see all that in the figures of course with sales increasing 1.6% overall on the semester again mainly fueled by volumes with negative pricing and operating income increasing by 8.1%, which is the main factor for the increase of the EPS and which means as well that the operating margins have rebounded very strongly at plus 98 basis points on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>This leads us to an increase of the EPS on a like-for-like basis of 6.7%, which put us on the right track to achieve the 10% full year, which is on target, and again I'll come back on that. Last word about the free cash flow; which has been very strong at &#x20AC;636 million, compared to 550 last year, which means an increase of more than 15% underlying the quality of our earnings plus additional items.</p>
          <p>A word on the sales or as I said, we've seen an acceleration within the half of the year. The second quarter here shows that, we've been increasing sales during the second quarter by 2.2%. This has been predominately <mark type="inaudible" /> fueled by volumes at 3.6. The value component, which was slightly negative during the first quarter, has become more negative as we have increased the speeds and the pace of reinvestment in different markets and regions.</p>
          <p>The currency impact remains negative by 2.8% upon the effect of principally emerging currencies being weaker than a year ago. And the scope of consideration reflects two things, number one the disposal of Frucor during the first months of this semester &#x2013;  at the beginning of this semester. And on the other divestments of Baby Food brands a year ago about a year ago &#x2013; sorry, in France, to Lactalis after &#x2013; in the process of integration of Numico. And this leads us to sales for the second quarter of 3,846 million.</p>
          <p>The same analysis on the first half keeps very similar effects with obviously less magnitude on the balance between volume and value. One other important point to note at this stage is that we have &#x2013; we are now at a point where the sales of &#x2013; the trend of sales growth has inverted after a year of 2008 where we have seen very flattish volumes or even negative some times. And a pricing effect which has been fading away. We have a reached bottom of that during the first quarter of this year. And we are now back to a positive trend, an acceleration trend of the sales but which is fueled this time by volume as opposed to by pricing as it was last year. So an acceleration, which is, of course, of a much better quality especially given the context.</p>
          <p>And move by division before going to the income. Page eight; Fresh Dairy product which is of course the main division of the Group. So again I think it's important to remind that we keep operating an environment which remain challenging. This is true in literally all geographies, but this is specifically true this quarter in Spain with some ongoing issues with distributors which remain very much the same as we have seen in Q1. With Russia, where we had had a very difficult first quarter of this year, Q2 shows an improvement, but the situation remains difficult. And Argentina which towards the end of this quarter has become again softer in terms of market evolution as we expected.</p>
          <p>This being said, this is the environment in which we operate and we've been knowing that, and anticipating that for a month now. And we have, as you know, gradually from January taken some initiatives on the price side, on the promotional side, but as well on the marketing side more generally speaking adjusting the back size, putting more advertising support behind the brands. And this has resulted in a volume recovery of 2.7%, which is the first positive operation for the past five month and showing that what we have invested in is showing positive results.</p>
          <p>You remember as well, that during the first quarter we explained that we had undertaken this initiatives in some countries, primarily in Poland, Hungary, in Czech Republic, in the U.S. We have been expanding these initiatives to additional countries during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>This has been the case of France and I'll come back on that, it's been the case of Mexico, where we have made a global reset of the portfolio at the very beginning of May. And this has been the case towards end of the quarter of Russia, where we see that some actions don't take but which is on the right track from these standpoints.</p>
          <p>If we focus on these initiatives again we've chosen to show you countries, new countries, not the existing one i.e. the one we've shown you during the first quarter have kept delivering positive performance following the rebound. Here you see France where we have been putting significant means behind the brands, you can see negative pricing which in average for the quarter as being of approximately 5%. We show you an example of Danettes, where we have growths back the index in terms of positioning of the price related to the average of the market from 135 to 124.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we've done some pretty focused campaign for this products. We've made some new pats for a specific channels of distribution. And all together this brand together with other such as Taillefine, Taillefine as well as Velout&#xE9; have contributed to a rebound of &#x2013;  to a bound of volumes. And to an improvement of the market share of the group not only in value but in volume which is probably the first for many, many years. So we have really adjusted in this country, this strategy with a view to recover market shares and volume as well, to recover market dominance and to do that across the range, through the range, and through premium product as well which by the way continue to perform well.</p>
          <p>Mexico has been a slightly different example maybe more in-line with what we have done in Poland, but even different from that. As I said, at the very beginning of May, we've taken a series of initiative we show you one on this chart, which is the Core Range. We have the Core Range, which was in a yellow bottle under the brand NutriPLUS with a premium pricing versus competition, we've chosen to give again more sense to the Core Range as we conceive it building on the Danone plants on the 90 years on the yogurt expertise bringing the price to 15% below competition. So making this Core Range in Mexico more affordable and moving from yellow to blue, which is a major change of course.</p>
          <p>You can see the results, which is not only coming from the Core Range, our Core Range is been one of the initiatives but there's been more. We've worked on Activia, where we have diversified the number of packs and we have for instance, introduced a one kilo pack, which means that we are gaining in penetration of the blood vessels and making them affordable to other categories of consumer.</p>
          <p>We have at the same time launched one product, which we will see the page after, which are the mini shots of Activia, which is very focused on the benefit and which is working well. And all together, this has resulted in a very significant rebound of the performance of Mexico, which have difficulty competing with Lala until the month of March, and which has been improving its volumes by 25% in June, sales by 10%.</p>
          <p>So, this of course, will need to be followed in the months to come but the result has been, frankly speaking, very much in line with the expectation and give interesting lessons for potentially other markets.</p>
          <p>I was mentioning the Activia Mini Shots in Mexico, you see them on the top &#x2013; on the top left, that's a product, which again is showing very good result from launch. We are multiplying the initiatives of innovation on different &#x2013; on different fronts. On the benefits and <mark type="inaudible" /> products of course; and beyond Activia Mini Shots, you can see Densia in Spain, for which it's far too early to say whether or not it's going to be a real success. Densia is a product which is targeting wholesale process and which has been launched at the very end of June in Spain. We'll be looking at the results knowing that we have other things in the pipe which will be coming in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Core Range, I've mentioned that. Danimals Crush Cup is an interesting innovation on the packaging side which is pleasing very much the kids and working extremely well in the U.S., so again we'll be multiplying initiatives not only in terms of price reduction and promo, but also in terms of Core Range, in terms of packaging initiatives with the Toppers, for instance, and in terms of health benefit as well. We play on these three fronts.</p>
          <p>So that's for Dairy, which again has really changed trends following the implementation of these initiatives. If we move to Water now, page 12, that's been an interesting quarter as well for different reasons. As you know, our business is split into two different parts: one is emerging countries, the other one is industrialized countries. Emerging countries have kept a very strong growth pace, very much the same as the one we have seen in the previous quarters, around 10% &#x2013;  10% this quarter to be,  to be precise. We've still very strong performance in many countries, specifically in Mexico and in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>The other part of the business is of course, the industrialized countries, which have remained negative during the first &#x2013; during the second quarter. But we have seen some beginning of an inflection.</p>
          <p>So, of course we have to be careful in front of that. We know for instance that the weather condition have probably played a positive role in that this quarter. But we feel as well some underlying improvements. We feel that, for instance, in the UK where we have been for the first quarter and four or five quarters positive both in volume growth and sales growth.</p>
          <p>We've taken some specific initiatives like playing the Volvic challenge which is very much inspired by the Activia challenge from the Dairy division, which is helping the consumer to understand he needs to drink a certain quantity of mineral water per week and for two weeks. And we've seen some improvements again in the UK and in France in particular.</p>
          <p>In this division, we of course not straying off course, i.e. we see these improvements as well as the result of initiatives we've taken on two fronts: first of all in the defense of the category, I think we're doing a pretty good job with some of our competitors, in alliance with them, in defending the category. The tone we have seen on bottled water in the medias have changed. It's not yet at the level we would like it to be. But it's improved, and it probably contributed to the performance. And then we keep innovating and pushing the brands. You've probably seen the Evian advertising, if not, I advise you to do so. It's been, I think, the most watched movie on the web in the past two weeks in most of the countries of Europe, and it's playing again on the role of vitality of Evian for the babies.</p>
          <p>On the right side, you see Volvic, which probably has a potential to become the green brand of the Group. The green and white brands; here you see an example of a launch we are proceeding with at the moment, which is making performance for the consumer in France which we called Eco R&#xE9;serve. Again we'll be multiplying that kind of initiative, not necessarily on big packs, but initiatives on our brands going forward.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, we keep innovating as well and pushing the brands in emerging countries with the Bonafont platform, which has proven to be successful in Mexico, is successful now in Brazil and we'll be looking at expanding that in other countries as well going forward. So Water, which needs to be confirmed, but again it seems that the trends are improving.</p>
          <p>Then we move to a stronger division, Baby Nutrition, with a growth which frankly has remained strong at 7.4%, with three elements to be noticed. Number one, most of the countries have delivered a performance which is still very strong and robust and in line with the one we delivered in the previous quarters. We had mentioned at the, during the first quarter that we had seen some softness in Russia; this remains true. In fact, beyond softness, we have seen some weakness in the surrounding factors, and in particular on the distribution side and therefore we have chosen to be prudent on that side and this has led us to be less pushy on the sales. We are working to strengthening this environment in order to be able to push again.</p>
          <p>The second element has to do with China. You remember that following the melamine crisis, we had seen a kind of exceptional trends in terms of improvement of the market share. We expected that to normalize. This is happening now. This has happened in fact for a large part during the second quarter, which means that our market share has come back, not to the previous level, but to levels which are more sustainable at 12, 13% and therefore these contributes to the performance of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So Baby overall, which again besides these two specific factors, is our &#x2013; remains extremely resilient and on which we are still very active with the performers.</p>
          <p>Again in this division, we keep innovating on two fronts: on the milk side and on the food side. On the milk side, one of the key challenge for us is the rollout of the Bebelac brand. You know that the main brand of the Group is Actimel. Actimel is positioned on the very premium and is defending the immunity benefits.</p>
          <p>Bebelac is more an everyday food for the baby and a complete nutrition concept. It's a product which is positioned differently, and we want to have these second products completing the range. So we have it in number of countries. We keep rolling it out in some others, and for instance, this has been launched in Thailand during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On the food side, we are of course pushing the development of our products in many markets. We still have a lot of potential, because we are underdeveloped on that side. We show you here examples in &#x2013; on the juice side, on one hand, but more relevant perhaps on the jar side with soups in Poland and Czech Republic, and again that's going to be an example of initiative we'll be taking again in the coming quarters in this division.</p>
          <p>The last of our division is Medical Nutrition, which continued delivering a very strong performance across the board, with two specific factors to be mentioned, perhaps. On the one hand, Germany, which it's being difficult both from a competitive situation &#x2013; standpoint and from the point of &#x2013; point of view of the pressure on reimbursements. So Germany is a market which remains tough. On the other hand, Southern Europe has been delivering excellent performance. And we see the emergence of very interesting performance in emerging countries, which remains <mark type="inaudible" /> division for the time being, but which are promising.</p>
          <p>In terms of innovation, we are doing the job as well in this division, with two examples here: Fortimel Compact which you can see on the right side. So Fortimel is a product which is addressed mainly to senior people. As you know very often senior people do not have &#x2013; are not sufficiently hungry, and therefore do not take the food they should be taking for &#x2013; with respect to their own needs.</p>
          <p>Fortimel is a product which is designed to give them the benefits and proteins they need in order to have their normal daily intake. One of the issue we had with the previous product was that the bottle being big, they tended not to finish it. We are coming with a smaller bottle, which was technically not very difficult &#x2013; not very easy, sorry, to put in place, but which we have managed to do so and which will be a further benefit for them in the sense that they will be finished the bottle. This is a really promising product, which will be launched very soon in the UK since we have received the approval from the authorities two days ago.</p>
          <p>Infrantrini and Nutrini on the other hands, you probably know that we are a leading company in the area of furthering growth, i.e. kids having problems of not growing normally. We keep again innovating, renovating, expanding the range, and we have three examples of these products on the charts.</p>
          <p>To finish with the sale, look &#x2013;  a quick look at the geographical growth, what you can see is that we've been growing, we've been accelerating the growth in all geographies. Growth remains negative in Europe, but it's improved by one points, it's improved as well in the rest of the world by one point in Q2 versus Q1. And obviously faster in Asia which remains the area of the world where we see the best dynamics in terms of consumptions.</p>
          <p>And now move to the margins page 19, starting with the breakdown of the income. So, the operating income has been reaching 1.411 billion this quarter. This is made of two different components, trading operating income which is a recurring part and other operating items, which is non-recurring for 205 million, I'll come back on that.</p>
          <p>Taking these 1.206 billion of trading operating income, this means that we have improved the margins, which has stood at 16.03% during this first half of the year, representing a 73 basis point increase versus the same figure of last year.</p>
          <p>How does this 73 basis points increase break down? Page 20, of course, we have some negative impacts as well on this side from the scope of consolidation and translation of and translation effect for the very same reason as the one I've explained before. On a like-for-like basis, the margins have indeed improved by 98 basis points.</p>
          <p>This improvement is of course driven by two main factors, one is the decrease of the costs, which amounts to 197 basis point this semester. This decrease of the cost again is driven by two factors. On the one hand input costs &#x2013; the price of input costs, which have decreased both on the milk and on the packaging sides, but in addition to that and for approximately one-third of that productivity, which has generated as well substantial savings all together.</p>
          <p>The second part of the equation is obviously the level of reinvestment, which plays on the sales and price and which plays as well on the leverage and you can see that on the right i.e. the effect of the reinvestment on the margin have been 87 basis points, which reflects the fact that we have been gradually putting in place these initiatives across the semester.</p>
          <p>If you move to the second semester and you go and you look at that in terms of dynamic, we obviously expect at the time input costs to be at the same level or maybe slightly lower since we'll be entering into the first anniversary of the decrease towards the end of last year. And at the same time an impact from the initiatives which will be gradually increasing, so that we should have during the second semester a very balanced equation on that side.</p>
          <p>If we look at this margin from divisional standpoints, obviously most of the improvement comes from two divisions which are Fresh Dairy and Baby Nutrition for the reasons that the impact of both productivity and the reduction of input costs is impacting these two divisions. This is even more the case in Baby Nutrition since we have taken less initiatives than in Dairy and we have the end of the synergies of the Numico acquisition, the cost synergies which we had &#x2013; which we have completed now.</p>
          <p>If you go to Medical Nutrition, there is a big number of minus 139 basis point but which in reality is a small number in &#x20AC;1 million and which we place two things. On the one hand phasing impacts of expenses, which means that this is going to be reverted during the second semester. And on the other hand some one-off costs with respect to some re-organization in some countries.</p>
          <p>Water's is &#x2013; has a level of margin which is almost flat but again reflecting different factors. On the one hand the continuing decrease of the sales even though at the low base the continuing decease of the sales in industrialized countries is bringing some negative leverage impacts. But this has been almost fully compensated by the evolution of the cost of raw material as well as by what is now a positive mix between emerging countries and industrialized countries.</p>
          <p>If you look at the geography, there's no thing specific to mention. The improvement has been across all geographies, even more of course in the parts which I think, we're investing.</p>
          <p>I now move to the bridge from operating income to net income. So we start again from the 1,411 on &#x2013; in the column in the middle, so just for you to re-explain to remind you of structure of the table. Here also on this page 22 on the left, the reporting number for 2008. Then next read the reporting number for 2009. You have the non-current items, which are developed they're impacted at various line &#x2013; at the various level, which are developed and then the underlying performance.</p>
          <p>So let me just focus for two minutes on the non-current items. You see an amount of 205 million at the level of other operating items, which is reflecting two thing. Number one, the capital gain from the disposal of Frucor, our beverage operation at the beginning of the year, and on the other hand, the investment in our Ecosystem, Ecosystem Fund, which has been announced at the beginning of the year and approved by the shareholders' meeting in the month of April.</p>
          <p>On the financial expenses level, you have 20 million positive, which again is reflecting two things. Number one, the gain on disposal of our biscuit operation in India and on the other hand some negative one-off exceptional financial items with respect to hedging. So, the total of that gives you a positive 210. I'll now moving then for to the underlying items and to financial expenses, which have been of 225 million versus 200 million last year. This is again different factors. Last year, we had as you remember a positive mark-to-markets of approximately 20 million on the financial expenses, which we don't have this year.</p>
          <p>This means that the number have been pretty comparable excluding this impact and is reflecting &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; on the one hand an improvement of the average cost of the debt and of the average debt. And on the other, the slightly higher costs of the hedging in emerging countries.</p>
          <p>All that, and I'll come back on the tax in the following page, is giving us a net income which has <mark type="inaudible" /> 798 million, before minority interest and to 722 million after minority interest.</p>
          <p>One word about the tax. We have the tax rates underlying of 22.5% the same was 24% during the first semester of last year. It was slightly in excess of 23% during the second semester of 2008, will remain on the tax rate which in a sustainable manner is in the range of 23.5, 23. The difference with the 22.5 is on exceptional tax benefits which we have had this semester.</p>
          <p>This leads us therefore to the underlying EPS which &#x2013; with a net income 722 million has amounted to &#x20AC;1.50 per share. The number of share have increased not at all as a result of the capital increase which closing has taken place on the 25th of June so there is no impact on this semester. But as a result of the distribution of the dividend in shares, which has created all together 11 million shares and 3 million on the product that employees basis for this quarter.</p>
          <p>This 1.50 compares to 1.47 on reported basis last year, which is driven by two factors, currency and scope on one hand. With the currency impact which is slightly higher than the one we have seen at the top line level it was 2.8, I remind you, and a scope in-line &#x2013; and the scope in fact very much in-line and a like-for-like sorry, growth for EPS which has stood at 6.7%. Again very much in the right direction considering our target of 10% for the full year.</p>
          <p>The work on the cash flow which has been driven by two main factors. Operating cash flow from operating activities has been strong at 846 million from 821 million the previous year. And on the other hand the phasing of the CapEx has been favorable this first half since we have had 4.1% of sales going forward. We still expect the run rate for the full year to be around 4.5% as opposed to 4.1 and therefore slightly higher for the second half.</p>
          <p>This cash flow &#x2013; the net free cash flow from operation of 600 million has been one of the three elements contributing to the reduction of the debt. The two others are of course, the capital increase for an amount very close to &#x20AC;3 billion on a net basis. And then the net proceeds from the disposals of our two businesses in Australasia and in India in beverage and biscuits. And all together this has resulted in a reduction of the debt of 4 billion, which means that we have now a balance sheet, which we consider much more balanced and robust with net debt reduced to slightly below 7 billion and other parts of the balance sheet, which has not been &#x2013; which have not been moving very significantly.</p>
          <p>I'll end with the outlook for the rest of the year. So we confirm our guidance of underlying EPS growth of 10%. The driver to achieve this 10% underlying EPS growth remain the same, sales and EBIT margin. It's obvious that, in the second semester, we expect the contribution from margins to be far less contributing than it has been during the first semester as we will be reinvesting gradually in different countries and divisions more and more of the cost decrease we have seen and on the contrary, we obviously expect during the second semester an acceleration of the sales growth as we take, as I've said more and more initiatives in our different geographies and division.</p>
          <p>This is the end of my presentation. I'll now propose that we move to questions and Robin and myself will be very happy to take that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Julian Hardwick at RBS. A couple questions, one on the guidance. I mean the 10% underlying EPS growth, you've excluded impact of disposals, currency and the rights issue from that. Now all of those are clearly quite material factors that are going to influence the outcome. Can you just tell us as you sit here today, what do you expect the impact of each of those three factors to be on the EPS?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I'm a bit puzzled by your EPS calculation for the first half because you seem to completely ignore the rights issue and made no adjustment in terms of the bonus &#x2013; or the rights issue, which should result in a restatement down in both the historic EPS and in the EPS for this year. So I was wondering if you could just explain how you're treating the rights issues in your EPS calculations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the <mark type="inaudible" /> we are treating it in accordance with the IAS, I believe it's 33 norms which gives precise guidance for the adjustments. Perhaps, the reason why you're don't see an impact on the first semester, is as I said, the fact that we have completed the transaction on the 25th of June, and we are in accordance with this norm, therefore treating that on a pro rata, temporary basis, which absolutely explains the fact that you have no adjustments and no significant impact for the first half. You obviously will have impacts for the second half. And this is what we have tried to show on the chart you see on the screen which is page 25 for the webcast.</p>
          <p>We've two elements which are the tariff adjustments and the capital increase impact itself. So during the roadshows for the capital increase, we've been very specific about this impact saying that we are expecting the tariff adjustments. I mean we know the tariff adjustments will be of 94%, which means an impact of minus 6, and this is basically what you will see when we come to see you on the full year in the first N/S column on the screen.</p>
          <p>For the capital increase, we've said as well that we expected the dilution to be 12%. We just restate that in terms of the weight to impact S2 of this year and S1 of next year. We expect this to be slightly de-balanced with a 75 as opposed to a 66. And therefore we expect the minus 7 on this table as we go to the second semester.</p>
          <p>As for the currencies, we are showing minus 3.2. We've made as we had done during the &#x2013; sorry during the first quarter, we've made an estimation again based on the spot at the end of the June. And if you take these spots for the second semester, we will find a total impact are of minus four. You could tell me &#x2013; you could tell me that this is a bit strange considering that the number of currencies in emerging countries have improved. This is true for part of them but not all of them. On the other hand, we are entering into a base of comparison versus last year, which is very different with respect to some currencies; I have two in mind. The U.S. on one hand and the Yuan more specifically on the other, which means that if we were taking the spots at the end of June, we would find an impact of four points instead of three points for the second semester. Now for the second semester, yeah, sorry. These being said, we have to see what's going to be the real impact. One of the reason why we've chosen to communicate in like-for-like EPS this year is precisely because of the volatility of currency, and we'll be monitoring this impact but focusing on the real performance.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Pablo Zuanic, JPMorgan. Couple of questions. First, can you give us more color at the regional level for the Dairy business and maybe for Baby Nutrition? In particular in the case of Dairy, what happened with volumes in Western Europe quarter-on-quarter, in terms of growth, the U.S. and emerging markets? And you have a delta of about 4 points right from minus one in the first to plus 2.7, but what drove that? And if you can also comment, just some color on Baby Nutrition volumes within developed markets and emerging markets, and then I'll have a follow-on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Dairy to give you a bit more color. There's been plus and minuses. Argentina is probably the main minus, Russia still been difficult, as I said, but has been recovering a bit compared to Q1. Then most of the improvement we've seen has been coming from the countries I've mentioned. The countries in which we've taken initiatives, which are Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, which have had a full year &#x2013; a full quarter impact in Q2, where they had only a limited impact in Q1. Mexico, which has had an impact for half of the quarter, France which has had higher impacts during Q2 versus Q1.</p>
          <p>And then we have countries which remain very solid in which we are taking initiatives, but not to the same extent as the one we've shown for these countries. This is the UK, this is Italy, this is Brazil in which the volume progression has been still very strong for the past quarters including this one. So we have &#x2013; that's the -- that's I guess the picture in geographical terms.</p>
          <p>If you think about Baby, fundamentally, we have three areas; Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia. I've mentioned Asia &#x2013; in Asia, I've mentioned China, which is a specific situation. Indonesia has been very much on the same base as Q1, perhaps with some improvements even. The rest of Eastern Europe, I mean, sorry, Eastern Europe, Turkey and Russia has been soft and maybe even more than in the first quarter. As I've mentioned, specifically in Russia, and in Turkey. The rest of Eastern Europe has been very much in line with Q1, and Western Europe has been very much in line with Q1.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just a follow-on, I know it's very sensitive to talk about your Dairy cost benefits. I mean when we see on TV all these farmers protesting in Switzerland and France. But I have to be honest, I mean, you're saying 200 basis points of  input cost benefits in first half on a consolidated revenue base of 7.5 billion, that's roughly only 150 million of cost benefits. And I have were we went with about 500, 600 million. If it's as low as 150, it just sounds to me like you don't have a lot of ammunition to get prices in the second half unless you are guiding for margins to fall in the second half year-on-year. I know you said that margins are going to be down &#x2013; up less in the second half, but just more color on those input cost benefits; they just seem very low to me in terms of the number you are giving us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you're probably the only one in this room on that. They are what they are, and again even in the 150 you mentioned, as per your calculation, there is as part of that a part of productivity, which is counting for approximately one-third, so the real impact of the rest of the input cost, is even lower than what you mentioned, which reflects the fact indeed that we have seen some improvement on the cost of raw material, but we have always said for the &#x2013; since the last quarter of this year that we did not expect the improvement on raw material cost to make us come back to the previous level, because we know that there are some, let's put it this way, resistance. There are some breaks to coming back to previous levels depending on the geographies, so we are not &#x2013; we do not feel surprised by that.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, one last one if I may, on the cash flow front, you said net debt at the end of first half below 7 billion, free cash flow or 600 million in the first half. So should we assume like what 6.3, 6.4 by end of the year in terms of net debt roughly?</p>

          <p>All right David Hayes from Nomura. Just a follow-up on that. Can you be more specific about what this productivity savings involve and whether it's ongoing whether we'll see that coming through in the second half another 50 million kind of benefit or more potentially? Just to clarify on the input cost, I think you said that it'll be flat to maybe a slight benefit in the second half. Is that the right understanding from what you said earlier?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it'll be lower than it was in the first semester? Okay. And then just on the productivity side, what's involved there? Is that an ongoing <mark type="inaudible" /> an equal amount in the second half of the year?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no &#x2013; there's no real imbalance now on the recurring aspect of this productivity. We make year-after-year, we make productivity for the Group. So that's &#x2013; I mean part of that is very much a recurring side of the exercises we are doing. Obviously, in market conditions and context as well, we are seeing we are trying to accelerate everything we can. And that's what we have been doing this year. Which means that yes this is sustainable, i.e. these are not one-off savings, but these are things which will be repeated over time.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" />. Good morning. In the first half of the underlying EPS on the like-for-like basis was up 6.5%; your guidance for the full year of 10% <mark type="inaudible" /> acceleration in second half of the year with margin contributing significantly less in the second half. What sort of volume recovery are you budgeting for to get to that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've &#x2013; on purpose chosen not to be more precise on the guidance. As I said, we feel we are in front of market, which remain extremely dynamics and difficult. We just want to have the flexibility to adapt further. What we know is that as we move into the year, we'll have the full effect of what we have already been doing in the first semester and we'll have the full impacts on the second semester. We know that we'll probably have the ability to implement further initiatives in some countries.</p>
          <p>But again, we are staying very close to the ground and close to the market in order to make these decisions. And therefore, I'm not really able to comment on that. Again, I'm repeating what we've been saying since the beginning of the year. We know there are several ways to achieve this 10% EPS. We are obviously trying as much as possible to the do that through volume growth and sales growth, because we think this is what is sustainable. But again we don't want to be led to do stupid things because of that. So we take it month after month and country-by-country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I have just one more question? Is it possible to give us within Dairy a breakout of <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. To be &#x2013; I'll answer to the mix effect, the product mix effect in Dairy which remains positive. Although, it has been slightly lower than what we have seen in the first quarter. So it was 1% during first quarter. It's around 0.5 for the second quarter. So it means that the <mark type="inaudible" /> keep progressing faster than the rest of the range. But as we rebalance the focus on the whole portfolio, there is less of a difference as we speak during this period of reinvestments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jeremy Fialko at Redburn Partners. I've got two questions the first one on the prospects for the Nutrition divisions in the second half. Obviously you've got this very, very tough comparison in China in the final quarter of the year. So if you could talk a little bit more about that. And also whether you think you'll see any sort of the pick up in Clinical Nutrition? And then the second question is on your Dairy volumes and whether you can give a little bit more detail on this. Obviously, volumes consist of two things, that you're selling more units of yoghurt and there's just putting more yoghurt in a particular pack. Can you talk a little bit about the balance of the two figures that will be quite helpful? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Frankly I don't have a breakdown of &#x2013; your question was very clear that it's really a combination of both. There's obviously a component of more volumes in &#x2013; I mean bigger units being sold and that's illustrated for instance on the one kilo product which we are selling in Mexico, but at the same time we are increasing the penetration. So we're not yet at the stage to share any KPI with you on that. We are working on it, will be at some stage, but clearly we are doing both, it's both a matter of &#x2013; some elements of bigger content but as well increased penetration. And I would say it's a majority increased penetration.</p>
          <p>On your first question I think it was about Baby as opposed to Clinical since you mentioned China. I mean clearly we've been saying from the very beginning that this unfortunate melamine crisis in China was creating some temporary effects but was going at some stage to normalize. We did not know exactly when, we've seen that's happening during the course of Q2. And we just have to keep monitoring it. But we think most of the normalization has taken place already which means that part of the negatives which you see in the performance of Q2 which come from these normalization and market share normalizing to previous level. These are one off for the quarter.</p>

          <p>And going forward just, follow up on Baby, we expect Baby again to remain resilient. We've always said that. But we've equally always said that we did not expect Baby to be fully immune from any evolution of the economic environment. Hence as well the initiatives we have taken for instance in Bebelac which aims at competing the range in order to make it more comprehensive and more solid with the second proposition to consumer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. I am Chris Wickham from MainFirst. I'm just intrigued by a point where you say &#x2013; in your text you say growth will be mainly driven by all leading brands onward because it's very hard if you're changing tact from being sort of heavily driven by price to switch around and be driven by volume. <mark type="inaudible" /> . But it also at the same price they actually lose that's &#x2013; being your leading brands. I was wondered perhaps you just clarify how this goes? Because I think it's quite hard to do there, if you then change your emphasis to volume?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry Robin is telling me that the question &#x2013; it's clear to me, but it's come unclear to probably the web audience since you were far away from the microphones, can you just summarize it in...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a problem with the microphone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry, so I will repeat the question. The question is about the sustainability of what we are doing and the fact that we having a strategy of improving sales through blockbusters in the past and we now have the strategy which is more volume based and less needs based.</p>
          <p>I think you have to &#x2013; we have to distinguish really two things as a strategy of the group and the adjustment we are doing at the moment. The strategy of the group is remains focused on delivering value-added product to the consumer and delivering among other things health benefits and good products to the consumer which can be valued then because they have these benefits and this superior quality at the higher price than we average of the markets. So that was true that is true today that will be true tomorrow that's &#x2013; there's nothing changing that. But then we are in the middle of the management of two very significant elements which are number one ups and downs on the main side.</p>
          <p>And number two the general economic slowdown which change or revise to adapt the consumer behavior. So what you can see principally in the figures today is impact of these adjustments. It doesn't mean at all that we are defocusing from the blockbusters, we are just working as well on the range &#x2013; the Core Range. We are strengthening the Core Range. We are taking a number of initiatives. We are lowering prices. We are pushing promotions. We are doing all that. But at the same time, we are not defocusing from blockbusters which remain a priority. And in fact when I give you the example of Mexico, I said that there were three elements in what we do.</p>
          <p>There is an element, we changed that's completing the Core Range. That's absolutely undeniable. But at the same time, we are number one expending the benefits for bigger formats. But expending the benefit for bigger formats also means that we are making these blockbusters at a relatively higher price to new customers which we did not reach before, which are consumers with less purchasing power. And we are launching the mini-shots which are absolutely in-line with what we have been doing for years which are these blockbusters. So we are acting on several fronts. I think what you're reading to the numbers is a reflection of the combination of the strategy and the adjustments, we are putting, but we are still very clear that the focus is to grow the blockbusters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too simplistic then we'll say that basically when people are going to spend a lot of money on yogurt and other Fresh Dairy <mark type="inaudible" /> when people aren't willing to spend that amount of money you grow somewhere closer to 4%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think it's far too simplistic, you're right. No, no but I mean it's -the fact that we adapt is really the consequence of the two shots, I mean don't forget that we have increased prices by 10% last year. We have increased prices by 10% when we have seen the increase of the cost of milk. Now that we see the level of the cost of raw milk normalizing it's absolutely legitimate to try and compensate the shock which the consumer has been going through and which he's been through, further more, in an environment which makes his life even more difficult. And in a situation where part of the strategy as well to come back with the comment from Jeremy is to increase penetration. So I think the reality is a bit more complex than that and is really the combination of these two effects i.e. the strategy which remains in place and works well and the adjustments we are doing to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi it's Warren Ackerman at Evolution. Couple of things, could we get your outlook for Dairy costs? For the first question. Looks like the pricing's being very, very weak, any kind of rebound that people were expecting in H2 '09 maybe has it &#x2013; has it been pushed out to 2010, your views on Dairy costs? And then secondly what kind of price cuts are you having to put through in Dairy I know Robin in the past has given us the example of Activia in Spain where you've taken a 33% price cut &#x2013; with Actimel, okay. 33% price cut to get a big volume improvement. Can you give some examples of the quantum of the price cuts in some of your bigger markets, what kind of elasticity are you seeing on these volume pick up? Do you need to cut prices double-digit to drive volumes? And then....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very valuable &#x2013; first of all because we don't do it the same way in all markets. Number two because you should not forget that's all that we are not only doing price and size but the combination of price, promo and a number of actions. In some markets like France you see that the average level of reinvestment is around 5% and the level of reinvestments on the products in which we are taking the actions is 8% for instance in the case of Danette. So it goes from that kind of magnitude to on the other hand countries like the one we mentioned by Robin or Poland for instance of Actimel in Q1 where we have decreased the price by a very significant number which is indeed 30%.</p>
          <p>But again it's really a factor of the dynamics we see in a particular country. The position we have in this particular country, the product we choose to push and the reading we have about the consumer attitude at this very point in time. But I would say same from 5 to 30's probably a good range with very significant difference from one country, one product to the other.</p>
          <p>And as for your first question, I will just say that there's no fundamental difference between what I said about the cost and margins of the group in the second half and the same for Dairy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To go back to Chris's point, are you concerned about the eroding price mix in the business? I mean I think premiumization has been a key part of the Danone investment case over the years. And it just seems right now that consumers are less willing to pay a premium for health benefits in &#x2013; certainly in the developed markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and what is your question &#x2013; are we concerned by that? No. We are not concerned. We're just moving. I mean the reality in the world, the market is changing on the many sides on the two sides I've mentioned before. Frankly, our worries is twice &#x2013; two folds. Number one to make sure that the strategy of delivering benefit to the consumer which can be valued is still in place and the answer to that is very clear. It's, yes, it's still in place.</p>
          <p>And number two to adapt micro to the current situation and to make sure that we are not trapped in what you call as a premiumization because there is a high cost to losing volumes at the end. You cannot &#x2013; we don't believe you can run a portfolio of product which will be completely premium without Core Range without, I mean, that's also the lesson of 2008. Our problem is very simple is verify the strategy that the strategy we had in place &#x2013; place and the answer is yes. And number two make sure that we catch the opportunities we see on the markets as much as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I guess, what I'm trying to get at, is okay cutting prices when your Dairy costs are coming down by 25 to 30% but what happens when you go into 2010 and Dairy costs will start rising again? You haven't got the same amount of ammunition to cut prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's why it's a new question which needs to be dynamic here just but frankly what is done on prices &#x2013; what is done on cost is done, you're right but then what is done on price is done as well.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Harold Thompson from Deutsche Bank. I have just got two question. You gave us a quantum of input cost 200 basis point down in first half. Could you give us an idea where Dairy stands versus that down 200? Is it substantially more? Fairly similar? And secondly, in the markets where you have invested, you've mentioned France and Mexico, is the margins up or down? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I take the second and Robin will take the first. The margin is either up or stable to answer these questions. And that's one of the reason why we are not taking any global initiative. We take initiative depending on the situation of every country, because we want by doing by taking these value initiative to do it in relation with the margin in relation with the margin as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or may be seeing &#x2013; at the group level input cost relief is about 200 basis points in the first half. Just look at the Dairy division, just give an idea <mark type="inaudible" /> 200 basis point or fairly similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we haven't calculated in basis points but the majority is driven by &#x2013; the thing is if you look at overall tailwind from milk, it's bigger than the total amount that we showed. But because you also have some headwind in the overall raw material costs developments. But because Dairy is the biggest part and in terms of the level of milk it uses it's driven by Dairy.

Some of them are a bit down, but we also see some markets going up like for instance Italy and slightly in Germany, Switzerland, Greece. Austria is up as well. Czech Republic is up, Hungary's up, and then you have a slight soft market share performance in countries like Romania, Russia, Belgium, the Netherlands. In the rest of the world, China's doing well with the new Activia introduction. Japan is doing well.

          <p>Alan Erskine from UBS. Just two questions. Firstly, I mean you've talked about a more challenging environment in Northern Europe in the Medical Nutrition side because of the economic slowdown, I'm just wondering, if we look into 2010 with the level of <mark type="inaudible" />. Is that going to continue to be challenging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry with the number of? The mic was off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh sorry, I was just saying with &#x2013; when we look into 2010 with the level of government borrowing likely to lead to more pressure on healthcare spending, how challenging do you think 2010 is going to be for the Medical Nutrition business, just qualitatively? Second, a small quantitative question, which is: could you give us actually an indication as to what sales in China Baby Food did in the quarter, quarter-on-comparable-quarter?</p>
          <p>And finally, just an observation, back to the number of shares in issue. I mean I grant you that you haven't had the rights issue in this period, but your share price is adjusted for the bonus element in the rights issue, so strictly speaking, the 150 is not comparing apple-to-apples in your share price. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last point, I &#x2013; there is indeed definitely some merit in discussing the accounting treatment, but at the end of the day, we report in IS 33 we've just got to follow that. So &#x2013; but I agree that's something that will be debated; we are just again following the norms. The auditors do not  leave us room of maneuver on that side either.</p>
          <p>On the two other elements, Medical, yes we see some pressure and anticipate that there could be, there could be increasing pressure in the coming months and quarters. This is one of the reason why we are trying to expand as fast as we can to countries where we anticipate there is less pressure, to emerging countries, that's one of the example. But also to different products with &#x2013; and there no investment model in some of the countries. So we anticipate there would be more pressure. We see that only slightly and in one country for the time being. But we are getting prepared to face more indeed. It doesn't make us particularly worried on the overall performance and resilience of this division.</p>
          <p>Then on Baby China, my only comment would be that we've grown far less fast as a result of destabilization of market share, but we have grown.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just reading the sort of full-year annual report, in that you make the statement saying with respect to the put options that no financial investment currently being considered as probable on the short-term.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning all. I have two follow-up questions. The first is on China again. Maybe you can help us understand on the Dairy rollouts and provide us with an update on China there? And maybe also share your plans if you have them that you can share on India for Dairy? And the second question is, just for the record, could you confirm to us again that you have no big acquisition plans at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the last point which is pretty similar to the previous questions, I considered it answered already. We are not going to confirm every quarter that we have no big acquisitions or acquisition plans in the pipe. I just confirm that there is &#x2013; there's been no change and no reason whatsoever explaining the absence of statement or the presence of statement seems to get that increase. So the situation is the same. And then let's be clear on that. I'm not going further. I'm not going to comment or answer any more of that kind of question.</p>
          <p>Not because we have things in the pipe, but because we don't want to be in the situation where we systematically answer or comment that kind of question. But then the answer is no, there is nothing.</p>
          <p>Then coming back to Dairy China, India Dairy, India Dairy, I think it's a bit early days. One of the first things we are studying is entering the country with an affordable, what we call internally, bottom of the pyramid initiatives, which will be leveraging on the experience we have in Bangladesh and trying out of this experience to make a real business model, but on the business side with India. So that's going to be the first one. Again it's bit preliminary to comment on it, because it's in the process of being implemented, but that will be the first way of reentrance, and then there will probably be others going forward, but again too early to talk about that.</p>
          <p>On the Dairy side, what we have said and seen in Q1 is basically continuing, i.e. we are growing fast. We've become number two in Shanghai in modern trade, and the growth is basically continuing well with Activia, so with the blockbuster.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning everyone. Just a follow-up on your comments you made in terms of margin expansion for the second half of year, I was wondering if you are working on a specific scenario for milk prices to basically project such a modest expansion for the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not to &#x2013; we have share now so we have some visibility of what the milk is going to be in the second half.  We don't expect any major change going forward, but we &#x2013; but this goes both ways. We don't expect any further improvements. We don't expect either to have a very significant increase of the cost. About the medium term, we are clear on the fact that there is probably no longer any upside on the level, we have seen today. And we think on the contrary that there could be some limited downside going forward, but manageable as they have been for many, many years up until 2006-2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The other question I have for you was regarding your Baby Nutrition business. The easing pace of growth, we saw in Q2 which is rather marginal. Is that true or is that fair to assume there was basically most in the back of Dairy demanding comp you had in 2008 or is there any specific reason for this slowdown? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No Mario it was basically in-line with what we indicated when we were discussing the sales performance of Baby in one of the proceeding slides. We saw a bit of softness in China which was just a rebound of all the good performance that we saw in Q4 and Q1 and as we flagged we expected some of the local players to come back quite quickly. And therefore it's more readjustment than anything else. Once the dust has settled down, there's no reason to believe why China will not continue with growth paths it has been on in 2008. We've also flagged that Russia remains a difficult market that doesn't mean that it's a very difficult performance, but it's softer than we were used to. Thirdly, Eastern Europe as a whole is a bit soft. And again nothing very significant but it's still for the overall equation it plays a role.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, I am forgetting one, which is weaning food, we've clearly indicated that within our portfolio, we know that it was more resilient than most other food categories. But within Baby Food, there is a part which is relatively speaking a bit more susceptible to an economic downturn and that's weaning food, because there is a substitute possible in terms of going to mother's kitchen or preparing the food yourself. And that is what we see, not across the board, but in certain markets like Turkey and again Russia. We see that the weaning food business is bit a softer than what you would see in a normal macroeconomic environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I would just be interested in a bit more color on the different blockbusters. Thanks for giving the volume and organic growth numbers, but maybe you can give a bit more color on different blockbusters. Where do you see positive signs and where do you see negative development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll do that. Activia is still very strong, and to be clear higher than when it was that &#x2013; sorry higher than the performance we've delivered in Q1 on this product, so still very strong and with the right direction.</p>
          <p>Actimel, as you know, has been the product which has suffered most for the past, I will say, 12 months .This is as well one of the product on which we have reinvested efforts by new initiatives in Poland in particular. And we see the performance of Actimel improving gradually. It's not yet at the level we would like it to be. But it's really improved and quite significantly.</p>
          <p>Danonino is very much in-line with the previous quarters i.e. not as strong as we would like it to be and not as strong as the potential we see for this product. So, as well as the case for Actimel in the past quarters, we have &#x2013; we know we have some work to do on Danonino, because that's a brand which can &#x2013; which really has a lot of potential.</p>
          <p>And the last one is Vitalinea, which was weak and is weak. And we know Vitalinea is as &#x2013; I mean one of the issues of Vitalinea is kind of cannibalization with Activia. That was true, that remains true. We are coming with initiative and innovation in order to better differentiate Vitalinea from Activia. We still have results to see in order to be able to confirm that we are on the right path for the product.</p>
          <p>So, positive Activia, Actimel; to be improved in Danonino and Vitalinea, we still have to find and confirm the solution.</p>

          <p>Hi, Xavier Croquez from Exane BNP Paribas. Just one point of clarification regarding the famous start of productivity gains in raw materials. There is no synergy of joint blending Numico and then on milk purchases in this clean of synergies?</p>

          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two questions, building on a previous one. We understand it's not easy to clarify what is elasticity of price on volumes, what is unit versus extra volumes and so on and so forth. But on our side it would be very helpful if you could provide us with a few examples of price cuts that are already six months back so the consumer has forgotten them. And what are the resilience of volume trends ones the price cuts are forgotten? So if you have a few examples. And the second one is in Germany in Clinical Nutrition what's really going on there? Why is it in Germany to start with and what is actually going on in Germany from a competitive point of view in Clinical Nutrition? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two elements. On the examples I think we have to turn back to the countries we've mentioned during the first quarter, because these are the ones for which we have the bigger look. And basically what we had observed was that the volume rebound was exceeding the price decrease. So that's the sales result was positive. That remains true, and that remains true and that's only throughout Q2, but even in June if you talk about June. So we have performances which are maybe slightly up from what you see in the first month, but which are very much in-line with what we expected and lasting.</p>
          <p>And that's true for the four countries which we mentioned that time which is Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and I think the last one was Hungary. In the case of the U.S. we obviously not in the same &#x2013; not in the same case because what we have been pushing is more promotions and therefore you can't have the same assessment as one you are talking about. But yes we see resilience in the effect of the actions we have taken and indeed that's very important that's the first thing to look at.</p>
          <p>With respect to Medical in Germany as I said it's a combination of pressure on reimbursement and on competition with one key player being in front of us which name is <mark type="inaudible" /> which he is competing very hard on price with us on that side. I think in addition to that it's fair to say that we had some management issues which we have been fixing and we expect therefore &#x2013; I mean we have action plans in place to progressively improve the situation but it's too early to see that in figure there now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Janardan?.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Janardan from Merrill Lynch. Your top line medium term guidance remains 8 to 10% I was wondering what you actually called medium term and if you could give us the detail of the assumptions you make by division to get to this numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So yeah, you're right it remains &#x2013; it remains 8 to 10. I won't qualify the medium term for the same reason than the one I've explained for the past year, it's been for the six month i.e. the environment in which we are living, the adjustments we are doing the change of consumption trends, in fact the environment in which we are leaving, the adjustments we are doing, the change of consumption trends, the impact of the economic crisis, establishing position of the price of milk and so on all that is putting us in a negotiating where we have to adjust the level, and we don't know how much time this is going to take. And particularly we never give guidance for the following year before November of the previous year.</p>
          <p>We are not going to start giving them earlier this particular year where we know that the economic situation is I would qualify it as unstable, and therefore we need to see &#x2013; we need to see more. As for the breakdown, it's fundamentally around the same number for the re-higher from Medical and Baby, and whether range for &#x2013; which we expect to be more between five and ten than between eight and ten. So, there's no change on that.</p>

          <p>So the last question from Pablo. So sorry it's Pablo in the corner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the follow up. Look maybe these questions more for <mark type="inaudible" />, but I have to say, back in November on Investor Day, you said, one day will be 100% blockbusters. And to be honest that I don't think that makes sense, okay, and when we are talking about growing in the core portfolio &#x2013; what I want to understand really these things hold their net, the growth in the core portfolio now, is this just tactical? Or is there a seismic significant change in strategy in which earnings are going to be start looking at innovating, and what I would call value-added maybe easier to copy core products?</p>
          <p>And what I mean by that there's number of segments on there you are guys are not fully serving. <mark type="inaudible" /> natural yogurt. You have a Hispanic brand in the U.S. running about 30%. You have people launching more indulgence type of products. And the list goes on and on. And I'm just trying to understand has there been a change or is it still what Franck wants 100% blockbusters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean again to me you, it's very important not to mix up the strategy which remains essentially the same and the adjustment we need to make to the specific situation. What's changed, I think it's easy, you just need to look around you to see the level of growth of the economic secure the growth of the unemployment's, the effect on the consumption I think it's pretty clear.</p>
          <p>What's changed as well is that we have seen last year in the U.S. for instance that's by being 100% focused on blockbusters, we run the risk to face some volume leak on the Core Range and we know that volume leak in the Core Range is making a center into a negative equation because if we use the leverage.</p>
          <p>So that's what we are trying to fix or adapt to the current economic environment, adapt to the current consumption factor. Overall, it's that we enter into an equation where we would put pressure on the blockbusters through the Core Range and that's why we are re-launching Core Range in some geographies like Mexico for instances. But again I repeat the priority remains the blockbusters, the priority remains to deliver have for food to the bigger number people possible. The priority remains to add value. I said many times and I can repeat it that if we were to choose competing on price only, we would we dead at the end of the day, because if you want to find people who can produce cheaper you will always find them. People dumping, playing on that as well so it's a question of balance yes we have to be competitive, yes we have to produce cheap, yes we have to make sure that we don't lose ground on the Core Range. It doesn't prevent us at the same time to have as a priority Activia, Actimel and the others. We are still focusing of spending 1 or 2% of your time and energy on Activia you go to an equation where you spend 70 to 80% on blockbusters and 20 to 30% on the Core Range, to me that's reasonable balance and certainly not a change of focus on strategy. It's just an adjustment.</p>
