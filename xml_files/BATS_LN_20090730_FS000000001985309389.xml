        <plist>
          <p>Well good morning, everyone, and welcome to our results presentation.  I'm Jan du Plessis, Chairman of British American Tobacco.  And with me this morning, I've got Paul Adams, our Chief Executive, and Ben Stevens, our Finance Director.  This morning, we'll be taking you through the half yearly results, after which there will as usual be an opportunity for people in the audience to ask questions.  And good morning also to those of you who might be listing on the conference call or watching via our website, bat.com.</p>
          <p>Before giving you my main impressions of today's results, let me begin by briefly running you through the headline numbers.  Overall volumes rose 5% to 349 billion, driven by last year's acquisitions of ST and Tekel.  Excluding the acquisitions, volumes were down 2%, mainly reflecting declines in market such as Russia, Ukraine, Japan and Mexico.  Much of this volume decline was in the low price segment.</p>
          <p>Global Drive Brands rose 5%, of which just over half came from brand migrations.  As we all know, sterling has declined relative to where it was a year ago, so revenue and profit benefited from favorable exchange rates, together with the contributions from the acquired businesses and strong pricing momentum.</p>
          <p>Reported revenue was up 24% and profit from operations rose 23%.  Nevertheless, growth at constant rates of exchange at 14 and 13% respectively was an excellent result, particularly in the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>Our associates' volumes were 94 billion.  And our share of their post-tax results, after adjusting items and the absence of a contribution from the ST in the current period, increased by 19% to &#xA3;279 million in current rates and declined by 5% at constant rates of exchange.</p>
          <p>Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 25% to &#xA3;0.773, broadly in line with the growth in profit from operations.  We continue to reward our shareholders with increased dividends.  Our established policy of paying an interim dividend representing one third of the previous year's total dividend results in our interim dividend being increased by 26% to &#xA3;0.279.</p>
          <p>12 months ago, we reported on the completion of the ST and Tekel acquisitions.  This year, we've announced the acquisition of Bentoel for &#xA3;300 million.  This deal represents our first steps into the significant Indonesian kretek market and should present us with a good platform for long-term growth in that market.</p>
          <p>As you will hear from Ben, the business continues to be very cash-generative and the balance sheet remains strong.  Moreover, despite the difficult economic and trading conditions that we have seen in some markets, the continued market share growth from our Global Drive Brands, our ability to innovate and our broad geographic spread should continue to stand us in very good stead indeed.  We are confident about our ability to deliver another good year.</p>
          <p>Paul will now take you through the first half performance in more detail.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.  And thank you, Jan.  It was the economist, J. K. Galbraith, who remarked that the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.  And as we peer into the second half of 2009 and beyond, the divergence of economic estimates suggests forecasters may be using a range of tools from horoscopes to tarot cards.  However, as far as we are concerned our business is performing remarkably well, despite the impact of rising unemployment, excise-driven price increases and the consequent growth in illicit trade.</p>
          <p>Much of the decline in our volume has been in low price and our premium volume is holding up well.  On an organic basis, our premium volume is down just 1%, mid price is flat and low price is down 5%.  The point is, premium is not necessarily the casualty in a down-trading market.  Mid price can go into low price and low into illicit.</p>
          <p>The net effect is that organic volume is down by 2% for the six months.  Reported volumes, however, rose 5% as a result of the acquisitions of ST and Tekel a year ago.  We've experienced good volume growth in Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Korea, Egypt, Uzbekistan, Nigeria and the GCC.  But this growth was offset by declines in Russia, Japan, Ukraine, Brazil, Mexico, Italy and South Africa.  The fact that our premium volume has held up so well is due to the strength of our Global Drive Brands, which grew 5% during the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Dunhill was up 8%.  The brand experienced volume growth in the GCC, specifically Saudi Arabia, as well as in Russia, South Korea and Brazil, partially offset by declines in Malaysia, Taiwan and South Africa.  Market share rose in most of its key markets due to a strong performance and the successful migration from Carlton taking place in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Kent volumes fell by 2% with volume growth in Romania, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan offset by industry declines in Japan and Russia, and despite increasing its market share in Russia.</p>
          <p>Lucky Strike volume rose 7% as good performances in Germany, France, Italy, Indonesia, Chile and Brazil were partially offset by industry declines in Spain, Japan and Argentina.  Market share was up across all of its key markets, except Japan where it declined slightly.</p>
          <p>Pall Mall volumes grew 10% with increases in Germany, Uzbekistan, Mexico, Turkey and Chile, partly offset by Italy, Pakistan, Russia, Romania and Hungary.  Despite lower volumes in Romania and Hungary, market share grew in both markets.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the regions.  In Asia-Pacific, profit rose &#xA3;101 million to &#xA3;557 million.  As a result of favorable exchange rates, supported by strong performances in Pakistan, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Australia.  At constant rates of exchange, profit was up &#xA3;25 million or 5%.  Volumes were 2% lower as increases in Pakistan, Bangladesh and South Korea were more than offset by declines in Japan and Malaysia.</p>
          <p>Higher pricing and lower costs resulted in strong profit growth in Australia, despite increased competitor discounting. Pall Mall and Winfield experienced growth but overall volume and market share remained in line with last year.</p>
          <p>Malaysia is an example of a market where industry volume has contracted, but premium, represented by Dunhill, has achieved a record market share.  Illicit trade continues to grow following steep excise increases in recent years.</p>
          <p>In Korea, a good performance from Dunhill led to volume and market share growth.  A weaker exchange rate and adverse transactional foreign exchange resulted in lower profit.</p>
          <p>In Japan, industry volumes fell 6.5% and although our market share dropped slightly, there was profit growth as a result of favorable exchange rates, productivity savings and an improved product mix.</p>
          <p>Profit in the Americas was &#xA3;63 million higher at &#xA3;579 million, due to Brazil's strong performance.  At constant rates of exchange profit would have increased by &#xA3;57 million or 11%.  Volumes were down 5% at 74 billion with declines in most markets across the region.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, significant profit growth was achieved as prices rose in anticipation of an excise increase. The actual rise in excise, around 40%, was significantly greater than that anticipated.  Although higher prices led to lower volumes, market share rose.</p>
          <p>Canada's lower costs, better pricing and currency benefits were offset by lower volumes and an adverse product mix, resulting in a drop in profit.  Market share for the last four quarters has now been stable, although it fell slightly compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Mexico experienced lower volumes due to an excise-driven price increase.  Market share was also lower.  Pall Mall had a successful migration from Boots while Montana performed well.  Profit declined due to the reduction in volumes and increase in marketing investment.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, profit was &#xA3;509 million, up by &#xA3;175 million.  This was achieved by strong performances in Italy, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Poland and the Czech Republic, as well as last year's acquisition of ST.  At constant rates, profit would have increased by &#xA3;100 million or 30%.  Volumes were up 18% to 63 billion, but were 3% lower on an organic basis.</p>
          <p>In Italy, profit increased as a result of higher prices and productivity savings.  The contraction of the market led to lower volumes.  There was also a small drop in market share mostly due to MS and tail brands, despite Lucky Strike's growth in share.</p>
          <p>Germany's volumes were in line with last year.  Paul Mall and Lucky Strike had good performances, contributing to market share growth, despite the tail brand decline.  This coupled with favorable exchange rates led to an increase in profit.</p>
          <p>In France, Lucky Strike and Paul Mall grew volume and market share.  Profit benefited from the favorable exchange rate.  Despite the lower industry volumes in Spain, market share was stable and profit increased following price rises earlier in the year and continuing cost management.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, profit was down by &#xA3;16 million to &#xA3;183 million, principally due to lower volumes and the impact of transactional foreign exchange rates on product costs.  Regional volumes were 9% lower as industry volumes declined in a number of markets following excise-driven price increases and also due to share loss in Russia during the second half of 2008, when we initiated a price increase not immediately followed by competitors.</p>
          <p>Although market share was down in Russia it was stable in the second quarter this year as competitors' price increases flowed through to the market.  Profit was lower despite price increases as a result of lower volumes, higher marketing investment and transactional foreign exchange impacts on costs.</p>
          <p>In Romania, Kent, Dunhill and Vogue put in strong performances, resulting in continued market share growth, although higher marketing investment and the decline in volumes resulted in lower profit.  Kent continued to grow its market share in Ukraine but the rapid currency devaluation and excise increases led to lower volume and profit.</p>
          <p>Profit in Africa and Middle East region was &#xA3;84 million higher at &#xA3;336 million.  At constant rates of exchange profit would have increased by &#xA3;53 million, or 21%, with good performances by Nigeria, the GCC and the Tekel contribution.  Regional volumes grew 37% to 64 billion, driven by increases in Turkey, the GCC, Nigeria and Egypt partially offset by a decline in South Africa.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, volumes were lower largely due to an increase in illicit trade and reductions in trade inventories. However, with Peter Stuyvesant's record share and Kent and Dunhill's continuing good performance market share grew.  Profit was broadly in line with last year. There was a significant growth in profit in Nigeria, following increased volumes and lower costs.</p>
          <p>The Middle East achieved significant growth in volumes, with the excellent performance of Dunhill in the GCC.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, the Tekel business has been successfully integrated.  Kent, Pall Mall and Viceroy all performed well, although total market share was lower as a result of a decline in the Tekel brands.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Ben.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone.  From the sheer weight of this morning's release, you'll be aware there are some additional disclosures.  Pages 22 and 23 provide segmental analysis of revenue at both constant and current rates.</p>
          <p>Please note that the adjusted profit from operations at constant rates of exchange is derived using the conventional method of translating profit at the comparative period's average exchange rates. We've not attempted to adjust the numbers for transactional FX.  In the supplementary section at the back of your slide packs, you'll see the impact of currencies on revenue and profit on a region-by-region basis in the usual graphic format.</p>
          <p>I'll start by taking a look at margins.  On a profit-per-mille basis, pricing and favorable foreign exchange have resulted in the Group's profit per thousand cigarettes rising from &#xA3;5.26 to &#xA3;6.20. Five years ago at the interim results, the Group's profit per mille was &#xA3;3.40.  So we've seen almost a doubling over that period.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange impact on translation and transactional factors has resulted in Eastern Europe's profit per mille being essentially flat, despite the price increases that have taken place in some markets.</p>
          <p>The lower profit per mille for Africa and Middle East reflects the Tekel acquisition which has had a dilutive effect on the regions margins.  The Tekel effect can be best seen on the operating margin, which resulted in the Africa and Middle East margin dropping from 35% to 30%.</p>
          <p>Pricing dynamics have improved margins in Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Western Europe while higher costs arising from transactional foreign exchange effects have diluted Eastern Europe's margin, which stands at a shade under 25%.  The adverse impact of transactional foreign exchange on variable costs offset just over half of the benefit of foreign exchange on the translation of profit into sterling.  The Group margin was similar to last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the income statement, adjusted profit from operations grew 23% to 2,164 million.  Paul has already taken you through the regional results.  Restructuring costs were &#xA3;29 million for the period and mainly related to restructurings following the Tekel and ST acquisitions.</p>
          <p>There was also an amortization charge of &#xA3;26 million in relation to trademarks acquired with Tekel and ST.  This will be a feature of future reporting.  The gain on disposal arose from the disposal of some from trademarks in Scandinavia to meet competition issues.</p>
          <p>Profit from operations before adjusting items was 22% higher.  Net finance costs at &#xA3;219 million were &#xA3;40 million higher than last year.  I'll discuss this in more detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>The share of post-tax results of associates was &#xA3;231 million, a fall of &#xA3;62 million, reflecting the absence of ST and some adjusting items at Reynolds American.  For the purpose of the adjusted earnings per share calculation, we've adjusted for Reynolds American's charge for trademark impairments and last year's payment from Gallaher, resulting from the termination of a joint venture agreement.</p>
          <p>Also last year there was a &#xA3;13 million adjustment in respect to an additional quarter's income from ST.  After adjusting for these items the contribution from associates was &#xA3;279 million, up 19% on last year.  The increase in net finance costs mainly relates to higher average debt due to the ST and Tekel acquisitions in 2008 and the adverse impact of exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Profit before tax was 16% higher at &#xA3;2,123 million.  For the purpose of the adjusted earnings per share calculation the underlying tax rate at 28% was lower than guidance due to a favorable change in the mix of profits.  We now anticipate the rate for the year to be around 29%.</p>
          <p>Profit for the period rose 18% to &#xA3;1,589 million.  And the minorities rose &#xA3;44 million to &#xA3;139 million, reflecting higher profits from Brazil and the impact of the foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Here are the drivers of adjusted earnings per share growth.  Profit from subsidiaries at constant rates of exchange drove earnings by 12%.  Net finance costs, associates and the minorities charge were all slightly negative.</p>
          <p>The lower tax rate of 28% accounted for just over &#xA3;0.02, or 3.4% of the adjusted earnings growth. The share buyback benefited earnings by 1% and the calculation was based on 1,993 million shares.  However, it was the strong underlying profit performance and favorable exchange rates that accounted for most of the 25% growth in adjusted earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow.  Operating cash flow rose &#xA3;195 million to 1,723 million.  This reflected the growth in underlying operating performance, partly offset by the timing of capital expenditure and adverse working capital movements.</p>
          <p>Restructuring costs were similar to the prior year.  Higher net interest payments due to the timing of a bond coupon payment and FX, tax paid and dividends to minority interest resulted in free cash flow being &#xA3;100 million lower than last year at &#xA3;848 million.</p>
          <p>The share buyback program has been suspended this year but dividends paid to shareholders rose 30% to &#xA3;1,241 million, which is a 14% increase over total cash return to shareholders in the first half of 2008.  Last month's acquisition of Bentoel is reflected by the &#xA3;300 million outflow.</p>
          <p>And finally net debt, which at the start of the year was &#xA3;9.9 billion and was &#xA3;0.5 billion lower at the end of June, the principle movement being foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>That's the end of the presentation so I'll hand over to Jan who will start the Q&amp;A session.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ben.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the formal part of our presentation and as always, of course, we're now open to Qs and As.  When you ask your first question, can I just ask that in each instance you just identify who you are and the firm, the name of the firm that you represent?  And I will very briefly just identify the questions for the purpose of the webcast to make sure that people pick up your questions.  So who is to go first?  Yes, sir?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Erik Bloomquist, J.P. Morgan.  Two questions, firstly with respect to the transaction impact of approximately 90 sterling, about how much of that was in Eastern Europe? And then second question was with respect to the trademark amortization noted. What's the life on that?  And then does that imply that there is a finite life on those brands in Turkey?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions.  The one relates to the transaction-exchange impacts of &#xA3;90 million and the second one relates to the ongoing outlook for the trademark amortization charge.  Ben?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I'm not going to give you an absolute figure for Eastern Europe but the majority was Eastern Europe because you can't hedge for transaction exposure in Eastern Europe.  So you can assume that the big majority of the transactional exchange exposure was in Eastern Europe.  On the amortization of the brands, we allocate useful lives to the brands of anything between nought and 20 years.  So those &#x2013; that amortization charge will just flow through in future years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to follow up on that, does that then imply &#x2013; I would have thought that some of the brands would have had an infinite life, or indefinite life I suppose is the correct term.  So are these brands different from other brands that you've acquired previously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is more to do with IFRS than our true belief in the value of the brands I have to say.  So we've just taken the assumption that we got to allocate a expected useful life for them and then chosen to amortize those.  So it's between nought and 20 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Immediately, yes?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Adam Spielman from Citigroup.  Just to follow up on that question about Turkey, obviously you bought a business who was losing market share very rapidly, I mean multiple percentage points a year.  And my understanding is Tekel is still losing market share, but a little bit more slowly than before. I was wondering if that race of the Tekel brands, I was wondering whether you were happy with the trajectory?  Whether you could ever see the market share in Turkey, the whole group leveling out?  And just sort of commenting on your hopes for Turkey, I guess in the light of what's happened in, let's say, Italy, where the market share is still declining having bought a declining business at the beginning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My next question is for Paul, relates to the acquisition of the Tekel acquisition in Turkey and the fact that the company has been losing market share for many, many years and has been continuing to lose market share in the current period. And Paul, you're invited to comment on the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Well I think the question was more around Turkey, the &#x2013; we do anticipate that the Tekel brands will continue to decline.  That was part of the &#x2013; our acquisition assumptions.  We're doing slightly better than we actually had in terms of market share in our acquisition plan because of the reasons you've given, they're declining slightly less fast than we anticipated.  But yes, we did assume that the Tekel brands would decline and indeed some Tekel brands would decline to nothing.  So yes, we do anticipate the Tekel brands will decline.  At some point in the future though, once those have declined, they will get down to their core usage or expire.  And by then we hopefully will have built our international portfolio to the level that we want to do it, which is the primary reason why we bought Tekel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's David Hayes from Nomura.  Just in terms of the volume profile, it was flat in the first quarter, down about four, I guess, in the second quarter very broadly.  Is there anything driving that's changing?  I guess the question to a certain extent is, is the volume outlook for the rest year is it more minus four, is it more flat, what the dynamics are there?  And then the second question just on Western Europe, it's clouded obviously by the acquisition of STK.  It looks in the numbers, without making the adjustment, 18% volume, 18% price &#x2013; 18% sales increase so price is flat but obviously Western European price has been pretty good.  Can you just maybe break out what that looks like underlying basis?  Or what kind of pricing you're seeing in Western Europe?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions for Paul.  The first is dealing with the volume progression we saw in the first quarter compared to the volume development in the second quarter and what it might suggest for the full year.  And secondly, Paul, asked to comment on the price-volume relationships in Western Europe for the first six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Q1 versus Q2.  The first thing you've got to bear in mind is that there were very different comparators for 2008.  So we had a soft Q1 in 2008 and we had a very tough Q2 in 2008.  I mean tough in that it was good.  Tough in comparator terms, so there's that.  I think you've also got to bear in mind that we took some big price increases because of excise increases in the second quarter, which would have had an impact on volume.  Two thoughts I would give you with, in terms of net revenue in constant currency terms, net revenue growth in the first quarter was very similar to the net revenue growth in the second quarter. So what you're seeing which is quite big in volume terms, really gets evened out at net revenue.  And I think this is the thing we have to bear in mind.  I know everyone looks at volume, but we are focused on value and revenue.  And that was quite a good equation for us Q1, Q2.  The other thing to bear in mind on volume is that I would think that organic volume in the second half of the year will decline by 1 to 2%.  Does that &#x2013; I think that hopefully answers your question.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the Western Europe question where David also wanted some comment on Western Europe pricing, volume and how they play.  Do you want to talk to that, Ben?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean it's pretty hard to split out with the acquisition of ST.  The organic volume increase in Western Europe, I can give you.  It was 3%, yeah.  And I'm not sure we're going to be able to split out the price-volume mix in Western Europe, because of the ST impact in the turnover.</p>

Just to go back to volumes, I mean, obviously in the first half your premium was only down 1% and low price down five, which seems a bit odd given the fact that some of the markets have now downtraded.  Going forward can you explain why that's occurred?  And going forward do you think you'll still be able to sustain a better performance on the premium side than on the low-end side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This relates to the differences that we've seen in growth rates or trends with regard on the one hand premium volume and on the other hand the low price volume.  Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you've got to look at the brand and geographic mix here.  In the first half our volume declined by seven billion sticks.  Five billion of that was Russia.  So over 70% of our volume decline was Russia and that's a function of the Russian market decline, 3.5%, and a function of our market share decline of 2%, from 22 to 20.  75% of the market share decline was because of low-price brands in Russia.  So what you're looking at is a volume decline principally of low-price brands in a relatively low-margin market.  And when we took the price increase in Russia in the middle of last year when Russian pricing had not been really keeping up to the pace for five years, we thought that was a good value equation.  And that's why we took the decision.  Now so it's principally low-price volume, some of that driven by ourselves, some of that driven by downtrading and we think we can continue to do better on premium than we can on low price because of the innovation, because of the strength of the brands.  We've got an innovation program kicking off in the second quarter.  We put a fair amount of marketing oomph behind that in the second quarter and we should see the benefits of that coming through in the second half.</p>

          <p>Yeah, hi.  Chris Wickham from MainFirst.  In your presentations in Italy in 2005, which occurred in the immediate aftermath, I think, of Philip Morris making an acquisition in Indonesia.  I remember you &#x2013; members of the team making a comment that, that wasn't the sort of acquisition that you would make because you were concerned about the regulatory backdrop on the kretek side.  Could you perhaps give us some update on what in the last four years has changed in your opinion about the prospects for the regulatory outlook and for kreteks?</p>

          <p>Frankly what happened was, we were surprised when a major international competitor went in and bought a kretek company.  We had been wary of kretek because we thought that there was some health issues around kretek and that had come out of the people who control this in R&amp;D.  So we were surprised.  We then went back and spent a lot of money looking at the research again on kretek and came to the conclusion that actually we'd made the wrong call and that we'd got it wrong.  And so we've justified, after a lot of examination, justified kreteks to ourselves and therefore have decided to go into the kretek market.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Julian Hardwick from RBS.  Just back on the volume-price issue, most consumer products companies value volume more highly than revenue and clearly there is a trade-off here and a point at which you can't absorb too much volume decline.  Are there instances where you think you have priced too much at all and you need to revisit your pricing strategy going forward?  And secondly, can I just ask a question in terms of the dividend policy?  Your approach is to pay 65% of sustainable earnings, which you defined as adjusted earnings.  I wondered if you could just talk about how you look at the impact of currency in the context of what is sustainable earnings?  And should we be thinking more in terms of constant currency earnings, rather than currency-inflated earnings as the base on which you'll be driving your dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think I'll take the dividend question later.  But the first question Paul is asked to comment on is, again, the question of volume and price, the proposition being that many FMCG companies rate volume more important than the revenues and what- how do we see that trade-off?  And have you possibly over-played the pricing game at the expense of volume?  I think that's sort of your question.  Paul, why don't you take that and I'll pick up the dividend point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not indifferent to volume.  Volume is important to us, particularly quality volume.  Global Drive Brand volume, premium volume.  So I just want to make that point.  But occasionally you have to make trade-offs between volume and value and we tend to favor value.  Have we got pricing right?  It's a very good question.  And one that we are focused on and one that we want to make sure that we get right.  We think we've got it right.  There's nothing where we felt that we've overcooked it.  I think we got out of line on pricing in Russia, but that was simply because we believe the competition were very slow in following.  But they're now at the same price as we are in the market place.  And it's interesting that when that happened, our market share has now stabilized and indeed is beginning to tick up, but it took a while to get there.  So I don't think there's anywhere where we're saying, no, we've overcooked it on price, or indeed the competition who have led pricing and have overcooked it.  But it's something we have to watch for.  You can't get too far ahead of the consumer.  And we have to be careful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the dividend question, I think that to some extent what you're asking us is, when we set our dividend policies to pay out approximately 65% of sustainable earnings, how do we define sustainable earnings?  And I think my answer would be that what we've done for many, many years is to exclude from our reported earnings per share things that we really think are non-recurring.  And by that we mean things like what we use to call exceptional items, we're no longer allowed to call them that.  Exceptional items, non-recurring things, profits and losses on sales of assets or, for example, amortization of goodwill.  That is how we arrive at our adjusted EPS.</p>
          <p>In terms of currency, look, currencies fluctuate of course over time, we all know that.  But it's a very difficult game.  I mean, there may be some people around at the moment who suggest that sterling is possibly too weak.  I'm not going to express an opinion because I've been in this game long enough to know that whatever I say, I'm bound to be wrong.  So at some point there may be some sort of reversal.  That may be next year, it may be the year after, it may be in five years' time.  So to be quite clear, we're confirming to you that when we refer to sustainable earnings for the purposes of our dividend policy we would target that by reference to our adjusted earnings per share number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that adjusted for currency, or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not adjusted for currency, no.  It's currencies as we have translated them in conventional terms from local currencies into sterling.  We've of course not adjusted in that number, I think I want to be quite clear, we've not attempted to adjust so-called transactional costs.   Amongst others because accounting conventions don't really allow for that.  You get into subjectivity and so on and so forth.  So we've not done that.  So our adjusted EPS number in a given year is reported EPS adjusted for exceptionals and amortization of goodwill and so on, as they came out in the given period.  And that is the target by reference to which we will determine our dividend payout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In which case, given this is a year when you clearly benefited from currency, what happens as currency swings back?  Would you be prepared to allow your payout ratio to rise in that event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, in the long run I think this is purely speculative.  I think of course many things will determine our earnings next year and the year after.  Currency will be one but, you know, volumes and price and cost and other things will determine that as well.  Therefore I still think what we've got is a quite sensible policy.  And I think it's somewhat speculative.  I think what I am prepared to say to you, it would be difficult for us ever to cut our dividends, but that's not saying we will never be prepared to do so because I don't think I should say that.  But it would be hard for us to cut our dividend.  Investors in British American Tobacco love us for many reasons, amongst others because they can trust our dividend.  And our message to you today is that, to the extent we are able to say so, trust our dividend.  All right?  Right at the back?</p>

          <p>Curious about your free cash flow performance.  We had a ratio of 65% in the first half.  You alluded to some timing factors in your presentation so I would just want to compare full year kind of on a more normal conversion rate of close to 80% <mark type="inaudible" />...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  We like our free cash flow to be sort of 80 to 90% of our adjusted earnings.  The figure at the half year was artificially low because there was quite a big stock-build ahead of the price increase in Germany.  So normal service will be resumed at the full year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>John Fell with Deutsche Bank.  Couple of things, first of all you gave us a 2% organic decline figure for the first half.  Are you able to help us with what would have happened to revenue and profit from operations, excluding the currency and excluding the acquisitions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, we can't really split out the acquisitions, because they are fully integrated now.  So they're all BAT brands now.  If you want to get an order of magnitude, then I'd just ask you to look at the figures we did give with the second half last year results where we said the turnover of ST and Tekel was 410 million and the profit was 118 million.  That's the acquisition impact in the second half of last year.  The impact this year is just impossible to say because they are totally integrated into the BAT business.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a follow-on question on the interest charge as well.  If I take a crude average net debt second half last year and first half this year, and those net interest numbers you give us, it looks like average cost of debt was sort of high-fives second half last year and low-fours first half of this year.  Is there anything funny going on there or...?</p>

          <p>Our broad feel for the cost of debt was about 5.5% last year, coming down to about 5% for this year.  The interest-paid figures in terms of the cash flow was just the timing of interest payments, that's all.  There was a big coupon on one of the bonds.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Chas Mansell from Evolution.  On the Americas figure, obviously you've had the benefits of the early price increase in Brazil.  Seems as if most other places were on the soft side.  Could you try and give us a bit more detail about the exceptional side of the Brazilian performance in H1?  And on Turkey, there's been quite a big excise increase recently.  Could you update us on that and what's happening to pricing following that excise increase?  And you mentioned a new wave of innovation kicking off and marketing spend's been quite high this half.  Could you give us a sense for the phasing of marketing spend?  Is it going to be higher in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well can I quickly just summarize for the webcast.  Chas Mansell has asked three questions. The first relates to Brazil, the timing of the Brazil price increase, which was taken in anticipation of the excise increase, and what that means in terms of profitability for the first six months and going forward.  Second, we should deal with Turkey, the recently announced excise increase in Turkey and what that means for us.  And thirdly, Paul is asked to comment on marketing spend and the phasing of marketing spend in the first half and the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well, let me handle the first two and, Ben, perhaps you can have a look at Brazil.  On Turkey, there has been a significant excise increase in Turkey.  In terms of what that means for pricing, Chas , I don't really want to talk about that.  My lawyers start looking at me very strangely if I start talking pricing in a particular market.  So in terms of what it might mean for pricing I think I'm going to duck on that one.  But as a general rule we'd like to take prices up to cover excise increases.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well again, I would be talking about pricing in a particular market if I was to answer that question.  In terms of marketing spend, generally speaking we weight our marketing spend towards the second half of the year.  That will be the case this year, but it'll be less second-half-weighted this year because we have increased the spend reasonably significantly in the first half of this year.  And so there has been a significant increase in spend in the first half, but it'll still be back-weighted.</p>

          <p>The impact in Brazil, Ben?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well all on Brazil, as you know, we had a big excise increase in Brazil which we offset with pricing.  The profit performance from Brazil has been excellent in the first half of the year.  It will still be good in the second half of year, but not quite as good as it was in the first half of the year.  The other thing that helped Brazil, of course, was the fact that they export leaf in dollars and that's been quite helpful to Brazilian profits in the first half.</p>

          <p>Don't worry.  It's Adam Spielman again.  I'd like to ask a question about the impact, if any, of the recession on the business outside Russia.  You've given us the mix overall.  Are you saying &#x2013; Russia, it was very heavily-weighted, various factors in Russia.  I was wondering just roughly speaking, I think excluding Russia and, let's say, Ukraine from your business, what that split would be, premium versus mid versus low?  And I'm also interested to get your impression about whether the recession, if it is having an impact, if the impact over time is getting gradually worse as unemployment builds up?  Or whether it's beginning to pick up if there is &#x2013; the impact is beginning to get less mad as the economies pick up to some degree?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  Paul &#x2013; Adam Spielman wants Paul to talk about the impact on recession on the business and on volumes and not necessarily referring again to Russia and the Ukraine but elsewhere in the world.  And secondly, Paul is asked to take out his crystal ball and gaze into the rest of the year and speculate as to what the impact of recession might possibly be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was talking about the first half, whether the impact was getting, by the end of the first half was less bad, or the same or worse, as it was at the beginning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the markets are declining at a slightly higher rate as a result of the recession.  And I think that's entirely to be expected.  I think a lot of it is driven by unemployment. Everyone's got their pet figure that they look at. I was talking to a senior banker the other day and he said it's all down to house prices in the U.S.  You know, that is the key indicator.  I think the key indicator is unemployment.  And I think from a consumer point of view and from a downtrading point of view, its unemployment.  And the thing to bear in mind about unemployment is that it lags.  So even if GDP starts growing and even if the stock markets starts growing, if you've got significant unemployment, consumer disposable income is going to be impacted negatively.</p>
          <p>Secondly, even if unemployment starts to reduce, assuming that those people unemployed were borrowing money when they were unemployed, I think you've got another lag on that as well as they try to repay.  So I think we've got, from a consumer goods point of view, fast moving consumer goods point of view, I think we've got a way to go before we start pulling out of this recession.  And I would think the second half of 2010 is the earliest and we're probably into the first half of 2011 before we start pulling out of it.  And I think that's going to have an impact on all consumer goods.  I don't want to speak for others but I think it will.  And I think it will impact on us.  I mean, just bear in mind that &#x2013; just to try and put that into context, supposing you've got a smoker and he smokes five packs of 20 a week.  Okay?  Five packs of 20 a week.  So that's around 14 cigarettes a day on average and that's relatively low against the world average of &#x2013; average cigarettes per day.  Now supposing he just chooses to smoke one less on a Thursday and one less on a Sunday.  You're down 2%.  So it doesn't take much.  And I think that the markets are going to be, in volume terms, soft.  And they're going to be soft for a while yet.  Now is that catastrophic?  No.  Can that not be overcome by pricing?  No.  But I think we've just got to adjust ourselves to the fact that in volume terms the markets are down and will continue to be soft.</p>

          <p>If you come back to the business, ex-Russia and Ukraine, I mean roughly, I'm not expecting you to quote numbers.  Do you think mix, you would say in general, mix has deteriorated?  So premiums have done worse than let's say low stuff?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean this is the point I'm trying to make.  If you exclude Eastern Europe, where we have seen some downtrading, and we all know its Russia.  I mean Ukraine, for example, perversely, which is an absolute basket case from an economic point of view, if you take super-premium and premium together in the Ukraine, it's growing.  In Malaysia, premium is growing, in Brazil premium is growing.  So I think there's a lot of mileage left in premium and &#x2013; as our figures demonstrate.</p>

          <p>Let me just talk about marketing expenditure.  I mean, when pinned up against the wall with hands around our throat, we've admitted to a 45/55 split.  As a rough order of magnitude, so I wouldn't take that as that's what it is every year.  We don't do our marketing against some sort of mechanistic, we can only spend 45% of our total spend in the first half.  It's about two point difference this year versus last year.  But I wouldn't &#x2013; so that would get you to a 47 but you'd probably be wrong on the number because that 45 isn't.</p>

          <p>Just on volumes in Eastern Europe, we had a volume decline of seven and a bit percent in the first quarter and nine and a bit percent in the second quarter, which came out at the 8.5% for the first half.  And Africa/Middle East organic volume was tremendous.  It was up 14% in the first quarter, up 8% in the second quarter and up about 11% for the first half.</p>

          <p>Hi.  David Hayes again.  Just on the migration of Global Drive Brands, it's 50% that disappeared, it was 25 I think you said in 2008.  Clearly the growth base changes that as well, but is there is a move to quicken migration to those brands?  And therefore, do we see more cost saving potentially coming through in the next 18 months to two years, going back to your point about offsets maybe to the slowdown?  And then the second question was just on Russia.  We should ideally have visibility on Russian tax, but there's been a couple of rumors recently around indexation of that tax outline in the next few years and also there was a rumor yesterday that the government were going to re-neg and change the numbers anyway.  Have you got any visibility on the stability of that tax level that's been booked out in the next two or three years?  And whether there's a risk of that going up, you think?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So migration of Global Drive Brands.  And the impact of migration on the growth of the Global Drive Brands and then the outlook for that.  And secondly a question on the Russian tax developments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to speed up migration in order to achieve cost synergies.  Migration is very much a case-by-case, brand-by-brand, market-by-market debate.  It's down to a lot of research as to whether the brand that you're &#x2013; whether you can migrate the brands that you want to migrate.  So they're very much on a case-by-case thing rather than a sort of policy to try and migrate.  In fact I would think that the level of migration will start to tail off rather than speed up as we run through the opportunities that are available to us.  That's on migration.  Russian tax, I mean, yeah, you get a rumor a day out of Russia on tax.  I have to say that, talking to our Russian management, they're not particularly worried about it and that they think it's quite manageable. There's nothing there that's bothering them at the moment, any more than usual anyway.</p>

          <p>Hi, I'm Eileen Khoo from Morgan Stanley.  One question on emerging markets.  I mean, you've always talked about how there's the long-term pricing potential in emerging markets because cigarettes are much more affordable compared to other consumer goods.  I just wondered whether, given the trends towards tax hikes that we've seen, whether you feel this is still the case?  Or whether your pricing power is perhaps somewhat limited in the next one or two years or so because of the economy and also because of the tax increases?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So your question relates to pricing power but do you mean the impact of tax just in the emerging markets pricing power or globally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, emerging markets specifically but you can comment on the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  No, I understand the point and it's a fair question.  I really have to go back to the answer that I gave before.  You have to take it on a market-by-market basis.  We're very alert to just how much you can push prices but there are no red lights flashing that says okay boys this is as far as we can take it. I think there's still opportunity for price increases.  As some of you know I've said for many years, it's not the consumer that's stopping price increases it's industry behavior that's stopping price increases.  And thankfully though for the last two years that hasn't been the case.  But I still think that there's room to move and particularly in some markets there's room to move on pricing.  For example, in Japan.  So I don't think we're up against any sort of buffers or constraints on pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just following on from that, could you comment a bit about Poland, because that's maybe one market where pricing hasn't worked?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it hasn't worked because the Polish government has to produce a certain excise rate in euros.  And as the Polish zloty has devalued they've had to keep increasing the excise rate in Polish zloty's to maintain the requirements at a euro rate.  And that has pushed prices up a lot.  That's not an altogether bad thing because it means that the German consumer is now buying in Germany rather than in Poland.  And therefore you've had a decrease in the amount of duty not paid, consumed in Germany, which is generally good news.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on PMI, they've set up innovations or pack variations or efforts in innovation.  Do you see they're making in-roads in terms of market share?  Or do you see it more as a &#x2013; do you see it as a risk or is it a possible signal that they're competing on innovation not on price?  Could you elaborate your thoughts maybe on the new dynamic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's good that Philip Morris are competing on innovation rather than price.  We tend to think that that's the right way to do it anyway.  And that's the model that we've been employing so it's good to see that Philip Morris are doing that.  I think they have done some innovations which have been successful, particularly in Japan and Korea.  So they have stepped up to the plate and they've had some good innovations which have brought to bear and that's given them some share growth.  And we're just delighted to meet them on the pitch.</p>

          <p>Hi, sorry, just two other quick ones.  More speculations, sorry. about Souza Cruz minority.  I know when you did Chile you said that you'd looked at that before and didn't feel that was something that was sensible or valuable.  Is that &#x2013; has that position changed at all, or whatever comment you can make around that?  And then just in terms of cost saves, if I broadly divide by 10.5 years, are we looking at that kind of cost-save base?  I know you don't talk about cost saves generally at the half year, but is there any kind of one-off big cost saving or less cost saving in the first half that we should know about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions for Ben, the first he is to comment on speculation with regard to Souza Cruz minorities and minorities elsewhere in the world.  And secondly the cost savings.  Ben?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  And just on cost savings, the answer's, no.  They &#x2013; we'll talk more in the full year.  I'm trying to guide people away from the cost savings, anyway, just look at the margin.  So I anticipate a growth in the margin at the full year, but there are no big one-offs in costs in the first half relative to the second half.  On minorities, I mean we continue to look at minorities all the time.  And if there's ever a situation when the stars align we might do something, but there's nothing particularly special out there at the movement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple on Canada, really.  First of all, you paid quite a lot of money as an industry in Canada trying to tackle illicit trade, but have you actually done anything about that, because it seems volumes are still dropping?  And secondly, just again in Canada, they were obviously one of the first to promise us a brand in store advertising in-store brand.  Did you do your own store distribution over there?  Has that caused any noticeable change in trends in Canada, or not really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did pay over some money to the Canadian government, you're quite right.  Difficult to see any change in behavior in terms of restricting the amount of product flowing out of the First Nation reserves.  I think that's about as far as I can say on that one.  And in terms of, yeah, the point is that we have now had stable overall market share in Canada for the last four quarters, which, whilst I'm not calling time or stumps on Canada, after four years of market share decline it's rather nice.  And I think a good portion of that improved performance i.e. stability, is down to the fact when we have DSD.  But we're not satisfied with that, it would be nice to start growing share a little and I think that's where our direct store distribution will help.  And in terms of the display ban, as you know, I think that if you're able to talk directly to the retailer who can talk to consumers, I think that's an advantage where you have display bans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, Nico again.  You previously alluded that leaf costs are going up but there's been a lot of changes in commodity costs et cetera.  Would you mind giving us update on the movements in your costs?  And maybe relate that to how do see the gross margin panning out for '09?  And is there potential for opening in the gross margin in '010?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I mean we said this time last year that we were facing quite a large increase in costs, leaf costs particularly.  The good news is that the crop that's just coming in at the moment, that we'll be using next year, the price we expect to be broadly flat.  So that's good news for next year.  You've got to remember of course in costs in the second half, they'll be slightly higher than the first half because we hedged some of our transactional effects cost in the first half.  So we do expect to see a slightly higher cost base in the second half of this year than the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that going to be offset by price as price relating to costs increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we can.  And then FX of course, if we keep the exchange rates as they were at the half year and flow them through for the full year, we had a 10% gain on FX in the first half.  It looks like we'll have about a 6% gain in the second half, so around 8% for the full year. So the second half of this year won't be quite as good as the first half of this year in terms of FX gains.  So I'd guide you to 8% FX benefit on profit for the whole of the year in 2009.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think I should close.  Can I just say to you I hope that what you've seen this morning is a business that continues to do really very well.  I think in a quite uncertain world in economic and trading terms, this business is in good shape.  And I hope what you've seen is a considerable degree of confidence in our ongoing ability to deliver a good earnings growth over the medium to long term.  And in particular also for this year I think we're well set to deliver another good set of numbers at the end of the year.  Thank you for coming.</p>
