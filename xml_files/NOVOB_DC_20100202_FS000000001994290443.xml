          <p>Good day and welcome to the Novo Nordisk Financial Year 2009 Results Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, CEO. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and welcome ladies and gentlemen to this Novo Nordisk conference call regarding our 2009 full-year result, which was released earlier today. I'm Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo Nordisk. With us I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer, and present are also our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release is available on our homepage novonordisk.com, along with the slides that we will be using for this conference call. The conference call is as usual scheduled to last approximately one hour. And I'd like to start with the presentation, as outlined on slide number two. The Q&amp;A session will begin in about 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number three. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements, such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual result to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, please see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation. Note as mentioned, that the conference call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available on Novo Nordisk's website, after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number four. We're satisfied with the sales results in 2009 with the sales growth of 12% reported and 11% in local currencies. This performance was driven by continuous penetration of our modern insulins in all key markets. North America continues to expand its position as the largest sales region, <mark type="inaudible" /> with sales growth of 21% reported and correspondingly 15% in local currencies. However, International Operations is the fastest growing region with 19% growth in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Within R&amp;D, we have achieved numerous significant milestones since the release of our full-year result 2008. Victoza has been approved across the trial markets, the U.S., Europe and Japan. The commercial launch is ongoing and progressing well in Europe, while we are looking forward to launch Victoza both in the United States and in Japan.</p>
          <p>We have initiated the Phase III program for our two new generations of insulins, which we now call Degludec and DegludecPlus respectively. This is the largest clinical trial program ever to be conducted within diabetes and we expect to enroll more than 10,000 patients in total.</p>
          <p>Further, we have started our first trials with oral insulin and oral GLP-1. We still have many challenges to overcome, however, we are encouraged by the progress made by our research and development teams during the past couple of years. A cornerstone in our business model is the financial performance we achieved in a manner, which is environmentally and socially responsible. In this context, I'm happy to note that we have achieved our 2014 target for reduction of CO2 emission already in 2009, a target we set back in 2004. More specifically, we have in the last five years reduced our CO2 emission by 30%, despite a significant increase in production volume. The realization of this target five years ahead of plans is a result of energy savings in all production facilities globally.</p>
          <p>This year, we also launched the "Changing Diabetes in Children" program. Today, the program has enrolled more than 400 children with Type 1 diabetes in six developing countries. The promising start of a program, which eventually is expected to include around 10,000 children.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the financials. Operating profit grew 21% reported and 15% adjusted for the impact from currencies and non-recurring cost in 2008, related to the closure of our pulmonary diabetes project. Our free cash flow in 2009 was DKK 12.3 billion, compared to DKK 11 billion in 2008. The high cash flow is driven by higher net profit and lower income tax paid, countered by increased capital expenditure during 2009. 2010, we expect our solid performance to continue. We expect sales growth of six to 10% and a growth of operating profit of 10%. We expect growth levels to be similar for both local and reported currencies. Later in this call, Jesper will add some details to our guidance for 2010.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number five. Our portfolio of modern insulin continues to show a strong performance overall. 2009, the portfolio of modern insulins was the main growth driver, accounting for more than 80% of total sales growth in local currencies. Biopharmaceuticals grew 11% reported and 9% in local currencies. Contributing the most to our sales NovoSeven, which increased 11% in Danish kroner and 10% in local currencies. Sales growth of NovoSeven was primarily realized in Europe and International Operations. Also our growth hormone franchise showed solid performance with 14% sales growth in Danish kroner and 10% in local currencies. Novo Nordisk remains the second largest company in the global growth hormone market with 24% volume market share.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the regional split of sales. 2009, sales growth was realized in all regions. North America was the main contributor with 48% share of growth measured in local currencies and our North American sales region continues to expand in leadership position. International Operations in Europe contributed 32 and 19% respectively of total sales growth. The European sales growth was impacted by currently low volume growth at the insulin market assumed to be a temporary nature and linked to the launch of the incretin mimetics in Europe.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in Japan during 2009 has been around 1% measured in local currencies. The growth of sales continues to be impacted by a change in the underlying insulin market dynamics, where growth of the basal segment, in particular modern insulin, has accelerated at the expense of the premixed segment where Novo Nordisk has its strongest position.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the insulin market dynamics. Around 59% of the global insulin market measured by volume has now been converted to modern insulins compared to 55% same time last year. The conversion trend is stable and looks set to continue in all markets globally. Of the many markets, the U.S. still leading the conversion with almost 70% of the insulin market being converted. In Europe, the modern insulins which represent more than 60% of all the insulins, whereas in markets like China a significant opportunity remains in converting patients where today only around 20% are using modern insulins. The conversion is driving the value growth of the insulin market along with the ongoing conversion to prefilled devices.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk continues to gain market share within the modern insulin market segment. Novo Nordisk's market share in the modern insulin segment is now 45% measured in volume. Novo Nordisk continues to be the only company that markets a full range of modern insulins with short-acting, premixed and long-acting modern insulins in advance and user friendly delivery systems such as, the easy-to-use disposable FlexPen.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on our global roll-out of Victoza. The roll-out of Victoza is progressing well. In Europe, Victoza has been commercially launched in nine markets, the latest of which are Greece, Sweden, The Netherlands and Switzerland. We expect the European roll-out to continue through 2010 and with the recent approvals in United States and Japan we're eager to start roll-out outside of Europe. In the countries where Victoza was first launched, market penetration continues to improve and Victoza has now obtained market leadership in Germany and in Denmark.</p>
          <p>In Germany, Victoza has captured more than 1.5% of the total diabetes market and successfully expanded the GLP-1 market to more than 3% of the total diabetes care market. In the U.K, Victoza is also gaining margins now close to 1% of the total diabetes market. This should be seen in the context where we continue to expand primary care trust formulary access for Victoza in the U.K.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Mads, who will give you an update on the development within our clinical pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to slide nine for an overview of the R&amp;D pipeline within diabetes and obesity.</p>
          <p>Significant regulatory progress has been made for Victoza. The first once-daily human GLP-1 analogue that was previously known under the INN name, Liraglutide. As announced on the 20th and 26th of January respectively, Victoza has now received approval both in Japan and the U.S. Following this, Victoza has now been approved in all of the trial markets within a timeframe of only 20 months, which is setting a new standard for regulatory approvals in the major territories. In the U.S., Victoza is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. A detailed update of the FDA approval was recently provided at our conference call on January 26.</p>
          <p>We're very excited to be able to launch Victoza in the U.S. in the weeks to come and we'll also continue to work diligently with the FDA to ensure that the post-marketing requirements, including the cardiovascular LEAD trial and other studies are addressed by Novo Nordisk.</p>
          <p>As regards to the benefits and risks of the incretin family, I'd like to point your attention to a Review Article in the February issue of Diabetes Care in which a number of authors including Dan Drucker and several past and present ADA Presidents summarized today's knowledge. One of the conclusions in the review article is that the sustained GLP-1 receptor activation induced by long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists leads to rodent C-cell changes that are not replicated in monkeys and that in man, further studies of long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists are warranted to allow human relevance.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Japan, Victoza is the first GLP-1 analogue to be approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and the awarded indication covers monotherapy and combination therapy for sulfonylurea in Type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk expects to launch Victoza in Japan in the first half of 2010, upon completion of price negotiations.</p>
          <p>Results from clinical trial extensions of LEAD 3, comparing Victoza to a sulphonylurea in monotherapy and the phase III B trial comparing Victoza to a DPPIV inhibitor, confirm both the superiority and sustainability of the HbA1c reduction and weight loss that was seen in the main study periods with Victoza. The trial extensions have now led to treatment periods of three years and 52 weeks in the two trials, respectively.</p>
          <p>The Phase III A programs, BEGIN and BOOST for the two new generation ultra-long-acting insulins, Degludec and DegludecPlus, respectively, continue to progress according to plan. More than 4,200 patients have by now been recruited in Phase III A. The ongoing BEGIN program now also includes trial comparing Degludec with sitagliptin in the insulin na&#xEF;ve Type 2 diabetes patients. Likewise, the BOOST program now includes two trials comparing once-daily injection of DegludecPlus with a once-daily injection of insulin glargine in patients with Type 2 diabetes, who are insulin na&#xEF;ve or already treated with insulin, respectively. Further trials are expected to be initiated during the first-half of this year.</p>
          <p>With focus on harnessing the beneficial actions of the two natural glucose regulating hormones, GLP-1 and insulin in one product, Novo Nordisk has recently initiated a Phase I study of the combination product of insulin Degludec and Victoza. From a therapeutics standpoint, such a product may be seen to improve even further on the efficacy that can be reached for a GLP-1 based treatment or alternatively as in allowing insulin therapy with less risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia.</p>
          <p>To further improve the future treatment outcomes and convenience in the pharmacological management of diabetes, the development of tailor-made proteins for oral administration has been a long-standing Novo Nordisk aspiration. The biggest challenge in developing proteins for oral delivery is to achieve sufficient uptake of the drug into the body. Over the last few years, we've developed strong expertise within the discovery of stable insulin and GLP-1 analogues that are optimized for the oral administration route and we have recently forged partnerships with the protein formulation technology providers, Emisphere Technologies and Merrion Pharmaceuticals.</p>
          <p>Based on these activities, Novo Nordisk now feels ready to overcome the hurdles related to protein degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and subsequent lack of absorption into the circulation. The first Phase I clinical trial with the Novo Nordisk insulin analogue designed for oral administration has been initiated with the aim of investigating the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics and dynamics in healthy volunteers as the well as in people with Type 1 and 2 diabetes. The trial is planned to enroll about eight subjects. Within oral GLP-1, Novo Nordisk has initiated a Phase I clinical trial with a long-acting human GLP-1 analogue. The objective of the trial is to investigate the safety, tolerability and bioavailability in about 155 healthy volunteers</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk has also initiated a Phase I trial with the compound NN9161 to be developed for the treatment of obesity. This trial will investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and potential signs of efficacy in approximately 140 obese, but otherwise healthy volunteers.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an overview of the haemophilia pipeline. In June 2009, the European label for NovoSeven RT was updated to reflect that safety and efficacy has not been established outside the approved indications for the drug. On 15th of January this year, the US FDA approved an update to the NovoSeven RT label. A boxed warning was added stating that serious arterial and venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events are associated with its use outside of licensed indications. The label change was initiated by Novo Nordisk, as part of routine periodic safety updates. As regards to the portfolio, the Phase I, II and III pipeline within haemophilia is progressing according to plan.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide, for a wrap-up on the pipeline of other Biopharmaceuticals. Both the U.S. and European regulatory agencies have now approved Vagifem 10 microgram for local treatment of vaginal atrophy. The product represents a reduced strength of the already-approved vaginal estrogen product, Vagifem 25 micrograms. The introduction of a lower dose of Vagifem is in line with the recommendations from the International Menopause Society, the North American Menopause Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Novo Nordisk expects to launch Vagifem 10 micrograms in the first quarter of this year in the U.S. and in the third quarter in Europe.</p>
          <p>To strengthen its activities within inflammation, Novo Nordisk has in-licensed a fully-human anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibody developed by ZymoGenetics, as well as a broad intellectual property rights platform covering the field of anti-IL-21 monoclonal antibodies. Development of this pre-IND candidate for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases is expected to lead to initiation of Phase a, Phase 1 trial late this year.</p>
          <p>With that, over to Jesper for an update on the financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to the next slide. We're satisfied with the financial results for 2009. Total sales growth was 12% as reported and 11% in local currencies. Growth was realized within both diabetes care and biopharmaceuticals and the primary goal contribution originated from the modern insulins.</p>
          <p>The gross margin for 2009 increased to 79.6%, compared with 77.8 in 2008. This improvement primarily reflects improved production efficiency, higher average selling prices in the U.S. and an 0.4 percentage point positive contribution from currencies. In 2009, total non-production related operating cost increased by 12%. Around 1.5 percentage point of the increase in non-production related operating costs reflected the higher value of key currencies versus the Danish kroner in 2009 compared to '08.</p>
          <p>The underlying development in non-production-related operating costs relates to the expanded sales forces especially in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Japan and China, supplemented by a stable level for research and development costs. The unchanged absolute level for research and development costs primarily reflects in non-recurring cost in 2008 related to the discontinuation of all pulmonary diabetes projects and also discontinuation of the growth hormone therapy project in patients with low serum albumin in dialysis. This was matched by costs related to the late-stage development of the new insulins Degludec and DegludecPlus, which we formerly knew as SIBA and SIAC in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in 2009 increased by 21% to almost DKK 15 billion compared to 2008 and is thus slightly higher than the latest guidance for growth in reported operating profit of around 18%. Net financials showed a net expense of 945 million, compared to a net income of 322 million in 2008. For 2009, the foreign exchange result was an expense of 751 million compared to the income of 141 million in 2008. This development reflect losses on foreign exchange hedging of especially U.S. dollar and Japanese yen, primarily due to the appreciation of these currencies versus Danish kroner in 2009, compared to the exchange rate prevailing in 2008.</p>
          <p>The realized effective tax rate for 2009 was 23%, leading to an increase in net profit of 12% to DKK 10.8 billion. Reflecting the impact from the completion of our four-year 19 billion share repurchase program in 2009, earnings per share increased by 15% to DKK 17.82 per share. The number of full-time employees increased by 7% to nearly 29,000. This development reflects international expansion of sales forces in key markets such as U.S., U.K., Germany and China, as well as manning for international expansion of the manufacturing sites.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. The significant free cash flow for 2009 of 12.3 billion has enabled us to complete the share repurchase program, while at the same time propose an increase in the dividend for 2009 compared to 2008. The suggested dividend for 2009 is DKK 7.5 per share, equaling a payout ratio of just above 40%, which we believe is comparable to the payout ratio of our peers in the healthcare industry. For 2010, we will initiate a share repurchase program of DKK 7.5 billion, which in line with previous years, will be executed through a Safe Harbor program with an international financial institution.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on the currency development. The development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner is shown on this slide. While the U.S. dollar continued to depreciate during the fourth quarter, it has recently appreciated again versus Danish kroner. In contrast, the Japanese yen has been fairly stable. The expected annual impact of &#x2013; on operating profit of a 5% movement in the currencies as stated on the slide has been updated to reflect the expected impact in 2010.</p>
          <p>For 2010 the annual impact of a 5% movement in the U.S. dollar is around DKK 580 million and for the Chinese Yuan, the annual impact is around DKK 100 million on operating profit. Therefore from a Danish kroner or even a euro perspective, the effect or combined effect of a 5% movement in the U.S. dollar amounts to a currency impact of DKK 680 million on operating profit.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial outlook for 2010. Novo Nordisk expects sales growth in 2010 of six to 10% measured in local currencies. It is based on expectations of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk's key strategic products within diabetes care, including continued global roll out of Victoza and biopharmaceuticals, as well as expectations of continued intense competition, potential generic competition to Novo Nor branding in EU and U.S., as well as adoption of a healthcare reform in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rates versus Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is now expected to be at a similar level to the growth rate measured in local currencies. For 2010, the growth in operating profit is expected to be around 10% measured in local currencies. The forecast reflects continued improvement of the gross margin, increased spending level for R&amp;D activities, primarily related to insulin Degludec and DegludecPlus and higher license fee and other operating income. Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the reported operating profit growth is now expected to be at a level similar to the growth rate measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>But let me highlight that given the development in key currencies during 2009, a higher share of the 2010 growth of reported sales and operating profit is expected to be realized in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>For 2010, Novo Nordisk expects a net financial expense of around DKK 100 million. The current expectation primarily reflects Novo Nordisk's share of losses in associated companies.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for 2010 is expected to be maintained at around 23%. Capital expenditure is expected to be around DKK 3.5 billion, primarily related to the new insulin formulation and filling plant in China and additional diabetes device capacity in Denmark. Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are around 2.7 billion, and free cash flow is expected to be around DKK 12 billion.</p>
          <p>All of the above expectation are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not significantly alter the business conditions for Novo Nordisk during 2010 and that currency exchange rate, especially the U.S. dollar remains at the &#x2013; remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner during the remaining part of 2010.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation of the financial results. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen will now moderate the Q&amp;A session. Please note that there will be a maximum limit of two questions per individual with the objective of allowing as many conference participants as possible to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper and Mads. Please note, ladies and gentlemen that this conference is being taped and the replay will remain available as mentioned on our website and, operator, we are now ready to take the first question, please.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We'll now move to our first question, which comes from Richard Vosser from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. Richard Vosser from JP Morgan. I wonder &#x2013; a couple of questions on Liraglutide, please. I wonder if you could disclose your sales of Liraglutide in Europe for 2009 and whether you could explain how your guidance changed following Victoza's approval in Japan and obviously in the U.S? And whether you could comment on &#x2013; I suppose the effect from both the sales guidance and operating profit guidance, whether you've built any extra cost assumptions in there, I suppose?</p>
          <p>And then just one on the pipeline, which is I wondered if you could explain what sort of peptide NN91, 61 the obesity product is? Should we exclude that this is a GLP-1 based approach and I wonder if you could go into a bit more detail of the rationale of your development process there? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Lars Rebien here. I'll try to give you a little bit of light on the Liraglutide or Victoza. We prefer not to disclose specifically sales of Victoza in the first quarters and you should not expect that we will so either in 2010 because the numbers are so heavily impacted on launches in individual contracts and pipelines filling. So, but they're rather modest, as you can expect given the size of the markets where we have launched the product so far but more importantly I think is the penetration and the quick uptick that we have seen in the markets where we have launched.</p>
          <p>In regards to the guidance on 2010 sales, you notice that we have narrowed the range in from five to 10 to six to 10 and that is a reflection of some more visibility on our ability to launch Victoza in the U.S. giving us visibility of a full-year on the market in the U.S. and that is what has impacted the top-line guidance. Jesper, do you want to comment on the operating profit guidance, what has &#x2013; what has happened between Q3 and what we are guiding now and then Mads we're going to quiz you on this acronym NN91 whatever regulator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first as Lars alluded to, we're basically taking the bottom of the sales range out, now the 5% is no longer relevant. So, we have the six to 10% range. We are certainly assuming that within this range that we have a U.S. healthcare reform that could have a significant impact on the numbers also. In terms of cost for Victoza, we have included cost in our guidance of having a operating profit of around 10% and if you want to get from the original at least 5% operating profit growth that we stipulated in local currencies in connection with Q3.</p>
          <p>That was the minimum level of operating profit we would have if we were at the bottom range of the turnover guidance. The guidance we're giving now is assuming what operating profit growth we will have at the mid-interval of our sales guidance and you should also note that we have now expected a slightly higher level of other operating income, now we are predicting that other operating income will be in the ballpark of 500 million, partly reflecting slightly higher royalty income in 2010 and the years beyond.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper. And then Mads, onto 9161, can you or will you &#x2013; should you disclose the nature of the molecule?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I &#x2013; I can say what it is not. It is not a GLP-1 analogue. It is a stabilized human variant using a kind of Novo Nordisk technologies for stabilization of peptides and proteins. An analogue of an anorexigenic peptide hormone that plays a major role &#x2013; or is believed to play a major role in the natural homeostasis of human feeding behavior.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes now from Michael Novod from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. It's Michael Novod from Handelsbanken. Could you try to give us some flavor on the initial feedback you have from key team leaders, particularly doctors in the U.S.? Because there's so much say different opinions traveling around regarding the Victoza label in the U.S. So, if you could give some flavor on what you hear? And then secondly could you try to elaborate a bit more on the subpoena from the Department of Defense in the U.S., try to give us some feeling of what are we dealing with here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Michael. And Mads Krogsgaard, what is your initial feedback from KOLs in the U.S. given that &#x2013; that we now know the label of Victoza in the U.S and compare that to &#x2013; with the situation perhaps in Europe and in Japan. And then, Jesper, if you'd care comment as much as you can on the subpoena on NovoSeven from the Department of Defense office.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well I think maybe the most unbiased way to do it is really to reflect a little bit upon the couple of both review articles and editorials that have just emerged this week in the Diabetes Care journal. They have been crafted by both a number of past presidents of the ADA and the current one plus President Drucker from Toronto and they pretty much reflect kind of the perception that I have and we have from a number of KOLs, that we are intact with on a very regular basis in the U.S. and that is &#x2013; that the class of GLP-1 agonists as you can read in this issue essentially in their view has a clearly beneficial ratio between the benefits and the risks of the compounds.</p>
          <p>They actually see that the long acting GLP-1 agonists do have this propensity to stimulate rodent C-cells whereas they do not do so in monkeys and they feel that there is still for &#x2013; due to the sustained activation of the GLP-1 receptor by the long-acting class of GLP-1s. They essentially feel that we need to even further solidify the human safety and that is what we're doing as part of the PMR and so on.</p>
          <p>So, if you want my personal view, I think due to the LEAD program and the many, many clinical studies and investigators that we have had on board in our Phase III A and B programs, we are in a situation where each individual KOL is pretty much able to make up his or her own mind as to the merits of this product. Of course, they will look into the label and so on, but they have a pretty good feel for what Victoza does in terms of benefit risk profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And any comments on the Europe and Japan in that regard, Mads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Europe and Japan, of course we have the direct hands-on user kind of experience and quite frankly we had a major meeting with 600 diabetologists in Paris a couple of months ago and it was really, really nice to see how they felt about the product and how they were using it and titrating in the events of transient nausea they had made up their own ways of giving about this and so on. And the same goes for Japan, where we don't have it on the market yet, but we have very nice feedback. We are the first GLP-1 analogue to &#x2013; or agonist to come to the Japanese market and there is a lot of excitement out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, basically, at the black box warning in the U.S. market is obviously not a positive. It's going to mean that it's a little bit more up-hill to expand the whole &#x2013; the market for GLP-1s in the U.S. Long-term, what is going to be decisive for us is what is going to be the label of other sustained release versions of GLP-1 from our competitors and you can appreciate that from our stance and scientifically we believe that they would be having the same block &#x2013; box warning as we have. But of course the market build-out is going to be difficult.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we received in January a subpoena from the Department of Defense, which directed Novo Nordisk to provide document related to NovoSeven. Although, we do not know the specific reason or scope of this investigation, the thing we are aware of is that the U.S. army doctors have at their discretion been using NovoSeven and the U.S. army had been purchasing NovoSeven for trauma use within soldiers. But we do not know the specific scope for this investigation and hence we cannot predict the outcome of the investigation, nor the timeline or financial consequences for this investigation. So, that is as much clarity I can provide at this stage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, then, this is Lars Rebien here and the interesting thing is we have not been marketing the product to the Department of Defense, so that was a program which was adopted based on a presidential waiver of the label, restrictions that are on NovoSeven in United States. So, we need more clarity on that and we &#x2013; hopefully we can update you next time we have an earnings release. Next question please?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello gentlemen, Henrik Simonsen, Enskilda. Two questions from my side. I think K&#xE5;re mentioned about a half-year ago your ideal speed &#x2013; he would be willing to comment on the Victoza launch, so to speak in Europe after six months and we've had Victoza now in the German market for about six months, would you be willing to comment on how you see the uptake and how much switching you're seeing from Byetta and how doctors &#x2013; German doctors have perceived this thyroid risk?</p>
          <p>And second question, I guess to Jesper, if you would comment &#x2013; give a little bit guidance on the cost structure of 2010. I noted that sales and distribution costs shot up to about 32% of sales in the fourth quarter against 28 in the third quarter. And admin costs were down year-on-year in the fourth quarter. So, could you provide a little bit of clarity on cost structure guidance for 2010 please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Henrik this is Lars Rebien here and Mads, so can you qualitatively talk a little bit about the adoption in Germany and obviously we are not disclosing the specific sales numbers, but nonetheless relatively speaking into other products, to the competitors in the marketplace, what are you seeing and where are we getting the patients from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, first of all we can say that the trend that we also reported on at the EASD conference call where the most of the patients we were taking in Germany essentially were not coming from Byetta switches but approximately maybe one out of three did so. We have seen a consistence let's say market penetration where the most of the patients are coming from oral antidiabetics.</p>
          <p>We are actually also seeing some patients switching from insulin, but the majority is still coming from oral antidiabetics and we are growing the market, you can say. To some extent maybe one third or so to the &#x2013; at the expense of Byetta but mostly by market expansion. And you can say at this point it seems as if the target group that we are mostly hitting is the ones that are failing on one or two OADs which is essentially also the main target for this one, the GLP-1. So we are consisting of &#x2013; we are continuing the performance that we alluded to at the EASD Meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Jesper, cost guidance or the cost structure, rather, expectations for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lars. The first thing of course will be a continuation of our expansion of gross margin. We continue to expect that we will improve our gross margin also going into 2010. Our guidance is a growth &#x2013; an improvement in the gross margin between 50 to 100 basis points in 2010 over 2009, no currency effect expected at present. In terms of the S&amp;P ratio, we will expect a ratio around 30%. I do note that we have expanded our sales forces in all the major markets and hence do not expect any significant expenses &#x2013; expansion of our sales force in 2010 in the markets where we launch or rollout Victoza.</p>
          <p>In terms of R&amp;D, clearly a slightly disappointing number for us with the 15.4% R&amp;D ratio in 2009 and we expect to better that in terms of investments in 2010 and I would anticipate the R&amp;D ratio to be in the ballpark 16 to 17% of sales in 2010. So, that should be well up by around a percentage point or so. In terms of admin costs, we continue to improve the admin to sales ratio and I would predict that the admin ratio would be in the range of five to 5.5% or so.</p>
          <p>Other operating income as I noted before, we have made some agreements regarding intellectual property that will provide some royalty income for us and our guidance now for other operating income will be around 500 million for 2010 and we believe that that income level is a sustainable level for Novo Nordisk also in the immediate years to come. So, that hopefully if you use the mid range of our sales growth, should get you to a growth level of around 10%.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question now comes from Sam Fazeli of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hi gentlemen. Thank you very much. My two questions, can you tell us if 9068 is Degludec or Levemir in it and also with regards to the impact of the formulation patent progress that you've had for the European Union, what do you think does this raise the bar further for a generic launch after the composition of matter patent on the analogues expires? That's my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mads Krogsgaard, this is for you, the 9068 the components and what can we read out of the extension of our formulation patent, with regards to generic competition in the European market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, there are &#x2013; you can say, some similarities between Victoza and Degludec. They are both neutral stable preparations with a duration of action of 24 or 30 hours-plus in humans and they are both absolutely to the analogues of insulin GLP-1. And those properties have rendered them mixable. So, it is indeed a combination of Degludec and Victoza where, as I was discussing, you kind of can either see it as a product where you get &#x2013; say for insulin with less weight gain and hypo risk or even more efficacious GLP-1 with a boost of insulin. That remains to be seen because we are only in Phase I at this point.</p>
          <p>As regards to the Aspart formulation patent, you are aware that we have previously had a situation where there was a lawsuit with Sanofi-Aventis that actually kind of revoked our original patent that related to some ways of stabilizing physically and chemically the insulin Aspart in the formulation for a long shelf life and without risk of degradation and other problems. That was revoked, giving us you can say, an IP situation that was going to leave us without any protection beyond 2011 in Europe and 2014 in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now, what has happened here in the last instance and that is the final round is that actually the patent has been put back in place again and we have prevailed meaning that the ways through which by different means of &#x2013; you can say excipience in the formulation, changes in various buffer constituents and other elements of stabilization of the insulin Aspart molecule, we have covered that now until 2017. That implies then that any attempt to make a biosimilar version of insulin Aspart will have to do a work-around in terms of the rather broad scope of activities that we have in our patent to make sure that you have a physically, chemically stable product. So, it has made it more uphill for biosimilar companies, so to speak.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. Most of them have been answered already. Just a question on the switching you mentioned in the German market saying one &#x2013; roughly one-third of the uptake of new patients is a switch from Byetta. Do you get angry or &#x2013; well obviously, but would do you like to share with us what the reports back from the markets have been and why patients have been switching from Byetta and to Victoza and if that is obviously indicative of what we can expect in the U.S. market? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mads, can you say something qualitatively about the &#x2013; the reason for switches on this one-third that is assumed to be switching from Byetta to Victoza.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, originally it was higher because of course many doctors were ready and waiting for this product. But we are seeing that number coming down and that is also as we would hope because that's what you need to see in order to be able to &#x2013; to expand the market. I think overall what you will see is going forward that it is becoming more and more oral antidiabetic failures after either metformin failure or metformin plus one more OAD failure.</p>
          <p>So, you should expect somewhat of a similar situation in the U.S., where the only labeling difference is of course that here it can be used also in monotherapy albeit not in first-line diet-failure patients. So, essentially our expectation is that we have as Lars alluded to, to grow the market, expand the market which is today, you can say very small considering the excitement surrounding the GLP-1 class and that predominantly means tapping into the market for oral antidiabetic failures, preferably already at the metformin failure stage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the cause for people switching from current Byetta use to Victoza?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the response we have from at least the 600 physicians that came on board there, that was essentially that in many cases they didn't want to continue because of the nausea associated with Byetta or the inflexibility of the dosing, and that's their personal observations you can say.</p>
          <p>But there are different reasons and after all you can say Victoza at least according to the LEAD 6 study that we have conducted does offer more glucose control with a more simple dosing regimen, and that's also what we are witnessing now in a real-life setting. If anything people, once they get to know which patients to use this product in, actually feel that they're getting a very satisfactory treatment outcomes.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions ,if I may. One is related to NovoSeven, it seemed like there was a little bit of softness in the fourth quarter. Can you perhaps maybe just comment as to what your expected growth trends might be for that product going forward? And by contrast, human growth hormone was stronger than expected in the fourth quarter, is there any stocking or anything we should be aware of within that?</p>
          <p>And then just lastly, I wanted to ask with regards to falling off in the formulation patent comment in Europe, just confirm the 2014 patent for the U.S. still holds or is that extended to 2017? And I'll leave it there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Lars Rebien here. First question is on growth rate Q4, respectively on NovoSeven and human growth hormone and what are the expectations for 2010. And then the second question was the 2014 U.S. patent on NovoLog and the compound patent for NovoLog still stands at 2014 in the United States. But what has been prolonged is the formulation patent. And that means and that show us the same situation as in Europe.</p>
          <p>A biogeneric version of the molecule could be made, but the formulation of its current form, the way it's being used in Europe and United States cannot be done directly. So, as Mads was alluding to, any biosimilar entry would have to reformulate outside of the &#x2013; this physical, chemical parameters, which we have stipulated in our formulation patent and they of course stipulated in a patent because it's difficult to stabilize the NovoLog product and therefore it gives meaningful protection. In fact, we believe a big hurdle for biosimilar entries and postponing that likelihood until 2017.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jesper, would you comment on the Q4 and perhaps even more importantly the growth rates expectation for 2010 on NovoSeven and the human growth hormone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Especially for NovoSeven one has to be a little bit careful watching the currencies in Q4 as the comparisons in Q4 of 2008 was quite significant. So, if you basically back that the currency effect out of almost 10 percentage point, you have a local currency growth of NovoSeven in the fourth quarter to the tune of 6%.</p>
          <p>And then you also got to bear in mind that we &#x2013; as we also noted when we did the 2008 report, we had a bit of a pipeline fill in Q4 2008 in the U.S. because there was some speculation in the wholesaler level of the distributors on pricing because a competitor's price rise. And hence, if you adjust that out, I think you are quite close to a normal growth level.</p>
          <p>But, but 6% growth in local currency terms for NovoSeven in the final quarter, I think that's pretty representative of what the product is able to do. The guidance we are giving for 2010 for NovoSeven will be a growth in the single-digit level. Whether it would be mid or high single digit, I think we'll have to get a little bit further into the year before we'll know more about. In terms of growth hormone, the local currency growth we had for Norditropin in the final quarter of 2009 was a growth of around 15%.</p>
          <p>So, we are very happy with that. The growth guidance for 2010, Norditropin will be in the five to 10% range. We continue to gain a little bit of market share and we are closing in on Pfizer as the global market leader within growth hormone. So, we expect to continue to expand our franchise with Norditropin.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I also have two questions. Firstly, going back to patent expiries. I was wondering &#x2013; I know of course that NovoRapid is expiring in Europe, the substance patent in mid-next year. I know that it's not very likely that any biosimilar competition will arrive at that time. But do you actually see a risk that some healthcare authorities would force you to take down your price and I'm thinking about a market like, for example, France. And then secondly, I remember when you gave your new long-term guidance in connection with the full-year result last year, you were asked if you &#x2013; what kind of price increases you have included in your long-term guidance in U.S.?</p>
          <p>At that time I think you said that it was not as dramatic as you have seen in the past. Nevertheless, I notice that the insulin analogues was increased in price in general about five to 10% and human insulin was increased by 20%, of course on the list price. Could you please elaborate a little bit on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Martin. First of all, Mads, would you comment on your expectations how the authorities would view a compound patent expiry on NovoRapid in Europe where as you would uphold the formulation patent, meaning that there will be imminent entry into this from a biosimilar perspective. With regards to a price increase, Martin, yes &#x2013; you should not take too much indication from &#x2013; to this price increase in the United States of human insulin. It's just basically signaling that we are moving out of the human insulin segment all together.</p>
          <p>And as you well know, a lot of this human insulin is actually being sold to government contracts and hospitals under the Medicare or under the Medicaid programs and there hence the actual prices are quite different from the list price, but isn't an indicator that we are moving out of this market and view this as prudent for us. I think that the price increases that you have indicated on the modern insulins somewhere between five and 10% has been historical levels, in some years it's actually been higher, it's been 10%.</p>
          <p>It's our anticipation that going forward it will be rather conservative market where we are not very likely to continue being able to raise prices, as indicated. Mads, do you have any comment on your view on the NovoRap situation in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I do. Actually, I'd just like to emphasis a few points. One is that unlike the human growth hormone situation where six or seven contenders are all offering that exactly same protein with 191 amino acids in the same place. Here, we're talking different insulin analogues with different properties i.e., they are in their own right new molecular entities.</p>
          <p>With that born in mind, we first of all have no legislation in place in Europe or U.S. for that matter that actually allows for biosimilar analogues of insulin to be brought to market at this point even though it's been discussed. And second of all, we have no examples where protein based molecules of different backbone structures undergo class substitution in any society.</p>
          <p>You can have generic substitution of the same molecule, but not of a different molecules, so the short version is should a lispro arrive for instance, in the European market a couple of years from now, that is not expected to significantly impact the NovoRapid situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was actually not my question. My question was that I understand that there would not be any generic versions arriving but I was &#x2013; the question was if the healthcare authorities could say that now you've earned your money on this compound and then actually force you to take down the prices on the compound. Nevertheless, there will not be any generics out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>I mean, this is Lars here, Martin, that we are meeting all sorts of arguments for lowering the prices by different governments. It's pure speculations, you have seen the discussion with Equick in Germany was just sort of quasi-scientifically based argument for why certain comparisons should be used when considering price. It's all speculation. We of course are going to state our case and then there'll have to be a discussion, and a negotiation with the given authorities.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Carsten Madsen from Carnegie Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I just I have two questions to growth rates in the quarter. Actually, first of all, if you look at North America in the diabetes franchise growth rate seems to drop significantly from Q3. Could you elaborate a bit on what has happened here and at the same time also touch upon what has happened in International Operations where growth is the other way &#x2013; growing in the other way, being significantly up. Could you shed some more color on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we certainly will try. If &#x2013; this is a growth rate in Q4 in the United States and I think we actually we saw growth rates in North America of around 12% in local exchange rate in the Q4. Underlying growth is actually more like 20% and the Q4 sales in local currencies was impacted by the fact that we had taken some provisions in anticipation of a healthcare reform and that may or may not come to fruition and so of course to the extent to which that is being further deferred, it'll have some impact both on those provisions, but also have impact for our guidance on the top line in 2010.</p>
          <p>And we also have some other provisions for returned goods, for discontinuation of products which is impacting the U.S. business as such. So, there is no, in our view no underlying signs that the business has deteriorated in the fourth quarter in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just do note that the currency effect in comparing Q4 with Q4 for the North American market is in exceeding 10%. So, a lot of the challenges here is very, very significant currency effect in that specific quarter and that's also part of the reason why we're saying, when you look at the guidance we give for 2010, do bear in mind that the growth rates in the second-half of 2010 is going to be higher than what they are in the first half, because of the comparators during 2009, of course assuming stable rates throughout 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have any comments, Jesper, to the IO sales in Q4 which were in the opposite direction, came in quite strong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the overall sales in IO was developing quite nicely and the key driver here was a very strong quarter in the Q4 in local currency terms in China, but also a solid development in Turkey. So, that was some of the main markets delivering positive development for IO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But this, all of course highlights the issue of looking at quarter-to-quarter variations, it's rather complicated. We do not see any major shifts in our business either way, United States is not going down and we see not that IO is going through the roof so you should expect more like the annualized normals than what you have seen reported in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. The next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That comes from Sebastien Berthon from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello gentlemen. A few pipeline questions please. First could you update us on your plans with Semaglutide for Phase III, as well as Victoza obesity in the U.S. following the approval of Victoza? And secondly, when will we have some phase, some first Phase II results for Degludec? Can we have that towards the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thank you very much, Sebastien. Mads Krogsgaard, Semaglutide, what is the current status on that program? Victoza obesity, the United States, now we have green light &#x2013; will you be will be moving forward and when? And will we see some results on Degludec and DegludecPlus during this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, the last one first. Degludec and DegludecPlus, you can imagine have been recruited 4,000 and a few hundred patients over the last months. This implies that some of the six-month studies are indeed going to start reporting as of you can say mid this year maybe into Q3 and that would mean that from then and onwards there is going to be a almost an avalanche of reporting of these, you can say 16 to 18 trials that have been kicked off in those programs. So, that is something we will get back to later this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the GLP-1 situation, it is true that the Victoza approval for diabetes treatment in the U.S. now enables us, we feel to with a deep and broad portfolio really progress significantly, whether it's the combination treatment with Degludec, whether it's now going to the FDA, discussing the path forward for obesity where as you know we have only initiated the small of the three Phase B trials and the two big ones have not been initiated. Obviously, we'll now be discussing with the agency how they see the situation going forward and that is something we plan on applying for meetings regarding in the very near future. Semaglutide, there as you know, we've completed Phase II trials with strongly figurative results.</p>
          <p>And there we want to wrap up all the non-clinical experiments and you can say elements of this whole program and have discussions with the agency before we, in the second-half of this year, are able to come with a stop/go decision for Phase III, which if everything works out fine both on the regulatory and on the non-clinical side would enable us to then proceed into Phase III.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let's have the last question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from Jack Scannell from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions. The first on the Victoza conference call after approval, you alluded to some studies looking at a range of long-acting GLP-1 suggesting that you saw a similar thyroid signal from a range of different molecules. Can you just clarify or remind us whether those were whole animal studies looking at carcinogenicity or whether they were some kind of cellular or cell-culture based or receptor-binding study?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in Diabetes Care there was a very positive editorial to which you alluded by Drucker on the GLP-1 class. There was also a less positive editorial by Butler on pancreatitis. And I just wonder if you can give us your thoughts on that, both in relation with the class in general, also possible differential risks with the long-acting GLP-1s, such as LAR, or Taspoglutide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mads Krogsgaard, so the reference you made towards having started the long-acting GLPs, including our own obviously, were they done in the whole animal studies or were they done in cell-based studies? And finally what's your comment to the Butler editorial on pancreatitis on long-acting GLPs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the paper that will be coming out in the near future is a very comprehensive paper that looks at both human and non-human, i.e., reptile GLP-1 analogues. Obviously with the amount of compounds that are being studied not everything is going into the in vivo situation, where you need to produce large amount of compounds, use large amounts of animals and so on.</p>
          <p>What we have done though is for each and every relevant late stage GLP-1 agonist of the long-acting and the short-acting ones, we've constructed full dose response curves on the relevant rodent assays looking at carcinomas and functional activation of B cell systems that we know in the pre-clinical situation are predictive of a later response in the in vivo situation.</p>
          <p>And to that end, we have then done pharmacokinetic experiments to map out what are the equivalent bio exposures that you need for a reptile peptide known as exenatide and a human one known as liraglutide to match actually the exposure that equivilates the doses that are needed to exert the anti-diabetic effect. And then we've in that situation done studies, where repeated dosing of the animals have lead to C-cell proliferation and hypoplasia and they are as will be shown in this paper completely identical and super imposable, whether you use the human liraglutide molecule or the reptile exenatide molecule. Also we have in this publication GLP-1 receptor knock out data and we have human data from the liraglutide meter analysis. So, this will be a very comprehensive paper with a lot of data and is coming we believe in the next month.</p>
          <p>And then the Butler -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Butler's concerns about pancreatitis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well here we should remark one thing and that is that when the FDA is talking in their remises, whether it's for Byetta or whether it's for liraglutide, they do actually use the phraseology the risk of pancreatitis, where when you talk about the C-cells they talk about the potential risk.</p>
          <p>Hence it is, at this point the verdict of the FDA that they do discuss the risk of pancreatitis. Even though you can say the numbers are small and it's not scientifically proven then at least this is at this point something that the producers of GLP-1 such as Novo Nordisk have to relate to. That being said, the Peter Butler paper is using I would say a one particular model of transgenic mouse diabetes, where pancreatitis has been seen initially with the DPP IV inhibitor and actually it is contradicted by other models that are used in other laboratories, where they're seeing no difference whatsoever on the occurrence of pancreatitis. Also, Novo Nordisk has not seen this in its pre-clinical studies. So, I think the jury is out and it's quite clear that pancreatitis is one area of further studies.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, with that thank you very much, Mads. It was a conclusion based on Victoza. And ladies and gentlemen, this was the conclusion of our teleconference. A web &#x2013; a copy of the webcast will be made available on our homepage. Our Investor Relations officers will be available to answer questions shortly, after our investor conference in Copenhagen, which takes place in about one hour. So, we thank you for your attendance and we will be back in connection with our first quarter release. So, see you then.</p>
