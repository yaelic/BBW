        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good time of the day to everyone. We're welcoming you to our traditional quarterly analyst and investor call on the condensing during consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as of 31st of March, 2011 and for the three months ended 31st of March, 2011. We, after a few brief words on the key numbers, would welcome and open it up for your questions.</p>
          <p>The main facts for the quarter are that our net brokerage totaled to RUB86.8 billion which is RUB4.02 per ordinary share as compared to RUB43.5 billion last year or RUB2.01 per ordinary share for the quarter one 2010. We have &#x2013; this amounts to annualized return on average equity of 33.6% compared to 21.3% ROE for quarter one 2010. Although, we would point out that there is seasonality in this number and it is not lending itself easily to linear extrapolation for the rest of the year. Our expectations and outlook for ROE that we've voiced before stays so far unchanged.</p>
          <p>Our cost to income ratio remains strong at 44.9% versus 36.2% for quarter one 2010. I know recently there have been questions asked on cost growth and we have always referred to our interim target for 2011, 2012 of keeping the cost income ratio in mid-40s practically for these two years so that we can spend some OpEx to create new revenue earning opportunities and to extract more sustainable cost efficiencies to ensure stable cost income ratio starting from 2013 of much, much closer to '14 in fact our strategic plan says '14.</p>
          <p>We have recovered provisions for loan impairment therefore it has been a credit to our P&amp;L of RUB14.2 billion for the first quarter this year against the charge of RUB54.3 billion &#x2013; debit charge of RUB54.3 billion for the first quarter last year. Again, I would stress out that provisioning is a lumpy event-driven process, and we are not smoothing it. Therefore, no linear extrapolation for these numbers please. There is several turnkey transactions that have &#x2013; we have been working on for almost two years on average to recover, that will just resulted in completing those recoveries through various types of transactions or judicial decisions, therefore they just happened to occur in quarter one.</p>
          <p>Our core capital adequacy ratio under Basel I was 13% and total capital adequacy ratio was 17.8% as of 31st of March, which is well above 8% minimum. We have observed good pickup in loan volumes, especially closer to the end of the quarter and although this is not part of the reporting as yet but it's worth mentioning that we have seen the continuation of those in April based on operating data in Russian accounts.</p>
          <p>So this means that we confirm our existing outlook, the loan growth for the full year. I will remind you that we have been voicing 18% to 23% growth for retail part of the loan book and above 13%, kind of 13%, 15% growth for the corporate part of the loan book.</p>
          <p>We also have seen some statistical confusion in the margin trends during the first quarter on a month-by-month basis caused by some seasonality and caused by some one-off events that have changed the patterns of how people save and borrow partially because of the new rate of the social security tax introduced from the 1st of January in Russia. But nevertheless, having cleared our margin perception outlook from these statistical confusions and then one-off events, we confirm our outlook for the full year of margins between 6.2%, 6.4% and the first quarter actually comes in exactly at 6.2%.</p>
          <p>Our fee and commission income continues to grow very steady terms. We have shown a 19% increase year-on-year and we remain optimistic that we should &#x2013; that this piece of growth is at least sustainable.</p>
          <p>Our operating expenses have grown up by 24.1% year-on-year. The major component of this are stock posts and they have increased by 22% year-on-year, as a result of increase in stock remuneration in 2010, some of which will continue in 2011 because this is a very detailed and careful exercise that we're doing; we're not rushing it.</p>
          <p>I guess as far as the opening remarks, I will probably just mention that the gross loan portfolio has increased by 2.4% this quarter, and it was healthy demand for both corporate and retail loans as I've mentioned. And it is split between corporate and retail in following manner. The corporate has grown 2.3% and the retail has grown 2.8%.</p>
          <p>I think for the opening remarks, I will not overload you more with verbal information. I am hopeful that all of you have access either online or have had a chance to printout our investor presentation, which is at the usual place in our official website, www.sberbank.ru in the Investors section. I will from, time to time, answering your questions, refer to some of the slides of this presentation which would illustrate some of the logic in the way we see the situation.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will open &#x2013; I would like to open this for your questions please. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Simon Nellis from Citigroup. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have a question about the comments that Mr. Herman Gref made about potential share buybacks and potentially prior to the planned privatization of the 7.6% stake that the government is thinking of selling. Can you elaborate on those comments and also just on what kind of target Tier 1 ratio you would be looking at posts any potential buybacks. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Mr. Gref was referring to the discussions that we have had informally with our Supervisory Board. And I know yesterday in the press also, the Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, Mr. Ulyukaev, who also sits on our Board, have made comments publicly about the same conversations. So these are formal conversations were around us discussing with our Board the possibility of buyback near the time of selling the Central Bank stake, the one that is tagged for sale.</p>
          <p>Sometime this or next year the 7.58% stake that is up for sale. The purpose of that is &#x2013; was to just understand that this type of action is not going to be &#x2013; that it is going to be perceived well by the Board which is logical for us to check. We haven't taken any specific decisions as to how much, when, what would be reasonable at the point in time. We have just agreed that this course of action is possible and practically can be executed in case we sense that the placement of the government stake might benefit in price terms from such an action. This was done on the basis that we are excessively capitalized. This is also based on the understanding that the management of Sberbank has developed, I hope, a strong reputation of being very conservative with respect to capital adequacy and that we will only buy-back amounts that will still leave us with relatively healthy capital adequacy ratio. We haven't discussed specific levels. I don't think I'm ready now to give any guidance on what capital adequacy ratio acceptable for us would be post-buyback. But we'll just refer to the &#x2013; to our conservative attitude to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you. I'm sure it'll be a very good investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> I think so (13:13).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just related to that question, though, if you did buy back shares, would you actually cancel them, and I understand in Russia, it's sometimes quite often difficult to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the regulations are such that you have one year to take that decision post-buyback. You either sell them back out to the market or you cancel them after one year. And if that happens sometime in 2011 or 2012, we believe that that particular year will be very symptomatic for us to come up with that decision closer to the end in demonstrating what sustainable post-crisis business growth expectations could be there. A bit more clarity on what exact shape and form would our M&amp;A strategy take and I &#x2013; I will make &#x2013; I'm sure there will be questions, I'll make a couple of comments on our M&amp;A strategy later on.</p>
          <p>And then what the residual amount of capital access would we have after, we'll satisfy the expected sustainable growth rate and M&amp;A appetite for us, because again this coming year or 18 months we'll provide much more clarity for a longer-term outlook. The situation with a sustainable base of growth for Russia in terms of financial services sector is a bit hazy because we're still too early out of the crisis. But hopefully, within 12, 18, 24 months whatever it takes, we'll have much better picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you very much. I have one more question and that would be on margins. Clearly, you are seeing continued pressure on corporate yields. I mean in the past, you kind of mentioned that you hoped that the worst was over, but can you just provide us a little more color on how you see the outlook for the corporate margins in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What kind of a color should I give you? I guess we do the factor analysis for ourselves and what it shows is that &#x2013; I have a very detailed set of numbers in front of me, unfortunately our competitors aren't publishing that so we probably wouldn't be able to follow any suit here, but that factor analysis shows that the margin compressions that we have just seen in the prior periods, that have subsequently stabilized in the past couple of quarters, was driven mostly by compressing yields on &#x2013; reducing rates in the asset side but that trend has stopped and &#x2013; whilst the volume have started to increase somewhat. So partially the reduction of the rates have stimulated the loan growth and once the rate has stabilized the loan growth starts compensating for good interest income coming in whilst we would still be enjoying a meaningful part of the positive effect coming from the re-price down of our retail deposits last year. And I'll remind you we have done it twice last year; in April, a bigger cut and in August somewhat smaller cut. We have cut in April by about 1%, 1.5%, 2 percentage points and in August depending on turnovers on various products, between quarter of a percentage points and 75 basis points. So during the quarter, three quarters of a percentage.</p>
          <p>So we will enjoy the effect of that for between 12 and 24 months. Now also in terms of margins, there is a very important impact from the fact that the higher margin products that we do on the loan side grow faster than the vanilla corporate loans where most of the price heat has been taken. Our retail portfolio is of a fantastic credit quality whilst our rates there are very healthy. They are right there with the market. In many sub-products, we're the cheapest in the market but at the same time, it offers very good risk and reward balance for us. And this portfolio grows twice the pace of &#x2013; or almost twice the pace of the vanilla corporate bilateral books. This is the way we see the color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I just try to summarize what you're saying, I mean it sounds like potentially the cheaper funding costs kind of will continue to come through but the decline in asset yield should slow, net-net margin probably stabilizes and with loan growth picking up we should start to see a return of growth in net interest income. Is that a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's neutral to positive outlook. The situation is that we have actually already seen the pricing on the assets stabilize and somewhat increase and the inflationary pressures have been one of the big factors there. So now when we negotiate rates with our corporate clients, this is the clear argument that &#x2013; it is obvious to everyone, it's hard to argue against it. So we see some positive impact on the asset price &#x2013; price-ups.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And I guess -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is &#x2013; the kind of color I give you is based on the negotiations that we do and the transactions that are going through our credit committees as we monitor them. Our &#x2013; whilst the margin effect filters through to P&amp;L with a bit of a &#x2013; three to six-month lag behind us, the &#x2013; that's why I'm saying we're neutral to moderately positive with the margin outlook for the rest of the year. And again to put it into the context for everyone, you've clearly seen us change the margin expectation two times upwards in the past six months. Remember, early autumn 2010 we were guiding for the margins to drop down to sub 6%, 5.8%, 5.9%. We subsequently revised this to 6.1%, 6.3% and then subsequently to 6.2%, 6.4%, which is our standing guidance. So that is a reflection on how we perceive the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Super. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thanks very much. Just a couple of questions, I suppose. One, it's still going to be a follow-up on the margin, second on cost and three, on sort of depository receipt program. So let me start with the margin question, I suppose, would you &#x2013; are you able to confirm that effectively from now on we are looking at quite nice loan repricing on both corporate retail side on the back of the interest rates? I know that's something that you've been negotiating over the last couple of months but how far can it go? I suppose from the perspective one, of the &#x2013; one naturally, interest rates to your pricing power and then &#x2013; and I'm interested for &#x2013; in both portfolios sort of retail and corporate? Yeah and then I'll -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's &#x2013; in corporate, there is some price renegotiation. It is a process that has quite a lot inertia. So when I say it's inertia so that when I say there's some nice positive signs, of course this is a relatively kind of slow position. You don't go that fast with bilateral negotiations with all of your hundreds of clients but there is clearly a good trend there.</p>
          <p>In terms of retail, it is not the repricing up that actually takes place. It's the mix effect change, which means that higher margin products such as credit cards, which also have kind of healthy in-commission component, also, retail loans that are unsecured, which &#x2013; all of which we price at the market and there is not much repricing in the market per se that is going on; in fact, none of the pricing up in the market is for retail loans. But the fact is that for us these products with higher margins push out other products from our old product line, which were as popular even before, not to say about now because most of them are relatively heavy, old process based and not very attractively priced. So these ones that we've stopped offering since we rolled out our new product line for retail lending, they occupy smaller and smaller share in part of the portfolio and are being replaced with better margining, better yielding products. So that mix effect is quite positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And my second question is on cost. You've effectively touched upon this in your presentation, but I suppose if we add all the numbers together, your guidance on margins, your guidance on fees and generally a two year, 2011, 2012 cost income ratio in the 40s were boldly sort of ending up at cost inflation at about 25% per annum. Now, it is quite a chunky number. You've got a couple of sort of, I suppose, things, which are not necessarily under your control, i.e. the social security taxes and then, of course, the inflation is running at 9% anyway. But would you say that effectively, the remaining portion of your investment portion by the end of 2012, that cost base sort of inflated by 25% per annum, would be there &#x2013; would be sort of then the cost base you're happy to run with going forward at sort of more normalized inflationary increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. Of course, yes. Again, you're right in coming out with about 25% year-on-year cost inflation. And you're right about &#x2013; in fact, we probably would see between 25% and 30%. But then again, whilst normally all of us, you and us, if we were talking about any other investment that we would have make, would have already had a heart attack by that time if it was any other company talking about this in these times. But this is not the case here.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we continue with our staff reduction program very actively and we have proven to the world, and most importantly to ourselves because it's a difficult process, that we can actually do it. I would remind we started with over 270,000 people, we're now at the end of the first &#x2013; at the beginning of the second quarter we're at about &#x2013; just about 230,000 people. Because &#x2013; that is 40,000, that is a &#x2013; big number that we have been very intensely working through, and we are continuing with this.</p>
          <p>What I would also tell you that net-net in terms of number of head count for 2010, it will not be yet another 5% down this year, but for a good reason. We will still cut about 5% of the work force in places where this is deserved; inefficient processes mostly. But we are starting to ramp up for future business volumes for new products in anticipation that &#x2013; in preparing for the growth to come. We only do that in the cases where our anticipation is very certain and we know that there isn't really going to be any let down; where we improve the quality of service, where we roll out new products. For example, for your credit card product to work successfully, you need to have a very decent call center supporting that with a good quality, where operators pick up the phone with only after one or two beeps and we didn't have that product couple years ago. We started actually carefully looking at credit cards for the first time back in 2009. In 2000 or &#x2013; as a result of &#x2013; for 2010, we skyrocketed to number two position in this market. And our target for 2011 is to go to 2000 &#x2013; to number one and we are comfortably on track with that. But of course you need a few hundred people to support that because this is millions of clients demanding quality products. But also the credit card product itself is such a sweet margin earning product that this is the kind of the cost of hiring all those people that you would be comfortable to bear.</p>
          <p>So this &#x2013; of course, on top of the social tax security on top of the catch-ups with &#x2013; from the pay freeze that have been there for three years adds up in the percentage year-on-year but this is &#x2013; again we're doing it in a controlled manner and knowledgeably. So net-net the head count reduction may not be that big but be assured that there is thousands and thousands of -redundant positions that were inefficient are been cut. I guess yes, most of the other arguments we've already voiced out. So that's the response.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And my last one is really just sort of updates on a couple of things. I suppose one is the depository receipt program, which is I suppose coming up soon. Second, any updates from the perspective of the privatization of the stake which has been announced? And thirdly, I know very small but are there any sort of negative effects of the Belarusian devaluation on your operations there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. We, as a Russian bank, have been through a couple of similar situations on a macro level. So we saw it coming, got prepared. Our Bank there is number three in the banking sector, relatively big, but we have been able to not only get prepared but to provide some assistance to the extent that we could in practical discussions of how you handle the problems with the local regulators.</p>
          <p>And what also hedges us significantly is that the National Bank of <mark type="ph" /> Belarussia (30:31) has allowed to make contributions to the funding and to the capital by &#x2013; to the subsidiaries of the foreign banks in, not in Belarusian rubles, but in dollars or any other hard currencies. So any additional support for the short-term liquidity issues that are there in the market that we should provide to our subsidiary is well hedged from the currency perspective. Besides, I will remind you that in relative terms, the size of the bank there is absolutely tiny as compared to Sberbank.</p>
          <p>Now very briefly on ADRs and on the prioritization. On prioritization, we're working on technicalities and legal mechanics of our interaction as the issuer with our majority shareholder; who will take what decisions, what process to follow, how, et cetera. So for that purpose, we have been last week nominated as the technical agent for the selling shareholder on the matters of privatization. This is &#x2013; this will usually involve us, for example, preparing a shortlist of investment banks to handle the sale stake and provide it as a recommendation to the Central Bank to &#x2013; for them to make a final choice for example and many other legal and technical things. So for that matter we have sent out &#x2013; last week, we have sent out RFPs to the investment banks for arranging the privatization transaction. Expecting the feedback next week and then we'll hold a &#x2013; a more formal tender to come up with a shortlist for recommending to the Central Bank.</p>
          <p>On ADRs, we have filed our submission for launching &#x2013; filed our application for permission to launch a zero balance depositary receipt program to the Federal Securities Commission of Russia. The regulatory term for response to this &#x2013; for approval to this, is one month. The application was filed the week before last, so we're kind of halfway through; hoping that it will actually not take them the full month because all the information is very clear and details are non-ambiguous that we have filed.</p>
          <p>Following that, we should be able to file applications to the SEC to get permission for a Level 1 ADR launch. So as this process progresses, we'll keep the public in the loop through normal press releases and announcements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anton, is there a timeframe to the privatization &#x2013; to your privatization, i.e. is it likely to happen this year or is it more 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will depend on the market conditions. The selling shareholder has been saying to us, and I guess to the market, that it is important for this transaction to be successful for them and &#x2013; mostly in terms of price, and for that purpose, they're willing to be flexible in terms of timing. Our plan is to see what the market conditions would be starting from September, because it is by September that we want to be legally and technically ready to do the transaction, so that the only factor for us to wait for would be the market environment and the price.</p>
          <p>So the press has been mentioning a lot the month of September, but we have always consistently talked about this only in the context of us being ready. And obviously, people know that within the second half of the year, September and early October, are usually the best timing parts rather than sometimes November, December. But that again remains so far theoretic. We &#x2013; again we'll wait for the right environment to do the transaction. That is what the selling shareholder is telling us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, in &#x2013; your CEO in talking about doing share buybacks and so on, in the same breadth almost, was reported as talking about big acquisitions and clearly you want the chance to tell us about the acquisition M&amp;A policy. I would be grateful if you could clear that up. I mean, I have always understood that we were not talking about things that were, I mean, very significant in balance sheet terms, but when your CEO was quoted as talking about big acquisitions, that didn't fit very well with share buybacks. So I'd like you to clarify that, if you could?</p>
          <p>And second &#x2013; and just secondly, a precision in terms of your outlook for commission income and whether you actually think you can achieve you know, 20%, you know, annual growth this year. And perhaps a little bit of color in terms of where you think that's coming from and what pricing you'd like in those sorts of areas and how important, for example, is the credit card business to achieving that sort of growth. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Now, there has been a little bit of a rumor mill about the meaning of what he said, I think. Because big is not something that is essential for us, quite vice versa. He probably was asked about big, but the nature of his response, I wouldn't be able to quote it because I wasn't around, didn't hear that in precise words, but he has been answering that question at least 10 times in my presence in various meetings and conversations in the past couple of months. And the logic is buyback you talk &#x2013; you're talking in &#x2013; normally in circumstances when you have excessive capital, and this is clearly the case for us. But you talk about buybacks as a consequence of assessing how much organic growth is there ahead of you and do you have enough capital for that.</p>
          <p>Then the next thing is what is your M&amp;A appetite and how much capital do you need to allocate for that. And only thirdly, is there enough to give back to the shareholders after all the successful growth, organic and inorganic, outlook, whether in the form of dividends or buybacks? Therefore, we do have some chunks of excessive capital but then we also have pretty stable expectations of healthy growth ahead of us. So that doesn't leave all too much for huge acquisitions for us to consider.</p>
          <p>But that is not the core reason. The main reason is that these days, if it is a bank and if it is for sale and if it is big, you're fundamentally talking about how big is the problem with this bank. In the post-crisis terms &#x2013; environment and based on what is going with the European banks, based on the overall quality issues and perceptions out there.</p>
          <p>So for a bank like ours, where we have so much opportunities domestically and our top priorities between 1 and 10 lay in our domestic market, we are thinking about it longer-term and we're saying other strong growth markets like CIS, Eastern Europe, India and China; we have to be very wise about. Because it is good to enter the market around now but because of the size of the problems that lay there, it is much wiser to take compact acquisition targets, carefully sort them out on a smaller scale without exposing yourself to too much of a risk and then use them as a platform for further bolt-ons in whatever individual countries or areas of the market.</p>
          <p>This is especially important in the context of a very big transformation strategically that we do with every aspect of the Bank's life through our first five-year strategy in which we're in year &#x2013; in the middle of year three now. So we're extremely big on changing at the bank. So our attitude to this &#x2013; this is something that should be not as small as a single country but not as big as a very kind of huge and diversified multi-country platform; it is rather a compact several country platform with its own government center through which we can &#x2013; allocating only reasonable amount of management focus and attention, manage the integration and through which we will subsequently, as a hub, grow whatever markets or segments we would want to follow. And this means that we may take the decisions on some of the targets this year but if &#x2013; only if the combination of all those factors that we look for is absolutely right. If it actually is not necessarily so we will be willing to wait for the next year. So we &#x2013; to sum it up, we're moving very rationally and step-by-step. We &#x2013; there's no ambition to get absolutely gigantic for the sake of it. So that's the context.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thanks for making that <mark type="ph" /> so clear (42:24).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And commissions...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...we are confident that we will be able to deliver over 20% growth, just &#x2013; full stop. We have been showing 24% last year, 17% in 2009 understandably, 32% in 2008 and 32% in 2007. We &#x2013; credit cards are used as an example where we &#x2013; you have to frontload a little bit of OpEx and CapEx to really get to the scale. But to give you a sense of perspective is, we have managed to get to number two with only 2 million cards in issue in 140 million populated country, including little babies. So there's clearly a huge market penetration that needs to happen but the ambition to become number one in 2011 is achievable with the business line of about 3 million cards. And this is not because we're not capable of issuing 5 million or 10 million. This is because the product is new. The population needs to be adapting to this. It will be reckless and irresponsible for us to push this product through the throat of the public. You have to be client-friendly and well-oriented.</p>
          <p>So in absolute terms, this is for the time being not particularly big, but there is &#x2013; there's other products that are very attractive. We have been developing quite active any type of online services through mobile phone banking, Internet banking, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:18) transactional services for retail clients and various transactional and cash management services for corporate clients. These are the big ones that are yielding &#x2013; or bringing in most of the growth that we see in percentage terms, I mean fees and commissions <mark type="ph" /> line (44:40).</p>
          <p>And also &#x2013; well, hopefully Troika will contribute at least some because even before we have closed the transaction, we have just signed the legally binding transaction documents last week &#x2013; actually no, this week, earlier this week, we have already been enjoying some of the synergies simply out of &#x2013; because our investment bankers and Troika investment bankers have been talking to the clients together and generating some good ideas. So there's some inflow of fees and commissions there too.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Alex Kantarovich from JPMorgan. Anton, thank you very much for this opportunity. If I may, I would like to ask about provisioning. Earlier you implied that we would see releases perhaps closer to the year-end and yet here we are, you have a considerable RUB14 billion release in Q1. If I read today's newspapers, I think Commerzbank mentioned that in Q2 basically releases would be matched by newly created provisions. Would you give us any guidance for the full year? Would it still be a charge or perhaps you could be more generous?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So far, halfway through the second quarter operating data suggests that we'd probably be neutral on provisions. There will be new created but some of the recoveries would happen faster. Whatever has happened in the first quarter was a bit of ahead of plan. We were very happy with our recovery guys, having done a very good job on several large but complicated transactions.</p>
          <p>I would still probably say that whilst there's some frontloading in &#x2013; in provision recovery that have occurred on certain transactions, but we will be generating enough of the new business to, all-in-all, for the full year still create a debit charge, i.e. some costs to the provision lines associated with that. If anything, so far our recovery plan per se, i.e. provision releases, on a full-year basis remain aggressive but within the same volume outlook because what has happened the first couple of quarters is that people have just done their job a bit earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Thank you.  And if I may ask you about buyback; surely given the pace of the capital formation that you have and the given the size and in order to be meaningful this buyback program should be sufficiently large. Should we assume the total size of the program as, let's say, $2 billion, $3 billion, would be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:22)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In all honesty, Alex, you know us that we haven't yet identified any reference point in numeric terms. But we know we're in a good position where we can afford to take those decisions much closer to actually executing them. So it's not that I'm unwilling to give guidance, it is just that we have had no desperate need to actually quantify it for ourselves yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. And the last question is again on the same topic of buyback because it's a big decision, big dollars, and obviously the government should be on board. Shall we conclude from what Mr. Gref said and from the proposed changes to a charter to let the supervisory council to authorize this that the government is on board with this, with the idea, at least in principle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I will &#x2013; Alex, I will reiterate that we have had informal discussions with the main shareholder. The question of buybacks is not so significant to discuss it any broader at the government level than with the main shareholder who &#x2013; by the way Central Bank is fully empowered to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:57) of the issues with respect to Sberbank. So they empowered enough political power to handle this alone. Therefore, we have had informal discussions, there were understandings achieved that this is possible, and if it becomes necessary, and that was it. Now the changes to the charter are of actually a bit more technical nature. For example, the law says that you can do buybacks for several reasons. In our charter, only one of them has been mentioned, so we said, "Well, look, the charter needs to reflect the law." And some of those reasons are could be relatively tactical so it is only natural for us to follow suit of many other companies where these tactical issues are handled by the board not by the AGM or extraordinary GM. So that was the driver behind it. It is just fine tuning of the charter.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>RUB250 billion? Okay. And because Gref was saying that earnings could clearly exceed $10 billion and <mark type="ph" /> Gref (51:56) issue quite a big ruble appreciation to get it translated into RUB250 billion?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Did he say that? I didn't hear that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to be bullish on the ruble but that sounds a bit of a stretch. With the RUB250 billion, I mean what is the &#x2013; what are the risk costs that you budgeted to get to that RUB250 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The risk costs &#x2013; where is my &#x2013; I will check my numbers but again I would probably not like to be very precise with them because again we are exactly at the turning point of the trend. And therefore the pace of recoveries is still not being unpredictable. I have a big, big chart in front of me that I'm actually thinking about us putting on to our standard template, investor presentation, that losses up, for us, from the first quarter of 2006 to now which shows costs for provisions and credit costs annualized in absolute and in relative terms.</p>
          <p>And again what is normalized 2006 average quarterly credit cost was between 0.3% and 1%; '07, the same; '08 about 0.7%, 0.8%. Only last quarter of 2008, it was 1.54%. Then 2009, it was enormous, 4.8%, 6.7%, 7.3%, 7.8%, these are the four quarters. 2009 was 6.6%, 4%, 4.1% and 2.8% quarterly. Yeah, last quarter of 2010 was 0.25%. Now, it's negative, almost 1%. It is very difficult to say what it is going to be when you are actually just halfway through the recovery cycle, and I'm talking more about the macro recovery cycle but the average recovery theories for a problem loan portfolio created by a crisis of this scale and that average recovery period is somewhat three to five years. We have only been working two-and-a-half years on the portfolio and we've collected some of the easier dollars, easier rubles out of that and quite a bit of more complicated rubles out of it but what we're left with is the remaining &#x2013; difficult to collect rubles which are again very, very difficult to forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, I mean I truly respect, I think it's fully understood that there's not complete clarity on the risk costs and that there is quite a lumpy series. But that's why I'm surprised that you say the profit is going to be around RUB250 billion, why don't you say it's going to be RUB250 billion to RUB350 billion or RUB200 billion to RUB300 billion? Right? So just I'm asking, I mean if you say RUB250 billion, I mean what are the risk costs that you put in to get to RUB250 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, you have all the other parts of the formula to come out to what is going to be the component. We have just fine-tuned the guidance on the costs. You remember one of the first questions of this call were what's the end-year guidance on the costs. We're saying it's about 30% up on last year, and the volume and the margins outlook we've already given out. They stay, so I guess this is the only missing component.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Secondly, regarding the margin, I think you were quite clear what you said on the asset yield and on the funding constraints. But could you shed some light on the asset efficiency and where you think that the loans-to-asset ratio could end up at &#x2013; by the end of the year? I think we're now at 65%, is that going to be 70% or could we &#x2013; could go above that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it would show some good dynamics. Because what we have observed in the more kind of recent months is that the total assets per se are growing slower than in new yield components, which is loans in corporate and retail. Therefore loans have been growing faster at the expense of compressing the size of the somewhat extensive securities portfolio that we have. So, I guess &#x2013; just looking to check one particular graph which may help me possibly give you a little bit more color if there is.</p>
          <p>Now, that one. Yeah we can &#x2013; we now see that it probably feels answering somewhat different question but related one which is something that we haven't mentioned before, is that when we look at what's been going on with the dynamics of the loan book compared to retail deposits &#x2013; overall deposits, retail and corporate, clearly starting from third quarter 2010, we see that the loans grow somewhat faster. With one exception of quarter four 2010, but that was statistical confusion because of &#x2013; again because of the taxes and because of some unusual go-ahead activity in the market overall. But clearly, that means that deposits are &#x2013; inflow is kind of slowing down a little bit. That would also contribute to the fact that the loans to assets ratio will be changing favorably to more optimal level, as you've mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So I mean if loan rates stabilize, funding costs are still maybe slightly coming down; maybe the re-pricing is pretty dominant in the second quarter, and your asset officially is going up. I mean that NIM is not going to stay where it is now, but that's going to move up to 6.6%, 6.7%. So where's the equation going wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, also one has to bear in mind, we don't rule out the fact that we might want to somewhat increase the retail deposit rates a little bit for the same reason,  because clearly inflation has been pumping up as compared to last year. The Central Bank has done a couple of moves although somewhat symbolic if you compare it with China and Turkey, but still &#x2013; so we may make some tactical fine-tuning to the cost of funds, so that could be a factor. Although, again, this is the one that takes effect, as we've just earlier discussed, much later, closer to the end of the year, so there is &#x2013; some of that that we have to factor in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is why again we're kind of saying 6.2%, 6.4% outlook for margins remains unchanged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My last question, I promise it's my last question, is regarding M&amp;A and in particular BTA. I think the <mark type="ph" /> common sense (60:18) or at least that was the way it was translated was that Sberbank outlined the terms under which Sber could be buying BTA. I mean how should I read that? I mean is this like outlining conditions that Kazakhstan is taking all the distressed assets of BTA and then Sberbank is ready to buy clean assets, i.e. something that's definitely not going to work &#x2013; going to happen or that there is significant progress and that we are actually close to a deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There has been some progress, but not &#x2013; in our discussions, but not at a much different pace to the progress that we have seen in the past couple of years, and that is probably for all the public sensitivities around this issue, the only comment that I would want to make at this point. I guess you can read well enough between the lines.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello there. It's Geoff Elliott from Autonomous Research. I've got a question on numbers <mark type="ph" /> in all costs (61:49). There are a couple of lines in there that are growing very quickly, depreciation up 30% year-on-year, lease expenses up nearly 40% year-on-year. When can we expect these to return to more of the normal growth rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess after 2012. 2011, 2012 are the kind of important years for us <mark type="ph" /> were the ranking (62:21) between the two trends. First, completion of the first two years of our strategy execution, where we have harvested some of the cost efficiencies, the ones that don't require a lot of spend or investment. I have spent enough time figuring out how to smartly spend in CapEx and OpEx to extract more sustainable long-term and more fundamental cost efficiencies on one side, and on another side, additions to the top line in revenues. So, in years three, four, this is the time to spend.</p>
          <p>On top of that, there is some of the opportunities in the markets in new products and sectors, as I've mentioned before, where you want to be the first to the table to enjoy the sweet revenue position, so you do some OpEx and CapEx for that, and that we're bringing forward to a bit front-load and rather spend the money six to 12 months earlier than not.</p>
          <p>And also some &#x2013; some of that &#x2013; now that third one is about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (63:35). So it is 2011, 2012 where we're consciously spending, where we're concentrating a lot of our resource to execute on all this and then it will be much, much closer to the inflation going forward from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the outlook for cost growth in 2012, I know there are a lots of moving parts that we don't yet know in terms of wage inflation, in terms of the tight environment. But is it intuitively right to assume that cost growth should slow down obviously in 2012 because it's coming from a very fast growth in 2011 --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, if we're guiding for around 30% in 2011, then it is likely could be around not more than 20% in 2012 off the top of that base, in fact probably lower. But we will give some more specific guidance closer to autumn when we start our planning exercise for the next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah, I've just got one question on the provisioning and it was this, if we look at your Russian accounting standard numbers, there was a very large write-back in the April numbers of about RUB18.5 billion. And my question is this: does that correspond with the write-backs that we've seen in the first quarter IFRS numbers so there's a timing difference between IFRS and Russian accounting? Or does that indicate that there's an extension of the trend into the second quarter that we may then see in IFRS as well?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only through a very small fraction there is a bit of a timing overlap; otherwise they're independent.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Olga Veselova from Troika Dialog. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Olga Veselova from Troika Dialog. My first question is about the lending dynamics and update on corporate loan growth. Looking year-to-date on the loan grown dynamics on the corporate side, we see that the Bank basically lags the banking sector slightly. And when we asked a question about this lagging at the previous conference calls you guided that the Bank basically avoids price competition with smaller players by interest rates. And could you please just update us if this is the case now, how you think this will develop in the second half of the year? And where is your pricing now on corporate loans relative to other banks? And do you think there are any other reasons why the Bank lags the sector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is some &#x2013; in retail, the reason why we're &#x2013; we have been, up to recently, lagging behind the pace of the growth market was not the pricing but the convenience and quality of our sales effort &#x2013; convenience of the product quality of our sales effort that was holding us. But we have been putting quite a little of effort to overcome that and we're already starting to see the effect, and again we'll like April much more than the first three months of this year and mostly for that reason.</p>
          <p>In terms of corporate loans, your question about where are our rates against the competition, we're extremely close. This is the one where you go head-to-head, especially in the large and largest segment, where the corporate treasurers are very finely sophisticated in negotiating the rates, against quite a number of banks, so we're up to the minute there with differences only in single basis points with the rest of the market for the equivalent risk that we take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And what is now the low end of interest rate range for let's say, good clients, for large clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will depend on what is the client that you're dealing with, what is the product, what is the tenor. I guess on slide 10, we give a bit of a guidance that the average yield on loans to corporate clients is &#x2013; you see the bottom graph, the green one on slide 10, for the first quarter has been about 9.7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, yeah, I see but it's accumulated. I mean what are the interest rates from new loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, look, it's probably a bit pointless. So the pricing is individual. Our portfolio is plain vanilla bilateral working capital loans. And again, despite the fact that we see full statistics of hundreds of thousands of clients, averaging on the basis of saying a good borrower is &#x2013; I don't think this is practically answering any &#x2013; making any sense for me to mention any number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Then my next question is about interest rates on the retail deposits. You mentioned that you might consider possible increase of interest rates on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (69:40). What would be the timing? Would it happen this year, second half year just your ideas on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are not excluding this happening this year but then again it will depend on how the events progress till then, on the macro-environment etcetera. What I mean to say is that we're not ready to do it now but we don't exclude that there may be conditions that would call for us to do it purely on the macro inflationary and overall rates environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also here a question, I think the Bank has started to introduce new product lines on retail deposits in regional branches.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is right, yes? What is the timeline for introduction in all branches by the Bank, and what would be the net-net result on average cost of funding or average cost of retail deposits <mark type="indiscernible" /> (70:49).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There &#x2013; it is designed to be somewhat neutral. The timing is pretty quick. It is, I think &#x2013; I'm cautious not to give you a wrong number because our head of Retail Business will then give me a hard time for this. So, yeah, I think it's months; it's definitely not beyond I guess the third quarter of this year, and it is more focusing on much closer in alignment to the clients' expectation of sizes, patterns, combination of savings and investment features. In some of the cases we're following the market, for example, like the product which is called investment deposit, where part of it is a deposit, part of it is an investment into a basket of mutual funds or into a branded mutual fund. So these are the type of things that would enhance non-pricing competition for us.</p>
          <p>Again, when we were discussing the macro situation on the previous question, the possibility of the price up in the retail deposits, the key driver there that we also watch very carefully is the market share. We've been around high 47%, low 48% of the market in retail deposits. This is something where we wouldn't want to go much below that; so maybe the market share dynamics would impact how we price the products as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Good. Thank you. And my last question, a small question is about costs, again. I think there were several <mark type="ph" /> maybe (72:58) reports with references to sources in the Bank that the Bank plans to increase salaries from middle of summer and there were even figures, 12% for employees and 20% for managers. Is this the plan? Could you confirm or refute maybe this? And is this is increase for base salaries or for all remuneration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is confirmed. It is roughly for total remuneration, and it is bringing this to the level where our further cost growth on pay will be only very, very marginally be exceeding the inflation, roughly in line. Why I'm saying only sort of very slightly above inflation in the following years, this is because that will reflect the dynamic of us having less people employed but better quality people, and therefore whatever marginal increase over the inflation in the following years will be much more warranted by the bigger sales and revenue numbers that those people should be able to generate or less money to spend on the processes and backup and support.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from Ronny Rehn from KBW. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Anton. Thanks for taking the time to call with us. A few questions from my side as well. First you mentioned on the retail book that you benefit from an improving mix effect. Where sort of are the individual yields on average for mortgages and for consumer? And secondly, do you see something similar happening in the corporate book? In particular, do you see SME demand coming back? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we do see SME demand coming back and we are now in the major engineering of our product line. In fact we went somewhat public on this in the past couple of weeks. Our head of Corporate Business, Andrey Donskih, was making comments to the Russian press on our exact plans. I wouldn't bore you with repeating those but just referring that these are available publicly.</p>
          <p>On the margins in retail, again I can tell you where on average the &#x2013; how does this portfolio yield and it's around 15%. And you can see that the fourth quarter was 14.8%, third quarter was 15.2%, before that it was 14.8%. So it is sort of stable. And currently our mortgages are somewhat lower margin based for a simple reason that we want to stimulate the real estate and the mortgage market a little bit more, and we're sort of leading the charge there, however, only to a limited effect because we've brought our rates on the margins down to the level which is aggressive, better than anyone in the market, but will go not much beyond that because otherwise you risk getting a bit higher risks and the main reason for that approach not generating extremely high pre-crisis levels of growth in the mortgage loan book is because the prices for real estate still remain quite high in terms of affordability for common business or common consumer.</p>
          <p>But the others are, again, as I mentioned, there's more unsecured types of credit for retail clients and therefore there's higher margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clear. I mean, to cut the question short, should we expect further expansion on the retail side or rather not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to the stable outlook of the margins that we are forecasting, the positive effect that comes from the retail part of the book is quite significant, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fantastic. And then maybe a quick one on the volumes. You got like a fifth of your book in FX mainly in dollar. The currency was about what 7% against you in the quarter, so underlying growth was more like 4% rather than the 2.5% you're seeing. What's the FX assumptions that you have implied for your full-year guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That I think implies &#x2013; I'm just checking the exact number in our business plan. I think it is somewhere &#x2013; if you give me a minute or two I will come back with a bit more precise number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the full business plan with me with all the reference data on it, just the main key figures. So I'll mention it in a few minutes down the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we should just go ahead with others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then maybe one last question on the asset quality. First, did you sell NPLs and if so how much? And secondly on your segmental results, sort of the regional results that you disclosed, when I add all those provisions that you disclosed, the regionals together, basically short of the group number by about RUB15 billion, exactly the opposite mix from Q4 where you kind of over RUB15 billion. What explains that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, you're comparing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (79:27) between regions and the Central Office in what quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically, just the total provisions, so you give the --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just provision numbers. So we basically &#x2013; if I add your segments together for third quarter, I would get to zero number. Again, the RUB15 billion release somewhere in the corporate center and exactly a RUB15 billion charge in Q4, so I just want to understand how this works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. These are actually different unrelated numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That have just coincided this particular quarter. There were some of the late aftershock waves of problems with corporate loans occurring in the regions; essentially that caused us to create some of the provisions there, especially when the clients were hanging on there after the crisis but finally letting go. Under the pressure <mark type="ph" /> of the problems swelled <mark type="indiscernible" /> (79:59). In the center we've done some of the recoveries. And normally, for the big chunky transactions, it is actually very difficult to distinguish them because between the sectors and the geographic because for the particular big ones where sorting them out takes a lot of professional expertise that you don't normally hold at the regional level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At some point through the life of those transactions, we actually do an internal transfer from the originating regional to the central office, and then the central office recovery team works with the assets like for a year so &#x2013; to recover it. So when it is shown, it is purely centrally held asset. And this does not contradict IFRS because, again, for all intents and purposes the control over the underlying collateral and the strategy to recover it actually goes back to the center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clear. Clear. And on the NPL sales did you sell any this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't do massive portfolio sales. What we do sometimes our recovery strategy for an individual transaction and that sometimes happens to be sort of sizeable, is after certain efforts and negotiation finding a counterparty that would buy out a particular transaction off of us for a good price. That's one part of the segment and there were some but nothing particularly big to report. And the other end of the spectrum is extremely small, kind of micro sub segment of SME, the corporate loans, which they're just too costly for us to focus our <mark type="ph" /> staff attention on (82:31). And these <mark type="indiscernible" /> (82:34) small regional cut, very small portfolios in particular regional, we have started some pilot sales of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what size are we talking roughly? Are we talking RUB5 billion or are we talking RUB20 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're talking corporate loans of individual ticket size less than RUB5 million each.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've only started this like in the pilot two, three regions and we've only done two, three transactions and each pool would be a few tens, maybe a hundred loans a pop. So these are very tiny thing. This is &#x2013; I'm describing the situation just to give you color in terms of where do we focus on NPL sales and these are just the extreme ends of the spectrum, there are big ones sometimes and there are very small ones.</p>
          <p>In the middle, there have been some large ones, but normally you would just restructure it differently; you'll either sell the underlying collateral or restructuring in some sort of they all go through the bankruptcy <mark type="ph" /> they (83:41) themselves don't <mark type="ph" /> incur that penalty (83:42).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. And super last question, just on the yield, just wanted to make sure in Q4, you had obviously this one-off positive impact on your asset yields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And did we have something similar in Q1 or can we look at this as a clean number, the 9.7% I think for the corporate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi yeah. I just want to ask you guys, if you're thinking about buyback at this time of the privatization would you consider just buying part of the stake from Central Bank? That's pretty much the same, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is pretty clear that actually, the Russian privatization law is directly forbidding this, so <mark type="inaudible" /> (84:39).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You can use a broker, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What?</p>

          <p>You can use someone like &#x2013; you can use a broker or something, that's not an issue, right? I mean, in terms of &#x2013; you cannot &#x2013; not necessarily you want to buy directly but just saying that doing a buyback in terms of privatization it's pretty much the same as buying it directly from your shareholder?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's just, we just chose our work carefully and that we would do everything that not only is directly stated in the law, but what the law implies. We're not looking for loopholes there. We just want to <mark type="ph" /> be free (85:39) and if the law says that you have to be fair to all shareholders and offer them the equal opportunity for buyback without any preference to minority shareholders, this is truly the right thing to do. I mean, we're on investor call, Dmitry what are you proposing to us?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, cool. One other question, it's pretty much follow-up to what Bob was asking, because &#x2013; or to what Paul was asking recently. So pretty much you guys had a reversal in the first quarter and you also had the reversal in April. So that implies that you &#x2013; unless something goes really wrong and you have loss of provisions in May, June, you're going to have a reversal again in the second quarter, so why again wouldn't you like guide us for higher net income range because if you do <mark type="ph" /> RUB20-something (86:40) billion of write-backs in the first half you won't be &#x2013; it'll be difficult to get to RUB250 billion; it should be higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look our provision pool is what, RUB600-something billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there is a lot of difference <mark type="indiscernible" /> (87:04) that is concentrated in every aspects of our business as the rest of the economy, which is less concentrated than other banks, but the Russian economy is still very concentrated itself, so there is the possibility of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (87:25) and or we could get some money, expect some delays and some of the recovery strength for example, I know some bankruptcy with procedure in Russia with a fully cooperating borrowing entity takes here at least 18 months. But it actually shoots up to 36 months if the borrower all of a sudden stops cooperating. So things like that happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's just that you've delivered already like RUB14 billion and pretty much RUB14 billion in April. Again, the impression I got from your answer to Paul is that that's going to actually come in the second quarter IFRS results. So if this is true, I mean, there should be something disastrous coming in the subsequent 3 months to offset that because you're provisioning in the months where you didn't have write-backs <mark type="indiscernible" /> (88:21) billion negative, right. So what I mean is that it seems like there should be a positive charge again in the second quarter. So that it just makes it very difficult modeling-wise for anyone who is participating in this call not to come to a higher number that's why we're torturing you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see, but, okay, if you hang on for 20 seconds, I need to consult with my colleagues.</p>
          <p>Yeah, my colleagues have been reminding me of finer inconsistencies or the differences between the Russian accounting and the IFRS in the way you report the provisions. And that implies that in the provisions line there might be some differences that are a bit more volatile between IFRS and Russian accounting and therefore we're yet to see what the impact of April release are going to be on the second quarter. So, but again, I may not necessarily be able to give you all the reasons because that would imply divulging the knowledge of specific transactions <mark type="indiscernible" /> (89:34) but trust me, we feel <mark type="indiscernible" /> (89:44).</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Anton. A couple questions &#x2013; just a little bit to continue on provision. If you could possibly share with us, what's the cost of risk on the new corporate loans that you currently issue and the same in terms of retail? I remember in retail, you said that <mark type="ph" /> literally (90:13) NPO is close to zero on the new issuance however, what would be the general level of provisions that you keep out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the regulation requires us to &#x2013; just one second, I'm checking the numbers &#x2013; right, corporate loans around &#x2013; the provision for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (90:49) if you look at pages 13, 14, the indication is &#x2013; can be taken &#x2013; this is note seven to the financial statement and page 13 on the financial statements not on the presentation, disclosure provisions and on commercial loans collectively it has been individually impaired. Not past due provisions show you that there is 3.94% level for corporates. For loans it is, consumer 1.6%, mortgages 0.9%, car loans 1.6%, so that should give you a rough indication of where the new loans are coming up to as well. This is because the regulations imply that you have a minimal kind of approach of at least 1% pretty much for everything else and then there's fine-tuning between 1% and 4% that you would come up to if you cleared off &#x2013; off the bad loans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And my second question is actually a follow-up on the buyback. As far as we understand, Mr. Gref was primarily talking about the ordinary shares given that the context of privatization was mentioned. However, would you also consider exploring an option of buying out prefs, given that they play a significant discount to the ordinaries?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anton, and thanks for the call. A couple of small questions from me, one following up on this buyback, I mean, does it have any kind of detrimental impact in terms of you developing, rolling out kind of dividend program? I mean is it something that now is being probably a little bit more in the backburner when there's now all this talk about buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. But then again on the dividend, we need to be precise so that everyone's on the same page. We have &#x2013; after one of our Board meetings in early spring our CEO came out to the press and made the public statement that the supervisory board has given us the staff management task to come up with proposal to revise our dividend policy for the next few years. And responding to your question of would that mean that there should be some positive trends in the dividend policy over a kind of a longer horizon, Mr. Gref has confirmed that. It doesn't mean that immediately in the next year or two there will be very lumpy payouts in terms of the dividends; would rather follow very steady and predictable policy of gradual increases over the five years. And again as Alex Kantarovich referred to in his question, given the capital generation capacity that we have, that type of approach should not be impacted by any talks of a buyback.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's clear enough. In terms of the Central Bank's sale of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (94:49) stake, do you expect there to be any kind of big kind of cornerstone strategic investors taking part in this? Are in any kind of particularly kind of advance talks with anybody about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't rule out possibility of cornerstone investors participating. We're not at the stage of any specific negotiations yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just on costs could you possibly give us a number for the unified social tax charge in the first quarter? Do you have that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it will be meaningful because again the first quarter has a lot of confusion due to seasonality. Well I can give you the full number that is edging to our cost base for the full year as the expected increase from the social security tax of RUB15 billion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello and good evening, Anton. Returning to the P&amp;L statement for the first quarter there was this time around a sizeable other operating income to the tune of RUB7.5 billion. Where was that coming from and more importantly, is it of recurring nature? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is other income that is coming from our non-banking subsidiaries which they generate on probably half of that was one-off and half of it was kind of sustainable I'd say. One-off related with profit/loss recovery because when we get a non-core assets we usually book it to not the banking balance sheet because that's not particularly efficient. So sometimes when we recover cash from those assets' sale we record some other income. And for those assets that are still on the balance there they generate a more or less sustainable stream.</p>
