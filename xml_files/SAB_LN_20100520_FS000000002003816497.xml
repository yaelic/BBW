        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone, welcome to SABMiller's results conference call for our F'10 financial year-ended March 31, 2010. I am Gary Leibowitz, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for SABMiller, and with me today as usual is Malcolm Wyman, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First, the formalities. Our presentation today will contain forward-looking statements reflecting the current best judgment of the management, but include risks and uncertainties and we disclaim any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines.</p>
          <p>So now to get started. We're pleased today with the strong competitive performance of our businesses in markets where consumer spending has remained weak through most of the year. We remain concerned about the lingering effects of the economic downturn on consumers, particularly the delayed recovery in employment among key beer consumer groups. This is more of a problem in developed markets and in here in Europe in particular, than in many emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Our ability to hold volumes flat in the downturn combined with a tight grip on revenues and costs has delivered underlying EBIT growth of 6% and our adjusted EPS delivery was very strong, up 17% with the operating performance enhanced by lower finance costs and a reduced tax rate. Free cash flow was also well up at over $2 billion for the year. And we've made further cost reductions across most of our businesses this year, protecting profitability and in some cases funding increased marketplace investment. In most cases we are already the low-cost industry leader and this reflects our drive for continuous cost improvement.</p>
          <p>Our efforts and the bottoming of consumer spending in some markets have resulted in firming volumes in the last quarter, but in general, spending and employment are lagging in these early stages of economic recovery. Our performance compares well to that of the global peer group, as you can see on the slide here, reflecting some market share gains as well as our better positioning in attractive beer markets. Our organic growth strategies are clearly working.</p>
          <p>Optimizing local brand portfolios' roots to market and operations, our commercial capabilities and growth initiatives are set to continue to deliver strong results over the medium term, and I will now walk through some divisional highlights.</p>
          <p>To start with Latin America, economic conditions showed some signs of easing, particularly in the last quarter. We've succeeded amidst some challenging situations, delivering lager volume growth of 3% for the region overall. In Peru, we've continued to beat the competition while improving segment mix, and in Colombia, notwithstanding an excise increase, volumes have grown recently, reflecting strong market execution and easier comps.</p>
          <p>By upgrading the beer category and expanding our brand impact portfolios, we have increased our share of alcohol in the majority of our markets. Our premium brands represented 9% of our F'10 volume, almost double their share in F'07. Firm pricing, positive mix and cost productivity delivered excellent EBIT growth of 17% and a big improvement in margins despite the challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>As regards MillerCoors in the U.S., you'll have heard the team's remarks on our recent performance earlier this month on our MillerCoors call. Trading conditions have remained difficult with high unemployment the key driver, particularly among demographic groups towards which beer consumption is skewed. We hope to see some improvement in the top line later this year, however, notwithstanding the subdued economy, pricing in the U.S. beer industry remains firm.</p>
          <p>The integration processes going on deep within the JV are progressing well in cost synergy realization as well as in market-facing processes to create a more powerful competitive business. This work covers the JV's own systems, our interfaces with our distributor partners, better channel execution tools in trade and deeper local market opportunity assessments as well as finishing touches to the integration of the former Miller and Coors brand portfolios.</p>
          <p>All in all, this work is starting to show an improved competitive performance within key market segments. MGD 64 and Blue Moon continue to do very well, and Coors Light, Keystone and High Life have gained segment share. And in a weak import market, Peroni Nastro Azzurro continued to grow and will be one of the centerpieces in the JVs new import and craft business, which we announced recently to be led by Tom Cardella.</p>
          <p>Turning to Europe, Europe has continued to be impacted by economic weakness, high unemployment and tighter credit and excise increases. We are pleased with the competitive performance of our full brand portfolios, however; our lead versus the main competitor has widened considerably in Poland and Romania, and we've held share in Czech despite our relatively premium position there amid negative channel and segment mix in that market. In Italy, we made significant improvements in our value extraction via a more focused approach on key brands, channels and price promotion. And in the UK, we're pleased with the continued strong growth of Peroni Nastro Azzurro in the on-premise and in national retailers. And lastly, in Russia, we grew our premium segment share in that market. However, we retain a cautious outlook for the market overall, given the further regulatory proposals the government is considering, which may well restrict the location of beer sales and consumption further.</p>
          <p>In Africa, we've delivered a robust performance across many of our markets on the back of investment in capacity and marketing. Organic lager growth of 6% was driven by the local premium portfolio, which itself grew 65%, with nine new local premium brands launched in the past 12 months. In particular, Mozambique returned to growth, ending up 11%, reflecting improved availability and distribution in the north of the country and Uganda delivered 24% growth through both market expansion and significant share gains versus our lead competitor in that region. And Castle continued its strong run with volume growth of 12% across Francophone Africa as well as Angola. Profitability was restrained by our investments in new capacity as well as temporary headwinds in Angola and movements in commodities and currencies across the continent, but overall, African momentum in top-line growth is strong and we expect profitability to follow suit going forward.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our Chinese operations continue to enjoy a disproportionate share of market growth with CR Snow organic growth of 10%, which is over double the likely market rate of growth during the period, albeit with some slowing in the industry more recently. Our national share in China now exceeds 20%. CR Snow's success in building high market shares regionally and stronger profitability is now showing excellent results in the central region around the Yangtze River Delta, notably in the Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, where our share now exceeds 70% and 35% respectively. Conversely, our Indian operations remain challenged by regulatory hurdles in several provinces and we are taking steps to improve profitability in this difficult context.</p>
          <p>In Australia, our Greenfield Brewery is set to commence production in June. We are very pleased with our progress in Australia, with volumes up 32% and continuing share gains for Peroni Nastro Azzurro.</p>
          <p>Lastly, among the regions in South Africa, improvements in efficiency have enabled a large increase in market-facing investment; these investments have centered on renovating the largest four brands in the portfolio and on servicing the most important classes of trade. The company stands well positioned there to leverage its scale advantages and build on its brand strength. Also in South Africa, volume and competitive performance from our associate Distell was strong, delivering us good performance with rising sales in the cider and RTD categories.</p>
          <p>Turning now very briefly to progress on the group's four strategic priorities, which we have pursued consistently over recent years to deliver value for shareholders. The first of these is creating a balanced and attractive spread of global businesses.</p>
          <p>GDP and population growth are two drivers of what we call the embedded growth of a market. This chart illustrates the proportions of our and our peers' markets, which are expected to offer low, medium and high embedded growth prospects. It is clear that SABMiller is well positioned, as you can see, with the highest proportion of volume in high growth markets, indeed double the exposure of the second peer and considerably less presence in the low-growth areas. This chart is pro forma for the Heineken/FEMSA transaction.</p>
          <p>Nowhere is our positioning and the strength of our positioning more evident than in our rapidly growing African operations. In Africa, our footprint is already far larger than that of any or our peers. We've just last month completed a two-year capacity expansion program adding 4 million hectoliters. This has held back profit growth in the short-term but will in future improve our scale and profitability as we increase the utilization of the new capacity and open new sales territories to reduce transportation costs and sustain strong, long-term growth.</p>
          <p>In addition to expanding our lager footprint in Africa, we are accelerating our development of full beverage portfolios there. Margins are initially diluted given the startup investments and additional complexity of adding on businesses in water and other soft drinks, but ultimately this provides operational and financial scale benefits in small, fragmented markets. For example, we acquired the Voltic water business in Nigeria and Ghana, Rwenzori, the leader in bottled water in Uganda and Ambo in Ethiopia, a venerable local water brand and entry point into the broader beverage market there in Ethiopia.</p>
          <p>Now moving onto our second strategic priority, developing, strong relevant brand portfolios that win in their local marketplaces. Within this strategy our initiatives to develop local premium brands have proven to be very successful. In all our markets, premium domestic brands represent a point of national pride, distinction and a way to satisfy demand for affordable luxury. These brands are typically priced 10 to 20% above mainstream and represent the sweet spot of the beer profit pool, combining significant volume with higher margins and at a far more affordable and accessible price than international imports, which may be a multiple of the price.</p>
          <p>We're making consistent progress across regions with the relevant local premium brands from around the world shown here on the slide, for example Blue Moon, Leinie's and Henry's in the U.S.; Club Colombia and Cusque&#xF1;a in Latin America; Lech, Pilsner Urquell and Kozel in Europe; Castle Lite in South Africa; a host of new similarly positioned national premium brands across Africa, as I mentioned; and in Asia the launch of premium Snow variants is enabling better revenue management with prices often more than double the average in the beer market.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the next slide here, despite the economic pressures, which inevitably results in some down trading, the success of these initiatives has been most visible in Latin America and Africa. In Africa, the launch of nine local premium brands has stimulated the growth, and in Latin America, local premium brands have also been winners, growing at a CAGR of 18% over the last two years. This success has been based on specific consumption occasion insights, packaging innovation, and expanded distribution with attractive merchandising.</p>
          <p>Looking at our portfolio initiatives in Latin America more broadly, we are introducing smaller bottles in hot and humid areas following the success of Aguilita in Colombia. Lighter beers are also being developed to increase consumption frequency and drinking at home with meals; for example, Aguila Lite is [audio break] biggest brand in Colombia, and you may recognize all these examples on the slides from our last Latin America seminar.</p>
          <p>You can see here on the left with Latin America, our focus on both revenue and cost management has produced an attractive ROIC on our initial announced investment of 7.8 billion, plus subsequent cumulative net CapEx. We've exceeded our cost of capital by the fourth full year post the acquisition a year ahead of schedule. And on the right, if you're still on the correct slide you'll see MillerCoors. The management have been able to obtain significant synergies and savings since the formation of the JV in '08, as you know. The combined cost reduction this year has accounted for a total of 375 basis points in margin enhancement, which has kept us on track to deliver a return on capital in F'11 in excess of cost of capital in the U.S., as we forecast when we created the JV.</p>
          <p>Moving on, the development and deployment of our strategic capability initiatives is on track aimed at standardizing and simplifying the business, sustaining our competitive lead in commercial capabilities and cutting costs. Our global sourcing operation has been established in Switzerland. We will soon go live with our new back-office systems in our South African operations and within corporate here in the UK. In Latin America, the front-office system is now running in Peru, serving over 90,000 customers, and we've outsourced the shared service center in South Africa, and by the end of June 2010, we will have done this on three continents. And working capital improvements are already in evidence with better controls and efficiencies generating $333 million in cash flow savings already this year.</p>
          <p>In conjunction with these far-reaching business capability programs, we're continuing to develop the SABMiller organization, in general, focusing country management roles more intensely on our commercial functions, and to do so we are functionalizing or removing non-strategic admin from countries. Taken together, this continuing organizational evolution will both maximize efficiency and increase our local competitive focus.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now hand over to Malcolm to review our financial results for the year. Malcolm?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good day to everyone. As in the past, my presentation will focus on results on an organic constant currency basis, as this better reflects our underlying performance and profitability.</p>
          <p>The group has delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth in the year. Adjusted earnings per share in our reporting currency of U.S. dollars was up 17% whilst adjusted earnings per share growth of 26% was achieved in pound sterling. Final dividend is US$0.51 per share, which brings the annual dividend to $0.68 per share, an increase of 17% over the prior year.</p>
          <p>In a year characterized by difficult trading and economic conditions, we delivered another strong performance, with lager volumes in line with the prior year on an organic basis. The resilience of most of our emerging markets, particularly in the second half of the year, offset volume declines across other markets, illustrating the strength of our global footprint. The strength of our local brand portfolios enabled continued share gains across many of our markets, including China, Peru, Poland, Romania and Uganda. Soft drinks volumes across our Africa and Central America markets grew 2%.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency group revenue grew 4.2% for the full year, up from the 3.1% growth reported at the half year. Revenue growth and tight cost management combined to raise EBITA over 6% on both a reported and an organic constant currency basis. Organic constant currency EBITA margin increased 20 basis points, somewhat lower than the increase reported at the half year.</p>
          <p>Group delivered double-digit earnings per share growth, de-leveraging a 6.5% year-on-year improvement in reported EBITA, into a 17% growth in earnings per share in U.S. dollars. A lower effective tax rate, reduced financing costs and lower profit attributable to minorities principally due to our purchase of the 28.1% interest in our Polish subsidiary, Kompania Piwowarska, all contributed to the strong earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>Group revenue grew 4.2% on an organic constant currency basis, with all regions delivering revenue per hectoliter growth. Strong pricing taken in the prior year, coupled with some selected price increases taken in the second half of this year, underpin the strong group revenue performance.</p>
          <p>Revenue per hectoliter grew 4% in Latin America as a result of pricing and positive mix, with good growth in our premium brands. Despite down trading across many markets in Europe, revenue per hectoliter grew by 6%, reflecting pricing taken in the prior year and principally price increases taken in the Czech Republic and Russia in the second half of this year to recover part of the significant excise increases. In North America MillerCoors grew revenue per hectoliter by 3% following price increases across all beer segments. In Asia, revenue per hectoliter grew by 2% with pricing gains in the first half offset by negative regional mix in the second half in China. And South Africa delivered good revenue per hectoliter growth of 7% following prior and current year price increases across our beer and soft drinks businesses.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the strong full-year group revenue growth, second half net producer revenue was impacted by the cycling of strong price increases taken in the comparative period of the previous year and the recovery of high excise increases in the last quarter of the current financial year.</p>
          <p>Despite lager volumes level with the prior year, we delivered a strong performance, with organic constant currency EBITA growth of 6.3%, reflecting firm pricing, improved effectiveness of marketing spend and fixed cost containments, offset somewhat by an increase in cost of goods sold. As expected, constant currency EBITA growth slowed in the second-half, affected by the cycling of strong price increases taken in the prior year and higher levels of marketing spend and fixed costs in certain markets.</p>
          <p>With some early signs of improved economic conditions, we have increased marketing spend in many markets over the last six months behind our strong brand equities.  Fixed costs have increased in the second-half of the year in markets where additional capacity has been commissioned, but will be more than offset by the expected utilization of this capacity in the current and future years.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, EBITA grew 6.5% as our major operating currencies appreciated against the U.S. dollar in the second half versus the prior year, reversing the adverse currency impact reported in the first half. All of our key operating currencies strengthened over the last six months relative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Full-year raw material input costs were up approximately 4% on the prior year on a constant currency U.S. dollar per hectoliter basis. The rate of raw material cost increases slowed further in the last six months of the year, with the group benefiting from lower brewing raw material prices. Lower distribution costs throughout the year, driven by lower international oil prices and some distribution efficiencies, benefited overall cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>Full-year local raw material costs were negatively impacted by transactional foreign exchange costs, resulting from adverse currency hedges and committed commodity arrangements in many markets. Total cost of goods sold were up approximately 3% on a constant currency dollar per hectoliter basis in the year, following a 12% increase last year.</p>
          <p>I will now move on to group financial considerations. A normalized EBITDA, which includes dividends from the MillerCoors joint venture, was up 1% on last year. Normalized EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points for the full year, principally due to the higher cash exceptional costs incurred in the current year. Our group-wide focus on working capital delivered excellent results, with all regions contributing to the strong full-year working capital inflow of $563 million. This result generated a year-on-year working capital cash inflow improvement of just over $1 billion when compared to last year's results. Business capability initiatives contributed 333 million to the working capital inflow, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure of $1.528 billion was $619 million lower than last year as a number of capacity-related expansion projects initiated in the prior year were completed earlier this year. Capital expenditure in U.S. dollar terms was, however, somewhat inflated by stronger underlying operating currencies. Free cash flow improved by over 1.9 billion versus last year, benefiting from the net working capital improvement and lower capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>The group effective tax rate of 28.5% was 170 basis points lower than last year's rate of 30.2% as a result of a more favorable geographic mix of profits and ongoing tax efficiency initiatives. Our underlying net debt position has improved from the prior financial year-end due to strong cash flow, but this has been offset to some extent by the impact of the appreciation of our currencies against the U.S. dollar and the value of local debts in operating countries.</p>
          <p>Our financial structure improved further with gearing falling significantly to 40.8% and with net debt to normalized EBITDA of 1.8 times. We undertook a major refinancing in July 2009 with a successful debut 1 billion euro bond issue having a maturity of 5.5 years and a coupon of 5.5%. We have also renewed existing facilities as required, demonstrating the financial strength and reputation of the group in banking and capital markets.</p>
          <p>Committed headroom available to the group is in excess of $3 billion as of the 31st of March. The reduction in floating interest rates has reduced our overall cost of debt with our average interest rate for the year of 6.3%, down from last year's average rate of 7.7%. Our weighted average interest rate as of the 31st of March 2010 was 5.7%, as shown on the slide, down from 7.1% at 31 March 2009. The majority of our debt continues to be held at floating rates, benefiting from continued low market interest rates.</p>
          <p>The pie chart on this slide shows our net debt profile by currency after the impact of derivatives. As you can see, we continue to maintain an appropriate and balanced net debt currency profile, given the spread of our businesses. As we report in U.S. dollars, we also keep a reasonable portion of our debt in that currency. Maturity profile indicates that the majority of our debt matures after two years. We currently have substantial headroom available to refinance more than the amount of debt falling due in the next two years in terms of existing undrawn corporate committed facilities and cash resources as well as significant in-country banking facilities.</p>
          <p>The GDP outlook for our emerging markets in 2010 indicates an improvement in economic conditions, but a broader recovery in consumer spending is not expected before the second half of our financial year. Raw material input costs are expected to be flat to marginally down in the current financial year. The benefits of lower brewing raw material costs, in particular reduced barley and hop prices, will be offset to a large extent by higher sugar and packaging raw materials. However, expected firmer local operating currencies against the U.S. dollar will have a favorable impact on many of our raw material costs in some of our major markets.</p>
          <p>We will continue our focus on cash generation this year; the significant working capital improvements achieved in the year will be consolidated and where possible extended, but at a reduced rate, as much of the benefit has now being taken. We expect to reduce capital expenditure to approximately 1.1 billion over the next three years, and in line with this, capital expenditure for the current year is approximately or is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, some $150 million lower than the year under review. This reduction reflects lower capacity-related expenditure, the completion of a number of large capacity projects in Africa and Europe last year.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that finance costs will increase marginally in the current financial year as expected higher interest rates in the second half of the year more than offset lower net debt levels. Finally, our effective tax rate should remain between approximately 28% and 29% this year, reflecting a level which we believe is sustainable, given the current composition of the group.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Malcolm. So to conclude, although the economic environment began to improve for some of our emerging market businesses in the latter part of last year, a more general recovery in employment and consumer spending is not expected until the second half of the year ahead. Price increases will be taken selectively, predominantly in the second half, and we expect raw material input costs for the year to be flat or marginally down. We will continue to implement our cost productivity initiatives while increasing investment in our brands. The group's brand equities and its financial position remains strong and we are well positioned to manage through current trading conditions and to take advantage of a future recovery.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator, we'll be happy to take questions now.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Our first question comes from Lauren Torres of HSBC. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi everyone. My question Malcolm, is if you could talk a bit more about this CapEx reduction as we think about the next three years and how you are splitting maintenance versus expansion and what the opportunities still are for expansion. I was just curious to get your breakdown of that.</p>
          <p>And also, with respect to investing and growing your business, last year, you were quite aggressive on marketing spend, just trying to get a sense of what you are thinking about this year by region and how you are breaking down those type of expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Lauren, first of all, on the CapEx reduction, we see that plenty of CapEx is gone in over the last year or two, right around the group. Not so much in the United States, but if you look at Europe, we have expanded in Romania, Poland, and Russia and also to a certain extent capacity expansion in Czech. In Africa, we are busy and have just opened up four new breweries and expanded two. In Latin America, we were expanding production capacity and in fact, what we have done now is we've closed a brewery in Bogot&#xE1; but mainly for reasons of the fact that it was located right in the center of the city. And so we have enough capacity in our new brewery to which we are in fact moving this one.</p>
          <p>So what we see over the next couple of years is a continued fall-off in expansion capacity. We do see a little bit in places like Africa, where we are having growth, and I would think that also in Latin America, and I know we're putting some expansion capacity into Ecuador planned for this year. So there will be small amounts of expansion capacity just in the areas that we need it.</p>
          <p>Maintenance capacity obviously, maintenance CapEx obviously continues, but included in our CapEx is a large chunk of container, what we call container CapEx, and that is for bottles and crates. And we have a regular program of replacing our bottles in each of our countries because we are probably the largest returnable bottle brewer. So there is a large chunk there, and that will continue, so that the major portion of CapEx is somewhere around the maintenance and containers, which would make up probably just short of 1 billion, and then with small amounts of expansion capacity. And that's how we see that over the next two to three years, just trending down slightly.</p>
          <p>And of course this is predicated on the way we see volumes over the next few years, which is moderate increases in volumes, and should that change obviously then we would come back and have a look at whether this needs to be adjusted in the further years as opposed to the closer years.</p>
          <p>In regard to the marketing spend, we have up-weighted our marketing spend in the last six months. I mentioned that in fact, if you look at Africa, we are up almost double, not quite in the second half. In South Africa, we are up about 50%, in Latin America, it's high single digits. So a lot of marketing spend has been going in, and we would expect to continue that in the first six months of this year, but probably not at the same rate, so that would be slightly less than in the last six months of the previous past financial year. And that is probably fair in those areas in places like Europe, where we're seeing declining volumes and if that continues, obviously marketing spend will probably be maintained, which will be therefore at a higher level per hectoliter.</p>
          <p>So by and large, it is situational, we'll look at each region, we'll see what the competitive dynamics are and we'll assist on an ongoing basis what do we think our, an appropriate level of marketing spend should be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could also ask along the same lines priorities for uses of cash, you know, there has been obviously a lot of consolidation in the industry, curious to get your thoughts on any further opportunities with respect to acquisitions and then looking beyond that, what are your other priorities with respect to uses of cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I think the first, at the moment, the first priority is we are reducing debt, and whilst we have strong cash flow we will obviously continue to do that, but it does place us in a very strong position to take advantage of any consolidation opportunities that may come along.</p>
          <p>Now we believe that by and large a lot of the consolidation opportunities have come and been taken by the major brewers, and going forward we would still see opportunities for consolidation, but certainly not at the same pace as there has been over the last four or five years. So we would think of maintaining a reasonably flexible balance sheet to take advantage of what might happen over the next two years. But at the same time, we do, and it's an obvious issue that if our balance sheet were to become underleveraged then we would have a look at different ways of returning cash to shareholders, for example, but certainly we are nowhere near that level at the moment and we will address that issue if and should that come to pass.</p>

          <p>Hi it's Jason DeRise, UBS. Kind of picking up where we were at the very end of the call this morning, we were talking about the input cost benefit in South Africa, and I guess I just wanted to understand the dollar-linked portion of COGS if that's been reduced. I guess when Norman gave his presentation about a year and a half or so ago, he talked about how that had been rising, I don't know if that's been, if it's changed since then, but we were talking about something like 50 to 80% of COGS being dollar linked. So I was &#x2013; I guess coming back to that question before how much of a benefit would you expect, and then on top of that, would you, or in spite of that, would you then reinvest though in A&amp;P as you did this year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jason obviously the situation in South Africa is complicated by the fact that many of the local commodities and suppliers in fact of packaging raw materials are dollar pricing their supplies to us. So there are two issues at play here, or three.</p>
          <p>There is the actual raw material costs, whether they are commodities or packaging, and obviously we've hedged some of the commodity costs and we have longer-term commitments to purchase raw material packaging supplies.</p>
          <p>There is the second aspect, which is those which are related to imported products. Obviously we cover that forward and it is in that area where we would see the currency that which we've, currency rate at which we've covered those commodities actually moving in our favor over the course of the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>And then of course there's the third aspect, which is the dollar pricing of local supplies, which are mainly in packaging supplies. Now obviously, that moves a little slower than the actual currency rate itself. So whilst the rand was depreciating, we found that we were having to pay a lot more when we were renegotiating our contracts with local suppliers on the basis that that was the dollar parity price. Now as the rand has strengthened, we are locked into some of those contracts, we have some arrangements where we would be able to get some of the benefit, but obviously we don't achieve the benefits as quickly as we would do if we were just buying spot and then covering on the market at that particular point in time.</p>
          <p>So this is bedeviled by medium-term contracts, not only for overseas supplies, but also for local supplies. But I think if I can just try and round that out to say that we would expect that the currency part of our input costs will be more favorable during the course of this year than it has been in the previous year, and obviously, we would expect to see barley costs and hop costs being better, but to a certain extent that it is offset by concentrate prices for our soft drink and also sugar costs.</p>
          <p>So there is some offsetting, and also bear in mind that if you look at commodity costs, they have started to move up. So we are getting the benefit of some of the sort of lower prices that had been there during the course of last year, but in many cases, commodity prices have started to move up again.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then with that end like after we go through all that analysis, do we then just assume whatever benefit you get gets reinvested back into A&amp;P, or will you let some of whatever benefit there is flow to the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that's, I think again, we'll see how much money we need to invest in A&amp;P. We certainly have been putting all of our fixed cost savings back into A&amp;P, but depending on the balance between fixed cost savings this year and savings at the gross profit level, I think we'll take a view as we go during the course of this year. But I think as we did indicate, we are looking for margins to stabilize during the second half of this current year and some of that would come I believe from the lower commodity costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If it's okay, just one other question. When you're talking globally about taking price increases where you can in the second half of the year, should we think about pricing in line with inflation, or would you try to take pricing in the back half of the year above inflation so that the benefit for the whole year is in line with inflation? How should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, very situational. I think we'd need to have a look and see how buoyant each of the markets are at the time and &#x2013; but generally, what we try and do is take price increases round about inflation levels. So we certainly wouldn't want to be putting in price increases at that stage which covered a rate from the beginning of this year, because that would then be double the inflation rate for the second half of the year. So I think you should be thinking about us selectively putting in price increases which would be round about the inflation rate as we saw it at the time that we were putting in the price increases.</p>
          <p>And please bear in mind as well though where we said that we will be taking price increases in the second half. We did not rule out smaller, selective price increases earlier on, which we sometimes have as standard, but they are not major prices increases, they are, certainly we are not saying that there will be absolutely no price increases in the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
