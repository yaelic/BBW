        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us today.  We previewed second quarter earnings three weeks ago and the themes this morning are unchanged.  We are taking aggressive actions to improve our company's growth and earnings performance across all businesses.  Those actions are intended in the short and the long-term to improve our customer focus and financial performance, as well as respond to broader industry and economic pressures present in the overall economy and in our sector specifically.  We expect these actions to strengthen our enterprise and its performance in 2009 and position us for greater advances in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Second quarter results are basically in line with the estimates we provided you on July 2.  Earnings per share of $0.67 exclude special items totaling $0.40 per share.  To briefly touch on these items, first, we agreed to propose settlements of legal claims for historical stock option matters and related costs.  Second, we recognized severance charges related to actions to reduce operating costs.  And finally, we divested a portion of our Medicare Advantage business in Nevada, which brought proceeds that we are required to record as an offset to operating costs in the quarter. Including these special items, we reported earnings of $0.27 per share in the second quarter.  I will use only adjusted numbers for the balance of my remarks this morning.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter -- our first half financial results reflect a number of business developments.  Our overall commercial medical cost trends continue to perform within expectations, while the commercial risk-based benefit businesses are short of expected premium yields and enrollment.  In the seniors business, there are gross margin pressures on Special Needs Plans and in Medicare Part D.  Medicare Advantage growth has meaningfully improved from last year but short of plan on membership and on revenue.  Medicaid and our Enterprise Services businesses are performing very well with the exception of behavioral cost pressures at OptumHealth and some pharma research project cancellations at Ingenix.  We had an unusually intense influenza spike in the first quarter and have a lower interest rate environment for the year.</p>
          <p>We expect the second half of 2008 will proceed like this.  Earnings in line with our revised annual expectations, beginning with the third quarter in the low to mid $0.70 per share range with improved operating margins.  Further profitability gains in the fourth quarter, driven by the seasonal performance of the Medicaid Part D program and by strong high-margin sales at Ingenix.  Full year consolidated and commercial medical care ratios to remain in line, continued reductions in run rate operating costs quarter by quarter, and improved alignment and translation of UnitedHealthcare strategy to local market resources and operations across all UnitedHealth Group health benefit businesses.  A common regional structure with strong regional leaders across all of our health benefit businesses to drive more in-market coordination and leverage performance across the spectrum of common local market needs and opportunities.</p>
          <p>Strength in commercial risk underwriting disciplines across the board to deliver premium yields at or above our projected medical cost trend.  More effective local engagement in marketing and distribution for commercial health plan businesses.  First phase consolidation and focus of clinical care services across all of our health benefit businesses.  A similar consolidation of technology operations across our entire health benefits enterprise that goes hand-in-hand with a tighter and simplified technology and capital spending agenda.  An enterprise-wide commitment to substantially completing all remaining integration efforts by the end of 2010.  An invigorated Medicare Advantage marketing approach for the 2009 open enrollment period, more grassroots in nature with more dedicated and controlled sales and enrollment resources.</p>
          <p>Successful preparation and start-ups for our recent Medicaid market wins.  Continued growth in generic and mail order drug utilization with the Prescription Solutions PBM [Pharmacy Benefit Manager] business.  Operating cash flows in the range of $4 billion in the second half, prior to consideration of the timing of legal settlement payments.  Advancing these items over the next six months and into 2009 will produce a stronger business &#x2013; one that is beginning to again perform in the face of challenging market conditions.</p>
          <p>We will now turn to a discussion of second quarter financial results.  Second quarter revenues of 20.3 billion increased 7% all in year-over-year including 3% organic growth.  Revenues in the quarter included $50 million in realized capital gains on fixed income investments as expected.  The consolidated medical care ratio was 83.2% and the UnitedHealthcare medical ratio excluding national accounts was 82.9%.  If you include national accounts, the UnitedHealthcare ratio was 83.8%.  There was no net change in our estimates of prior period medical costs in the second quarter, whereas last year's second quarter results had a $110 million benefit from prior period development.  This represented a 60 basis point variation in the consolidated medical care ratio year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Our operating cost ratio at 14.6% is excessive and reflects an infrastructure size for growth that did not develop in 2008.  We have taken aggressive action to adjust this and expect to remove 500 million in run rate operating costs by the second quarter of 2009 and continued beyond that.</p>
          <p>Second quarter cash flows from operations were $600 million.  This included the unscheduled return of $170 million in deposits to a continuing customer to accommodate its request.  Second quarter 2008 cash flows were also negatively impacted when compared with the second quarter of 2007 by the timing of more than $700 million in income tax payments, which historically would have been made later in the year.</p>
          <p>We continue to forecast full year adjusted operating cash flows approaching $5 billion.  This is in the area of 1.3 times net income, with strong second half cash flow results as government payments are received and working capital is reduced.  We have already collected nearly $500 million in government receivables this month and received notice of another $250 million for August 1, which will bring down our government receivables balance by $0.75 billion in the third quarter.  We have direct line of sight to cash flows from operations in the area of 1.8 to $2 billion in the third quarter and a comparable amount in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to growth trends, on the services side, our Enterprise Services businesses continued to be on track for strong 2008 revenue growth.  Ingenix is positioned for full year revenue growth exceeding 25% and closed the quarter with backlog of $1.8 billion.  Despite some abrupt and unexpected contract cancellations, Ingenix CRO [Contract Research Organization] sales activity remained solid and its close ratio for the first half of '08 is strong at more than 35% on a dollar basis.  Emerging Ingenix growth areas include consulting services under long-term contracts serving payers, providers, and the government sector.  We are also starting to see more international sales such as the large Northamptonshire Primary Care Trust contract which was secured this month.</p>
          <p>OptumHealth has seen continued strong growth in public sector services, which partially compensate for the membership shortfalls in its ancillary business within UnitedHealthcare and other commercial benefit carriers.  We are targeting full-year revenue growth in the mid to upper single-digit percentages.  OptumHealth Financial Services also continues its strong growth momentum, with now more than $600 million in assets under management, a 50% year-over-year increase.</p>
          <p>As expected, Prescription Solutions revenues decreased due to the previously announced reduction in auto-assigned Part D business as well as increasing generic drug utilization, which is good for consumers while it strengthens our margins.  The Enterprise Services businesses continued to perform well in the aggregate on growth and earnings metrics.  They are each well situated for growth for long-term performance.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the benefit businesses, starting with UnitedHealthcare commercial market.  Our business remained soft in the second quarter, with stable fee-based enrollment and a decrease of 95,000 people in risk-based products.  The commercial market continues to be characterized by low employment levels, intense economic pressure, and strong competition.  On a full year outlook for an 800,000 or more person decrease in risk-based business includes an estimated loss of 350,000 people from PacifiCare and 100,000 in conversions to our fee-based offerings.  Participation in fee-based arrangements continues to run more strongly than originally expected, with current expectations for stable enrollment this year.  Including the Fiserv Health and Sierra acquisitions, we anticipate 2008 gains of about 900,000 consumers for our commercial business in total, which would be a 3% year-over-year increase.</p>
          <p>We continue to see our national commercial health plan medical cost trend at 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points &#x2013; essentially toward the upper end of this range, with the upward pressure coming from inpatient unit costs in California and the Northeast.  Our gross margin pressures relate principally to pricing, where we have not seen the yield advances previously expected and forecasted.</p>
          <p>Relative to pricing, we have not seen changes in the marketplace for risk-based offerings for 2009.  While one can create a case for firming and pricing positions in the market, we are not relying on any improvement in competitive conditions at this time.  I will reiterate that our discipline and long-standing underwriting philosophy and approach is to fully price to our expected cost trend.  There is no change to that approach and there never has been.  But we must become more effective in achieving the premium yields we target and need.  To that end, we will compete differently going forward.</p>
          <p>We're going to do more -- we are going to be more engaged at the local market level and do a better job in support of local market tactics and execution.  Key differences in regional market structures, cost positions, and competitors mean different markets require different approaches.  The goal is to bring customers the largest and most diverse set of resources in the most local way.  This approach, combined with sharper, more disciplined underwriting and continuing gains in service and innovation will once more advance our value to customers.</p>
          <p>On the national customer side, we bring a comprehensive integrated set of service offerings, combined with excellent medical cost trends driven by distinctive, clinical information and intelligence, effectively aligned medical care management, leading quality designation programs, and the broadest network on a single system.  As the 2009 selling season is about half done, we don't yet have a final bead on January 1 results.  At this point, we have lost a couple of high-profile accounts where we believe the business went to the market at lower price points that we were willing to accept.  Accordingly, we expect some membership decline for January 2009 in this market segment.</p>
          <p>In the Medicaid marketplace, AmeriChoice added 375,000 people this quarter, including 55,000 through organic growth, putting them slightly ahead of the growth plan at this stage of the year.  We closed the Unison acquisition on May 30, sooner than expected.  Unison strengthens our public sector business in Tennessee and Pennsylvania and adds market presence in Northeast Ohio, Delaware, South Carolina, and Washington, D.C.</p>
          <p>Two years ago AmeriChoice was struggling.  We reorganized it under new leadership to take better advantage of UnitedHealth Group's resources and to get closer to its market.  Today margins have stabilized and we have the #1 market share in the state Medicare market segment.  In just the past 90 days, we have seen new market wins or contract extensions in Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Washington, D.C. and a double win in Tennessee.  I credit Rick Jelinek and Tony Welters and their team for work well done.  While there is always more to do, in some ways this work represents a template for the direction we are moving in commercial and senior markets.</p>
          <p>In the senior markets, growth results are mixed.  Medicare Supplement is on track to add 125,000 seniors.  Evercare is continuing to win new contracts and expand its state-based programs in markets such as Texas, Hawaii, and New Mexico.  Hospice, while small, is growing nicely.</p>
          <p>Most of our growth in Medicare Advantage this year has come from Special Needs Plans rather than SecureHorizons' traditional HMO product, and accordingly revenues will grow only modestly, roughly 7% organically.  SecureHorizons has the potential to perform better, and that is being addressed with new leadership, stronger control of distribution resources, more grassroots-focused approaches to sales, marketing, and enrollment and adjustments to benefit designs at the county level for 2009.</p>
          <p>We previously discussed the profitability issues with Special Needs Plans this year including for the 80,000 seniors enrolled in our chronic care plans.  We established a $49 million premium deficiency reserve this quarter for those Special Needs Plans, which contributed 30 basis points to our second quarter consolidated medical care ratio.  This reserve is intended to address the loss exposure on these plans for the balance of 2008.  We are confident that our 2009 benefit bid with CMS will fully address benefit underwriting issues, and we will have more specific comments on product positioning later this year after their approval in October.</p>
          <p>I will move from growth to touch further on operations.  As I noted, we are taking aggressive action to address operating costs.  The goal is to achieve the full benefits of the scale of our enterprise, to better support our local businesses in their regions, and to tighten the control processes that led to excessive operating costs relative to our achieved levels of business.</p>
          <p>Let me tell you how each of these goals are within reach.  We are aligning clinical and network organizations and technology operations across our health benefit business units in an effort to improve their focus, simplify their agenda, and eliminate redundancy.  We will get better basic outcomes at lower cost.  We are accelerating multi-year integrations in businesses like OptumHealth and UnitedHealthcare, where there is ample opportunity for performance improvements for customers as well as cost efficiencies as we consolidate redundant operations and processes.  Our clinical operations will be more local market-centered and continue to operate within the boundaries of national clinical policies.  Our relationship with medical societies and professional associations and their inputs regarding issues of science and administrative simplicity, will continue to be core.  We will continue to have a prominent position and brand supporting clinical excellence, which has long been one of the strengths of this organization.</p>
          <p>Collectively, these activities improve visibility, accountability, and speed while freeing up dollars to support investments in local market resources that improve market relationships and responsiveness.  To that end, we are also changing our strategy for advertising, promotion, and distribution in the Medicare market in particular to become more grassroots in local markets and much lower in cost.</p>
          <p>Our final topic this morning is capital.  During unusual market conditions our team has managed our investment portfolio well.  We've avoided material impacts from subprime investments, auction rate securities, and other troubled asset classes, and we have prudently generated $103 million in capital gains in the first two quarters.  As of June 30, we have a gross unrealized capital gain position of $100 million and a net unrealized loss position of $52 million.  Our strategy of investing in a diversified mix of high-quality securities and generating appropriate risk-adjusted return has been appropriate for this market environment.</p>
          <p>We will lower our capital expenditures in 2009 and the supporting expenses will therefore also be lower.  Again, we are focusing our investment agenda on those items which have the greatest favorable impact for customers and our future growth and cutting or deferring items which are lower priorities with lower returns.</p>
          <p>For more than 10 years we have maintained a strong share buyback agenda.  We have viewed this as the most effective way to use excess capital given our view of the potential for our businesses.  Until the last 2 to 3 years that approach has been exceptional, but was clearly not effective over the last two years or more.  However, today even looking at our businesses conservatively with long-term growth rates, margins, and cash flow levels less than we project or less than expected for our sector, our shares appear undervalued and compelling.  Accordingly for the near-term, we believe continued share repurchase to be more accretive than it has ever been &#x2013; exceptionally so.  As our businesses perform at more predictable levels and as our equity returns to a more typical valuation, we will continue to assess rebalancing our capital allocations and evaluate dividend levels in light of our size and the strong cash flows we're capable of consistently producing.</p>
          <p>While market conditions are perhaps less predictable than they have been in a decade, we believe the actions we are taking across our businesses will produce a measured performance recovery in 2009 and set the pace for an accelerating performance level going into 2010 and beyond.  We recognize execution is key.  Only through better execution will the financial markets restore fully the valuation we believe the enterprise is worth as a diversified organization.  In the interim, as we grow some businesses and turn around others, the sensible path is to pursue the returns we believe we are capable of generating through share repurchase given our level of projected operating cash flows and the low relative stock valuation that I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>I will close with a brief summary and some forward-looking comments.  Our focus at this point is on 2009.  I have described the steps we are taking to improve performance.  We are re-focusing regionally and locally, strengthening underwriting discipline, reducing operating costs and capital spending levels, correcting senior product benefits, membership mix, and distribution, opening new Medicaid markets and continuing to execute in our Enterprise Services business.  As we move toward 2009, the results of these steps will be accelerated if the economic environment improves.  For 2008, we continue to project revenues to be in the range of $81 billion with earnings of $2.95 to $3.05 per share, supported by operating cash flows approaching $5 billion as adjusted.</p>
          <p>We appreciate your interest today, and we can now move to questions.  I am joined in this room by many of our senior business colleagues.  John Penshorn, Brett Manderfeld, Mike Mikan and others will continue to be available after this call to respond to questions you may have through the course of the day.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Good morning.  A couple questions; one, specifically on the commercial MLR [Medical Loss Ratio] in the quarter, it was a little bit better than I had expected, and I'm just curious, the 83.3 number that you have out there for the full year, I know it's plus or minus 50 basis points, but as I look at, to get to that number the back half of the year would need to see a significant deterioration in MLR of about &#x2013; I'm measuring about 250 basis points.  As I look back to last year, the MLR was closer to 100 basis points up seasonally.  I'm just curious if there's anything that you can tell us as far as what you think might change there year-over-year.  Or do you think &#x2013; do you think you might be towards the lower end of that plus or minus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to let Mike Mikan kind of respond of this and then I might comment after his comment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Justin, we're going to stick with the guidance that we gave three weeks ago of 83.3 plus or minus 50 basis, but what we're seeing on a year-over-year basis is or what we expect to see is a heavier utilization in July than we saw last year, given that July 4th fell on a Friday this year, last year it fell on a Wednesday as I recall and that was a long weekend.  So, we expect lower outpatient procedures for -- or higher outpatient procedures this year for that time period compared to last year.  So, it really is driven by that for the third quarter.  Typically, I think we've said in the past that we expect the third quarter to seasonally be flat to slightly down from the second quarter.  This year, we'll see it slightly up or up from the second quarter.  And in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect and I think prudently so, the deductible wear-off that will impact the fourth quarter.  So I think we're, our estimates are in line with our expectations.  So, yes, year-over-year, it will be higher this second half than last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Good morning.  What's the biggest challenge to cutting the $500 million from your admin cost structure while at the same time trying to improve customer service?  And, does that 500 million include the CapEx reductions that you referred to or would that be in addition to the 500 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it includes the -- with capital expenditures, there are internal costs that go along with them.  So, it includes that portion of the internal costs.  But, we really have quite a start on this, and I'll let Dave Whichmann kind of respond to give you some of the facts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Charles, a couple of the facts, one of the metrics we're trying to achieve is the reduction of somewhere around 4,000 FTEs in our business, and we've accomplished about 2,000 of that through June 30, and we've had another 1,200 reductions since that timeframe up until today.  So, we have about a remainder of 800 to come out.  But, that will come out net of seasonal adjustments that we need to make to our staffing, which tends to rise seasonally towards the last half of the year to prepare for the first quarter utilization period.  So, that's obviously we're walking &#x2013; we're managing very effectively in getting these head count reductions in place.</p>
          <p>The reason why this isn't nearly as complicated as you might otherwise think is that we did grow quite substantially on a same-store basis our FTE count leading up to about this time last year.  So, we're actually still in excess of last year's count as of June 30.  So, against that, obviously, we've also not grown to our expectations.  So, what we're really doing is right-sizing our labor to respond to the growth that didn't materialize, and that, those changes are in our operations areas &#x2013; sales, local service, et cetera.</p>
          <p>We are also centering our IT agenda on a more narrow set of very important and strategic initiatives.  And, as a result of that, we'll have some labor reductions there as well.  That &#x2013; the 500 million does include some portion of non-capitalizable expenses that generally trail our capital expenditures.  So, those will be eliminated as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, technology, administration, some areas of what I might call internal operations, I think the orientation towards as we say rebalancing towards regions, our favoring the regions and addressing redundancies on the national side of our metrics, those areas that we have found to be most effective we have not really had to look at the service disciplines, et cetera, all of those which have improved significantly over the course of the last year.  So, I appreciate the question.  The next?</p>

          <p>Yeah, Hi Matt.  Our RBC levels are over 300%.  I think we've said before that we are very well capitalized across all our legal entities.  We continue to work with states on getting appropriate dividends from those levels.  But we feel we continue to be very well capitalized and consistent with prior years.</p>

          <p>Hi.  Thanks.  Question on 2009.  I guess, Steve, you did a good job I think of highlighting some of the pluses and minuses.  But could you just sort of outline what are the sort of the biggest pluses and minuses maybe just on the top line?  And could you sort of expand what exactly did measured performance recovery in 2009 mean?  Does that mean earnings &#x2013; you're expecting higher earnings in 2009 than 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Josh, obviously, I am not attempting to provide specific guidance on 2009.  I would say I'll go back to the comments I made as kind of I closed the formal commentary.  I think that the orientation to the local markets for the commercial businesses, I'll use that first, is quite potent.  We have a great deal to offer and I think we can be more effective on a market-by-market basis, making sure we align the right products to the marketplace, look at our and optimize our cost structures in those markets and engage I think more effectively.  And I think we have the right leadership in place with respect to that.  And, so, I think that there, you will see a much more competitive dynamic from United in that basis.  Same might be said of the SecureHorizons' business on a market-by-market basis, particularly in the front-end of the business in terms of the sales, distribution, enrollment disciplines, et cetera.  Expect a much stronger business along those lines.</p>
          <p>Pricing discipline, we are committed to commercial pricing discipline in our risk-based business, and we have made the appropriate corrections with respect to our Medicare benefits for 2009.  So I expect better performance out of all of those, and I think those are all basic, fundamental margin-contributing actions.  We can do a better job in operating costs.  I think as Dave's comment suggested, we are really dealing with what we consider to be excess cost levels and I think those will be &#x2013; you're going to see effects of those in the latter part of 2008 into 2009.  And, the other businesses that we have are quite strong and have a great deal of momentum.</p>
          <p>So, I can be optimistic about 2009 without being specific, recognizing it's a challenging economic marketplace and we are coming from a place, particularly with our commercial risk business, where we have not had momentum and have to recapture that momentum, we're going to do it by engaging the local market.  That's the, I think the best I can do in terms of giving you kind of a body language sense of '09.  And I think 2010 is what I expect to be fully back in stride.</p>

          <p>Hi.  Thanks.  Good morning.  I was just wondering if you could comment on the Medicare bill that passed last week and how you anticipate that might impact your operations going forward.  And then along those lines, just specifically to the group private fee-for-service product, it's not something you've been necessarily seeing a lot of growth in, but where do you see that business going, going forward?  Is there still an opportunity there?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Greg, as you know, we've had a strategy of deliberately positioning ourselves in favor of network-based Medicare Advantage rather than private fee-for-service over the years because we think we can unleash more value from Medicare that way and because of what we perceive to be a slower political risk, risk that is now crystallized in the new law.  So the direct impact on us is minimal, because only around 7% of our Medicare Advantage membership is in private fee-for-service, and of those -- that 100,000 or so members, three-quarters live in areas either unaffected by the law or where we already have network-based alternatives.</p>
          <p>The direct effects are minimal, but we do think that indirectly, the law potentially creates further growth opportunities for us, because obviously the end of deeming will mean that perhaps 80% of the private fee-for-service market will now over the next two years have to migrate to a network-based product, and that's something that we have been predicting and positioning ourselves for.  So essentially 1.7 million private fee-for-service members are going to be triggered into shopping, and as the largest operator of network-based Medicare Advantage with what $100 billion of purchasing power behind us, we hope to be able to capitalize on that opportunity.</p>
          <p>As to the group market, the Congressional policy changes obviously mean that by 2011 group Medicare Advantage members will have to again move to network-based products.  And that again we feel is presenting a meaningful opportunity for us.  In the meantime, we are seeing a pleasing upswing in employer interest in our group Medicare Advantage for 1/1/09.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  I'd like to delve into your local market strategy a little more to understand this, because my questions are three related to that.  One, isn't local market strategy a less efficient, less standardized way of doing business versus a national standardized PPO approach?  How long does it take to roll that out, given how broad a distribution of the -- across the country UnitedHealth currently and still enjoys?  And, how long will it take to get traction do you estimate and how much will it cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might start with a couple of themes and then ask Gail to pick it up.  But, as I think you know, we have operated in what I'll a matrix for several years.  So, we basically maintain a regional structure down to the local market level, and we maintain national what I'll call product line and functional structures, and we have in essence some redundancies in both of those.  And we have been saying for the last year I think that there needs to be a rebalancing back towards local market dynamics.  And this really is a meaningful step and commitment in that direction.</p>
          <p>So we've really operated on those two dimensions for some time.  And we believe that's kind of an 80:20 rule and have for some time.  So while there are common elements across markets and you can truly scale and get the leverage of a enterprise and the consistency that you referenced, that there are meaningful elements that are local in nature, how the products are positioned, the cost structures, the relationships, et cetera that we have not been taking advantage of to the extent we could, and it has made a difference in terms of our competitiveness on a market-by-market basis.  And this effort is really headed in that direction.  From a cost point of view, I actually expect that we will be more effective from a cost structure point of view because we will adjust our cost structure between the national and local level.  Gail, you want to pick up...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Good morning, Sheryl.  Just sort of building on I think Steve's comments, first, let me start with we still plan to use and leverage our national scale, but deploy that more effectively.  And I do think it is about changing and rebalancing from the national and product view that we currently have to a regional and local view, and we have some examples of that already.  So this isn't a brand new model to us.  We've actually been very successful in managing our network contracting under this model for some time.  So we have a very strong national oversight in that.  For example, we have regional leads and local market individuals already deployed.  And you can see those results in our excellent unit cost results that we've driven over a number of years.  So, Sheryl, what we're really doing is we're taking that model that we've used in network very successfully in aligning our clinical, our products and our analytical resources.  The other thing that you need to remember &#x2013; and I think Steve touched on this as well &#x2013; is we already have our financials organized by region and product.  So, we can take a view of that as well.</p>
          <p>As I sort of sum that up, our focus is on strong regional and national &#x2013; strong regional market leadership and disciplined local market execution, and remember this has to be supported by a simplified operating model, and we've already taken those steps to go forward to support those tactics.  So we've reduced our regional structure from six to four, we have new regional leaders in place who know how to execute on this business design and also have a very strong and deep financial and operational health plan experience.  They know how to do this.  They have been through this before.  And as we think about summarizing that, it is going to drive much more specificity on how we take our national resources and deploy them locally.  So, as we think about that, that's how I guess I'd summarize.  We're pretty well prepared to execute on it now and that's where we're moving forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi.  Thank you.  I'm not sure quite what the question is.  It's more of an observation, and you did a very good job of addressing some of my questions and issues.  But I kind of say myself on the one side if you announced this morning that we're going to take our $3 in earnings and we're going to give you $1.50 dividend and $0.75 to run the business and grow the business and $0.75 to use for capital management purposes, my own personal opinion your stock would yield 4% and sell at 37.50.  So it seems on the surface be significantly undervalued, and I'm wondering to what extent this undervaluation is the result of the extreme approach that you, Aetna and WellPoint take in terms of capital management, meaning virtually no dividends at all?</p>
          <p>On the other hand, I say if it's worth 37.50, it's really exciting about the prospect of buying it back so far below fair value.  But then I look and I see in the first half of the year, we spent $2 billion buying 48 million shares back, which is an average price of $41.67, and we talk about spending 3 billion for the year, which means we're going to spend 1 billion at a hell of a lot lower price than we're willing to spend at higher prices.  So I guess the question is are we really facing covenant issues or balance sheet constraints as to why we're not buying back at least as much in the second half as you bought in the first half.  Then second, assuming your policy regarding capital deployment remains the same, that we use our cash flow to buy back equity because we think it's undervalued, and I'm not discouraging you by the way from doing that, could we assume that next year that the 3 billion that we're spending this year could be replicated as a rough idea assuming no dramatic change in the price of stock &#x2013; that the $3 billion ongoing repurchase program in '09 would be a distinct possibility assuming no dramatic change in business or stock price?

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hard to know where to begin, but since you and I have had conversations along these lines, I think that what -- I believe that our thinking was in relative alignment.  There is a compelling opportunity today, we are dedicating our available excess capital to repurchasing our shares, and we'll continue to do so, so long as that valuation looks compelling and looks to be under what a market norm would be.</p>

          <p>...the term is almost your term and that is this could be perhaps more accretive than it has ever been before.  And the only thing that I would then add to that is that at a point in time when I would say that the restoration of the business and its market value reaches a, what we consider to be I guess a more normal level, we will undertake the consideration of a dividend that are probably more expected from an enterprise of our size, scale and with our cash generation capacity, and do that in a measured way and communicate with the marketplace our thinking along those lines as well as any other items that we think should be seriously considered to drive shareholder value without compromising the long-term interest of the operating company.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Wanted to come back to the pricing strategy for 2009, on the early July call you got the question a number of times, and it didn't, at least the perception was there wasn't a real straight answer there, it was a lot of focus on case-by-case underwriting, focus more on local markets, whereas today it seems like you're making a much more definitive statement that you are going to price at or above trend in 2009.

And while I recognized we got into a discussion about how does that play on a case-by-case basis, the core theme is we are going to price to our price, that we are going to price to our cost trend and maintain that discipline and strengthen that discipline down to at the local market level, which is what Gail has alluded to, and we are just confirming that message today.

A couple weeks ago you had mentioned an expectation for medical cost trend in '09 in the 7.5 to 8.5% range, and maybe if you could just talk about within the individual components, which areas you see the most risks for potential acceleration, and then which areas you see the most potential for improvement?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  As Steve said on the July 2 call, we expected and are expecting a cost trend of around 8% plus or minus 50 basis points.  That's slightly up from what we're seeing this year.  We think it's prudent to take that view given we have seen some inpatient unit cost trends, as we've mentioned over the last several calls, in the Northeast as well as the West Coast.  We're really not seeing any dramatic changes other than that.  We have seen some slight up-ticks in orthopedic devices and things like that, but nothing dramatic.  So we think it's prudent at this time to forecast to 8% plus or minus 50 basis points.  And that's where we're expecting right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  There's two primary drivers impacting behavioral benefit costs.  The first one, we underestimated the impact of the Mental Health Parity Legislation that was enacted in New York, and as a result under-priced that business.  We will fix that and factor it into 2009 pricing decisions.  The second one is, across the book, we're seeing some overall increase in utilization as a result of more of our consumers accessing their behavioral health benefits.  So we're seeing a slight increase in penetration.  Again, that will be an underwriting matter, and we will incorporate that as we see appropriate into 2009 pricing.</p>

If all goes well, how does that wind up looking relative to '08?  If all the actions you're taking are successful is -- maybe give us sort of the best case/worst case scenario, directionally, relative to where you expect that to be for '08, any color you could give sort of direction would be helpful?</p>

But if we are committed to pricing to our cost, that to me speaks to margin strengthening -- preservation and strengthening.  I think we can be more effective in medical cost management, and I think we could be more effective in operating cost management.  So I think that those things can improve our performance.  You do have to recognize that as we go into 2009, we have -- 800,000 would be our projection of commercial member loss, which means we will lose those member months and...</p>

We've also focused on reducing our new business discounted pricing.  So we've fundamentally strengthened the underwriting and pricing discipline.  We've also brought some new leadership into our underwriting area, an individual who was leading that three years ago in another part of our business.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first touch on, there's a couple of questions embedded in that.  One is, as we look at our yield issues, we talked a little bit about this a few weeks ago.  First, we didn't see the acceleration that we expected in post-first quarter.  Second, we had a mix shift because of the 800,000 fully insured lives that we're going to see a decline in, and that, that's a big driver of what happened.  Then finally, this mix of new business was greater than in prior years and again the case-by-case negotiations.</p>
          <p>So, a lot of why we expect, and you get back to the leadership issue, again strengthening our resolve around case-by-case negotiations, which I just talked about, also greater visibility and insight as we talk about the financial leadership in the regions, which we've dramatically strengthened with the changes that we've made and also strengthening the leadership in our underwriting area.  So part of this is much better visibility into the types of products we're positioning in the market and selling, and we do have I believe through more engagement in the local market an opportunity to manage that better.  We're not doing this passively.  We're going to be aggressively managing that as we roll this out to the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, because your assessment, you didn't see it as a systematic control issue then as you've kind of looked at -- this sounds more like about products that were sold and some leadership issues than a systematic control issue, is that your, fair characterization of your assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't -- we don't have a systematic control issue.  We have good, strong national control.  So it really is a mix of business, again, that we can focus back on what happened as we look at the yield.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question will come from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks.  You did a good job in terms of giving a sense of the competitive dynamic, some pricing on the commercial health plan business.  I was wondering if you could provide an update on the pharmacy benefit management side of your business, how it's comparing to last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we can.  In terms of the performance of that business, it has had some nice steady growth, but its real performance has been driven by the concentration and improvement in penetration of mail order itself and in generics.  And I think that has been the story.  We are also in-sourcing all our specialty pharma through Rx Solutions, and while that is evolving, that is very good for both our benefit businesses and for Rx Solutions itself.  And Bill, you might have any other comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you said it well.  2008 has been a year where Prescription Solutions has been focusing on improving generic penetration, and the results have been nice in that area, and also improving mail service penetration, and those results have been productive.  And as Steve said, then we're pleased with the progress so far from the standpoint that it not only lowers costs, but improves our margin in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But how about if you look externally, are you seeing anybody particularly aggressive on price and changing the dynamics in that business, or is it pretty much steady state compared to last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My experience would be that it is a competitive market.  It always has been a competitive market.  But I haven't seen any significant change in dynamics, to answer your question.</p>

          <p>Correct.</p>

          <p>Yep, but with strong competitors.</p>

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Brian Guyker with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys.  I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on capital structure.  I was wondering if you have a target leverage ratio, debt to EBITDA, and can you offer any specifics on share buyback plans, for example, if you plan to use any debt to finance the buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Mike respond to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I missed the second part of the question.  Can you repeat the second part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  The second part was, if you could comment at all on specifics of the share buyback plans?  For example, if you plan to use any debt to finance the buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; as we've stated before, we are estimating to maintain our debt-to-total capital ratio of around 40%.  It has adjusted above that or has closed out above that in the second quarter as a result of the litigation charge that we took or the proposed settlement charge that we took.  We expect to remain around that for the foreseeable future.  So I don't see any change with that.  And then we fund our repurchase program using our cash -- operating cash flow.</p>

          <p>We'll take two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The next question comes from the line of Al Copersino with Madoff Investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not sure what that was.  But Steve, I had a question.  We clearly are not in a situation the industry was in, in the '80s and '90s where because of a severe cyclicality...  Hey, Steve, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You could &#x2013; I'd be benefited by starting over that, and I don't what you have in the background there, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, nothing here.  Can you hear me okay now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Let's try again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I was just saying that we obviously, even with the greater challenges this year for several companies, we're not in that vicious cycle the industry was in, in the '80s and '90s, a few good years, a few bad years.  The industry has remained it seems relatively disciplined on pricing I think the last few years.  That combined with a slowing economy, I'm just wondering first of all if you agree with this, with this hypothesis that we're at a point now where it's just getting more and more difficult for employers to afford some of the managed care risk products.  Do you -- would you agree with that hypothesis, and if so, what does United do about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of pressure on benefit affordability, I think that has been in the environment for some time and it's always a relative thing.  But we continue to see employers supporting benefits, carrying benefits, and being very much committed to them and actually integrating them more and more with their total employee relationship and approach to their workforce.  So what we've seen employers do is then pursue products that have lower content, have consumer engagement elements, and begin to engage the consumer as we've said for years into participating in this health relationship with them.  And we are actually seeing more commitment than ever on the employer side to engaging on that kind of level, which actually gets them more involved in the benefits, and they're seeing positive things.  We can -- our trends for many of our large clients have been quite exceptional this year as they have engaged in these kinds of programs.  And, Gail, I don't know if you would like to add color to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd concur with Steve's comments.  I think affordability is absolutely an issue that employers are very focused on.  We have a broad portfolio, a leading consumerism platform, and we're seeing and continuing to and to bring new products to market &#x2013; those are tailored based on the specific market needs.  But in the small group we see a continuing purchasing of leaner benefit products and continuing buying of those.  So I think we're going to continue to see that trend.  In the upper end, consumer engagement continues to be an important position and that's an area where our innovation I think serves us extremely well.  So we are very focused on both product design and then secondarily, actually equally as important is helping to manage the medical costs and a renewed focus on that.  So both of those I think tie very much into the affordability discussion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So while your premise that there is tension and what I might characterize as a healthcare crisis, that's almost a prevailing environment, and more and more I think are relevance to &#x2013; as an industry, to the marketplace to be able to provide these benefits and manage costs effectively and help employers and their employees, I think our market value actually continues to increase and our executional abilities as an industry are getting better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question will come from the line of Peter Costa with FTN Midwest Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thanks for taking the call.  I guess I'm still a little bit confused as to how your premium yield problem is going to get resolved by moving decision making closer to local management, which you would think would be even more concerned about losing a group and perhaps be willing to cut price to keep that group, and maybe you can answer that question by explaining a little more specifically what the 350,000 lives that are not the PacifiCare lives, that are not the conversions, but the other 350,000 lives, what were those lives &#x2013; were they small group, mid-group, were they geographically specific, were they product specific?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Gail, do you want to react to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  First, let me clarify.  This is again a balanced strategy.  We have strong national underwriting controls and we manage this, again, pricing is managed on a market-product-segment specific basis.  So it is the combination of the national controls with local insights, because pricing again is both mathematical as well as assessment of the market conditions.  So, again, we're pricing to beat our cost trend.</p>
          <p>Getting back to sort of that distribution question you asked, as we look at the overall numbers, it breaks down between, as you said, 350,000 from PacifiCare, 100,000 in conversions, roughly 100,000 in just attrition in the book and then it's a balance between our small book of business and our middle market, and we do see a concentration again in certain states and California being one of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I might also broadly just suggest that it's, we talk about pricing, but it's really a broad underwriting dynamic, and it's really putting the right product and basically crafting a solution for a customer that will perform for the customer and drive the margins that we are looking for from an underwriting point of view, and that takes the degree of intimacy that has to be achieved at the local market level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's all the time -- maybe before we go, I might just touch on a couple of the themes again for the quarter, that basically our results were in line with what we had reported three weeks ago, but there are strong elements of our business that are growing quite well including AmeriChoice, Ingenix, our Enterprise Services businesses.  And in the businesses that are more challenged, we are taking actions to improve our growth and financial performance and the strength in our operations across the board.  And as we make progress on this through the balance of this year and into 2009, I think you will see our performance come in more in line to what you have historically expected from us, and this will only get better if the economic environment strengthens.  So we appreciate your interest today.  Thank you.</p>
