        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 2011 Half Year Results Presentation. And it's really nice not to have the pillars in the way in terms of looking at you.</p>
          <p>I'm Alison Cooper, Chief Executive of Imperial, and I'm here today with our Finance Director, Bob Dyrbus, and other members of our Senior Management Team. And maybe just to mention, for those of you who haven't met them before; got Roberto Funari here on the front row, Group Marketing Director, and Arthur van Benthem, Group Sales Director, in case anyone wants to say hello afterwards. The others I think you have met at Investor Days.</p>
          <p>Well, I'm pleased to be presenting another good set of results, which highlight the strength of our growth strategy. We delivered successes across our international footprint, driving growth through our unique Total Tobacco portfolio. Volumes of our key cigarette brands, fine cut tobacco, luxury Cuban cigars and snus were all up with gains in EU and non-EU markets.</p>
          <p>Our focus on building sales, whilst effectively managing costs and cash, are key to our growth and enable us to create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We're investing in brands, products and capacity to support our sales growth agenda, enabling us to capitalize on consumer growth segments. And in maintaining our disciplined approach to investment and cost management, we've also increased tobacco adjusted operating margin in the first half.</p>
          <p>Effectively managing the cash we generate is a key element of delivering returns to shareholders. Twelve month cash conversion was again strong at 98%, and today we've announced plans to further increase dividends in 2012 and beyond, and the share buyback program, which starts immediately.</p>
          <p>Turning to the first half headline numbers, in terms of our overall volume performance, total stick equivalent volumes were down just 0.7% in the first half, a pleasing result given the difficult trading conditions in Spain. And looking at year-on-year comparatives, this half has been significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation, principally the euro.</p>
          <p>Performance is, therefore, better understood using constant currency, which will be the basis of our comments today. On that basis, tobacco net revenues were up 2.7%, tobacco adjusted operating profit up by 3.8%, and adjusted earnings per share up by 7%. The interim dividend is 28.1 pence per share, and, as usual, this represents a third of last year's total dividend, an increase of around 16% on last year's interim.</p>
          <p>In our pre-close trading update, we highlighted a shift in trade buying patterns in the U.K. from the first to the second half. And just to give you a feel for our underlying performance, if we adjust for our results for this and exclude Spain given the exceptional environment, Group stick equivalent volumes were up 1%, revenues up 4.4% and tobacco operating profits up over 7%. And the chart also shows our underlying performance in the EU.</p>
          <p>As you're aware, we generate a lot of cash, and how we use that cash is a key component of our value creating strategy. We've been very successful in reducing our debt and earlier this year announced that we expect to reach a 50% payout ratio for 2011. Thereafter, we expect to further increase the payout ratio, with dividends per share continuing to grow steadily ahead of adjusted earnings per share over the long-term.</p>
          <p>In addition, we'll begin a share buyback program effective today at an annualized rate of &#xA3;500 million, and Bob will provide you with more detail later.</p>
          <p>So returning to today's results. We uniquely provide consumers with experiences across the tobacco spectrum. We refer to it as Total Tobacco. This gives us opportunities to capitalize on consumer growth segments across our market portfolio, driving underlying sales growth in the EU and 7% sales growth outside of the EU.</p>
          <p>In the first half, we grew combined cigarette volumes of our global strategic brands Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes and West by 5%, reflecting our success in emerging markets outside the EU. And together, these three brands now account for 23% of our total cigarette volumes.</p>
          <p>And we achieved another excellent performance from our international cigarette brand JPS, with volumes up 16%. We also grew fine cut tobacco volumes by 5%. Habanos cigar sales are very strong outside the EU, increasing by 16%, and we grew snus volumes by 19%.</p>
          <p>Let me focus now on each of these headlines. Our investments in the rejuvenation of Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes and West with new formats and variants have made these brands more dynamic and relevant for today's consumers.</p>
          <p>Davidoff had an excellent first half, growing 9% with very strong performances in a number of key markets in Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East. In 19 of its top 20 markets, Davidoff either grew or maintained its share. The core premium line franchise grew over 8%, and we've made very encouraging progress with new variants such as king size super slims; with improved volumes of Gauloises Blonde, our biggest selling brand, by 5% following the supply disruption last year, with good results across Africa and the Middle East, including Morocco and Algeria.</p>
          <p>And finally West, our leading international value brand, grew 1%, performing well in Eastern Europe, where new variants such as West Fusion, our King Size Super Slims offering, have provided consumers with an innovative product at an attractive price.</p>
          <p>We've also been evolving the JPS portfolio, reinforcing its smart choice positioning with the consumer, being premium on everything but price. And this is reflected in another excellent performance. Volumes were up 16% overall with strong growth in the U.K., Germany and Australia.</p>
          <p>We achieved a significant milestone in Germany this half, with JPS capturing 10% market share for the first time, confirming its position as the second largest brand in the market, while rapid growth in Australia has resulted in the brand achieving 3.8% market share, up from 2.2% last year.</p>
          <p>Fine cut tobacco is in growth in many EU markets, and we've continued to capitalize on our leadership in this segment to drive volumes up 5% in the first half, and this was complemented by strong growth in papers up 8%, tubes up 12%.</p>
          <p>A key element of our fine cut tobacco success story has been leveraging cigarette brand equity into fine cut tobacco and JPS is a great example of this, having achieved 6% volume growth this half and the brand now accounts for almost 9% of the German fine cut tobacco market and 3% in France.</p>
          <p>We're focused on building on this success and recently launched JPS roll your own and make your own in the U.K. and Ireland.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, we've been very successful with West, particularly in make your own, and delivered 10% volume growth in the first half. Route 66 is also gaining traction, achieving excellent results in our Rest of EU region. The brand now represents over 11% of our total fine cut tobacco volumes.</p>
          <p>In cigars, our luxury Habanos portfolio grew sales outside the EU by 16% and delivered 2% overall volume growth; that's a great performance given Spain is the largest Habanos market. Cohiba, Romeo y Julieta, Partagas, Hoyo del Monterrey and H. Upmann all grew volumes.</p>
          <p>In terms of market, volume growth was driven by very strong performances outside the EU including Russia, Brazil, the Middle East, Asia and, in particular, China.</p>
          <p>And finally, our highly successful snus business, where total volumes grew 19% across Sweden and Norway, with growth in Skruf and Knox. Both brands were recently rejuvenated and, with our new factory having removed capacity limitations, we're well placed to drive further growth in this category.</p>
          <p>Turning to our markets. One of the key consumer trends in the EU is the move to value and we're well placed to capitalize on this trend given the versatility of our Total Tobacco approach. We have strong representation in all key tobacco segments and at all price points, providing us with the flexibility to respond to consumer growth trends.</p>
          <p>This has meant we have reinforced our leadership in the U.K. with a stable cigarette share and increased cigarette and fine cut share in Germany. Spain continues to be a difficult market, but there are growth opportunities and we've grown our domestic fine cut tobacco share and our domestic cigarette share has been improving in recent months.</p>
          <p>We've made further notable gains in the Rest of EU, with JPS volumes up 12%, and total fine cut tobacco volumes up 5% across the region. In the U.S.A it's also a value-seeking story, with consumers economizing in cigarettes and cigars in a very competitive environment and earlier this month we began integrating our cigarette and mass market cigar sales forces to further strengthen our customer and consumer interface.</p>
          <p>In our Rest of World region, we're capitalizing on the considerable growth opportunities there are for us to develop this business. We're driving growth in key consumer segments through the success of our global strategic cigarette brands and our strong portfolio of local and regional brands.</p>
          <p>Profits grew over 30% in Eastern Europe, by over 20% in Asia and just under 10% in Africa and the Middle East. In addition, there is great potential for our prestigious Cuban cigar brands and we achieved significant growth in a number of major emerging markets, including China, Russia and Brazil.</p>
          <p>Total EU volumes were down 4.5% or 3.6 billion sticks, whereas outside the EU they grew by 2.4 billion sticks, nearly 3%. In the EU, our reported performance was in line with the market. In the U.K., the shift in trade buying patterns from the first to second half accounted for more than half the volume decline, with underlying U.K. volumes down around 4%.</p>
          <p>In Germany, our share growth in cigarette and fine cut tobacco generated volume growth of 3% in a stable market, roughly 0.5 billion sticks.</p>
          <p>And in Spain, our stick equivalent volume performance was in line with the market. There are challenges, but there are also growth opportunities, and we're making good progress in queen size cigarette, in fine cut tobacco and cigarillo growth segments.</p>
          <p>In our Rest of EU region, our volumes declined 2.1% against a market decline of over 4%, reflecting strong share growth performances across cigarette and fine cut tobacco in a number of markets, including Austria, Czech Republic, Poland and Portugal.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., Fortuna sales were strong in the first half and we also grew volumes in our fine cut tobacco business.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, we continue to make gains in growing segments and grew volumes of Davidoff and Style in Russia and Ukraine. Our volumes were down just 0.6%, with Russia and Ukraine stabilizing, and we're up 1% excluding Balkan Star.</p>
          <p>Markets continue to grow across the Africa and Middle East region and we delivered a strong half with volumes up 4%, driven by growth in a number of markets, including Morocco and Saudi Arabia.</p>
          <p>In Asia-Pacific, volumes increased nearly 7%, driven by growth in Laos, Vietnam and in South Korea following the launch of Davidoff.</p>
          <p>Turning now to look at our tobacco net revenues on a constant currency basis where, despite the impact of Spain and a shift in the trade buying patterns in the U.K, overall EU revenues were stable and non-EU revenues were up &#xA3;90 million or 7%.</p>
          <p>U.K. revenues were down 5%, impacted by the shift in trade buying patterns. German revenues increased 1% and Rest of EU increased by 5%; see the absolute amounts on the chart.</p>
          <p>America's revenues were down 1% as we continue to invest in price support behind our brands while our Rest of World revenues were up 9%. Africa and Middle East revenues up over 4% and Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific and Duty Free all reported revenues up 9% or more, reflecting excellent price mix driven by growth in our global strategic brands across the Rest of the World region.</p>
          <p>My review of our operational performance has given you a sense of how we are driving growth in our business through Total Tobacco, with underlying sales up in EU and strong performance outside the EU.</p>
          <p>Our global strategic brands, fine cut tobacco portfolio, snus and Habanos all had a strong first half. Total Tobacco gives us a unique opportunity and one which we'll continue to exploit.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand it over to Bob to go through the related Group results.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I'll start with an overview of the results. This table shows reconciliation between reported and constant currency numbers. As Alison mentioned, this half year has been significantly impacted by foreign exchange translation, principally the euro-sterling exchange rate, and I'll focus on constant &#x2013; a constant currency analysis in all my comments.</p>
          <p>There was no transactional impact from foreign exchange in the first half. Tobacco net revenues rose by 2.7% while Logistics distribution fees were down 1.5%. Tobacco adjusted operating profit increased by 3.8%, with margins slightly up and Logistics adjusted operating profit declined 3.4%, giving combined growth of 3.3%.</p>
          <p>Further repayment of bank debt, partially offset by a minor increase in average cost of net debt, meant that our interest charge for the period was down 3% on last year. After tax being charged at an effective rate of 24.5%, adjusted earnings per share grew by 7%.</p>
          <p>Results have been adjusted and presented on our usual basis, with the main difference the reported results being amortization of acquired intangibles of &#xA3;210 million, fair value losses on derivative financial instruments of &#xA3;47 million, and the exclusion of a one-off tax provision releases of &#xA3;205 million, as we've resolved certain prior-year tax matters. And there are further details in the appendices.</p>
          <p>I've split the analysis of tobacco constant currency operating profit growth of 3.8% between EU and non-EU markets, and highlighted the absolute profit movements on this and the subsequent slides; starting with the EU, where U.K. operating profits declined by 5% due to the shift in trade buying patterns. In Germany, share growth in both cigarette and fine cut tobacco drove a 7% increase in profits aided by ongoing efficiencies in the business.</p>
          <p>Our performance in Spain reflects a difficult economy and the public smoking ban. And in the Rest of the EU, operating profit was up 2% with growth in a number of markets being partly offset by weaker performances in markets affected by the financial crisis, notably Greece.</p>
          <p>In our non-EU operations, starting with the Americas, and principally the U.S. where, despite a highly competitive market, we grew our profits by 3%.</p>
          <p>We increased profits in our Rest of the World region by 18%, with all sub-regions performing strongly. In Eastern Europe, we grew profits by over 30% benefiting from improved pricing and strong performances from our global strategic brands and a number of regional brands.</p>
          <p>In Asia-Pacific, our share gains across the region generated profit growth of over 20%, and our Africa and Middle East region also performed well, with volume growth driving profits up close to 10%.</p>
          <p>And our Cuban cigar business has also made good progress, particularly so given Spain, increasing profits by more than 10%. Overall, we grew profits outside the EU by 15%.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we've grown our constant currency tobacco margin by just under 0.5 percentage point.</p>
          <p>We maintain our cost disciplines whilst continuing to invest for growth, in brands, in growing segments or in expanding capacity. We will continue to focus on maximizing the returns from our assets and there are still opportunities for us to become more effective, and the merger of our U.S. cigarette and mass market cigar sales forces is a current example.</p>
          <p>In Logistics, profits declined 3%. In tobacco logistics, growth in cigars and fine cut tobacco has helped offset the decline in cigarette volumes in Spain, and we've taken further costs out of the business.</p>
          <p>In other logistics, our transport operations performed well, but the weak economic environment has impacted other areas of our business. Our ongoing cost savings program continues to focus on maximizing profitability.</p>
          <p>So, looking ahead to the remainder of the year, firstly in the EU. In the U.K., we expect a stronger performance in the second half as a shift in trade buying patterns unwinds. In Germany, the market remains strong and we will build on the share gains we've delivered in the first half with recent price increases further benefiting results.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we expect the challenging environment to persist. Against this backdrop, we're focused on delivering further successes from our value portfolio and taking share in the growing consumer segments.</p>
          <p>Across the Rest of EU, we're focused on driving the continued success of our cigarette portfolio, cigarette branded fine cut tobacco products and our snus business. Outside the EU, we'll build on the results we've delivered in the first half of the year, particularly with our global strategic cigarette brands, Davidoff, Gauloises Blonde and West, and our luxury Cuban cigar portfolio.</p>
          <p>In the USA, the market remains competitive, though the rate of volume decline has stabilized and combining our cigarette and mass market cigar sales forces will strengthen our position.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, market conditions in Russia and Ukraine are more stable and we are focused on increasing our market shares in growing consumer segments such as Super Slims and King Size Super Slims.</p>
          <p>In Africa, market volumes are growing and our strong portfolio of local and regional brands should continue to perform well, while in the Middle East we seek to further grow sales, particularly with Davidoff and Gauloises Blonde. In Asia-Pacific, we'll further build on our improving positions in our key markets across the region.</p>
          <p>In logistics, we'll continue to identify growth opportunities and manage our costs in a difficult trading environment.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the financing of the business; at the end of March, our closing net debt was &#xA3;10.1 billion, reflecting the usual first half net working capital outflow and the final dividend payment.</p>
          <p>Working capital outflows were &#xA3;700 million and included the unwinding of last year's one-off timing benefit in our Italian logistics business. Despite this, the working capital outflow was &#xA3;100 million less than last year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure, tax and interest payments are comparable to last year, while end-March cross rates means foreign exchange has not been a material impact on our net debt position when compared to September 2010.</p>
          <p>Measured over the last 12 months and, thereby, capturing the full business cycle, cash conversion was 98% towards the top end of our 90% to 100% target range. Our average adjusted net debt for the period fell to &#xA3;10.3 billion, some &#xA3;1.3 billion down on last year. And last December, we took advantage of lower credit spreads and refinanced &#xA3;2.5 billion of bank facilities until 2015, ahead of their maturity in July of next year.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, our all-in average cost of net debt rose to 6.1%, partly as a result of this refinancing and because our cash flow can only be used to reduce the relatively low cost revolving credit facilities.</p>
          <p>Our net interest charge fell to &#xA3;280 million on the back of reduced debt levels, while our interest cover improved to over 5.5 times. The appendices contain further details on our interest rate fixings and debt maturities.</p>
          <p>Guidance for our average interest costs for the full year is around 6.1%, slightly down on our previous estimates, as underlying rates have not risen as &#x2013; as much as implied by yield curves at the start of the year. Our tax rate will remain at around 24.5%.</p>
          <p>As usual, we expect the normal first half working capital outflow to unwind in the second half. We anticipate a year-end outflow in the region of &#xA3;100 million, reflecting the unwinding of the timing benefit in our logistics business.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash utilization, as Alison said earlier, our strategy is about delivering sustainable shareholder returns with efficient cash utilization, a key component of value creation. Following successful debt pay down and announcing the 50% dividend payout for 2011, we've reviewed our options as to how to best to deploy our ongoing strong cash flows.</p>
          <p>Our dividend yield is around 4.5% and our shares trade on a PE of around 11 times based on 2011 forecasts. A higher dividend payout and share buybacks are not mutually exclusive, and noting where our shares trade, we recognize the value in both.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, from a base of around a 4.5% dividend yield, we envisage growing dividends per share ahead of earnings per share over the long-term, thereby steadily increasing the payout ratio.</p>
          <p>By steadily increasing the payout ratio, we are able to offer strong dividend growth from an already attractive yield, while also employing share buyback programs starting immediately at an annualized rate of &#xA3;500 million.</p>
          <p>Absent M&amp;A, for which, as always, returns have to exceed both a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital and the returns from a share buyback, utilizing a combination of steadily increasing payout ratio and an appropriate level of share buybacks allows us to maximize our cash returns and maintain an appropriate capital structure.</p>
          <p>So thank you. I'd now like to hand you back to Alison to conclude the presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our portfolio is the most comprehensive in the industry and this Total Tobacco approach provides many growth opportunities, opportunities we're capitalizing on as we've demonstrated today.</p>
          <p>Sales grew 3% in the first half. We grew combined cigarette volumes of our global strategic brands Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes and West by 5%. JPS volumes were up 16% and we grew fine cut tobacco volumes 5% and Habanos sales grew 16% outside the EU, with Snus up 19%, and we remain focused on building on this momentum in the second half.</p>
          <p>Our good performance in the first half reflects our continuing focus on the there key components of our growth strategy: sales, costs and cash. Consumer choices are continually evolving and it is our understanding of these consumers, coupled with the versatility of our brand and product portfolio, that will continue to ensure that we make the most of our sales growth opportunities, and that sales success will be enhanced by a diligent approach to managing costs and cash.</p>
          <p>We maintain our cost discipline while continuing to invest behind our portfolio to drive sustainable sales, while dividend increases in 2011 and beyond and our share buyback program will return excess cash to shareholders further enhancing returns. We have the assets, the opportunities and the capabilities to deliver long-term success.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And we'll now take any questions that you have. As usual, the presentation is being recorded, so if you could wait for microphone before speaking and then state your name and organization, that would be helpful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. David Hayes from Nomura. Two questions, if I can. Just on the dividend payout, I guess, the obvious question maybe. I just wonder if you'd be more specific about what the target is. Is it kind of a 65% payout ratio benchmark level, and what's sort of the pace of getting towards that target?</p>
          <p>And, then secondly, on trading, in terms of the U.K., obviously the tax rise, price rise, <mark type="ph" /> just saw a (28:16) month or so ago, pretty quite soon. But I just wonder whether you can talk about what impact that is having in the marketplace in terms of volumes and mix. Well, how that might affect the second half performance? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll maybe let Bob comment as well, in terms of the dividend payout ratio. We haven't set a target for the dividend payout ratio. The objective is to gradually increase that dividend payout ratio, with earnings growing and dividends growing ahead of earnings per share growth and the same is over the long-term. So we see that as a continuing rise in the dividend payout ratio. Bob, do you want to comment as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That &#x2013; that, I think that's where we see ourselves, and, as we said, I mean, it's a mix between dividends and buybacks are not mutually exclusive. Buybacks are &#x2013; basically, we'll employ them when the returns justify it for our shareholders, and so, rather than being tied in &#x2013; and our benchmark is basically delivering value to shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I pick up on the U.K. point. Yes, tax increase, price increases in the market, clearly, but usually with the normal elasticity aspect, the softening of the market. Following that, we've already got clearly consumers economizing in the U.K., as we have had for a very long time in the U.K. So, it's a question of positioning the portfolio to maximize on that.</p>
          <p>I think, particularly, the recent launch of JPS <mark type="ph" /> Rio and Mio (29:36) has been very helpful in that regard as well, and a very appropriate time in the market for those products to be launched, particularly the <mark type="ph" /> Rio (29:44) brand; just early days, indications it's beginning to pick up quite well. So that's the challenge for us in the U.K. But overall, I would say actually April has been a fairly strong month &#x2013; stronger than we expected in the U.K. I'm not going to make any link to the weather.</p>

          <p>Hi, morning, Martin Deboo, Investec. Question on Spain, question on Australia. Spain, let's leave the market and the Spanish economy out of it, but you are losing share in that market on the numbers you've disclosed this morning. Can you comment on what you think is going on there in cigarettes, and what actions you're taking to try and correct that? And in Australia, similarly there is a corresponding increase in share value, some commentary on that? But, just give us an update your stance on plain packaging in Australia as well, if you wouldn't mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. First of all, in Spain, I mean, clearly difficult market; difficult for consumer companies, companies generally at the moment in Spain. And I see some improvement in that in the second half, but I think it's still hard to tell when it's going to improve significantly in Spain, currently. So, what's the challenge for us? The challenge is to capitalize on what I see as the growth opportunities in every market, and in Spain there are growth opportunities currently. And you've seen that in the first half, with an 18% reduction in the cigarette market, but also an 18% increase in the fine cut tobacco market.</p>
          <p>We've been growing share in fine cut tobacco significantly; got now around a third of that market from a domestic basis with Ducados Rubio performing particularly well. So it is really a question of marking sure we are positioning the portfolio in those growth segments</p>
          <p>In cigarette, for example, we've got Ducados Rubio soft pack in there; we've Fortuna Red Line; we've recently launched &#x2013; we've also got the Nobel Style, which is a queen size version of Nobel. All of those have been successful launches so far and have given the portfolio some traction, some growth momentum, particularly in the last few months. So, I think we are doing the right things in Spain; clearly, though, it's a difficult market. And it's &#x2013; with both the economic environment combined with the excise and the regulation, it's going to remain so for a bit longer.</p>
          <p>Australia &#x2013; sorry. Australia; we've had some fantastic share growth in Australia, 1.5 percentage points up. JPS has done incredibly well in that market. It's over 3% share now. So I am very, very pleased with the results from the Australian market. But the looming issue of plain packs with the Australian government; opposition is very straightforward. We'll fight it tooth and nail, and we'll continue to fight it with the rest of the industry. We've got strong arguments; we are into the consultation period at the moment with the government change in June, and we will keep every effort to make sure this doesn't happen.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. A couple of things, first of all just going back to the balance sheet, &#xA3;500 million as a buyback, even with a gradually increasing payout ratio, you are still going to be probably in debt pay-down modes. How long will that last do you think, and what sort of balance sheet interest cover metrics are you going to be looking at to gauge the size of what the buyback program should be in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Essentially, I've constantly said the one thing that remains a constant for Imperial is we will remain investment grade and, obviously, those are our constantly forward looking ratios, and you are juggling not one but many variables. Hence, a mix of buyback and dividend payout we judge to be the most efficient way of using it. And yes, you've noted that if we were to continue ad infinitum of buyback at &#xA3;500 million a year, even with an increasing payout ratio, soon we wouldn't have any debt, so we will run an efficient balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And effectively, I think we've shown today that we will take action where we see value being created for our shareholders and we will take that action in the future. I think people can rely on us to do the right thing there. You would obviously not run a tobacco company ungeared.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And can I ask one more question about the U.S. business and this putting together of the mass market cigar and cigarette sales forces? Can you tell us what's behind that? It's going &#x2013; is that intended to lift the performance of both the different businesses, or is it weighted towards one or the other, the advantages of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean there's clearly been considerable changes in those businesses over the last year or so following the federal excise tax increase. So a very difficult market in terms of quite active in the deep discount sector in cigarette and also an impact on cigars from those increases as well. So we've been doing some significant work in both businesses in terms of the portfolio rejuvenation of brands, particularly the cigar portfolio. We've rationalized and got refocus &#x2013; new formats.</p>
          <p>And, I think, if we put these businesses together now, the combination in line with our Total Tobacco approach, is going to be very strong in terms of the position &#x2013; strengthening our position in the market, both with customers but also in terms of the consumer offering we can provide. So it's a very natural move for the business. Clearly it will give us some efficiencies, but the prime focus here is to strengthen our overall position with customers and consumers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Adam Spielman from Citi here. Can I ask you a question about the pricing environment, particularly in the EU? Philip Morris said in their recent results that they were getting less optimistic about the &#x2013; what they call the pricing variants. They were taking down their guidance on pricing variants, because they said another competitor &#x2013; I don't think it's you &#x2013; has been very, very aggressive in some markets. And I was wondering if you can comment on that, if you can please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think it's worth just looking at what's happened already in this financial year, just to do a little, shall we say, sense check on the price situation. We've had price increase in the U.K. We've had a price increase in Germany just being effective now. There's a price increase in Spain coming through three key markets. I would say in terms of pricing opportunities as we look at them based on recent history, we still see good opportunities for price in the EU.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of price aggression, or whatever you want to describe it as, clearly there will always be competition in markets and clearly we're competing. People are going to take different views on price in different markets, and there will be occasions where that happens. So, I'd expect it in a competitive environment, I don't see that as any particular surprise. But I think recent history is we're still seeing some good price opportunities now coming through in the EU and also outside the EU as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that aggression has actually got worse recently for whatever reason? I mean, in an impact of very good nominal increases. There has been some slippage, perhaps you -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's interesting, I mean, clearly other people have their views on this. But I think we continually see markets where sometimes it's easier for us to take a price increase from a competitive perspective than others. And yeah, I think this goes in swings and roundabouts, it's a rollercoaster at times in terms of how it happens. I wouldn't make any overarching trend comments at this point.</p>

          <p>It's Julian Hardwick, RBS. Got couple of questions. Just on the U.K., you gave us the impact on volumes from the phasing of buying in the first half. Can you give us &#x2013; just help us with the profit impact in the first half there?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly, is the introduction of the buyback &#x2013; should we read into that any commentary around what you see on the acquisition front? And do you have any scope going forward to do an add-on deals and continue the buyback? Or &#x2013; it obviously depends on the size on the deal. But, would you need to stop the buyback if you did want to buy something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. U.K. profit, one word, Bob. Two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>U.K. profit; maybe in terms of revenues it was &#x2013; about, little north of &#xA3;20 million and a little under that in terms of the &#x2013; sorry, revenue little more than &#xA3;20 million, profits a little under &#x2013; around about the &#xA3;20 million. Obviously, our U.K. margins, and this is a marginal thing, are higher than the operating profit that you see as a headline, which is already quite high.</p>
          <p>In terms of buyback, effectively, we still have scope for acquisitions. I think it's fair to say this: we don't see anything there at the moment. And we've always said that going forward, basically, we believe that, if you like, the deals will be smaller than they have been in the past. That's not to say &#x2013; and it depends on the metrics of the deal and, yes, it might be necessary to vary, but it doesn't &#x2013; not &#x2013; it depends on, actually, deal-specific items, because, obviously, I have been in the past quoted the fact that when you're doing deals, firstly, we have our criteria.</p>
          <p>It's okay, you can come out now. That's my bank manager in the cupboard. Basically, we have our returns criteria for deals, so that <mark type="ph" /> persists (39:32), and obviously, in terms of the metrics, you are also acquiring the profit streams of the company. So the deals were actually quite large &#x2013; larger. So, yeah, there might be some variation, but it's not an either/or scenario.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Jon Leinster, UBS. Last time Germany started putting through consistent tax increases, they saw a very high elasticity of demand on the <mark type="ph" /> G2 paid (40:03) market as it all shifted to Poland. Is the fact that they're now set out a tax policy with consistent price increases likely to cause a reversion to Polish consumption, or is that &#x2013; do you think they decided the price gap has closed enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you've got to look at what triggered that historically, and those were, sort of, knee-jerk, much bigger excise increases that drove that, sort of, suck in of illicit trade into the German market. Actually, it's not only illicit, because clearly some of the Poland cross border trade is fine within an EU context. But there was also illicit trade in the German market.</p>
          <p>So those were big step changes. This, in terms of approach, I think is a very good model in that it's looking at moderate regular tax increases, which shouldn't have a significant dynamic in terms of illicit trade and also gives us a nice opportunity potentially, therefore, to look at opportunities for us to take a price increase as well. So I think this is a really good model in Germany and should be good for our profits going forward. Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alison. Nico Lambrechts, Bank of America. Three questions. First just, could you give us a little bit more detail of the process in Australia? Could the government actually implement the plain packaging and you have to oppose it or oppose it afterwards, or can you actually have a long drawn out legal process and you continue as is? First question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Bob, could you give us an indication of the FX impact on sales and profits for the full year at &#x2013; I don't know, whatever spot rates are, they move so quickly, just an indication on that?</p>
          <p>And then, maybe, update on the Russian market and Balkan Star volumes? Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Shall I kick-off and other <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:56)</p>

        <plist>
          <p>They won't pick a rate. In terms of the Australian plain packs, I don't think it's entirely clear. I think we'd clearly like to challenge before it happens, but it may well have to be a challenge after the event. But I think we just have to see how that pans out currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in worst case, it could remain that it has to be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:22)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you got a look at whether or not there's ways you can actually block that. I mean that would clearly be our preference, basically. But we've got to just work through that and see exactly what the legislation looks like, because we are still not working with any details, until we see what we can challenge and how we could block it.</p>
          <p>In terms of Russia, the market has been actually stabilizing. It's looking a lot more positive. Some of the trends we saw historically are coming back to the market. So we are seeing some growth again in premium, for example, whereas before above premium was really the only segment that was still growing at top end to the market. Mid-price is still a good place to be. So we are seeing some of those trends just beginning to return in terms of the tobacco dynamics and, clearly, Davidoff is doing well within that currently, as is Style in the market.</p>
          <p>The Balkan Star piece is still about profit for us. We've made that call on Balkan Star a while ago, to get it into more profitable territory. And we've been ceding volumes, but even into Balkan Star now, to be honest, those are beginning to plateau off. It should be less of an impact going forward in Russia.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now for the $64,000 answer. Actually, as I said, the main impact was the cross rate between the euro and sterling and, from memory, the average for the first half of this year was about &#x20AC;1.17/&#xA3; and it was about &#x20AC;1.12/&#xA3;, &#x20AC;1.13/&#xA3; last year. I can remember, sort of, euro/sterling parity being talked about then.</p>
          <p>If we look at second half on second half, I think it's broad; I mean euro isn't going to be that much different, therefore the impact, most of the impact has already happened. There may be a smaller impact in the second half, but I think it's not going to be that much larger than, in absolute terms &#x2013; than the absolute impact in absolute terms in the first half, yeah, because I think second half euro is broadly where second half euro was last year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just two &#x2013; hi, David Hayes from Nomura, just two follow-ups, if I can. In terms of A&amp;P spend, have you increased A&amp;P spend in the first half? I don't know how you want to measure that, always any phasing on A&amp;P, first half, second half. And, I guess, more broadly, is there a need for more A&amp;P or a plan for more A&amp;P in the next couple of years, particularly coming back to market share point in Spain and France and a couple of your other key markets? Is there a plan to try and address that by being more aggressive in those marketplaces?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, just on the U.K.'s trading, phasing in the second half recovery, as I understand, it was the September price rise in the U.K. that drove the trade shipment phasing. So, does that mean we should expect a price rise in the U.K. in September to make sure we get that normalization in the second half? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me pick up on the A&amp;P point first. I think we need to look at this more broadly from the investment perspective, but if &#x2013; I'll just take the straight A&amp;P point. It's very similar half-on-half, if you make the comparatives between H1, H1; it hasn't had a huge &#x2013; huge increase in terms of the spend. But, if I look at investment on a broader basis, you've got to think around what we're doing in different markets, around what we're doing with the different formats we're employing in markets, the significant investment we're putting into some new formats into capacity, into &#x2013; also in pricing in a number of markets, like the U.S. as well.</p>
          <p>So, there's a number of investments going on you need to look at more holistically behind the actual sales growth in the portfolio, rather than just saying and, I think for tobacco in particular this is quite a narrow definition, to say just what have you put into A&amp;P. So, we are investing for growth across a broad spectrum of investment opportunities in the business and you can see that as well in terms of increasing capital expenditure, not huge in terms of a tobacco company or in terms of any company for that matter. But that's pushing up a little bit and much more focused on new formats in the business, for example, in 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of the U.K., we are clearly indicating in terms of the second-half and that we expect the unwinding of the trade position. I think it's &#x2013; clearly we make pricing decisions as &#x2013; as the right time is appropriate. So I am not going to comment on that further at this stage.</p>

And the second question is this, if I look at your Rest of EU division, organically sales were up about 5% and profit was up about 2%, so there is a decrease in margin there. I assume that's mainly to do with Greece, and I was wondering what it would be if it &#x2013; if Greece hadn't been, or if you can, sort of, somehow explain --</p>

And so, in terms of that, if you were looking at pure cigarette, but you've also got a mix change within the Rest of the EU, with higher volumes of fine cut. We were talking about the growth of fine cut in that region. That's got different parameters in terms of revenue per stick equivalent, if you like.</p>

          <p>Can I follow-up in that case. If you've got margin decreases because of growth in fine cut, and that trend continues, will the margin &#x2013; have we seen as much margin as we're going to get to in Rest of EU?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you were talking about explosive growth in fine cut. I mean in terms of, if you like, the ongoing, when you start from somewhere and you have some changes. We have &#x2013; we do have the Greece impact. And, by the way, fine cut over time has exactly the same characteristic as cigarette when you go through a price increase or anything else. So some of these markets were entered into and price increases are coming up on them -</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a number of factors in the mix in Rest of EU, clearly in terms of cigarette portfolio development and also fine cut development. Clearly there is a number of markets in the EU where consumers are looking for value. Fine cut has done exceptionally well off the back of that.</p>
          <p>It varies by market. Some markets are very profitable in terms of fine cut, some are less profitable. But it all has opportunities to build the position over time and build the profitability over time. So, in terms of going forward, is this going to be a permanent dilutive effect? I don't see it as that. But there clearly is an impact from, as Bob says, quite a significant pickup in fine cut in some markets but not all of them.</p>

          <p>Up till recently you've sold &#x2013; stuck to the outlook of buyback within fiscal '12, where the market toward October. Could you give us some insight, what was the case that you put forward to the Board in order to bring it forward? Or was it the business which was stronger? Was it the rating agencies giving you more support? Or was it just frustration on the share price?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is just about what Imperial has always been known for, and that's an absolute focus on making sure we maximize what we do in terms of shareholder returns. And we've clearly looked quite carefully at the &#x2013; where we see the business going. This reflects our confidence in the business and the outlook for the business. We clearly also paid down debt faster than we anticipated following the Altadis deal, although that was already known.</p>
          <p>But clearly, we've got opportunities to use our cash, and, really, for us it was always part and parcel of the equation in terms of shareholder return. And if we can accelerate it beyond expectations externally, clearly it was by 2012, so we gave ourselves some space to make sure we considered it appropriate and took into account the context, the environment, we do it. We move. We don't just sit on our hands and say, well actually, let's just wait a bit a longer. If we can get the cash returns out there then we'll do it.</p>
          <p>It's absolutely what we're committed to. Back to Bob's confidence point in terms of going forward, I think it was Jon's question, that you're still going to actually be getting some &#x2013; get paid off the back of this, what are you going to do going forward? We'll keep it under review. We'll keep it focused. We'll do what's in the best interest of shareholder value.</p>

I didn't actually say it would be November or June or whenever, I merely said it wouldn't be 2012.</p>

          <p>Jamie Norman from Evolution. Just a question, if I may, about the United States. Some quite encouraging signs on the labor market; just welcome your thoughts on how, if that continues to improve, it may impact on the industry, whether in previous cycles that will make for firmer pricing, improve mix, or whether this time around, you know, the consumer, sort of, search for value is more entrenched? Just a bit of color would be welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, the reason we were keen on the U.S. in the first place, and it continues to be the reason, we see the attractions of that market is headroom on pricing. And, if you look at it in terms of relative affordability versus other markets, the U.S. has still got considerable headroom in terms of affordability in terms of cigarette. So, absolutely, I see opportunities for pricing in that market. I've always seen opportunities. They will continue to be there and that may help yet further. But, yeah, it's part of the reason for being there. I have got to get back to Jon here, because he's been sitting at the microphone waiting. That's all right; Chas is next here, as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. A follow-up on Spain. FMC down 18%; annualized looks bad, but the latest quarter looks even worse. We've had numbers down in the 20s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you done an exercise where you've tried to estimate what is the real underlying decline in Spanish consumption versus what's related to <mark type="ph" /> sips (53:35) and inventories and tourism?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of Spanish consumption at the moment, we're looking to see and we're doing some further work on it, because clearly this sort of environment does provoke an increase in illicit trade as well, particularly around the southern part of Spain. And we've seen that move up to probably roughly 6% of the Spanish market currently. So, it's still not that big, but it has had a bit of a pick-up in the south of Spain off the back of the economic environment, with increase in clearly the high levels of unemployment.</p>
          <p>But there is an impact on consumption in Spain at the moment. If you look &#x2013; it's a slight decline in terms of incidents, slight; and clearly a bit of a reduction in terms of sticks per day as well. But some of that is being picked up with fine cut consumption as well, as you saw 18% growth in the fine cut market.</p>
          <p>So there is lot of churn in the moment &#x2013; at the moment in Spain with consumers. And they're &#x2013; and how they're &#x2013; the choices they're making around either how much they consume or what type of product they are consuming. So we are keeping on top of that in terms of what we're doing with our portfolio, but I don't think it's settled down yet. We're trying to help in terms of the <mark type="ph" /> sips (54:40) environment, because we just launched a nice little app. So, if you are standing on a street corner in Spain and want to know where you can go and have a drink and have a nice place to smoke at the same time, it will tell you exactly where to go.</p>
          <p>Chas?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Chas Manso from Evolution. I mean your profit growth is increasingly dependent, it looks, on outside of the EU. Could you perhaps &#x2013; and in the Rest of the World you had a very nice margin expansion this time around. Perhaps, could you give us a bit more color on how you are expanding those margins and where you see, perhaps, the margin ceiling for the Rest of the World, now that you're pretty much 35% margins?</p>
          <p>And in the Americas, I mean your profit progress there was much slower. Could you give us an update on the promotional environment? Are you, sort of, disappointed that your market share remains where it is given that smaller players are going to the wall and you've been increasing your distribution coverage in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, from a growth focus, we are still focused on the EU for growth as well. And don't let the current environment in Spain, which is clearly causing some challenges for everybody, lose the focus on the fact that EU is still about growth for us too. So that's still a core part; the mature market model in terms of the opportunities with slight volume declines, prices we were talking about earlier, is still very much there. There is some consumer adjustment in some of these markets currently. But I do see those opportunities for the EU going forward as well.</p>
          <p>But, yes, outside of the EU we've clearly got some great results at the moment. The brand portfolio is performing particularly well. And clearly, when you're growing Davidoff and the higher price brands as well, that clearly helps margin, but also reflects the mix of markets in terms of where you are delivering the growth to.</p>
          <p>So overall, I think opportunities are there. There is always going to be opportunities for price and for portfolio, which will help margins, but also you got to watch how the market mix works within that as well. So, yeah, there will be some opportunities to move that forward, I am sure above the 35% and particularly if Eastern Europe gets some good price increases, because that's clearly very positive for margins and it's the lowest margin part of the business still. So there's opportunities there.</p>
          <p>The U.S, I think what we are looking at in the U.S. at the moment is to really drive some further growth through looking at a much more Total Tobacco approach in the market. In reality, the share has held on I still think very well there, considering the amount of money that's being tossed around in the market in the deep discount segment by very significant competitors, and we will continue to position that portfolio to move forward from here.</p>
          <p>We've got various plans we are working on in terms of the focus and the brand portfolio to improve the situation. But I still think it's held on very well and, clearly, Philip Morris, again in the U.S. market at the moment, are promoting a Marlboro mark special blend. So, yeah, that's a competitive position that we really have to keep managing and we are doing well in a number of areas with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you update us on how you've improved your distribution coverage in your key markets, U.S., Russia and any others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean it's largely done in terms of the initiatives we talked about previously. We stepped up, I think, the Russian sales force by about 170, I think, if I am rightly in terms of total. The U.S. sales force is increased; it's about to increase significantly more, clearly on the integration and getting the combined portfolio through to two sales forces.</p>
          <p>So we've moved up the distribution levels. We'll keep pushing that in terms of the coverage in those markets. But we haven't got another step-up project in Russia currently, but the U.S. integration will give us a bit more to go for. Toby, mic. Sorry, Roger, we'll come back to you in a second.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yeah, thanks. Toby McCullagh from Morgan Stanley. With the Altadis integration synergies now approaching full realization, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about where you see the incremental savings opportunities going forward, either regionally or in terms of business activity?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean you're right. In terms of the Altadis synergies, the one project remaining to, if you like, deliver the full synergies that is actually the closure of Berlin, which is scheduled for the end &#x2013; for the end of this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of synergies, everybody expects to stand up and say, well, you make savings. Two things; firstly, we are in terms of what we're doing &#x2013; we're actually using our assets more effectively, in utilization of assets. The growth agenda actually gives us savings, and there are, quite frankly, within the organization as a whole, there are literally thousands of tiny projects that actually continue to drive synergies and cost savings.</p>
          <p>It's a focus on costs and a focus on value, actually, in terms of what we're doing. And I think that is there and will continue to be there. And I've seen our management team deliver that over &#x2013; well, you know what, I'm long enough to have said over 20 years, because I'm &#x2013; and they continue to do things. And it's lots of small things, and you &#x2013; as I've constantly said, you don't have to be talking about some sort of major reorganization to be driving efficiencies and &#x2013; out of the organization. So it's a constant &#x2013; constant move of various things, and it's happening every day of the week, frankly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and you saw a slight tick up in margins in the first half, the U.S. integration project, although clearly from a sales force perspective is about a more powerful interface with the customer and the consumer is also opportunities there from back office, and realigning that aspect of the businesses as well.</p>
          <p>As Bob said, there's a number of initiatives like that around the business that we'll continue to push on &#x2013; continue, clearly, also to keep our footprint under review as well. So, it's very much part of the DNA, but I think &#x2013; as I always keep saying, a value creation DNA, not just about costs for costs sake. It's making sure we apply that cost in the right places in the business. Yeah, I think we probably get to one more, I think Roger.</p>

I think the outlook for it is &#x2013; is strong in Germany currently.</p>
