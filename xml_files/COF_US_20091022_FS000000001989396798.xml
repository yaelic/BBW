          <p>Thanks Jeff. And good afternoon to everyone listening to the call. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $426 million or $0.94 per share. Earnings per share improved 77% from the linked quarter, excluding the second quarter costs of repaying the government's preferred share investment.</p>
          <p>The improved bottom line performance was largely driven by three factors that boosted revenue by $482 million or 12% quarter over quarter. First, higher yield more than offset lower balances in our domestic card business and drove approximately $180 million of the revenue increase.</p>
          <p>Second, better performance in our credit card trusts and market conditions in general led to a $150 million sequential improvement in the valuation adjustment to our retained securitization interests. Next, we opportunistically reallocated portions of our investment portfolio to lower risk, more capital efficient securities while recognizing $150 million of gains in the process, about $100 million more than last quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition to increased revenue, the bottom line benefited from a 6% sequential decline in noninterest expenses driven mostly by not having an FDIC special assessment in the quarter, as well as modestly lower marketing and restructuring expenses.</p>
          <p>While preprovision earnings were up $600 million, this was partially offset by a $296 million increase in our provision expense quarter over quarter.</p>
          <p>Net charge-offs were up modestly as expected, but the primary sequential change was a shift from an allowance release in the second quarter to a small build in the third. The modest allowance build was a result of a material increase in our commercial banking allowance, mostly offset by releases in both our credit card and consumer banking allowances. More on the allowance in a moment.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate fell to 25% in the quarter as we released some of our tax reserves in recognition of a favorable court ruling for the treatment of the timing of interchange income. All told, the $1.03 of continuing operation earnings per share in the quarter was flat to the year-ago quarter, despite the significant challenges we've all faced over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>The $44 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations includes $83 million of expenses related to repurchase obligations under reps and warranties made principally by GreenPoint in connection within its mortgage sales before it ceased originations in 2007.</p>
          <p>As we turn to slide four, I'll describe our economic outlook and our allowance associated with continuing operations.</p>
          <p>Unemployment and home prices have been and continue to be the economic variables with the greatest impact on our results. We still expect the unemployment rate to hit below 10% range in the first quarter of 2010 and now believe it is likely to remain stubbornly high. To date, the Case-Schiller 20-city housing price index has declined by about 31% from its peak. Despite a couple of months of promising news, we continue to assume home prices will fall by about 42%, peak to trough.</p>
          <p>Our overall allowance rose by $31 million as a result of larger, mostly offsetting allowance changes across our businesses.</p>
          <p>First, our Credit Card business had a $78 million release in allowance, more than entirely driven by the $2.1 billion decrease in reported card loan balances. Consistent with our cautious economic outlook our coverage ratio of allowance to reported card loans rose to 10% in the quarter. The slight decrease in allowance to delinquencies was caused both by the increase in delinquencies off second quarter seasonal lows as well as a change in the delinquency mix.</p>
          <p>As early-stage delinquencies rose during the quarter, and caused overall levels to rise while late-stage delinquencies that typically require higher allowance coverage ratios have improved.</p>
          <p>In the Consumer Banking segment the better than expected credit performance of the Auto Finance business and modest loan shrinkage in the quarter led to a $192 million release in our allowance for that business. This was partially offset by a $66 million build associated with the other consumer banking businesses so the segment overall had a modest decline in allowance coverage in delinquencies.</p>
          <p>Finally, degradation in collateral values especially in the construction portfolio and the impact of rising charge-offs caused us to build the commercial banking allowance by $256 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The coverage ratio of allowance to loans rose over 60% or 90 basis points to 2.3% while the coverage of allowance to NPLs now stands at 85%. Excluding the run-off small ticket CRE portfolio, the allowance coverage to NPLs in this segment is 108%. Rich will discuss credit trends in the Commercial Banking segment in greater detail in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>It's also important to note that none of these coverage ratios factor in the assets that were acquired in March as part of the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition. Those assets continue to perform in line with our expectations at the time of the mark and therefore did not impact our allowance in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, the $31 million build of the allowance coupled with the shrinkage of our balance sheet led to a 24 basis point increase in our overall coverage ratio and positions our balance sheet to absorb high levels of losses in the quarters ahead.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide five I'll discuss the balance sheet. Average managed earning assets decreased by $6 billion in the quarter, as we had varying degrees of shrinkage in each of our lending businesses. Our Domestic Card portfolio was down about $2.6 billion, driven by elevated charge-offs, lower loan demand in revolving card businesses and the continued run-off of our installment loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>The 4% shrinkage in our Consumer Bank loans was a result of a decline in the size of our mortgage portfolio and lower oustandings in the repositioned auto business. Despite the decline in the percentage of the typically higher returning Domestic Card assets, weighted average yield of assets improved 73 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll discuss this in more detail when I talk about margins in a moment.</p>
          <p>Average liabilities declined $5 billion in line with the decrease in average earning assets. While our funding mix was stable and our managed loan-to-deposit ratio decreased slightly to 1.23, we continued to trend toward lower cost retail deposits as we let higher cost brokered and retail CDs run off. By replacing the run-off of higher priced time deposits and securitization liabilities, with lower cost liquid and time deposits as well as benefiting from lower overall interest rates our cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined 12 basis points to 2.28%. These funding cost improvements helped improve margins which I'll now discuss on slide six.</p>
          <p>For the second straight quarter we saw significant improvement in both our net interest and revenue margins. The NIM improved by 84 basis points, about half of which was driven by an increase in card yield and lower finance charge reversals.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the NIM improvement was driven by the lower funding costs I just described, a purchase accounting impact associated with the Chevy Chase Bank acquisition and asset yield improvement in both auto and small business.</p>
          <p>In addition to the drivers of NIM improvement, the revenue margin benefited from a $150 million sequential increase in the valuation adjustment to our retained securitization interests as well as a $100 million increase in the gain from the sale of securities in our investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Turning to the efficiency ratio. We remain committed to disciplined cost management. We've expanded margins and a $120 million decline in noninterest expenses, the efficiency ratio dropped nearly seven percentage points in the quarter to 38.4%. However, it's important to note that this percentage will almost certainly increase in the fourth quarter as expected year-end increases in operating expenses, costs associated with the implementation of the CARD law and increased marketing will affect noninterest expense.</p>
          <p>It's also likely that some of the revenue benefits we saw this quarter will not recur, and as a result the denominator in our operating efficiency ratio will decrease.</p>
          <p>I'll discuss the investment portfolio briefly on slide seven. As I've been saying throughout this part of the economic cycle our investment portfolio is a source of tremendous liquidity strength and balance sheet flexibility. And those characteristics were once again clearly evident in the quarter. While the size of the investment portfolio was essentially flat in the linked quarter, there were some material changes to our allocation of securities.</p>
          <p>Early in the quarter we took advantage of market movements to swap out of some Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities into capital efficient zero risk weighted Ginnie Maes. We also took advantage of improved market pricing to exit our CMBS holdings and decrease our position in non-agency MBS in the quarter.</p>
          <p>While these moves contributed a 13 basis point decline in portfolio yield to 4.27%, they also provided a $150 million gain in the quarter and reduced the capital required to support this portfolio.</p>
          <p>In addition to the recognized gains, we also had a $642 million improvement in the value of the portfolio, which now stands at a $343 million gain position.</p>
          <p>We continue to position the investment portfolio to maximize both liquidity strength and balance sheet flexibility by investing in highly liquid low risk securities that will enable us to quickly reallocate space on the balance sheet to higher returning assets as lending opportunities arise.</p>
          <p>Speaking of balance sheet strength, I'll discuss capital on slide eight. Solid earnings, strong appreciation in our investment portfolio, and a decline in ending loan balances led to a 52 basis point improvement this quarter in our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible managed assets.</p>
          <p>Our TCE ratio now stands at 6.2%. This is the first time since the third quarter of 2008 that our TCE ratio is above 6%. And I needn't remind any of you that was before the worst of the financial crisis. Unemployment was at 6.2%. Our allowance balance was some $1 billion less than it is today and before our purchase of Chevy Chase Bank. The increase in common equity along with the proceeds of a $1 billion trust preferred issue early in the quarter also drove a significant improvement to our tier one ratio, which increased 210 basis points to 11.8%. Our tier one ratio is now higher than it was before we repaid TARP in full in the second quarter of this year. And our tier one common ratio is now 9.7%.</p>
          <p>The composition of reported capital and reserves will of course likely change considerably when FAS 166 and 167 are implemented. Although consolidation of many securitized assets and liabilities is scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2010, it's still too early for anyone to know exactly how this accounting change will be reflected in their financial statements.</p>
          <p>For example, there's still some uncertainty in the industry about precisely which assets and liabilities will need to be consolidated. And the impact on regulatory ratios cannot be known until federal rule making is finalized sometime later in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>But in light of the intense focus we are all giving to this accounting event, I'd like to spend a moment describing how we're evaluating the consolidation process and how it might be reflected in our financial statements.</p>
          <p>Although changes in accounting standards do not change our overall capacity to absorb risk, they can represent a significant shift in our reported balance sheet. At this point we are still assessing the options included in FAS 167 for electing either a book value or fair value approach to consolidating securitized assets and liabilities. We are confident that our capital positions us well to make this important accounting election solely on the basis of what best reflects the economics of our business.</p>
          <p>While accounting standard setters are debating a move towards fair value at some point in the future, most of our balance sheet like that of the majority of banks is currently accounted for on a book value basis.</p>
          <p>So assuming we apply a book value approach to consolidation, then the biggest impact would be an increase to our allowance with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings.</p>
          <p>Taking the conservative assumption that the allowance for expected losses on securitized and nonsecuritized loans would be the same and rolling forward our current balance sheet trends to the first quarter of 2010, we expect that our TCE ratio would remain above 5% and would likely grow thereafter. Of course, any reduction in TCE arising from consolidation would at least be matched by the size of the allowance build.</p>
          <p>Or taking into account tax effects, the allowance build could be even greater than the reduction in capital. On the other hand, if we were to elect a fair value option provided for in the new accounting standards, our allowance would not change as a result of consolidation. The impact to capital would depend on the market value of the liabilities at the time of consolidation, as well as the present value of assumed losses and relevant revenues expected over the life of the receivables.</p>
          <p>Even though a fair value election would likely have a less negative impact on TCE than book value consolidation, it would not have a corresponding impact on allowance because the assumed losses would then be incorporated into the fair value mark.</p>
          <p>I know that many of you, like we, would prefer to know today how all of this will play out over the next couple of months, but there's simply too many variables to predict the exact result. In any event, we remain highly confident in the overall risk bearing capacity of our balance sheet and our ability to navigate the coming consolidation or any other changes in accounting standards now or in the future.</p>
          <p>Before I hand the call over to Rich to discuss the performance of our businesses on slide nine, let me just remind everybody about our segment reporting realignment that was described in an 8-K filed last Friday. We believe these changes in segment reporting better reflect the manner in which the performance of the Company's operations is evaluated, enhance visibility into the performance of our key businesses and provide investors with greater comparability to pure bank reporting. Rest assured, however, we will continue to provide the same monthly credit disclosures for the Company's lending businesses.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll pass the call over to Rich. Rich?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gary. Our Credit Card business posted net income of $292 million in the third quarter. Improving revenue margin and revenues in our Domestic Credit card business drove the improved profitability. The Commercial Banking business had a net loss of $130 million, entirely driven by higher provision expense which resulted from a significant allowance build in anticipation of future credit losses.</p>
          <p>Preprovision earnings in Commercial Banking increased by about $6 million, as revenue improvements outpaced the increase in noninterest expenses.</p>
          <p>Consumer Banking profits grew to $185 million for the quarter. The largest contribution came from Auto Finance profits, which were helped by an allowance release that resulted from credit trends that continue to outperform our expectations and from declining loan balances.</p>
          <p>I'll discuss results and key performance trends for our new reporting segments beginning with our Credit Card business on slide 10.</p>
          <p>The results of our Credit Card reporting segment are driven by the Domestic Credit card business. Ending loans in our Domestic Card business declined by about $3 billion. The continuing runoff of nationally originated installment loans drove about 40% of the decline although installment loans comprised just 13% of the Domestic Card loan balances. Our Domestic Card business includes about $8.1 billion in installment loans down from about $9.3 billion at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We essentially stopped originating installment loans late last year so the portfolio will continue to shrink as outstanding loans amortize.</p>
          <p>We may see an inflection point and opportunities to increase originations in part of Domestic Card sometime in the next few quarters. But we expect the Domestic Card loan balances will continue to decline in the fourth quarter and into 2010.</p>
          <p>We expect that weak demand from creditworthy borrowers, continuing caution in underwriting, elevated charge-offs and the runoff of the installment loan portfolio will more than offset new originations. Revenue margin in the Domestic Card business improved to about 16.8%. Better revenue margin drove an increase in revenue dollars despite declining loan balances. Net interest income improved as a result of revenue enhancement actions we took earlier in the year and fewer finance charge reversals. Noninterest income benefited from fewer fee reversals.</p>
          <p>We expect Domestic Card revenue margin will remain above 16% in the fourth quarter. In 2010 we expect quarterly revenue margin to moderate modestly, but remain close to its fourth quarter 2009 level.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows credit results for the Domestic and International card businesses. Domestic Card charge-off rate for the third quarter increased 41 basis points to 9.6% as a result of several offsetting factors. Three quantifiable factors drove about 140 basis points of charge-off rate increase in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>These factors include declining denominator, the implementation of OCC minimum payment policies and the absence of the one-time second quarter benefit from a change in bankruptcy processes. Favorable seasonal trends especially in the first two months of the quarter drove an offsetting 75 basis points of charge-off rate improvement in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The net result of combining all of these quantifiable factors is an estimated third quarter charge-off rate increase of about 65 basis points. But the actual increase was only 41 basis points.</p>
          <p>This difference suggests that the underlying charge-off rate actually improved by about 24 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The Domestic Card delinquency rate increased 61 basis points to 5.4% at the end of the quarter. Some of this increase was seasonal. The second quarter is a seasonal low point for card delinquencies coming off the tax refund season, while the third quarter is a seasonal high point. In addition, we are seeing some impact from pricing actions we took earlier in the year. Based on past experience, we expect this delinquency increase to be temporary, although we do expect it to lead to higher charge-offs early next year.</p>
          <p>We continue to analyze test cell data to refine and update our estimated impacts of implementing OCC minimum payment policy in our Domestic Card business. We expect the OCC minimum payment impact to drive around 20 basis points of charge-off rate in the fourth quarter and into 2010.</p>
          <p>This is down from the estimated 80 basis point impact this quarter so the fourth quarter charge-off rate is expected to benefit by approximately 60 basis points as the OCC minimum payment impact abates.</p>
          <p>Overall we expect further increases in the Domestic Card charge-off rate throughout 2009. The economy continues to weaken and we expect the usual fourth quarter seasonal headwinds. We believe we'll reach the peak of charge-off dollars in the next couple of quarters although declining loan balances are likely to drive rising charge-off rates for a bit longer.</p>
          <p>But to be clear, nearing a peak does not necessarily mean that we're nearing the beginning of a robust recovery. As Gary discussed, we expect that unemployment rate and, therefore, Domestic Card charge-off dollars are likely to remain stubbornly high throughout 2010.</p>
          <p>The International Card business posted net income of $2 million in the third quarter. Profits declined from the second quarter as higher provision expense more than offset revenue gains. Elevated charge-offs and delinquencies in the International business reflect continuing economic deterioration in the UK and Canada.</p>
          <p>We've been retrenching the UK business for some time now and we've been cautious in Canada in anticipation of the credit worsening that began in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Despite the significantly elevated level of charge-offs our credit card business is demonstrating its resilience by delivering industry-leading profitability through the cycle. As we discussed last quarter we continue to believe we're well positioned for life after the implementation of the new CARD Act and that our revenue model will remain largely intact.</p>
          <p>Managing our business to both weather the recession and respond to the coming changes in the credit card industry creates risks and potential profitability pressures in the short term.</p>
          <p>But in the long term we believe the new law and the market and competitive environment it will create could open up opportunities and be a net benefit for Capital One.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows Commercial Banking loan and deposit trends. Average loans declined to $30 billion. Modest declines in commercial real estate as well as middle market were partly offset by modest growth in specialty lending. The expected run-off of small ticket commercial real estate loans, a business we exited some time ago also contributed to the decline in commercial banking loans.</p>
          <p>Average deposits grew 4% to $17.8 billion. Deposit interest expense rate was stable at about 75 basis points.</p>
          <p>Revenue grew $17 million in the quarter. Despite -- excuse me. Deposit growth with disciplined pricing and modest improvement in loan yields contributed to revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows Commercial Banking credit trends. While solid revenue and noninterest expense trends drove an increase in preprovision, pre-tax earnings, commercial banking posted a net loss for the quarter due to the increase in provision expense. Provision expense increased more than $250 million, largely as a result of a large allowance build in anticipation of future credit losses.</p>
          <p>The two most important drivers of the allowance build were the significant decline in collateral values, particularly in our construction portfolio, and recognizing the effects of higher charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Charge-off rate for the Commercial Banking segment increased by 53 basis points to 1.42%. Excluding the run-off portfolio of small ticket commercial real estate loans, the charge-off rate in our continuing commercial lending businesses increased a more modest 28 basis points to 1.08%. Nonperforming asset rate increased 37 basis points to 2.83%.</p>
          <p>Rising nonperformers and charge-offs in the CRE portfolio drove the third quarter deterioration in our core commercial lending businesses. Credit performance in the middle market portfolio was relatively stable.</p>
          <p>Construction loans continue to be the main driver of CRE nonperformers. Although construction loans comprise only 18% or about $2.5 billion of the commercial real estate portfolio, almost three-quarters of the nonperforming loan balances are construction-related.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we also began to experience an increase in nonperformers in office and retail loans. The nonperformers have been project and sponsor-specific situations and it's too early to determine if a trend is emerging.</p>
          <p>Declining asset values were an important driver of higher charge-offs in the quarter. Commercial real estate values declined broadly during the quarter but the most dramatic declines occurred in construction properties. We expect continuing declines in commercial real estate values.</p>
          <p>We believe that the continuing recession will drive further increases in nonperformers and charge-offs across our Commercial Banking businesses. Compared to most large banks commercial loans are a much smaller percentage of our total company's managed loans and we also believe that our Commercial Banking loan portfolio is well positioned to weather the recession.</p>
          <p>We have a favorable loan mix with a relatively small exposure to construction lending. Since credit deterioration is most pronounced in construction lending, our relatively small exposure to construction is a key reason that the absolute level of our CRE charge-off rate is lower than many other banks.</p>
          <p>We also have a relatively large exposure to New York City multi-family, because of rent controls and supply limitations our New York City multi-family portfolio has been relatively resistant to recession. We have disciplined lending standards and we underwrite to in-place cash flows and rent and we follow a relationship-oriented approach that focuses on borrowers with whom we have had a long experience and deep relationships.</p>
          <p>You can see loan and deposit trends for the Commercial Banking business, excuse me, the Consumer Banking business on slide 14. Average loans declined about $1.7 billion. Auto Finance loans declined as a result of our earlier efforts to retrench and reposition the Auto Finance business.</p>
          <p>Mortgage loans fell as we continued to experience expected run-off. Loan yields improved 98 basis points to 9.5% driven by improving margins in Auto Finance and purchase accounting adjustments on the mortgage portfolio.</p>
          <p>Average deposits declined about $1 billion. We continued our strategy of optimizing deposit mix to focus on deposit customers that drive the best long-term profitability. Improved deposit mix and favorable interest rates drove an 18 basis point improvement in deposit interest expense in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, Consumer Banking revenues increased $56 million, with revenue improvements across the Consumer Banking businesses. Provision expense declined $46 million, driven by an allowance release in the Auto Finance business. Noninterest expense declined $43 million as a result of improvements in retail banking operating expense.</p>
          <p>Note that noninterest expenses in the Consumer Banking segment include about $46 million of CDI amortization.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 shows credit results for mortgage and auto, the two largest components of the Consumer Banking loan portfolio. Consumer Banking includes our $16 billion portfolio of mortgages and home equity loans net of the credit mark on the acquired Chevy Chase mortgages.</p>
          <p>About $7 billion or 44% of the portfolio are Chevy Chase loans, including about $4 billion of broker originated option arms. The Chevy Chase portfolio is inherently riskier than our legacy mortgage portfolio.</p>
          <p>The substantial credit mark we established on acquisition insulates us from most of the credit risk of the Chevy Chase portfolio. There is some risk that we will have to increase the mark or add an allowance if actual credit trends exceed the assumptions we made in establishing the mark. But so far performance is within our expectations and we remain comfortable with the mark.</p>
          <p>The remaining $9 billion or 56% of the mortgage portfolio consists of well-seasoned high FICO, low LTV mortgages that were originated for North Fork by GreenPoint as well as branch originated home equity loans mostly in Louisiana.</p>
          <p>Credit results for this part of the portfolio remain in line with our expectations and with industry credit trends for similar high quality portfolios. Delinquency and charge-offs for this part of the portfolio continue to degrade along with the industry.</p>
          <p>Our current priority for the mortgage portfolio is aggressively managing defaults. We also are building infrastructure and developing strategies in anticipation of opportunities to grow in-footprint mortgage originations as the mortgage market shakes out and the economic cycle turns.</p>
          <p>I should also note that the mortgage portfolio in the Consumer Banking segment does not include the remaining $517 million of GreenPoint-originated ALT-A HELOCs which are held in the other category. These loans were originated for sale but GreenPoint was unable to sell them when we shut down GreenPoint originations in 2007. They continue to perform very poorly as they run off and we've allowed for them accordingly.</p>
          <p>As Gary mentioned earlier, we added to our rep and warranty reserve in the third quarter as a result of ongoing repurchase risk with respect to GreenPoint mortgage loan sales.</p>
          <p>Capital One Auto Finance contributed the largest share of profitability to the new Consumer Banking segment. Our Auto Finance business delivered another strong quarter of profitability despite continuing economic headwinds. Profits in the quarter were aided by an allowance release that resulted from declines in loan balances as we continued to reposition and retrench the business as well as continued favorability of credit trends versus our expectations.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 and 2009 origination vintages are delivering strong results. We've been able to originate loans with lower LTVs to customers with higher FICO scores, at the same time we've been able to improve pricing and margins in the current competitive environment.</p>
          <p>As a result, we expect that the 2008 and 2009 originations will yield above hurdle risk-adjusted returns and their performance to date is tracking at or above our expectations.</p>
          <p>Auto Finance charge-off rate increased 73 basis points in the quarter to 4.38%. The increase resulted from expected seasonal patterns and the impact of the decline in the denominator. These factors were partially offset by continuing strength in used car prices and recovery values and by the continuing success of our investments in Auto Finance collections and recoveries. Auto Finance delinquency rate increased 63 basis points from the sequential quarter following expected seasonal patterns.</p>
          <p>We expect Auto Finance charge-offs and delinquencies to increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 in line with expected seasonal patterns. Also, we have observed a decline in used vehicle prices in the last few weeks. So there's growing uncertainty about the sustainability of favorable used vehicle prices.</p>
          <p>Pulling up, we've worked for years to position our Company to be resilient and we're demonstrating that resilience through the most challenging economic cycle we've seen in generations. We've delivered solid preprovision pre-tax earnings throughout the recession. We've passed the government stress test. And we were among the earliest to be able to repay TARP. In the third quarter we delivered solid growth in both revenues and bottom line profits despite increasing provision expenses.</p>
          <p>We also built additional balance sheet strength, allowance as percentage of reported loans increased and our TCE and tier one capital ratios continue to improve.</p>
          <p>While third quarter results were strong, we expect that loan balances will continue to decline in the fourth quarter and into 2010. Thus far, the revenue pressure from declining loans have been partially offset by increasing revenue margins and allowance releases have helped to mute the bottom line impact of declining loan balances.</p>
          <p>Going forward we do not expect continuing revenue margin expansion. We're weathering the storm, but the storm is not over. And we continue to face several significant risks.</p>
          <p>While the pace of deterioration appears to have slowed, labor markets have yet to actually improve. In past downturns, unemployment has often recovered quickly after the peak. But in this recession there are several reasons why the recovery in the job market may be slower and more prolonged.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond unemployment rate the reduction in hours worked creates even more slack in the labor market than is apparent in the unemployment rate. The average time to find a new job is at an all-time high &#x2013; a sign that the job market is more frozen than in past recessions. Because this recession is so geographically broad, workers are less able to find new jobs by moving. And the housing crisis further reduces mobility, as many workers cannot sell their current houses in order to relocate.</p>
          <p>Similar to labor markets the housing sector remains severely dislocated, despite some signs of stabilizing home prices. There's a growing backlog of foreclosures and inventories of homes in foreclosure or with severely delinquent mortgages are increasing.</p>
          <p>This is likely to put downward pressure on home prices as the foreclosure inventory hits the market. Continued weakness in housing puts pressure on the broader economy and makes any emerging recovery fragile. For our retained mortgage portfolios continued housing weakness drives higher credit losses and adds to the risk that we may need to increase our credit mark.</p>
          <p>Even as things eventually cure, we will continue to face for some time the risk of additional repurchase requests for alleged rep and warranty breaches on GreenPoint and Chevy Chase Bank mortgage loans that were originated and sold years ago.</p>
          <p>Some of the apparent improvements in the economy may not be sustainable. As government stimulus programs like Cash for Clunkers, the First-Time Home Buyer tax credit and other direct cash payments to consumers may have only fleeting effects.</p>
          <p>Legislative and regulatory uncertainty remains high, with Congress continuing to debate bank regulatory reforms and specific limitations on traditional bank product. The current debate includes the possibility of accelerating the effective date of the Card Act, limiting interchange fees on credit and debit cards and regulating overdraft fees on checking accounts.</p>
          <p>There are large numbers of new regulations that need to be developed and adopted in 2010 to implement the laws recently enacted by Congress. And we won't even know what agency or agencies will be developing the regulations until Congress finishes its work on regulatory reform.</p>
          <p>Because the storm is still with us and we continue to face these risks, we continue to make the tough decisions and take actions that we believe will put us in the best possible position to manage the Company through the downturn for the benefit of shareholders. We have tightened underwriting standards across the board. We've exited the least resilient businesses like national lending installment loans and small ticket commercial real estate. Even as we've invested in increased collections intensity, we made great progress on our efforts to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency to enhance our long-term competitive position and build resilience to rising credit costs. Our strong and transparent balance sheet remains a source of strength in these turbulent times. Allowance coverage ratios remain high, funding and liquidity remain rock solid and TCE ratio at the end of the third quarter with 6.2% -- its strongest level since the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>The strength of our balance sheet is not just about weathering the storm. We also expect our balance sheet to generate shareholder value as we emerge from the storm. Our balance sheet can contribute to higher margins over time as capital markets funding and wholesale deposits mature and we replace them with lower cost commercial and consumer banking deposits, and as opportunities for profitable and resilient loan growth emerge, we expect that we'll be able to grow loans by rotating our earning assets from investment securities back into new loan growth.</p>
          <p>As a result of our actions, we believe that we remained well positioned to weather the storm and deliver shareholder value over the cycle. Now Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Good evening. Just one quick question on the observable performance impact you've had so far across the increase in rates in credit cards. For those customers that have been seen a significant rate increase on, that have existing balances, can you give us kind of any early feedback on what the credit performance has been like there, if you've seen a lot of fall-out or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Andrew, what we look for on any of these things is we look at effects on attrition and we look at credit. And of course there's a slight interaction between those.</p>
          <p>The attrition rates have been actually so far a little less than expected. They're certainly very manageable. You know, we believe there is a, like you've probably seen in prior revenue change impacts, there is a small effect that we believe is making its way through our delinquency buckets. That's what contributed to the 30 to 59-bucket being higher than otherwise you would expect it to be over the last couple of months.</p>
          <p>So we believe that effect will make its way, while it's moderating a little bit, as it makes its way through charge-off. There will be a charge-off effect that will happen from that but that over a period of a few months we believe that effect based on years and years of experience will sort of resolve itself. So all in all it's been a really quite a modest impact on the externalities from this decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Then as my follow-up, just looking at the Auto business I think your comments around there, obviously there's been some solid enough performance to release that level of reserves. Margins have expanded. LTVs have gone down and the quality of the borrower is better. Do you see the opportunity to grow that business now or is it still very much in a kind of contract and defend type position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're definitely -- in fact, we have not, despite all my use of the C word of contracting, I actually want to say that for some time now we've been pretty stable at about in originations at about one and a half billion dollars per quarter. So what's contracting is the underlying portfolio and that will continue to contract for an extended period of time.</p>
          <p>I think the thing to focus on, Andrew, is the originations, and we've been, because we've been on the one hand so concerned about the economy and everything and all the amazing developments occurring in the auto market, but on the other hand so impressed with some of the performance of our originations, in the business we have kind of been steady at about one and a half billion dollars. I think that from here I think that we might modestly grow that from here. But one thing I want to caution is that part of the reason that we were able to generate the success we have in the auto business is we very carefully chose which dealers and to certain underwriting standards that we would do this. So we don't want to turn around and sort of undo that which got us here.</p>
          <p>So we think the auto business is a fairly healthy business and from a lending point of view industry right now. I think you'll see some cautious growth from Capital One, growth in originations but it's still going to be within the context of something pretty modest.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, good afternoon. I had a question on the revenue margins in the US Card business. I think Rich, in the last quarter's call you had guided to 15%, above 15% in the last two quarters and below 15% for the year, with the performance this quarter and your new guidance looks like you've done a little better than that or quite a bit better than that. So I was wondering what drove that change over three months since we last talked on revenue margin, and also <mark type="inaudible" /> suppression number this quarter, it fell sequentially despite a pretty significant increase in delinquencies. Does that reflect maybe some confidence that the credit might be getting a little better and that some of your comments about the delinquency increase we saw in the third quarter just being mostly related to similar pricing activity, can you just give me a little color on what's going on in the US Card business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, our revenue margin in the third quarter came out a little higher than probably our own expectations. I think probably the driver of that was actually what happened on the fee and finance charge side with respect to reversals. So kind of positive developments on the credit side made its way into the fee and finance charge reversals, which actually flow through the revenue line.</p>
          <p>So as you look at it, you know, envision that the underlying sort of revenue measures that we took in the business are going exactly as expected. But we had that extra overlay.</p>
          <p>With respect to delinquencies, how do we -- let me just make some comments about credit card performance. It is certainly -- it has tended to a little bit outperform our expectations now for probably the last five or six months. Here's where it's been performing particularly well relative to our expectations on the recovery side. We've actually seen some improvement in recent months, slight improvement in recent months in recovery, bankruptcies have been stable. I mean they, of course, have just been up, up and away for a long, long period of time. So that has been good. The other striking thing is some improvement in late-stage flow rates, which again we have not seen. We've been mostly dealing with the reverse of that for a long, long time during this downturn. So those have been real positives. The only sort of thing on the other side of the argument, Chris, is the bit of a bubble in the second bucket and into third bucket delinquency.</p>
          <p>And there are multiple causes of that. Seasonality you would expect that anyway. We actually made a change in our collections practices after a lot of testing we kind of shifted where we put the intensity with respect to which delinquency stage gets a certain amount of intensity in terms of collectors and everything. And we've actually found there was more leverage to kind of backload a little bit more the intensity.</p>
          <p>That actually causes an increase in early-stage delinquencies. That's more of a slight permanent effect, but it doesn't actually -- we believe there's a net positive on charge-offs there. And then the other thing is, of course, the impact of the revenue actions that we took and that one that while we can all have our beliefs about that impact we want to keep an eye on it just to be sure that that thing washes through the delinquency buckets.</p>

          <p>I think also previously you had talked about the CARD Act, the new brown-out in the second quarter when it went into effect. And it seems from your guidance tonight that you're feeling a little more confident about your ability to weather the new rules. Can you give me any sense of if it's true and what's changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, we basically -- the more we have really gotten our head around the CARD Act and what are its many, many impacts on how the business works and on us, I think we're increasingly bullish that you're not going to see a big striking effect once the CARD Act goes into effect.</p>
          <p>I think that we believe that the revenue margin, that the kind of fourth quarter revenue margin that you're going to see is pretty typical for what we would expect in the card business for next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just sort of following up on that. So basically you're saying that from where we are today and next year with the opt-in requirement on over limit fees we're just not going to see much of an effect on the income statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean they're offsetting -- yeah, series of offsetting factors, but basically, yes, David, there would be more or less we think the revenue margin that you're going to see probably next quarter, which will be pretty representative of the revenue margin for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you or Gary just clarify what the tax rate was on the gains and the revaluation and then how much of the purchase accounting adjustment impacted the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Variety of items there. The purchased accounting adjustments were about $50 million more or less. Some of that will continue. But there was a bit of a catch-up this quarter. Again, the gain on security sales was about $150 million pre-tax. It was about a -- that was $100 million over the previous quarter. And on the evaluation adjustment, sort of a similar amount of improvement. It was a small positive but remember last quarter we had a big negative. That resulted from the fact that a lot of the cash that had been trapped when our master trust had reached some lower levels of excess spread earlier this year improved. That both released some cash and also the rate of collectability is now considered to be higher. Finally, on the tax, the ruling we had in tax court in late September around treating interchange as interest, subject to tax deferral rules, that favorable ruling, there were a couple of other rulings that kind of offset the impact. So it was a net positive for us.</p>
          <p>Given the favorable ruling we had from the court, we released some of the reserves associated with this matter. But because this is still an ongoing process, there could be an appeal. We have not released all of the reserves against that matter and we'll have to see what happens over the next several quarters to get to a final resolution to determine the ultimate impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thanks for taking the question. I guess the first question has to do with the charge-off rate in the credit card business. You guys have talked a lot about the potential for decoupling earlier in the year where charge-off rates increased more than the unemployment rate. And, I guess for the most part that hasn't happened but I was wondering is there any way in your mind if the unemployment rate does in fact stay stubbornly high through 2010 where you could see a decoupling in the opposite direction where charge-offs actually start to decline relative to the unemployment rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, I think my overall answer would be that as unemployment goes, so go the card charge-offs. Now, let me put a few nuances around that. Also an important driver is what happens to home prices. So if for some reason they rebounded while unemployment didn't, I think there would be some positive effect. But frankly we're still as worried about potential latent challenges with respect to home prices in many ways as we are about unemployment.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would say, though, is the thing you're referring to, the old proverbial one-to-one relationship between domestic card charge-offs and unemployment rate that has been seen in the last two downturns and that we've talked a lot about in prior earnings calls, you know, that in some ways the more things change the more they stay the same. I think this downturn will show a pretty strong close to one-to-one relationship between those two.</p>
          <p>But it will -- the only thing that we've seen of late is that there seems to be a bit of reduction in a sense of the coefficient of impact from unemployment to the charge-off rate, that would explain some of the kind of better than expected performance that we have seen.</p>
          <p>Now, this could actually be in some ways a kind of, a simple interpretation of it is it may just be a manifestation of something that didn't matter very much while everything was worsening but matters a lot when you get to the peak. And that is, which comes first in a sense, the peak of credit or the peak of unemployment. And the lag effect of unemployment -- credit being a moving somewhat earlier than unemployment may be what's being manifested here. But I think the other thing, just to kind of add a little more complexity to this thing, the other thing that could be explaining the better than expected kind of credit performance and the seemingly slight reduction of impact of credit vis-&#xE0;-vis the unemployment number could be a lot of these sort of temporary impacts of tax stimulus and cash for clunkers and a lot of other things going on. So, overall, I think we view that as unemployment goes so goes the card business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just have a quick follow-up. Gary, on the in terms of like your liabilities now in terms of duration, has it changed dramatically like this quarter versus, say, a year ago as you kind of shift somewhat away from securitizations into deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Mike, our overall approach is still to try to run a bit of, as close to a matched book as makes sense. Although, certainly given the extraordinary environment we're in right now we're trying to keep ourselves as at least somewhat liability sensitive. But when you take a look at the nature of our assets, between credit cards which are now overwhelmingly floating rate and certainly most of our commercial loans also have a floating rate, in order to get to the position we're looking for, we've got some longer duration in our investment portfolio, and on the liability side we've been obviously taking advantage of the opportunity to bring our costs down by going more towards deposits and in terms of duration there hasn't been a significant shift, other than the benefit that comes from the roll off of some of the higher cost CDs. So net-net, slightly liability sensitive. But still probably a little more matched than many of our peers.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys. Marketing continues to trend down. I'm wondering, normally there's a surge in the end of the third quarter beginning of the fourth quarter related to getting cards in people's pockets for the holiday season. Should we expect any surge in the beginning of the fourth quarter and given all of the changes to the operating environment what are you guys seeing in terms of response rates? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick, I mean, you're right on the normal patterns with respect to marketing. I don't think -- you might see a little bit of an uptick, I would never use the S word surge to describe this low level of marketing that's going on here.</p>
          <p>So, more I think what you'll see out of Capital One on the credit card side is pretty cautious, a combination of our caution and in many ways the lack of demand that's out there for high quality borrowers as they continue to ramp up their savings rate.</p>
          <p>With respect to response rates, response has increased during this period of time. I mean, there's been such a dramatic reduction in supply out there, as you can see from the mail monitor data, for example, that not surprisingly there would, we are seeing some increase, pretty much across the board, everywhere we're marketing. Some increase in response.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Rich, could you talk a little bit more about the suppression and its effect on income given the comments you made about expectations for delinquencies and losses, kind of, I guess sounded like they wouldn't be better going forward. So how does that reflect itself in the suppression? What happens to that number, kind of in Q4 and Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Moshe it's Gary. First of all, I don't think we should read too much into the amount of suppression. By and large, we're simply reflecting the kind of experience that we've been seeing in terms of consumer behavior, and also quarter over quarter, we're going to see what quantity of charges are being made, because obviously we have to assess before we suppress.</p>
          <p>So by and large I don't believe that suppression will have a major impact. But certainly it was a small contributor. The lower suppression coming from fewer finance charge reversals. Certainly it was a small contributor to the improvement in the Card business revenue margin this year. But it's not a major driver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But you certainly -- your revenue margin is up. So it's not like you're charging less interest, right, on and your delinquent accounts are -- I guess it's not clear to me how the suppression amount could be down unless you're expecting fewer charge-offs of accounts that would have had those fees and finance charges billed, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, again, I think, as with an allowance you have to take a look, Moshe, at the reserve. It's not just the experience we're having, it's the experience we're having versus the expectations that were previously built. And so, even though we're not necessarily looking for a significant improvement, there is a combination of factors that would make us believe that perhaps the amount of reserve that we had already posted or some amount we had already suppressed was more than appropriate.</p>
          <p>But by and large if you see the allowance going down, you can usually expect to see the finance charge and fee reserve also coming down a small bit.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just wanted to ask about the competition, we're seeing kind of one of the larger card competitors, introducing some new products into the market, kind of focusing on affluent in the prime segment and also the small business and seeing marketing expenses coming down a lot. I'm just wondering what you're thinking about in terms of competition and whether you're worried about market share at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me make a few comments, Aaron, about competition. First of all, the striking thing is competition has mostly drifted to the really the upper end of the market. So it's not surprising that the new cards and kind of new things that you see out there almost entirely are being pitched to the top end, frankly more heavy spender part of the marketplace and I think you should continue to expect that from everyone, including Capital One. A lot of emphasis on this. This segment has performed well during this downturn. It was always a beloved segment beforehand and it will be as or more beloved going forward. So this will be intensely competitive.</p>
          <p>There has been just a kind of just a massive reduction in supply into the heart of the revolver marketplace. Industry mail volume. Now it's not a perfect metric, Aaron, because, of course, increasingly people get their credit cards in ways other than mail. But the effect is so dramatic, it's certainly telling here, and that is that versus a year ago industry mail volume is down by more than two-thirds. So that, I think, that will probably -- I wouldn't expect that to turn around dramatically any time soon. The other thing I would really point your attention to is the pricing in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>We've been saying that for a long time that industry go-to rates really will tell you a lot about the future health of the card business, because with the new CARD Act, go-to rates really are the destination rates and they kind of evolved where they weren't necessarily that in the world of penalty-based repricing, which is essentially going to be a thing of the past after the CARD Act. So what I've said is watch the go-to rate and if you look at that, actually it's interesting, the go-to rate itself, if we go back to, say, July of 2008, the go-to rate has gone from, the purchase go-to rate has gone from about 11.7% to about 13% so on the face of it it looks like about 130 basis points of increase. But, we have to adjust for the significant decline in interest rates and therefore cost of funds during this period of time. So, the most telling one is go-to minus prime and go-to-rate minus prime has gone from, by our tally, 6.69% up to 9.75%. So it's basically 300 basis points over this period of time and it's been interesting. The first, so in the summer of last year it was around the mid 6s, this it being go-to-rate minus prime. In the latter part of the year it went to the mid 7s. For much of this year, it's been in the 8s and in the last couple of months, in August/September basically it went into the mid-9s.</p>
          <p>So I think what you're seeing is the industry, I think, has been spending most of its focus on dealing with its existing portfolio. And, frankly not doing a lot of marketing. But I think the industry both is recognizing &#x2013; these are early stage of recognition that the go-to-rate is the defining kind of indicator of origination pricing held, but let me also say that based on our calculations and for our originations we certainly would believe that it needs to go quite a distance farther to really get to the kind of destination we would look for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks and just a quick follow-up for Gary. Housekeeping. The 150 million valuation adjustment this quarter on the residual, how does that compare to last quarter and then just for clarity, the 150 from the security sale that you're seeing, about 100 million of that is kind of an unusual run rate number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just to be clear on the second question, the $150 million worth of securities gains I was just trying to help you out quarter over quarter. We had about a $150 million gain in the second quarter. So there was a delta pre-tax of about a 100 million. Now, with respect to the security valuations, or, sorry, the retained interest valuations, remember in the second quarter we had a negative adjustment of about $115 million, about half of that came from the fact that we had increased the amount of retained interest. We had done some additional public issuances and we were trapping cash because we had a very short moment there where we went below a trigger on our Class C and that requires us to post a valuation charge against it. And, then, the other half was based on the negative credit trends that we were seeing at the time and certainly the valuation in the marketplace of those interests.</p>
          <p>So it was a negative 115 adjustment in the second quarter. We had a positive adjustment of 37 million in the third quarter, hence the 150 million more or less pre-tax swing. And again that the same two things that drove the negative adjustment last quarter reversed this time around. So a smaller quantum of retained interest, a reduction in the amount of cash that was trapped and an improvement in the valuation of those interests.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's been a lot of emphasis on the operating margin, and what you were saying about the go-to rate just now Rich, when you look at the average balances, average yields and average cost of funds table, you had a remarkable increase in your average yield and a good decline in the cost of funds.</p>
          <p>So you said that you've migrated most of your cards now to floating rates. So and then margins unlikely to increase in next year, but I guess that assumes flat Fed funds, if rates start to go higher then we should expect to see average yields go up there on these floating rate credit cards and deposit costs probably be more sticky then we might start to see some further margin expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Bruce, it's Gary. Look, obviously figuring out the duration of deposits is an art, and not a science. So certainly we factor in when we assess the sensitivity of our balance sheet to movements in interest rates. We assume some degree of stickiness. And of course on the card side there may be a variety of considerations in the way promotional rates are offered to people so that while the underlying rate on the card is floating, it may be that the customer is assured of a rate for a period of time.</p>
          <p>So by and large I think the movement in rates is unlikely to have a significant impact on the net interest margin in the card business, but you can rest assured that both our balance sheet management functions and our, all of our Bank are out there trying to beat the beta when it comes to deposits and we'll do our best. But I'm not sure that I would project that.</p>

          <p>Bruce, it's certainly something that we are very concerned about. I think there was a relative to the original proposal there was a little bit of lightening of that one. So it softened a bit as it made its way through the House Financial Services Committee, but it's certainly still not to the destination I think that's extremely important vis-&#xE0;-vis classical preemption.</p>
          <p>Just to remind us all why we care so much about this, you know, in subjecting national lenders to every State legislature in the country, the risk of many different regulatory barriers coming across 50 states, which even the anticipation of potential legislation in 50 states could actually lead to reduced lending even before in a sense it actually happened in a particular state and the cost of compliance on all of this as well. So I think this is a very, very critical issue. There's a lot of I think very widespread opposition by large and small in many, many quarters to this and we'll see where it goes, Bruce. But that's a top issue on our list.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to make sure I understood your commentary around the revenue margin and the CARD Act so do you guys actually think that there will be an impact to the ROA of the US Card portfolio from this law?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, let me &#x2013; so, we, the law has a tremendous sweeping impact on the industry. And we're not spending 200,000 IT hours for nothing here trying to get ready for this thing ourselves.</p>
          <p>So, and the way the business works, it's a very sweeping set of changes. Now, some impacts that I think are going to be very hard on other players will be relatively lighter for Capital One. I think a number of our competitors were pretty reliant on very extensive penalty-based repricing, as a core basis for the business model. That really never was the basis of the Capital One business model, and that practice is really at the absolute bulls eye of what the CARD Act is trying to address. There were also other practices like universal default and things like that as well.</p>
          <p>The CARD Act, though, even as Capital One has a relatively intact revenue margin on the other side of this thing, I do want to say that for us and I think for the industry, there will be substantial redistribution of sort of where revenue comes from in the sense that, and I think this is in many ways what the Act is trying to achieve, it's less -- there's going to be less income coming from fees and things like this and particularly things like over limit fees, and I think that the revenue model of the business is going to go back to more the way it was in the '90s, which is more focused on headline rates of APRs and in some cases annual fees. So, I think there's a very important, very healthy redistribution that will be going on but I think that with respect to Capital One I think that preparation that we did for years with respect to our work on credit card practices, you can probably remember some of my presentations years ago. Some of the work we've done over the prior year and then the implementation of opt-in, that opt-in itself, I'm a big believer that for a lot of customers they want the ability to go over limit and I think it's a very appropriate thing to have an explicit opt-in on this and we believe that that will also make sure that every customer is where he or she wants to be, but net-net, when you pull up on this, while there's a redistribution of where revenue comes from, there's a it's a very healthy one and I think overall Capital One is positioned to have our revenue margin be intact through this period of time and into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe just a follow-up to that question or to that response is just if we looked at the mix of the portfolio maybe a year from now would it look any different than it looks today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Within sub segments of segments I would say yes. But I don't think you'll see a dramatic change for Capital One. The thing that's an unknown to &#x2013; well, let me talk about the elements of uncertainty in all of this because I believe deeply that our revenue margin is intact through this process, but let me talk about the uncertainties.</p>
          <p>First of all, on the legislative and regulatory side, there is still miles to go before we sleep with respect to even what agency is the regulator, the actual final interpretation of laws, of the CARD law that's still waiting to come out and then all the kind of things that still loom out there for things like interchange and other things. So there is a tremendous uncertainty so when I talk about intact revenue margins, I'm talking about relative to that which we know right now I feel quite good about that. The other big uncertainty that to me that will affect our mix, as you asked, but also a lot about the size of our business going forward is where does the industry go with respect to pricing? And it has been so long since the industry really had to fully focus on the kind of essential long-term nature of the initial offer that, as I said before, where this go-to rate goes for is going to make a big difference to the health of this business and our appetite for origination in some of the segments of the business.</p>
          <p>But my kind of sound bite summary of where I think the business is going is that we're going back to the '90s. This is back to the '90s without the industry growth component. So, the '90s was a wonderful period of a very level playing field. It did have the nice overlay of tremendous industry growth, but the competition was very much based on headline rates and it was very much the credit card issuers who succeeded during that period of time were those that I think had the strongest underwriting models. I think that the situation evolved in a troubling way during this last decade to where the leverage was not on underwriting. Because people would self-select through penalty repricing into a price level that reflected ultimately their risk.</p>
          <p>We're going back to the '90s, it's all about upfront underwriting. I think that plays to the strength of the whole information-based strategy model that our company is built on. But in addition to playing to our strength I think it is such a positive with respect to the opportunity to go back and really build a franchise with consumers where the debate is not about industry credit card practices and it's really about adding value to our customers and building cornerstone relationships in credit card that can be expanded elsewhere. So we are incredibly looking forward to this and it's back to the '90s.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, we certainly have believed that we're going to be, we are one of the financial institutions that's emerging with relative strength and one of the benefits of that is are there going to be a lot of banks that are struggling and potentially may need to sell themselves and a small number of buyers. That said, we would be very selective. We don't feel any need we have to do this. And we've taken a look at some of the failed bank deals that have unfolded so far. But I do want to say that there's a lot of hair on a number of these things, even in the cases where the credit losses are actually protected. And a lot of times the franchises have been very, very badly revved up and damaged.</p>
          <p>So our view here is we would be extremely selective and we are not in a rush to go try to snap up the first opportunity that comes by.</p>

          <p>Hi, good evening. Sort of a follow-up to the comments earlier. There seems to be very divergent views on where the card receivables could go and how we look at normalized earnings. One view is that receivables fall off dramatically 25, 30 type percent. Is there a scenario where as you get comfortable with the go-to rate that that portfolio balance may be a little more stable than we think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, I've been preaching the -- I've been from the high mountaintop to anyone who will listen, cautioning people over the last basically year and a half or so say just you will find a very, very striking reduction in balances in the card business from a variety of factors. I don't say the same thing looking forward. I don't -- I don't think the rate of decline that you've seen in the past is necessarily going to reflect -- I think going forward the way I look at it is until we -- so speaking for ourselves in a sense I think I speak for the industry on this one as well -- until we see the inflection point at which for us the card business would really look like something where we really want to step up originations, and as long as charge-off rates are where they are, you're going to continue to see pretty much the same rate of decline you've seen in the past. I think that inflection point is near. It's not here. It's probably near. Now, when that inflection point comes, it takes quite a bit of origination to offset the sustained pretty darn high level of charge-offs. So I think the destination post inflection point for card players like ourselves is a more flattish kind of near-term outcome than anything that would show a lot of growth. But I do think post inflection point, you know, unless the industry just is stubbornly not getting its head around what go-to rates need to be, I think that the steep decline would be stemmed.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rich, Capital One's US card business has historically generated ROAs way above the industry 3-4%. And I guess the view has been that a lot of that has been due to the smaller loan sizes with the higher fee-based components especially late and over limit fees. Under the new, certainly one of the bulls eyes of the credit card legislation was some of those fees, especially over limit fees and I guess we'll see where late fees come out, but it seems like you don't feel like your ability to generate those types of very high returns in the future are going to be impaired by this legislation, do you think the entire industry is going to have higher ROAs because of the big increase you mentioned you pointed out in go-to rates and/or what is going to allow Capital One to continue to generate much higher returns, much higher returns than the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. So let me talk about the destination of some of these fees for starters. I think OL's destination over limit fees' destination is in terms of fee amount is down. We certainly expect and plan for that, down but not out in a sense, but down. Okay. I think that the number of occurrences of them is also down because one is going, companies like Capital One will be moving into an opt-in and while I believe that opt-in can be a very positive thing and like I talked about earlier the net effect is also going to be down with respect to that.</p>
          <p>I think with respect to late fees, late fees I think are kind of one of the classic kind of forms of risk-based pricing that I think are extremely well understood in the consumer marketplace, that the credit card is more just very typical of how virtually all financial instruments have credit cards. So it will be interesting to see over time, part of the unfinished business here of the Federal Reserve or whatever agency ultimately weighs in on this is how they view the, "reasonability' of some of these fees. So that one I think we'll certainly keep an eye on. Capital One has generally been cautious with respect to credit line extensions, Bob, and, as a result, sometimes I think had a higher incidence of over limit fees than some players, but I think that we have been more than any changes here are going to be more than offset by the benefit of having a lot less I think sort of changes to make a lot fewer changes on some of the other things.</p>
          <p>So, back to your question, then, will we be able to make I don't want to shingle myself for what ROA we'll be able to make in the long-term. My view is this &#x2013; it's back to the '90s is I would say, that is a level playing field. I think the way Capital One has been able to generate exceptional profitability is really more one customer at a time, the credit and pricing decisions one customer at a time with the use of an information-based strategy that we've not only spent 20 years building, the entire company is designed to be able to execute on this.</p>
          <p>So, I look at that and say I don't see anything changing in a negative way vis-&#xE0;-vis that, frankly the ability to go back to an underwriting differentiated business I think is a positive, and I look forward to a business where truly the competition is more on headline rates and more on upfront underwriting and so I'm pretty optimistic about our ability to generate strong returns.</p>

          <p>Yes, so first of all, it won't be a switch that's on-off relative to the card business, we view this as one sub segment at a time. And when we hit the &#x2013; we look for this proverbial inflection point as I call it. It's not just about when the economy turns because if it were just when the economy turns then frankly we'd have one inflection point across the Company.</p>
          <p>To us it's really about the supply and demand dynamics in a particular sub segment of a business, what's happening with positive or negative selection, the competition and price levels at the time and how the consumer is performing in that business. So, I would expect over, not too long from now we would selectively on the consumer side of Capital One be hitting those inflection points. But what I would expect on the other side of that, Bob, overall what you would see would not be a big bang breathtaking increase in marketing, but rather something that is more gradual and measured, because it is my deep belief that there is still a lot of pretty darn bad stuff waiting to happen in the economy. I don't think that we have to rush to go anywhere. And I want to see demonstration of what the pricing and competitive dynamics are in the business post this CARD Act, and I think that's going to say a lot about the growth prospects for all of us.</p>
