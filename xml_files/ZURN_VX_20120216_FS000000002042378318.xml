          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zurich and welcome to Zurich Financial Services Annual Results Reporting for 2011. Just a friendly reminder to please turn off your mobile phones or other gadgets that you might have with you so we're not disrupting the presentation or the Q&amp;A time. And it's my pleasure then to turn it over to our CEO, Martin Senn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank very much, Debra. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today we are proud to present to you our annual results for 2011, showing good profitability despite unprecedented level of catastrophe and weather-related losses and despite a very challenging market environment. We continue to generate strong cash flows. We have a strong capital base and solvency position. We are growing where we want to grow. And thanks to our resilient performance in 2011 and the continuing execution of our strategy, we are well positioned to outperform in a challenging environment. And this gives us the confidence to maintain our dividend at CHF17 per share, which is as the dividend payment will be paid from the capital contribution reserve exempt from Swiss withholding tax.</p>
          <p>Now, let me give you some highlights before my colleague, Pierre Wauthier, explains these numbers in more and in greater detail. Business operating profit was $4.3 billion, a decline of 12%, while net income after tax attributable to shareholders was $3.8 billion, 10% higher than in 2010.</p>
          <p>These are strong numbers in the year, characterized by a challenging global economic environment and an exceptionally high level of catastrophe losses and weather-related losses. Industry-wide, these losses were more than twice the level seen in 2010 and more than three times the average of the last 10 years. We have also benefited from strong risk management actions and gains from investments, including the sale of part of the group's stake in New China Life Insurance.</p>
          <p>Despite the challenging environment in which we operate in, our return on equity was close to 12% and our business operating profit after tax return on equity came in at 10.2%, reflecting the impact of the exceptionally high level of catastrophes and weather-related losses. Our underlying businesses continued to perform well and to execute on their strategies, with solid improvements in their underlying performance and continued focus on driving growth and value in Global Life and Farmers. And in General Insurance, achieving selected growth in those areas where can do so profitably.</p>
          <p>In General Insurance, efficiency enhancements and robust underwriting actions reflecting our sustained focus on profitability produced a strong 2 percentage point improvement in our underlying loss ratio. With the exception of frequency and overall set severity of catastrophe and significant weather-related losses, nevertheless impacted the combined ratio which deteriorated to 98.8%. Our Global Life business continues to grow new business value in certain mature markets and particularly in emerging markets. And this is in line with our objectives. And we expect this trend to continue as we invest our acquisition in Malaysia and as well the alliance with Banco Santander in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Farmers delivered growth in premiums in all continued business lines except for homeowners. The growth momentum accelerated through the year as farmers continues to execute on its multi-channel and multi-brand strategy, building the strength of its brands and expanding its customer reach.</p>
          <p>As to our capital position, shareholders' equity remains stable at broadly the same level as of December 31, in 2010, after recording the total cost of paying $2.7 billion post-dividends in 2011.  The strength of this performance is what gives us the confidence to pay such an attractive dividend.</p>
          <p>And this slide shows our dividend history including the proposed dividend of CHF17 for 2011. As you know, the dividend is subject to shareholder approval at our Annual General Meeting on March 29. Our policy is to pay an attractive and sustainable dividend. And the proposed dividend reflects both our strong performance and our continuing confidence in our strategy. This has helped us to deliver profits in every quarter since the current economic crisis begun, and in fact, since 2002.</p>
          <p>We are successfully managing the current volatility, and we are prepared for the challenges ahead. Our continued focus on financial and underwriting discipline and the effective execution of our strategy has enabled us to deliver strong results and to continue to generate strong cash flows from which we can sustain an attractive dividend. We are on track to deliver on our targets by 2013. Our capital and solvency positions remains strong and we have a strong platform from which to grow our business selectively in mature markets and into high-growth markets.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we were able to selectively capture growth through our alliance with Banco Santander in Latin America and our acquisition in Malaysia, as well as through the renewal of our distribution agreement in Germany and Italy with Deutsche Bank. We will continue to seek out new opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. And we will strive for organic growth by improving our customer proposition, reviewing our product portfolio, using technology to know our customers better and by investing in our people, our processes and our systems. But this growth, will never come at the cost of the financial and the underwriting discipline.</p>
          <p>We are managing the present with confidence and we are leveraging our strong position to prepare for the future. We believe that in markets like these, our strength is a critical advantage in capturing new opportunities. And we have clear criteria and are committed to acting on opportunities that meets these criteria. And we will do this as usual the Zurich way with discipline and with focus.</p>
          <p>And in recognition of this and the fact that Zurich has now been focused on insurance for several years, our board of directors will propose changing our name from Zurich Financial Services to Zurich Insurance Group at our Annual General Meeting on March 29. Our results for 2011 show that our strategy is working, and as we have highlighted in our Investor Day in December, we are confident on how to further build on this growth momentum.</p>
          <p>And on that note, I would like to ask my colleague, Pierre, to talk you through last year's business performance in much more detail. Thank you very much. Enjoy the presentation. Pierre.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Martin. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to present the year-end results for the Group. During 2011, we have progressed towards our targets and continued our underwriting discipline while growing selectively in mature markets and continuing to expand in high-growth markets. This has been an exceptional year. Hits with the worst catastrophes and weather events recorded of over $105 billion. Our customers have suffered enormously as they were hit by floods, earthquakes and tornados. But this is our business. So we have been very proactive managing claims and delivering when it mattered to our customers.</p>
          <p>2011 has also been a year of increased market volatility and volatile credit spreads as well as continued low interest rates, particularly in the Eurozone, as you know. We have weathered the storm well, thanks to our risk-based approach to managing our assets relative to our liabilities.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the fourth quarter, our business operating profit of $1 billion declined compared to last year as we recognize losses from the Thailand floods of $275 million as well as further losses from the New Zealand earthquakes of $80 million. We benefited however, from our global aggregate reinsurance recoveries in the amount of $130 million. The net effect of all these was a reduction of $225 million on our fourth quarter results.</p>
          <p>In addition, the fourth quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $557 million on the lower chart reflects mark-to-market adjustments as well as a higher tax rate and an accrual for current and future charitable contributions of $100 million pre-tax reflecting our commitment to society. We have progressed on our announced expense target of $500 million for the Group by 2013, achieving over $100 million of run rate direct expense savings from mature markets.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me clarify what has been included in the year-end accounts, and in particular, with regards to more recent acquisitions. We have first fully consolidated Malaysia in the fourth quarter and as such, recognized $9 million in net income for 2011. With Santander, we had included preliminary estimates of $15.6 billion on the asset side and $13.2 on the liability side with $1.1 billion recognized in non-controlling interest and the remainder of $1.2 billion reflecting the net purchase price. There is no impact to the P&amp;L itself in 2011. We will provide more details of the transaction when it has been fully consolidated later in the year 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a look at the results by segments. In General Insurance, we have further progressed on executing on our targets with the results of portfolio management actions and continued rate increases reflected in the improved underlying loss ratio, which I'll lead to a bit later. This improvement, however, was more than offset by the extraordinary frequency and overall severity of major cat and weather-related claims, events throughout 2011 resulting in a business operating profit of $2.3 billion. Global Life reported a business operating profit of $1.4 billion, down 14% in local currency. Increased fee income from a higher average assets under management and higher risk margins from the focus on protection business were more than offset by the continuing investment in the business as well as lower stock market levels and a lower benefit from special operating items compared to the prior year 2010.</p>
          <p>The decline in the business operating profit of Farmers to $1.5 billion is entirely due to Farmers Re. It reflects the lower average All Lines Quota Share treaty participation to 12% and an unfavorable underwriting result given the extraordinary high amount of cat losses at the Farmers Exchanges.</p>
          <p>Farmers Management Services, however, posted a small increase in business operating profit. As slightly lower management fees were more than compensated by lower expenses as well as lower 21st Century integration costs.</p>
          <p>Other operating businesses increased compared to last year, reflecting the strong Swiss franc and the effect of positive one-off items in 2010. Non-core businesses reported, however, an improved result, as this year loan provisions were significantly lower than last year in our banking business. We also experienced lower than expected claims incidence and relative outperformance of our assets relative to our liabilities in the Centre's disability portfolio. For our U.K. and Irish property loan books, we continue to focus on running down the book. And we have already made good progress in 2011 with loan redemptions of $375 million or 16% of the total loan book. During 2011, we also made very good progress on unlocking capital from the non-core operations leading to the regulatory capital release of about $800 million in 2011.</p>
          <p>So now, let's turn to the detailed results by segment. And before we go into the General Insurance numbers, let me set the scene for these results. First, 2011 was the costliest year in terms of catastrophes and weather-related events. Second, General Insurance continues to face a subdued macroeconomic environment that is characterized by low GDP growth or even recession in mature markets, as well as low yields in most countries. And third, we continue to successfully execute on our combined ratio improvement targets.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, let's have a closer look at the numbers. The impact of major catastrophes particularly in Asia-Pacific in the first and fourth quarter and large losses such as the tornados in the U.S. in the second quarter or hurricane Irene, as well as hailstorms in Europe, resulted in major cat and large losses after reinsurance being about $800 million compared to last year. This was partially offset by the portfolio management actions and rate increases taking hold and improving the underlying loss ratio by 2 points and contributing almost $600 million to the underwriting results. The extraordinary frequency and overall severity of the loss events in 2011 has been mitigated partially by the full use of our global aggregate cat cover. After booking an estimated recovery of about $45 million in the third quarter, we booked a further $130 million recovery in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Taking prior-year developments into account as well, the reported combined ratio increased as a result by 0.9 points to 98.8. We highlighted in the third quarter that the result in Germany had been affected by a number of issues. As a consequence, we have undertaken a deeper review of the German portfolios. And therefore, in the fourth quarter, we have further strengthened reserves by about $120 million, including specialized such as architect liabilities. In addition, Germany saw some higher large losses in Q4 and an increase in the hail storm losses, which further added about $30 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Germany remains an area of management focus, of course. But we feel comfortable at this stage with the reserve position and believe that the comprehensive set of management, underwriting and pricing actions, which we are implementing, will restore the profitability of this book.</p>
          <p>As Mario already showed at our Investor Day last December, the implementation of our General Insurance strategy is continuing to show results. Our stance on pricing and underwriting discipline is unchanged and rates continue to go up with a rate increase of 3.5% for the year, a further small increase over the nine months, which were at 3.4%. Portfolio management actions to ensure adequate levels of profitability continue to be implemented. Nevertheless, gross written premiums are flat in local currency in the full year, while showing a small increase in the fourth quarter of 1%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a look at the rate development on the next slide. With continue to push rates and portfolio reshaping actions in a balanced way to drive profitability. As said before, General Insurance rates increased on average 3.5% in 2011. Let me remind you here that this average rate increase comes on top of similar increases over the last three years and therefore have a compounding effect. In the fourth quarter, we saw some further acceleration of rate increases in Global Corporate North America and in certain lines in North America Commercial.</p>
          <p>So let's look now at the individual rate actions in our various market units in more detail. So Global Corporate, as you can see, achieved rate increases of 3% in 2011, as well as higher customer retention. North America Commercial has confirmed its trend of strong rate increases with 4% in the fourth quarter. All major lines of business show rate increases and worker's compensation continues to lead with an increase of about 8% in the fourth quarter. In addition and in line with Global Corporate in North America, we see even higher rate increases in the motor and property lines in the fourth quarter compared to the third. Overall, we consider this to be a really good result in a highly competitive market.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Europe. Rate increases in European personal lines have continued to stay similarly high as in the past few years driven by the U.K. and Italy. In both the U.K. and Italy personal lines motor books, these rate increases continue to improve the accident year loss ratio, further confirming the trend from the nine months and thus demonstrating that our actions show through intangible results. Commercial lines in Europe saw similar rate increases at the nine months. Overall, increases continue to be at healthy level and help to support the profitability of these portfolios.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to premiums, which is the lower chart, which are driven not only by rates, but also underwriting and growth actions, retention and new business performance. In Global Corporate, gross written premiums were flat in local currency. They're reflecting the net effect of all these actions. Global Corporate's underlying production, however, i.e., excluding captive and fronting business is strong, which is reflected in net earned premiums being up 2% in local currency for the year.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. and Europe, the continued focus on profitable customer relationships led to an increase in a retention. And we continued our expansion in Asia and the Middle East. In the fourth quarter, North America commercial have seen an unusual increase in premiums from crop, which is driven by higher commodity prices as well as better harvest leading to true-ups in the quarter. This contributed 2/3 of the 8% gross written premium increase in the fourth quarter, while it continued selective growth in targeted areas of commercial markets, such as energy casualty, drove the remaining increase. This pulled the full year top line to a flat position after a reduction of 2% at the nine months, an encouraging result for the year 2011, which was characterized by portfolio reshaping actions in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Europe's premiums overall reduced by 3% in local currency in the full year, even though we have achieved rate increases. The premium levels reflect a different economic environment in Europe as well as our targeted re-underwriting actions. As such, targeted actions in our personal lines motor book in the U.K. and Italy explains about 2/3 of the decrease in the year. And we are seeing a bottoming out here as the rates of premium reductions is lower. And overall for Europe, retentions rates are up.</p>
          <p>In terms of absolute amounts, the premium reductions in Europe, however, were more than compensated by increases in international markets. Here, premiums continue to grow at 10% in local currency, specifically driven by growth in Latin America by 21%. This increase is mostly due to Motor and Specialties business in Brazil as well as Motor in Argentina. In the region Middle East and Africa, premiums are slightly up despite re-underwriting actions taken in South Africa. Furthermore, Asia-Pacific grew by 5% in local currency, mostly resulting from rate increases in Australia and growth in Japan.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the loss ratio components in more detail. And I will focus on the two charts on the left. Starting with the underlying ratio, it improved by 2 percentage points in the full year to 64.3%, consistent with our improvement in the nine months. As Mario explained at the December Investor Day, we continue to implement reshaping actions across the GI portfolio. As a result, the underwriting result, for example was the 15 poorest performing portfolios improved by over $200 million versus the prior year. As such, we have refocused the U.S. workers' comp portfolio ahead of the market. We also shrunk some pieces in our North American portfolio that were not performing well like U.S. Environmental and some excess casualty portfolios.</p>
          <p>In addition, we improved significantly the performance of personal lines and motor portfolio in the U.K. and Italy. We did this while growing selectively in targeted segments. These actions, together with many others, show that we are progressing well on our journey to improve the risk return profile of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now let's continue looking at the loss ratio and its components. In the second column from the left, you see the prior year reserves or PYD on the chart, which amounted to $1.2 billion, i.e., 4.2 percentage points of the loss ratio or about 2.3% of net loss reserves. This is about $100 million lower than last year. These releases emerges from various regions and lines of business across our Global portfolio, and we believe that the overall reserve adequacy is unchanged year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Global Corporate saw releases of about $400 million from both Europe and North America, while North America commercial released about $450 million from various lines, including liability and financial lines. Europe show net releases of about $200 million, which resulted primarily from the motor business in Switzerland, while most other countries reported small favorable amounts. In contrast, Germany reported reserve increases of over $200 million taken in the third and fourth quarter, mainly in the medical and professional liability lines as I already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Next, major cat losses of $1 billion in total include in the fourth quarter, and as already mentioned, the $275 million from the Thailand floods as well as the $80 million from earthquakes. If we now move on to our large claims, 2011 was characterized by an extraordinary frequency and weather-related losses. In the second quarter, we <mark type="ph" /> flagged (28:38) $200 million or 0.7 percentage points of the loss ratio related to U.S. tornados. And in the third quarter, we mentioned specifically that severe hailstorms in Switzerland and Germany, the loan added about $130 million. Together, these weather-related events added 1.1% percentage points to the loss ratio.</p>
          <p>However, at this stage, we see no specific trend for large claims in terms of loss type and location and we believe that our risk and aggregation management is effective. As I already have mentioned, these unusually high weather/cats losses have triggered the group's global aggregate cat cover. We have separated this out in the estimated total recovery of $175 million in this analysis, which contribute to 0.6% than in the combined ratio &#x2013; loss ratio. In summary, the overall reserve adequacy is unchanged. The underlying loss ratio continued to improve by 2 percentage points. Rate and re-underwriting actions taken in previous quarters are further earning into the results. So overall, I think very encouraging moves going in the right directions.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the next slide, let's put the 2011 cat and large claim events into perspective. So you can see, in short, 2011 was a very heavy year for major cats and large claims. The quarterly average of such claims over the past five years is now at 9%, which is up 1 percentage point from the average we showed last year. And this is of course due to the average for 2011, which is at 12.4%, i.e., almost 3.5% percentage points above the slide here mean.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that the experience over the last quarters largely reflects the volatility peaks, which is worldwide events, as I mentioned before with the highest insured losses ever encountered, and which are of course inherent in a Global book covering large risks like ours and that we price such risks accordingly. In addition, we have not changed the structure of our reinsurance program, which prove to be adequate and effective in this extraordinary year.</p>
          <p>Moving on now from the loss to the expense ratio. Overall over the year, the expense ratio stayed flat as we continued to manage expenses tightly. You will notice in the fourth quarter that the expense ratio ticked up by 1.8 points to 28.2%. More than half or about 1 point was really driven by one-off items such as asset write-offs and increased bad debts provisions from balance sheet reviews and higher reinsurance receivables as a result of high cat and weather-related losses. In addition, there were seasonal patterns, for example in back amortization as experienced in prior years. And we also continue to invest in our international markets. Our focus on total spend is not only targeting other underwriting expenses, but is equally focused on loss-adjustment expense and management costs reported also under non-technical expenses. And we continue to work on our overall expense base to achieve the ambitious cost-cutting targets by year-end 2013.</p>
          <p>As announced at our December 2011 Investor Day, we are making good progress and are starting to see reductions in direct expense in mature market of more than $100 million, while reinvesting in our international markets. And our continued drive to increase efficiency in the business is also reflected in a reduction of head count by about 4% in mature markets.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn over to Global Life. And here also before we look at the numbers, I think it's useful to place the Global Life results into context with the year that also provided many challenges as well as opportunities. First, 2011 was a significantly volatile year for financial markets. Most equity markets and interest rates closed significantly down over the 2010 levels. These declines weighed on results, and although de-risking actions have got some way to mitigate the economic impact, the market volatility continued to impact consumer appetite to invest in unit-linked and single premium products. We continue to adapt to these challenges by modifying product mix and successfully diversifying into the growth markets of Latin America and Asia-Pacific/Middle East.</p>
          <p>Second, the tough competitive and economic landscape within Europe persisted particularly in Spain, Ireland and Germany. Our pricing discipline in these markets will continue focusing on profitability over volume. And third, we continue to selectively invest in the business in line with our strategy.</p>
          <p>With this backdrop in mind, I will now turn to the key performance indicator. Gross written premiums, policy fees and insurance deposits remained flat at $27.7 billion, but decreased by 5% in local currency terms as growth mainly generated in the U.K. and Asia-Pacific/Middle East did not fully offset the reduction we experienced in Spain, Ireland and Germany.</p>
          <p>Net inflows to asset under management remained positive at $2.8 billion. A good result considering the economic environment across Europe and the aforementioned pressure on single premium inflows. While reported new business value increased by 7% in local currency, it doesn't include a refinement in our methodology for calculating new business value for the corporate risks business. Excluding this change, new business value reduced by 5% in local currency. This was primarily due to a reduction in Europe's overall volume and margin and a change in persistency assumptions in North America.</p>
          <p>As noted in my opening remarks to this slide, we are seeing the combination of economic uncertainty, austerity measures and volatile financial markets impact the consumer appetite and competitive pricing behavior mainly in Ireland and Spain, as well as a reduction in the single premium market in Germany. To put this into context, the combined new business value in these countries has reduced by 20%. That said, we have continued to drive value growth within Europe in areas such as Corporate Life &amp; Pensions in the U.K. and Switzerland and private client banking solutions in the U.K.</p>
          <p>In addition, solid margins and APE growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific/Middle East enabled strong organic growth in new business value in these regions of 32% and 15% respectively. While the Corporate &amp; Pensions pillar gained traction, particularly in Brazil and Mexico, Asia-Pacific/Middle East growth came from corporate savings and individual protection products.</p>
          <p>Moving on to embedded value, the embedded value operating earnings of $1.4 billion represented an operating EEV return of 8.5%. The return decreased 1.1 percentage points over the same period a year ago as the higher impact of new business and the expected emergence of value from the in-force was partially offset by expense and persistency variances. The closing MCEV decreased by around $600 million to $15.8 billion. This was largely driven by dividends in the region of $580 million as the EEV operating earnings of $1.4 billion were mainly offset by adverse economic variances of $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>I would like to draw your attention at this point to a new disclosure highlighting our discounted risk neutral cash flows over the life in-force business. It can be found in the appendix to this presentation as well as in the EEV report. And you will see that about 57% of the Global Life VIF emerges in the first 10 years reflecting the size of the long detailed book with our new business entities, however, being on the short payback, high margin business.</p>
          <p>Back to the slide, reported business operating profit decreased by 8% to $1.4 billion or 14% in local currency terms. As mentioned when framing the quarter, the reduction is largely financial market driven combined with a continued investment in the business.</p>
          <p>I will go through this further in a profit by source slide. Before going there, let me go a little bit into the new business by pillar results. Within the bank distribution pillar, the new business value declined by 17% in local currency. While the volumes in Spain and Germany came under pressure, the new business margin improvement of 3.8 points to 28.8% helped reduce the impact to new business value particularly in Spain.</p>
          <p>I say brokers in the business value decreased by 13% in local currency, as volume growth in Latin America was more than offset by lower sales in Germany and the Irish domestic market. Moreover, volumes reduced year-on-year in the cross-border business manufactured in the European hub for Ireland, for distribution in Italy where 2010 benefited from an Italian fiscal amnesty. Volume in the Asian pillar decreased by 5% on a local currency basis, as increased sales in Switzerland and Latin America were offset by reduced sale in Switzerland and Latin &#x2013; offset &#x2013; sorry, by reduced sales into Italy and Germany.</p>
          <p>The change in persistency assumptions in North America was also the main contributor to reducing the pillar's margin and therefore the new business value. International and expat new business volume grew by 5%, while new business value grew by 11% in local currency as the pillar leveraged key distribution capacity in the Middle East as well as improving the new business margin by 1.5 percentage points. And then, Corporate Life &amp; Pensions continued to consistently deliver growth in volume and value in most regions, especially from business generated in the U.K. and Asia-Pacific/Middle East.</p>
          <p>Even excluding the corporate protection methodology refinement, new business value increased by 23% on a local currency basis over the same period a year ago. As with the first three quarters of the year, the appetite for wealth solutions in the private banking sector in U.K. remained in the fourth quarter, allowing the continued placement of tranches of investment bonds through the banking partners in the U.K.</p>
          <p>So, let's now look at the Global Life business operating profit by source view. Global Life delivered a resilient operating profit of $1.4 billion, a good result in a difficult environment and continues to be well positioned to fund its gross new business cost and transformational spend from the in-force business.</p>
          <p>Looking at the margins in more detail. The business in-force expense margin of $1.4 billion, decreased by 6% in local currency mainly as a result of higher operating expenses and transformational spend, which was partially mitigated by increases in policy charges due to an ongoing shift from traditional to unit-linked business in Germany.</p>
          <p>The risk margin of $762 million, improved by 16% in local currency, growing in line with our focus on writing protection business as well as a stable claims experience. The investment margin of $709 million, decreased by 5% in local currency mainly as a result of the reducing investment yields and the divestments of the insurance operations of Caixa Sabadell in 2010.</p>
          <p>The gross new business strain of $1.5 billion decreased 8% in local currency due to the reduction in broker commissions and the lower acquisition cost in the Corporate Life and Pensions pillow. You can find more details in the appendix with regards to Global Life profit by source results by country.</p>
          <p>We completed, in the fourth quarter, the 51% acquisition of Santander's insurance operations in Latin America. So let me give you a few details about the performance of these operations in 2011. As you know, we closed the transaction in October and November of 2011. The initial purchase price of $1.67 billion has been adjusted down to $1.4 billion mainly due to pre-closing dividends as well as FX movements. And you may notice when you look at the annual report that the cash paid was $1.2 billion. The difference relates to approximately $250 million of acquired debt, which then reduces the net asset value of the transaction. This $1.2 billion was financed through $500 million subordinated debt that we issued in January of this year and the remainder from cash resources.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the financial information. Cash dividends paid post-closing in 2011 were approximately $224 million on a 100% basis, clearly supporting the free cash flow generation of the group going forward. There has been a good positive development on gross written premium with a compounded annual growth rate of 17% and a local statutory net income growth of 13.5% on a like-for-like basis, which is supported by the improvement in the combined ratio of about 2 percentage points to 83%, clearly demonstrating the earnings potential of the business.</p>
          <p>Now remember that this is local statutory, so when we'll consolidate it under IFRS, the net income number will change as it will, among others, include the amortization of intangibles. We will give more details of the performance of the joint venture later in the year when we have the time to fully consolidate it. And we'll start reporting on that in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our third business segment, Farmers. Here just also to give you a little bit of background, the U.S. economy also went through a difficult year even though there were signs of improvement in the last quarter with the unemployment rate falling and consumer confidence rising.</p>
          <p>While the U.S. auto industry is seemingly recovering in demand, the situation on the housing market remains challenging with new home sales at persistent low levels. In addition, there were high catastrophes and weather-related losses also in the U.S. Against this background, Farmers continue to execute its multi-channel and multi-brand strategy resulting in an accelerating momentum of premium growth.</p>
          <p>So let's now turn to the figures. As already mentioned, the business operating profit dropped 12% to $1.5 billion entirely due to Farmers Re, while the Farmers Management Services profit slightly increases. At Farmers Management Services, management fees and other related revenues in 2011 were slightly down to $2.8 billion.</p>
          <p>However, in the fourth quarter there was an increase of 2% as a run-off of the 21st Agency auto book readily sales out during the year and the growth of the continued business gained momentum. Lower expenses and lower 21st Century integration costs over the year made up for the shortfall in management fees and other related revenue, then allowing for a slight increase in the business operating profit to $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Business operating profit of Farmers Re in 2011 dropped $205 million to $116 million. This reflects the reduction in the All Lines Quota Share treaty to 12% compared to an average of 30% in the previous year, as well as a 3.2 points iteration in the combined ratio to 100.8%, of which 2.1 points are attributable to the higher cap losses.</p>
          <p>The gross written premium of the Farmers Exchanges, which we manage but do not own, grew 1% to $18.3 billion in 2011. Adjusting for the run-off of the 21st Century Agency auto book, growth was 1.5%. The growth mentioned evidenced in the second and third quarter further accelerated in the fourth quarter, was gross with the premium increasing by 2.9%. The negative impact of run-off the 21st Century Agency auto book, last time maybe I said this, which affected premium growth in previous quarter is finally gone.</p>
          <p>Over the year, all the continued lines of business experience growth except for homeowners, which has to be seen in the context of the economic situation I mentioned before. When homeowner's premiums were down 0.5% for the full-year, they were up 1.4% in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter was also particularly strong for the 21st Century direct book with an increase in premium of 8.4%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Farmers Exchanges combined ratio. It was 106.4% for 2011 or 7.7 points higher than 2010. The deterioration is mainly driven by the loss ratio and reflects the high amount of cat and weather-related claims as well as unfavorable auto property and physical damage strains, both industry-wide and at the Farmers Exchanges.</p>
          <p>Counteracting rate and underwriting mitigating actions have been and continue to be taken. The increase in the expense ratio reflects the strategic investments in Farmers branding, eastern expansion and 21st Century policy acquisition costs.</p>
          <p>The All Lines Quota Share treaty participation was increased from 12% to 20% as of December 31, 2011, leaving the Farmers Exchange's surplus ratio at 38.1% at year-end. The strengthening of the surplus ratio compared to the 36.5% that we reported at the end of the third quarter and is fully attributable to this increase in the quota share, which aims to maintain the solvency levels for each of the individual exchanges at the desired levels as well as keeping the combined surplus ratio in a range around 36% over the cycle, therefore supporting Farmers growth ambitions going forward.</p>
          <p>Moving now to investments. Financial markets, as already mentioned, were a challenging 2011 particularly as the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis continued to unfold. After a particularly volatile third quarter, government bond yields, especially core government bond yields, declined further in the fourth quarter while equity markets showed some recovery. Against this background, I'm very satisfied to report that we have achieved a total investment return of 5.4%, which is unchanged compared to the previous year. Net investment results, which is included in net income, grew by 17% to $9.4 billion due to higher realized capital gains compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's look now at the performance for our Group investments in little more detail. Net investment income increased by 1% in dollar terms but is 4% on the local currency basis mainly because maturing debt is reinvested at lower yields. Net capital gains more than doubled to $2.2 billion. The bulk of these capital gains were achieved in the third quarter by our derivatives positions used for hedging economic exposure as well as the sale of part of our stake in New China Life Insurance in the second quarter. And net capital gains at the fourth quarter were small.</p>
          <p>It is well known that we use derivatives selectively to manage alien market risks. In the fourth quarter, we took some losses on those derivatives, hedging our exposure to equity risks and some gains on those covering exposure to interest rate risks. The net effect being the loss of just over $100 million. These derivative results should not be surprising during a quarter of recovering equity markets and falling government yields. In line with our assessments of diminishing <mark type="ph" /> T risk (52:06) from the Eurozone crisis, we also unwound our EURO STOXX put options, which we mentioned at our half-year results. And this we did in the earlier part of the fourth quarter. As a result, our net equity exposure increased to 3.2% compared to 2.7% at the end of September. This increase brings our equity exposure closer to our strategic asset allocation.</p>
          <p>Finally, net unrealized gains increased by $1.1 billion in 2011. This increase was largely driven by gains on the government bond portfolio as yields fell, more than making up for losses on equities, gain realizations on our bond portfolio and on the sale of part of our stake in New China Life Insurance.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our net unrealized gains increased slightly with gains on European core government bonds and equities mostly counterbalanced by decline in the valuation of the European Peripheral government bonds. In dollar terms, group investments of $194 billion are slightly down from the previous year level. However, on a local currency basis, they are up 1% given the impact of falling interest rates on the value of debt securities.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to shareholders' equity. The balance sheet continues to be very strong with $31.6 billion in shareholders' equity. Overall for the fourth quarter, equity decreased by approximately $200 million to the $31.6 million I mentioned with a benefit from the fourth quarter net income as well as the change in unrealized gains being offset by foreign currency movements and higher net actuarial losses on the group's pension plan, mostly driven by the reference interest rates and especially in the U.K.</p>
          <p>If we now move on to solvency. Our Swiss Solvency Test ratio as filed for the half year, as you know, was 225%. As mentioned in the previous quarter, we file our SST ratio with FINMA half yearly. In line with this, our next filing based on the full year 2011, will actually be made in April 2012. And so we will publish this ratio with the Q1 results reporting.</p>
          <p>We indicated at the third quarter that we estimated the ratio to have remained above 200% as it was negatively impacted from the half year primarily by the sharp fall in interest rates especially in euro, although the de-risking actions outlined at the half year had gone some way to reducing the impact.</p>
          <p>In Q4, volatility in the markets remained elevated. In particular, lower interest rates in the core sovereign bond markets used for discounting the liabilities and increasing interest rates in the European Peripheral sovereign markets as well as the increased equity exposure all impacted the SST ratio negatively.</p>
          <p>In addition to these market-driven effects, the SST ratio will also be impacted by the recent acquisitions, i.e. Santander and Malaysia. We estimate that after these impacts, the ratio to be in the region of 190% based on second quarter sensitivities.</p>
          <p>As mentioned previously, the SST approval process has also not yet finalized. As part of this process, FINMA, requires certain adjustments to be made to the full year 2011 filing, which we expect to reduce the ratio, however, to keep it consistent with the AA range.</p>
          <p>As these adjustments result from the more conservative stance taken, they will also likely reduce the approximate ratio of 1.8% that we use to reconcile the internal model to the SST model in the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>At Q1, we will provide further insight into the impacts of these model changes along with the reconciliation in our internal model. In the interim and to help provide a further reference point, we estimate our internal economic model to be in the region of 100% to 110%, still above our target AA calibration of 100%. Taking the changes to the SST model as well as the volatile market environment, I'm quite pleased with the continued resilience of our solvency position.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to dividends. As Martin already mentioned, we are proposing a dividend of CHF17 per share, which we expect to maintain Zurich's position as one of the top dividend payers in the sector. As clearly stated throughout 2011, our dividend policy remains to pay a sustainable and attractive dividend. This means that our decision is not driven by specific payout ratio or yield, but our intention is to pay a dividend, which is sustainable and therefore reflects our confidence in a steady cash flows and our expectation for future growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>For 2011, the net cash flows from the business amounted to $4.3 billion as forecasted at our Investor Day in December. After taxes and the cost of debt to free cash flow on a run-rate basis is within $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion available for dividends and redeployment into the business.</p>
          <p>In addition, we plan to utilize up to approximately $13 billion of additional paid in capital to continue to pay our dividends free of Swiss withholding tax for the coming years. This offers a considerable income tax benefit to our Swiss retail investors as well as other investors depending, of course, on their local applicable tax situation.</p>
          <p>The book value per share increased from CHF198 at the third quarter to CHF203 at year end, up CHF1 also compared to last year.</p>
          <p>In summary, we're very pleased with the results for the year and our ability to withstand market volatilities. Our cash generation and our solvency position remains strong. We grew selectively in mature markets from General Insurance and Global Life, supported by good progress on our high-growth market strategy with Global Life APE organic growth in these regions. The recent acquisitions in Malaysia and Latin America will further reinforce our expansion in 2012.</p>
          <p>Famers continue its growth momentum, achieving a year-on-year premium increase from almost all business lines and accelerated in the fourth quarter. We continued our underwriting discipline as evidenced by the steady underlying loss ratio improvement of General Insurance of 2 percentage points, as well as our continued strong new business margin in Global Life of 24.5% and our consistent margin above 7% in Farmers. We remain focused on what we can control and we'll continue to execute on our strategy towards the delivery of our announced targets.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. And now I turn back over to Debra for the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Okay. So if I could ask Martin and Pierre to join me up here on the stage and it's time for Q&amp;A now. And we obviously have a lot of people on the line. So again, you know rules. So if you could try to keep questions to at least two questions per time that you ask so that we can allow people to have an opportunity to ask their questions. So if we can begin here in the room first. Yes, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Holger Alich from Germany's Business Daily Hadelsblatt. I have a question regarding Deutsche Bank. Zurich is the leading insurer in the consortium of <mark type="ph" /> DDNO (1:01:34) policy of Deutsche, which had an &#x20AC;800 million claim against the Kirch <mark type="ph" /> problem (1:01:38). Could you tell us how much this will cost you, the consortium? And could you give us the effect for Zurich? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. Alich, for your question. I must tell you that as a matter of principle, we're not making any comments on customer-specific relationships or as well any customer-specific claim. So I'm sorry I cannot &#x2013; I don't want to go deeper into that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the next question. Yes, Ren&#xE9;?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Debra. It's Ren&#xE9; Locher with MainFirst. So I have two questions. First on slide 12, the rate change monitor. I was looking a little bit what your competitors in the U.S. like Hartford, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:29), Travelers reported regarding premium rate increases and then it looks like they were much more positive than you are. As far as I can see, this 4% you have in Q4, that's unchanged versus Q3. Perhaps you can just comment a little bit on the U.S. commercial business.</p>
          <p>And then on slide 77. Oh, that's on the investment here again. If I'm right, the split between government bonds and corporate bonds was something like 50/50 in midyear, or after nine months. Now, I can see that you have increased your stake in government bonds. So here again, what's the reason for this because here again some of your peers are investing now much more into corporate bonds with strong cash flow like food, utilities. Just what is the strategy behind that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so Ren&#xE9;, I'll take your two question. So, two things, one is the U.S. competitors, the investments, I will answer. I'm not sure if I have fully understood your question, so if I haven't let me know. You have to look at, first of all, the rate increases are really differentiated both by line of business as well as customer segments. So if you look for example at workers' comp, we are increasing our risk by 8%. I think this is pretty much leading. The numbers that you have seen from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:04:11) and Travelers I think are in somewhere between the 5% and 7%. But they're really focused on a commercial market, which is a submarket.</p>
          <p>If you look at what we've done in this particular segment, then our rate increases would be comparable. And for example, there's a lot of property. Our rate increases in property are around 5%. So, I think if you look at it then from an apples-to-apples, we're actually pretty much in line with these competitors. And this is not bad for the market because we all go in the right direction. We all then benefit from a more appropriate pricing.</p>
          <p>That's the answer to your first question. The second question, I'd phrase this way, so we haven't fundamentally changed our strategic asset allocation portfolio other than the equity exposure that I mentioned. We already have exposure to credits in our corporate bond, both banks as well as corporate. And that has not fundamentally changed. We feel that having a strong exposure consistent with our strategy of government bonds, of course, focused also a lot on high quality bonds is a good way of managing balanced portfolio and keeping the risk under control, because yes, you can chase for yield and you can invest more in corporate bonds, but then you clearly increase your risks profile and the capital required. And it's not obviously the risk return is then inappropriate. So does that answer your question? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well take the next question from the line please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>First question from Mr. Horgan Spencer of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Spencer Horgan at Deutsche Bank here. Two questions for you. The first one is you talked about the potential changes to the solvency test model at FINMA they're asking you to do. Can you just sort of elaborate a bit more on what sort of topic we're talking about in terms of those changes. And also I think the implication is that you would expect it to cost about less than 10 percentage points if I understood correctly. Maybe you could just confirm that one. And then secondly you talked a bit more about what you were doing on the product side in Life Insurance. I think you particularly mentioned Germany in a single premium business. I wonder if you could just also elaborate on that point. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the changes to the SST model, you have to put the SST model in perspective and how to calculate. It's a very detailed, stochastic model and requires first to have all the results and all the numbers before we can start to run it. Because it's highly complex and especially as you go into low-interest rate environments like us, it's not easy to predict where it can go. With that comment in mind, that's one of the reasons why it's difficult then to predict ahead of time without having run the model what the impact will be.</p>
          <p>Now, the changes that have been requested by FINMA are around some modifications, mostly focused on the <mark type="ph" /> ALN (01:07:35) side, which because of all the options and guarantees, are embedded, are hard to predict, but they are not super significant. And that's why we did indicated I think in &#x2013; you asked to our colleagues in our IR that the impact is probably somewhere in the 5 to 10 percentage points impact. So it would be a very strong ratio, but the key thing also to remember is that it's on a more conservative basis. And the SST ratio has very conservative assumptions embedded. And for example, all the discount rates are done at government rates, and the lowest risk government rates. So you take basically German bonds for the Eurozone. You don't go into other countries.</p>
          <p>So that's just one item to keep in mind as &#x2013; we will give you more details in Q1. I think it is more productive. When we have the numbers that they are confirmed, that they are filed, then we can go into the detail and explaining all the nooks and crooks and the variances over last year. We just wanted to give you an idea of what was happening and trying to give you comfort around where we're going as well as of course keeping you abreast of changes that we did such as the acquisitions and the equity exposures.</p>
          <p>On the product side, what we've been doing over the last few years really is we've been reshaping the portfolio of Germany. Now clearly, you've got an existing book and like many of the life insurers, this was a lot of traditional products sold. So this remains. But the big focus really on Germany is on more protection as well as more unit-linked products to reduce further the risks. And so we feel comfortable actually with the product mix that we're selling in our new business products, and in particularly the new products that we're developing and selling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll take another question from the line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. Farooq Hanif, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much. I've got two questions. On the Swiss Solvency Test, I think there's quite a conservative assumption for the discount rate, of course depending on which market you're in. But I was wondering if &#x2013; do you think FINMA will eventually adopt an approach to that that will start to align itself with Solvency II once we get movement on that. So in your conversations with FINMA, do you see this intention to really move closer to Solvency II or maybe give some uplift? That's question one.</p>
          <p>Question two, looking at the earnings &#x2013; statutory earnings for the Santander acquisition, you mentioned that obviously the real earnings <mark type="ph" /> number (01:10:43) for us would be different because of <mark type="ph" /> DAC (1:10:45) and related intangible effects. I would have though actually that that impact would be quite small or even positive given your high growth and the creation of <mark type="ph" /> DAC  (1:10:52) on new business, could you comment on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, happy to do that. On the discount rates, so I already mentioned its governments and low-risk government. There are two things to consider. I cannot speak for FINMA and what their intentions are. What you should, however, be aware of is that the use of the discount rate is actually in the law. So actually to allow, for example, the discount using swap rates does require a change in the law.</p>
          <p>So that is doable. It's actually not something that from what I understand is completely impossible. But it's still an enterprise to get that going. So I think in the very near term, the change to swap is probably not going to happen, but over time certainly. And, of course, FINMA has applied for the equivalents under Solvency II. And I'm sure that this is part of their full process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry to interrupt, but I mean obviously there's a massive difference in Switzerland and <mark type="ph" /> South (1:12:18), but clearly for you, I guess you would find ways of getting round that anyway. You're very well capitalized, but some local insurers it's a massive issue that's why I asked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But you will understand if I cannot speak for the solvency position of other insurance companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to Santander, so there are more details by the way in Note 5 of our financial statements. I think there are two things happening. And we will provide you more detail really in Q1. One is the fact that on an IFRS basis, you will have this goodwill impairment playing a role, but then of course from &#x2013; on an embedded value basis in particular, so you will have then the new business value playing. I think it's really too early to give you any indications of how this will exactly play out. So, if that's okay with you I suggest that we park that question and we'll give you then more detailed answer in Q1.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fabrizio Croce at Kepler. I have actually only one question. It's about the <mark type="ph" /> pre-federal (01:13:29) country exposure. I saw that you shifted some exposure from Italy to Spain, some $1.8 billion out of Italy and $1.9 billion additionally in Spain. And I saw that the premium are pretty stable. So, is there really a clear view that Spain is better on the way than Italy? This will be on your risk report, risk review report.</p>

          <p>So, this I think are indeed actions that we mentioned and happened essentially in Q2, where we did, sorry, in Q3, we reduced the exposure to Italy. In Q2, we increased our exposure to Spain. So, that was disclosed at the time and it was about the risk return in these two countries at that time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Andy Broadfield from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning all. Two questions. One, I'm just been looking with intrigue at the Eurozone haircut slide that you mentioned and you dragged up I think back at Q3 or Q2, Q3 time. I'm just comparing what you indicated there with where you've ended up or you've indicated you've ended up at the end of the year. And I'm just a little surprised that we're lower than your scenario of the Eurozone haircut. I was just wanting to know if there's a number of factors with the acquisitions, et cetera. I was just wondering whether you might be able to give me a little bit more color as to why that gap exists? Because for me at the moment, I feel like that comfort that we got a little bit from your Eurozone haircut scenario is a little devalued at the moment. So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question just on slide &#x2013; well, I think it's slide 31, which shows the BOP-ROEs for the different divisions based on the allocated IFRS equity. If I run my eye down those, none of them seem to be getting too close if you did after tax to your targets. I appreciate the Farmers business will skew the whole group back up and then they'll be the sort of non-core and operating &#x2013; the operating businesses as well. But I was just wondering, how should I think about those different divisions, which I think the GI BOP-ROE should look like and Life, et cetera, within your sort of group targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I will take the last question first and I will I think probably ask you to ask again the question of the Eurozone haircuts because I'm not sure I understood it. On the BOPAT ROE, well, you have to keep in mind is if you go back to the concept of the 16% BOPAT ROE. And we have indicated that in these challenging market 2 points lower is more realistic, so I guess that would translate to 14%.</p>
          <p>Now, what you have to take into account is that if you actually achieve around 12% on Global Life and Life, then the fact that the BOPAT ROE on Farmers is achieving somewhere between 45% and 50% then lifts you up to the 16%. So, that being &#x2013; so therefore, you don't necessarily need on the pre-tax basis even a 40% to be at 18%. You can really afford to be lower. And that's part of the Zurich model.</p>
          <p>So with that being said, I think the return that we're achieving on GI, we're not happy with this. I mean, as we've explained, this has been a huge impact of losses and cats, which is 3 full points above the average over the last five year. And to be fair, it's true. We are not planning the same year in the future. So, but that's why you have, if you want the improvement actions first on the underwriting so we continue on improving the loss ratio as well as on a normalized basis if you look at the normalized cat, then you get much closer on the GI side to our target levels.</p>
          <p>And then on the Global Life side, the move towards more capital-light products will also further improve the ROE. So it's really all these elements when you take into account, go back to a normalizing, take the Farmers into account, improving returns on Life that get us back to our target ROE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the BOP-ROE and pre-tax 18% you think is the G life in North America and commercial Europe for example are pretty good results if you are to achieve that across the board given the other things you've mentioned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we can achieve 8% that would get us to something that would be &#x2013; we're always aiming for more, but it's already get us into quite solid results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so to the solvency question. If I can make it clearer, you went from 225% I think to 198% on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:18:54) scenario too, Eurozone haircut. Your Q4 movement would take you down to 190% and Q4 was not particularly pleasant, but it was significantly less bad than the Eurozone haircut scenario. So I was just trying to reconcile those two numbers and to get myself comfortable that a Eurozone haircut is &#x2013; that the modeling you did was still valid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This actually has a limited &#x2013; not too much to do with the Eurozone haircuts. I think it's better to walk from the 225% down to the 190%. We said &#x2013; so Q2 was 225%. That's what we reported. We indicated at Q3 that given the market turmoils, we estimated the ratio to be above 200%, right. So let's take 200%.</p>
          <p>So that really then, what we're trying to reconcile and this is due to the increased volatility, the Euro market, the market's down. I think this was covered back in December.</p>
          <p>So now, what you need to reconcile back to is the 200% to the 190%. There is two impacts that are pretty clear. One is the impact of the acquisitions. We're already take that into our account because acquisitions have been completed. So they have an impact both on the available financial resource, as well as well as capital requirement. And I won't give you an exact number, but that's already a few points from both of these.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we have increased the equity exposure. That also further has a downward impact on the SST ratio. And then, in the region of 190% is because there is indeed uncertainty and in particular, it's really very difficult to estimate what is the impact going to be of the lower interest rates in the core Eurozone countries because that has a negative impact on the RBC. So, that will also be an impact that perhaps you haven't fully taken into account. And then the further credit spreads on the peripheral. That's why we mentioned &#x2013; or I mentioned in my opening speech, the lower discount rates that we use for the SST, which is based on German bonds then has a lowering impact on the AFR and also has an impact on the RBC. So, it's &#x2013; without <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:21:26) changed something that is difficult to fully understand and quantify at this stage. That's where it's gotten to the complex calculations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:21:49) first question goes to the investment side. I've seen from the figures that you invested about $25 billion into bank debt. I wonder how you assumed your risk on that financial sector investment and how much is your interest in investing into new forms of bank that like the CoCos and you sort of bank cat bonds that UBS has just placed in the market.</p>
          <p>And another question maybe to Martin Senn is regarding expansion into new and expanding markets. How much &#x2013; has your appetite been spelled now with your expansion there in Latin America and Malaysia or do you plan other rounds of expansionary moves? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:22:47). Now, let me actually try to answer both questions or do answer both questions. On the first, I should stress that our portfolio in bank-related fixed income payable is very well-diversified as you can see as well. Geographically, it bodes as well with maximum exposure to single issuers. So we feel pretty comfortable in the way the portfolio is shaped. Also in terms of how the portfolio has been developing and performing all together.</p>
          <p>With regards to the second question, would we invest in the CoCos. I would say this somewhat for a liability-driven investor as we are in an environment with a solvency regime, which is economic and risk-based, challenging to invest into a, say, an asset which has very specific characteristics as a CoCo has because what you really indicate as a CoCo you really buy is kind of bond with equity CAGR, which in a certain situation should the issuer have a capital sort of constraint converts from a bond into equity. And the challenge I was referring to how do you model that then into a regime where you potentially at those moment when markets are potentially stressed and you might be stressed because of having this exposure. That would make it very, very challenging.</p>
          <p>And so with that, we are not investing into any assets. And I'm not only referring now to Cocos. There you cannot really ideally model that in any given situation and then you make it dependent on market development.</p>
          <p>And this discipline has been one of the reasons why we have managed so well through the crisis, maybe also have avoided, for example, in the past to invest at least heavily invest, I will not exclude <mark type="ph" /> a teaser (1:24:52) position, but we have not really measured in the CDOs. Because in CDOs, for example, it was obvious to us that in a stressed situation, how do you absorb the additional liquidity requirement you have because of the huge leverage in such products, which you cannot really model in a balance sheet such as the liability driven investment company.</p>
          <p>I hope that gives you the answer that these are, in our environment, investment opportunities, which are very difficult to model and therefore, we are shying rather away from it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The expansion, of course, into Latin America, Malaysia. I would say in those specific markets, your question was as well if your appetites satisfied. I mean, we always look to continue to grow both organically and inorganically if it meets our hurdle line and if meets our strategy, our business plans, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>With regards to Latin America, we feel that we have now an excellent platform to capture future growth. Keep in mind we have been in Latin America for over 40 years already before this aligns with Santander. But now the combination with this multi-channel distribution opportunity with Banco Santander. Our own platform, I think gives us enough to work with.</p>
          <p>And there is no immediate plan to look for further and organic expansion opportunities in that part of the world. We are very, very solidly positioned and have a good platform. I think the same is valid for Malaysia. But Malaysian Assurance Alliance Berhad, it's a wonderful asset to have. It's a very good cultural fit. We are very pleased with that. Overall, I think there will be new opportunities and more opportunities for Zurich to grow into a high-growth markets. And if there is any such opportunity, naturally, with discipline I have referred to, we will have to look at it. And if there is a good fit, would execute on it.</p>
          <p>But let me as well stress that we are feeling that we are in a very strong position the way we are organized in terms of our geographical spread, but as well in terms of the reach we have with our product scope at this moment. And from that point of view, we are rather patient, I should say market participants and don't feel rushed in any way. Our priorities is we'll do it the Zurich way, with focus and with discipline and generate value for all stakeholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just have two basic numbers questions please. First of all, your Life BOP was very strong in the fourth quarter. In the past, you guys have been very good without pointing out one-off effects that influence that number. Pierre, is there anything you need to point out, any kind of one-off influences on that fourth quarter number?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, thank you very much for the update on Santander in the Latin American operations. When I model this, probably quite similar to how everyone does it. I'll need to model Life and non-Life separately. Can you give me an indication of how that earning &#x2013; the earnings in 2011 even a rough indication of how they split between Life and non-Life? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Brian, thank you very much for these questions. With regards to the Life BOP, I don't have a specific number in mind, but I do remember however is that it was not very significant. And it was definitely not higher than we always have some. But it was not a big number. And if you'd like to have specifically the number, then I would advise you to go back to IR. The &#x2013; sorry, the other question was on, Santander's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:29:13), I'm sorry we do not have that and I can only refer to the fact, this is primarily Life. So, it's a big portion of the earnings is in the Life segment.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>H, there. Just the first question was more sort of clarification. When you talk about, I think you've told us this in the past. When you talk about rate change, I just want to understand the pace of earned rate change across your portfolio. It looks like the earned the rate change is around 3%, 3.5%. Or is that not actually earned yet? That is more just the written. So, maybe just talk about written versus earned rate change. And within that context, how would you characterize the unlikely pace of earned rate change versus loss costs inflation, underlying loss costs inflation? And the second question just a quick one. Workers' compensation in the U.S., which you've been adding to since, I think, it was 3Q 2010. You made no mention of it this time around, but are you no longer seeing any lead time to reserves there or is that still &#x2013; is there still an ongoing drag there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the pace of earned rates, the rates increases as we indicate on our written basis. So it's the rate action we take, which then influences the written premiums. And then the written go into the earned. So you're right in that. There is a lag in that the rate needs to first go through the written and then from the written to the earned. So it's actually &#x2013; as you take into account the complete full effect is more than a year. But that's also why since these rate increases have been going up for quite a while, you are seeing that earning into.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly the earned would now be only something like 2% year-on-year then or thereabouts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, it really depends on line of business by line of business. They've been relatively stable over the last three years with some increase. So I would go perhaps more towards 3%, but it's probably somewhere 2% and 3%.</p>
          <p>The loss cost inflation was the second question. Of course, this is something that we carefully monitor. That is one of the reasons why we substantially increased our reserves in the workers' comp business. We feel that the rate increases are in pace or exceeding claims inflation. That's part of the underwriting actions. It obviously varies business by business, country by country.</p>
          <p>For example, we had some reserve releases in Switzerland. This is due to a change in legislation on so-called whiplash claims. So that completely then changes loss cost. But broadly speaking, we feel comfortable with the rate increases versus the loss cost inflation.</p>
          <p>With regards now to workers' comp, you're right. We didn't mention anything and this is due to the fact that we haven't seen any adverse developments in this quarter, which is very encouraging. I would put a big caveat, it's that it's very encouraging to see that. It's still a very long line of business. So it is subject to different approaches by judges and interpretation of law. And therefore, while it's a good quarter, as the French say, [Foreign Language], which means that we'll continue to monitor that very closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take one more from the phone and then one more in the room here. So if we could have the phone line, please.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Two questions. On the slide, I think slide 46 in the Life, that lovely segmental presentation, you showed for other in Europe a figure of minus $53 million. I just wondered what that's worth. And then the other question is, I really welcome all the detail on Santander, I think, but given you actually completed the deals in the October, November, I don't quite understand why there's a kind of delay. I'm sure there's a good explanation. It just seems weird that such an efficient company as Zurich would say, "No, we haven't done it. We'll do it next quarter." Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so Michael. Thank you for your question. On the first question, that specifically I don't remember right now. So it's something that I would refer you back to IR with regard to the specific negative item, or maybe we'll come back.</p>
          <p>On the Santander, you have to look while we try to be and continue to be as efficient as possible, you have to keep in mind that this is something that we completed, just completed, in November for the biggest part, which Brazil and Mexico. And the accounts that are prepared are not the same as we would prepare it under IFRS. While overall Santander prepares on an IFRS, the rules are different. They are less detailed, much less detailed. They're not an insurance business. I mean, they're a banking group with insurance operations.</p>
          <p>So in order to get to the level of disclosures that we feel comfortable, there's really a lot of work that we need to do, data that we need to get, because it's not cut the same way as we need it to be. And that it just takes time. And I think it's also very dangerous to give you high level estimates because yes, we've been doing that. But frankly, it's not with the robustness that it should have so that it's prepared for disclosure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then let's take one last question from here in the room. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Pierre Marutti (1:35:58) from the Monthly Business <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:36:03). Mr. Senn, you mentioned when you took over your job, one of your long-term goal is to make Zurich the best world insurance company. How far have you come so far? And how do you measure such a goal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Marutti (1:36:23). That is indeed our ambition, I should say, this is not the long-term ambition. This is the ambition.</p>
          <p>And clearly, you cannot, as an organization act like Zurich, which has this global reach, which has this success. You cannot be sure than anything else than having the ambition, not only to play in the champion's league, but also to win it.</p>
          <p>And when I say that's the way we measure it, this is in terms of what is the satisfaction of our stakeholders, i.e. our shareholders, our customers and our employees. The easiest to measure, and we do that in principle every day with the shareholder because we see every day how is our share price changing relative to the other competitors, global competitors of course, how are they paying dividends and so on and so forth. What is their reputation.</p>
          <p>I think we do very well there and we're probably one of the best. And when I say to be the best, does not mean number one always all the time, but being, really be in the top in the first class fourth quarter of the league table. So there we are probably have done a very good job in the last years and we want to continue doing a good job.</p>
          <p>With regards to our employees, we do &#x2013; every year, we do engagement service where we get results in terms of how they feel, how they don't feel. And we take it very serious and we encourage them to be open and honest in the feedback and to tell us the truth. And we want to hear the truth and the truth is, tell us where it does not work in terms of how we are engaging together as colleagues.</p>
          <p>And we're making good progress. Last year, for example, we have moved up in the engagement of our colleagues around the world in an environment where the insurance sector and the engagement survey has dropped. So we have positive within Zurich, negative in the market. We want to keep that trend going. Are we already there to be considered the employee of choice? No. There's much more needed, much more work needed. And we work very hard on that day by day.</p>
          <p>And with regards to the customers to say, we measure that. We have stream scores where we measure per market, per product, where are we, how do we compare relative to our competitors? And the same there. Wherever we can take action, we take this action. This is a process. Even though it never stop, because the moment we stop resting, that's when we're going to fall back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One more thing. With the integration of all the &#x2013; that the acquisitions you made, is this absorbs resources to &#x2013; does this hinder in your daily business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it does &#x2013; naturally it takes resources, but it's not hindering our daily business &#x2013; this is part of our daily business. And I think the odd is obviously to find the right balance in terms of how do you run the existing platform versus being able to integrate new platforms. And we have to consider that. And we do that. And we prioritize that in terms of well our resource capacity versus the post-merger integration opportunity and so on and so forth.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Debra. And thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen for joining us today here in Zurich and on the telephone. Thank you very much for your questions. And as well, thank you for the good dialog we could have together.</p>
          <p>I do hope that today's announcement has reminded you that we remain a very robust business. A business that through a combination of financial and underwriting discipline and to the effective execution of our strategy, continues to weather the very challenging economic times in which we live, generating sustainable profitability, paying attractive dividends, and enhancing our platform for future growth.</p>
          <p>We continue to generate strong cash flow. We have strong capital base and solvency position. We are growing where we want to grow and thanks to our resilient performance in 2011, and the continuing execution of our strategy, we are well-positioned to outperform in a challenging market.</p>
          <p>Now these results will not have been possible without the support of our customers, our business partners and of course, the very hard work of all our employees and colleagues around the world. And so I want to thank all of them for everything they do and you do to make us a better, stronger company every day.</p>
          <p>And I thank you as well for joining us here today. And as usual, I wish you a good rest of the day. As usual, I wish you, as well, good luck in the markets. Thank you very much.</p>
