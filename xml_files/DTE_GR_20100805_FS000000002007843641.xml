          <p>This presentation contains forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Deutsche Telekom management with respect to future events. These forward-looking statements include statements with regard to the expected development of revenue, earnings, profits from operations, depreciation and amortization, cash flows, and personnel-related measures. You should consider them with caution.</p>
          <p>Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond Deutsche Telekom's control, including those described in the sections Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors of Deutsche Telekom's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>Among the factors that might influence our ability to achieve our objectives are the progress of our workforce reduction initiative and other cost-saving measures, and the impact of other significant strategic, labor or business initiatives, including acquisitions, dispositions and business combinations, and our network upgrade and expansion initiatives. In addition, stronger-than-expected competition, technological change, legal proceedings and regulatory developments, among other factors may have a material adverse effect on our costs and revenue development.</p>
          <p>Further, the economic downturn in our markets and changes in interest and currency exchange rates may also have an impact on our business development and the availability of financing on favorable conditions. Changes to our expectations concerning future cash flows may lead to impairment write-downs of assets carried at historical cost, which may materially affect our results at the group and operating segment levels.</p>
          <p>If these, or other risks and uncertainties, materialize, or if the assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, our actual performance may materially differ from the performance expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. We can offer no assurance that our estimates or expectations will be achieved. We do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements to take new information or future events into account, or otherwise.</p>
          <p>In addition to figures prepared in accordance with IFRS, Deutsche Telekom also presents non-GAAP financial performance measures, including, among others, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EBIT, adjusted net income, free cash flow, gross debt and net debt.</p>
          <p>These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-GAAP financial performance measures are not subject to IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Other companies may define these terms in different ways.</p>

          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning to the participants in the U.S. A hearty welcome to the second quarter conference call of Deutsche Telekom. I think we had some very good results to be commented upon, and with that said, I would like to hand over to Ren&#xE9; Obermann, my CEO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Stephan, and good afternoon, good morning to our listeners from the U.S. We are, indeed, very pleased with these results and the progress in the first half of 2010. We're well underway to achieve our full-year guidance. You will recall that T-Mobile UK was deconsolidated as of April 1 this year.</p>
          <p>Excluding T-Mobile UK, revenue in the first half of 2010 was stable year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to &#x20AC;9.9 billion in the first half of 2010 and at the bottom line, reported net income improved by 1.8 billion from minus 0.6 to positive 1.2 in the first half. In Q2 specifically, we demonstrated continued very good execution. In Germany, we made very good progress towards stabilization of revenues, with almost stable revenues and achieved a turnaround in adjusted EBITDA, with a growth rate 2.4%.</p>
          <p>German mobile strongly outperformed the competition with a 6.1% service revenue growth and a margin of over 44%. And in German fixed, we achieved a broadband net add market share of 52% and line losses on the lowest levels in 2005.</p>
          <p>In the United States, we improved revenue and customer trends. With 106,000 contract net adds, we returned to customer contract growth. Rapid smartphone adoption continued, and that resulted in strong growth in data ARPU to $11.60, as we targeted it; as you may recall, we talked about that several times.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, the service revenue trend improved, as well. In Europe excluding the UK, the adjusted EBITDA margin remained essentially stable compared to Q1 in an ongoing difficult environment, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>In Systems Solutions, the adjusted EBIT margin improved further to 3.4% and revenue growth accelerated to 2.9%, with external revenues growing at a healthy 7.2%. Order entry was stable.</p>
          <p>With regards to our intended share buyback program, we took the necessary board resolution on July 27, with the program to commence as of August 10.</p>
          <p>Save for Service continued to support &#x2013; continues to support group profitability with savings of &#x20AC;1 billion in the first half of 2010. Finally, our core direction in &#x2013; with regards to wireless Internet, mobile data revenues grew healthily by 28% to &#x20AC;2.1 billion in the first half. In summary, based on these good results, we confirm our guidance for 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to key group financials in Q2. If we adjust the 2009 and 2010 Q2 figures for the UK for better comparability, group revenue grew pro forma by 0.9%, while adjusted EBITDA decreased pro forma by 1.9%. The growth in the adjusted EBITDA of Germany could not entirely offset decrease in the adjusted EBITDA of the U.S., Europe and GHS. On a pro forma basis, adjusted net income grew by 0.6% and reported net income by 20.5%.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow improved pro forma by 5.7% to &#x20AC;1.5 billion. In particular, due to lower cash CapEx. With a free cash flow of &#x20AC;2.9 billion in the first half of 2010, we are well on our way to achieving our full-year guidance.</p>
          <p>Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA benefited from foreign exchange effects in the quarter. Looking at the main regions, we see the following developments for the first quarter. In Germany, we are continuing the trends towards revenue stabilization, as we have achieved the turnaround in adjusted EBITDA based on strong cost cutting.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., total revenues in U.S. dollars were almost stable, due to the improved trend in service revenues combined with strong equipment revenues, while adjusted EBITDA decreased due to higher customer acquisition costs in line with the return to positive contract net adds.</p>
          <p>In Europe, adjusted for T-Mobile UK, revenue and adjusted EBITDA decreased, mainly due to regulation in the economy. EBITDA increases in markets like the Netherlands, Poland or Hungary could not offset EBITDA declines in the other markets, particularly in Greece.</p>
          <p>Systems Solutions revenue growth accelerated to 2.9% as a result of the 2009 big deals beginning to bear fruit, while at the same time continuing the trends toward further adjusted EBIT margin improvements, supported by good progress in cost cutting.</p>
          <p>Let me update you on the progress achieved with regards to our strategy, citing some concrete examples. First, improved performance of our mobile-centric assets. In the U.S., data ARPU grew sequentially by $0.70 to $11.60 in Q2 labeling or exceeding the absolute growth in data ARPUs of T-Mobile's larger competitors. In the Netherlands, we achieved a significant margin improvement to 31% and a good service revenue growth of 3.5%, significantly outperforming our local competitors.</p>
          <p>The second bullet, leverage one company in integrated assets. In terms of OTE-Synergies, we achieved a run rate of &#x20AC;164 million as of Q2. The legal merger of Slovak Telekom and T-Mobile Slovensko was completed on July 1. As you know, the legal merger of fixed and mobile in Germany became effective as of April 1, and we have already made excellent progress, as demonstrated by our Q2 results.</p>
          <p>The third block, build networks and processes for the gigabit society. We concluded the spectrum auction in Germany with an excellent result. For 1.3 billion, we acquired 95 megahertz of spectrum, including two blocks of valuable 800 megahertz spectrum. Importantly, there was no new entrant in the auction. In the U.S., our HSPA+ footprint now reaches 85 million POPs, which means that we have the widest coverage with 4G-like speeds in the U.S. We're also rolling out HSPA+ in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands this year.</p>
          <p>The fourth block, connected life across all screens. We introduced the iPhone 4 in Germany, the UK, and other markets. We pioneered 3D broadcasting over IPTV in Germany, we introduced and services like a personalized football TV conferencing function for the new season.</p>
          <p>And the fifth block, connected work with unique ICT solutions that gives the following sub-points. We launched the De-mail registration as a valid legal substitute for regular letters and we won several big deals in Q2, including DekaBank, Deutsche Post DHL.</p>
          <p>At our Investor Day in March, we defined five growth areas in which we aim to almost double revenues by 2015. Here is an update on our progress in the first half of 2010. In Mobile Internet, first-half revenues amounted to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, up almost 28% year-on-year, with strong growth in key markets such as Germany and the U.S. In Connected Home, that is double and triple play offers, Home Gateway and the Communication Suite, revenues were up almost 10%.</p>
          <p>In the Online Consumer Services revenue, the revenues were up 18%. This area benefited from the growth of the Scout Group. T-Systems external revenues increased by 4.8%. Last point, there were no material revenues yet in the Intelligent Network section. However, we laid the groundwork with a number of initiatives in all areas; the Energy sector, Health, Media Distribution and Connected Car. In all growth areas combined, we generated revenues of 8.5 billion in the first half of 2010, up by 1 billion compared to H1 2009. This represents 27% of group revenues, up from 23% a year ago.</p>
          <p>Turning to the operational performance in the U.S., there were several encouraging signs in Q2, although we are still facing a number of challenges. On the back of strong data ARPU growth, service revenues declined by just 1% &#x2013; sorry 1.1% in Q2, compared to a year-on-year decline of 2.5% in Q1. In fact compared to Q1, service revenues actually increased by 1.5%.</p>
          <p>This good result was supported by a better customer development. We've returned to contract customer growth in Q2 after 3 quarters of declines. Underling core postpaid net adds turned positive as well in Q2. The rapid uptake of 3G smartphones continued, and was the main cause for the increase in data ARPU to a $11.60, up 17.2% from Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA increased slightly from Q1, but decreased year-on-year. The cause for this decrease were increased customer acquisition costs due to higher gross adds and increased subsides in connection with the strong sales of 3G smartphones. Despite these significant investments into the market, the EBITDA margin was 26.7% in Q2, slightly higher than the level of Q1, 2010.</p>
          <p>The improved operational performance in the U.S. is also a reflection of the progress with regards to our roadmap for 2010. In terms of the network, our 3G coverage now extends to 208 million POPs, of which 85 million already have HSPA+ coverage, with a maximum download speed of 21 megabit per second. The HSPA+ coverage will be extended to 185 million POPs by year-end. In terms of devices, 3G smartphones now account for 19% of total customers, of 6.5 million, up 1.3 million in Q2.</p>
          <p>We launched a number of new 3G smartphones including Samsung Vibrant, which has received very good reviews as a valid iPhone challenger. We will launch our first HSPA+ smartphone later this summer. We continue to leverage our expanded distribution platform. The better contract up-take in Q2 also reflects the success of some of our pricing promotions, including the ongoing $5 family add-on promotion.</p>
          <p>Before turning it over to Tim, let me review the tremendous progress we have made in Germany over the last 4 years. In 2006, we had to deal with a number of problem areas and started off with a clear target to secure the future and the competitiveness of our German business. And I think it's fair to say we did achieve this in the last 4 years. Back in H1 2006, in terms of competition, we had a broadband net add market share of 5% and a mobile service revenue market share of 35.9%.</p>
          <p>Today as of H1, we have a net add market share of 50% in broadband and the mobile service revenue market share of close to 37%. We have regained the market service revenue leadership in mobile more than 2 years ago and have expanded our lead to almost 4 percentage points since then.</p>
          <p>Back in 2006, we had OpEx of &#x20AC;9.7 billion in the first half, and today, that has been reduced to almost 20% through our Save for Service to 7.9 billion in the first half. On the back of these savings, we were able to stabilize our fixed network margin around 34%, even though it is still lower than back in Q2 2006, while we significantly expanded our mobile margin from 39.3 to over 44% now. Back in 2006, our line losses were more than 1 million in the first half. Today these losses have been reduced by almost a third to 687,000.</p>
          <p>The share of retail broadband and IPTV customers in percentage of the total base more than doubled from 19 to 46%. We grew the number of mobile contract customers during the same period from 14.6 to 17.2 million. Back in 2006, in terms of service, we were dealing with a vast number of complaints: low network stability, low reachability in our call centers, a low first contract resolution rate, and so forth. Today, our customer service is being recognized as superior to our competitors, and also, these KPIs have improved significantly. For instance, comparing Q4 2009 with Q4 2007, the number of complaints is down more than half. The mean time between assist for DSL lines increased by 47% and the first contact resolution rate has improved by 24%.</p>
          <p>And importantly, we have established ourselves as the most innovative carrier in Germany. We have sold 1.3 million packages of our IPTV product, Entertain. We've sold 1.9 million for iPhones. We have already more than a 100,000 LigaTotal! customers, and so forth. Particularly for the small and mid-sized companies, MobileTV and the Remote Program Manager as examples, as further examples of all the innovation efforts, which we undertook.</p>
          <p>Specifically, over the last 2 years, the revenue development in Germany improved from minus 6.1% to almost stable revenues in Q2 2010. During the same period, adjusted EBITDA growth improved from minus 1.7% in 2008 and as low as minus 4.1 in Q2 2009, to a positive 2.4 in Q2 2010. This EBITDA improvement was driven by the better top-line performance and a significant adjusted OpEx reduction, down almost 9% since the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>For the German fixed-line business, we have been growing our broadband customer base steadily and with a net add market share of 45% plus on average, thereby defending our overall broadband market share, at 47%. This was also helped by a better mix and increasing double and triple play customers in our base, which resulted in an increase of the average revenue per access or ARPA.</p>
          <p>Our line losses were reduced dramatically, from 648,000 in Q2 2008 to 315,000 in Q2 2010. At the same time, we expanded our mobile service revenue share from 35 to 37 and increased our service revenue market leadership to almost 4 percentage point.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn it over to Tim for a much more detailed look at the divisions and group financials. Tim, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ren&#xE9;. Hello, everybody. As you could imagine, I'm very pleased with the Q2 performance, especially in the German environment, both on the operational and on the financial side.</p>
          <p>Revenue was almost stable year-on-year, compared to minus 2.2% in Q1. This improvement was supported by the strong growth in mobile and a smaller decline in the fixed line business. The almost stable revenues, combined with the continued OpEx cuts of 2.4%, resulted in adjusted EBITDA growth of 2.4% to more than 2.4 billion. The margin expanded by 1 percentage point to 39.3 and by 3 percentage points compared to Q4 2009.</p>
          <p>In Germany, fixed revenue trends improved as well to minus 2.9% in Q2 compared to minus 5.3% in Q2 2009. This is the lowest revenue decline since 2008. Due to a net OpEx savings of 2.4%, adjusted EBITDA decreased by only 3.3% in Q2. The margin stayed essentially flat at 34% year-on-year. Adjusted for a settlement with Tele 2, which impacted our margin by 70 basis points, the EBITDA margin would have improved by 50 basis points year-over-year.</p>
          <p>On the operational side, the German fixed line business showed an excellent performance in Q2. Our broadband retail market share was unchanged, 47%. In the quarter, we achieved a net add market share of 52.3%. Year-to-date, we saw accumulated net add market share of 50.1%.</p>
          <p>Please note that due to an interface error at the beginning of the year between the old and the new wholesale system, the number of wholesale bundled access lines in Q1 was overstated and thereby, our Q1 market share at the time was understated. This was corrected in Q2.</p>
          <p>Cable regained some market share in the quarter, while the DSL competitors had a smaller market share. With 315,000 line losses stabilized on a level in fact even lower than the 372,000 line losses in Q1. This was supported by IPTV and the further increase in double/triple pay &#x2013; play packages to 46 of the total customer base.</p>
          <p>We see improved customer satisfaction as a key level to reduced line losses. The TRI*M index for our broadband business is now at 54, up 1 point year-over-year and slightly better than of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the German mobile business. We outperformed all of our competitors in terms of service revenue and ARPU growth. We achieved an excellent service revenue growth of 6.1%, compared to 3.3% in Q1. This service revenue growth, again, is more than double that of any of our German competitors.</p>
          <p>Blended ARPU grew by 8.8% year-on-year, far exceeding the growth at any competitor. Compared to Q1, we saw a further acceleration in data growth of 54%, driven by the strong uptake in the smartphone share of handsets sold.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA was also very strong, up 14.3 year-on-year. Let me repeat that again, up by 14.3% year-on-year, even faster than the growth rate in Q1 of 8.8%. This represents a strong margin of 44.4%, outperformed the 41% in the second quarter last year. All of this was driven by the strong revenue growth, continued focus on customer value with a high expanding share of contract customers and low contract churn in the business. <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>In the Europe segment, we had an essential stable margin, despite a revenue decline of 3.7% excluding the UK. Regulatory effects continued to impact revenues and EBITDA. Adjusted for the UK and for regulatory effects, the revenue decline would have been 1.1%. Across Europe, the TV strategy shows good success, with the number of TV customers growing by 31% year-on-year to 2.1 million and net adds of 67,000 in Q2 alone.</p>
          <p>Let's review the development in key markets. The Netherlands again had a very good performance with service revenue growth of 3.5%, significantly outperforming our peers, driven by strong data revenue growth of 28%. At the same time, the margin expanded by 9 percentage point to 31%.</p>
          <p>In the Czech Republic, contract customers grew by 5%, while contract churn remained at the impressive low level of 0.4%. The margin decreased to a still high 48%. Recall that the results in Q2 2009 were positively impacted by a settlement of inter-connection revenues related to past years.</p>
          <p>In Poland, revenues and EBITDA grew in euro terms due to currency. The margin was stable at 39% due to tight cost control, with OpEx declining by 8%. Also in local currency and adjusted for regulation, the service revenue decline improved to minus 3.2%.</p>
          <p>Coming to Greece, despite the impact from the financial crisis, the margin remain stable at a good 36% and we further expanded our service revenue market leadership in the Greek mobile market. However, revenues down 9% year-on-year and EBITDA down 10%. This was impacted by the crisis. The OTE management expect these factors, which have negatively impacted the Q2 top-line performance, to continue through the revenues in 2010. As in Q2, the OTE management will actively pursue initiatives to contain revenue erosion, cut costs and preserve cash. The OTE synergy run rate amounted to &#x20AC;164 million as of Q2. In Hungary, the margin expanded by 1.5 percentage point to 43%, even here a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>Let's go and make a deep dive into T-Mobile Netherlands, which is an example of a very successful in-country consolidation; synergies work. We acquired Orange Netherlands back in 2007 as you could recall. We have achieved a satisfying synergy run rate of more than &#x20AC;100 million, with a further planned increase of 30% until 2012.</p>
          <p>The integration with Orange has been a great success with lower cost, higher synergies and a shorter time period than planned. With lower SACs per gross add, we are gaining high-value customers. Contract ARPUs have been stable despite regulation and competition. Over the last 12 months alone, total OpEx have reduced by 15%. During the same time, the number of contract customers increased by 7.5% to over 2.5 million, and in the second quarter 2010, service revenues grew by 3.5% and data revenues by an impressive 28.7%. And we achieved a record high adjusted EBITDA margin of 31% in the second quarter. In sum, we are very happy with the results the team has achieved in the Netherlands. Our business case is working and our return on capital employed is on the right track.</p>
          <p>Let me provide you with some more details on the OTE synergies. As of Q2 with an annual potential of 164 million, we are already at a run rate more than expected. 60% of these are CapEx synergies, 40% are OpEx synergies. The majority of the synergies derives from procurement and terminals and occur at Cosmote. The total run rate from the buying case will therefore be overachieved one year earlier. We therefore expect the annual run rate to increase to at least 215 million by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>In System Solutions, we saw an acceleration of the positive revenue trend that we already saw in the first quarter. Total revenue grew by 2.9% to 2.2 billion, supported by strong international revenue growth of 7.9% into 700 million in the second quarter. External revenues improved by 7.2% to 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>In Q2, we won several new big deals, including DekaBank and Deutsche Post DHL. As demonstrated by the acceleration in revenue growth, the big deals closed in 2009 are beginning to bear fruit. Importantly, System Solutions was able to achieve a further increase in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin due to the forceful execution of its efficiency program.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBIT improved sequentially by 18 million to 76 million, equivalent to a margin of 3.4%, up from 2.7% in Q2 2009. In 2008, we had a negative margin of minus 0.3%, just to recall, there is a track of eight quarters in a row, with continuous improvement within the System Solutions business.</p>
          <p>Save for Service cost savings amounted to 247 million in the first half of 2010, with 64% of this coming from the ICT Operations part. We have therefore already achieved 50% of the total ambition level for 2010. In Q2, specifically, the Save for Service contribution amounted to 160 million; measures including the optimization of data centre infrastructure, reduction of production cost and Systems Integration, restructuring and standardization of sales activities, and process streamlining in the G&amp;A function.</p>
          <p>Turning to the free cash flow development for the quarter, free cash flow before spectrum expenditures amounted to &#x20AC;1.5 billion, 6.1% higher than one year ago. This was driven, in particular, by lower CapEx and changes in working capital, which more than offset the higher cash out for taxes and interest. Free cash flow for the first half amounted to &#x20AC;2.9 billion, up 60.9%, providing us with a good foundation to reach our guidance of around 6.2 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>Savings from Save for Service amounted to almost 1 billion in first half, with sizable contributions coming now from all divisions including the U.S. Compared to June 2009, we achieved net savings of 600 million in the group; an organic decrease of 500 million, excluding changes in the scope of consolidation and foreign exchange. As a result the group adjusted EBITDA margin improved from 31.3 to 31.6 year-on-year.</p>
          <p>One of the examples of Save for Service measures are in the respective regions. In Germany, efficient steering of truck tolls through new IT, standardization and process automation in the provision of customer lines. In the U.S., significant improvement of purchasing conditions in the area of real estate, IT, and mobile content. In Europe, reduction of network costs for savings in the areas of field service, vendor portfolio and energy costs. At System Solutions, increased standardization and reduction of complexity in the product portfolio. And at the central headquarters, group headquarters, GHS, centralization and elimination of duplication of administrative processes. Just to mention, we have implemented Shared Services for payment, for closing, for consolidation and for the bookkeeping.</p>
          <p>Moving to our balance sheet, key ratios remained solid despite the sequential increase in net debt. As in 2009, net debt increased due to the payment of the dividend in the second quarter. In addition, the stronger dollar also increased net debt and we paid for the German spectrum auction in the quarter.</p>
          <p>However, shareholders' equity also benefited from currency and increased sequentially to 44.8 billion. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA increased to 2.3, but it is expected to decrease again in future quarters. Gearing only increased slightly to one times and the equity ratio stayed at a high 33.7%, 2.5 percentage point higher than the year ago.</p>
          <p>We took advantage of favorable market conditions and raised debt capital amounting to approximately 2.8 billion since the beginning of the year. We will continue to opportunistically tap the bond market in 2010. The reassessment of off-balance lease obligations is expected to support our ratings on top of it.</p>
          <p>Before turning to the Q&amp;A session, some words on our ROCE, return on capital employed, steering process. We are well underway in setting up all important work streams in order to improve the constituents of the ROCE and harmonize all different missions.</p>
          <p>With our full year 2010 results and going forward, we will update you on your &#x2013; our progress of return on capital employed. With that, I would like to hand over to Ren&#xE9; again and we look forward to your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much Mr. Eger. We will now begin the question and answer session <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Mr. Hannes Wittig from JPMorgan, may we have your question, please?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Just two questions, as requested. I would like to understand a bit more the high level of equipment subsidies that you guys had in the U.S. in the second quarter whether you expect that to continue and how that fits into the say medium-term margin targets, do you still sort of believe in the 30 or 35 target, when would we be seeing those coming through. And secondly, T-Systems, so far has done extremely well in terms of revenues and also I can see the EBIT improving, but the EBITDA hasn't really grown yet year-to-date, so when would you expect the strong revenue momentum to translate into EBITDA growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Hannes, it's Ren&#xE9;. With regards to SACs and CPGAs in Q2, the outlook, the higher SACs, especially contract SACs, were due to a number of promotions. For instance, the buy one smartphone and get one free on the Father's Day promotion and the strong sales of the higher value smartphones to the new customers, but bear in mind we had targeted this. We wanted the smartphone penetration to increase and the year-end objective is 8 million smartphones, sorry 3G capable phones in the base. And of course it's in our interest to drive down the wholesale prices in the new smartphones, which we are working on with our vendors.</p>
          <p>We expect however the U.S. wireless market to remain, in this regard, specifically, competitors and we will have to play along with these trends. But still, bear in mind it's a high and fast amortization. On an average ARPU of roughly 50 or $52 for a contract customer, it is still very attractive even if CPGA are $300 or $320; the payback is fairly short and fairly good. And therefore, it makes sense commercially to push for the momentum; it will pay back. But of course, overall, Hannes, we will continue to be disciplined with regards to the costs and cost management, as we demonstrated by the strong cash contribution in Q2, because there, you know, it was up to $744 million, so we will continue to be disciplined, but here it really makes sense. And Tim, on the TS side, do you want to answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Hannes. So, question on the T-Systems, first, the reason that we are steering the T-Systems business with the EBIT and EBIT margin is that the entire industry is driven on that one. If you look to Accenture, if you look to IBM, if you look to Cisco with the Siemens business, they are all communicating the EBIT and we have said that we want to play at high level with these guys, which is a 6.5% EBIT margin. Having said that, we know the business has to come from the top, so it has to come from international external revenues. That's the main focus in T-Systems. So not in T companies, so outside in the world all over the place we see great growth rate and we have all the big deals gained in the last year and they are now in the transformation phase to make comfortable margins.</p>
          <p>And what you will see in the upcoming quarters, and even in the Czech, with regards to the future, we have said we want to see a 6.5% EBIT margin, which will even support, let's say, the EBITDA trend at the same time. So I think we are well on track. You have seen already quarters coming in, the EBITDA year-over-year was almost stable, it was stable so no big increase, but we expect an increase in EBITDA coming soon.</p>

          <p>Mrs. Robin Bienenstock from Bernstein, may we have your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much; two questions. One again about the U.S. I'm just wondering if you can tell me anything about the returns or activations you might have had on the Father's Day promotion, and whether all the phones that were taken up were really &#x2013; have become active? And the second question is about German cable pricing. I've just seen some of cable pricing get a little more aggressive in the last couple of months, and I was wondering if you have seen any pressure or felt any pressure from that since that's come into play? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah thanks, Robin. Yeah, first of all on the Father's Day promotion, all I can say and I want to say really, it was a successful promotion and, as expected, so really not surprising really came down well and it helped.</p>
          <p>The German cable pricing and the pressure resulting from that I, to be honest, I &#x2013; yes, cable is growing and &#x2013; but look at the overall market share. We are still very strong in comparison to cable and overall, we do not fell pressurized by the cable initiatives over and beyond what was in the past. Having said that, we take them very serious, because we are not na&#xEF;ve. We know that the Docsis 3.0 technology is good &#x2013; it gives them a good competitive edge, and therefore, we are building our network also very targeted and our distribution activity is very targeted, trying to cut deals with <mark type="inaudible" />, with the real estate management companies and so forth in order to keep them at bay and we take them serious, but so far no, I don't feel any increased pressure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ren&#xE9;, I might add, on the respective question with regard to the cable operators, first of all, from the cable competition, only Unity Media has reported Q2 figures so far, which looked, by the way, mediocre with 26, a negative 26% internet net adds year-over-year. So the net adds were quite low compared to ours. What our estimates are, and I think Deutsche Telekom is the only company, which is giving a little bit of an entire market overview, is that we &#x2013; that we see that the cable operators will show something around 40% of the net adds in the second quarter. With us having 52% in the quarter on the net adds I think even with the attacks, we have a good product on hand with Entertain. It means that we are effectively doing quite well, but I think Ren&#xE9; mentioned already, the competitiveness we are taking serious.</p>

          <p>Mr. Peter-Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux, may we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions please. First one, relates to your CapEx guidance, which is so far, sort of been between 9.3, 9.4 billion for the year. You're obviously running at a rate somewhat lower than that and even though I know some of your CapEx is supposed to be back-end loaded, I'd just like to sort of ask you if your outlook for CapEx for the full year has changed or if it's still the same? The second question on GHS, is the run rate on the EBITDA losses in this business indicative of what we should expect for the second half of the year as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter-Kurt, we felt that we want to spend a touch more than in '09, so gross cash CapEx of approximately 9.3 to 9.4, which compares to 9.2 of the &#x2013; in the previous year. The slight increase is predominantly driven by around 20% higher CapEx in Germany, both in fixed and mobile and I &#x2013; and I'm almost sure you would endorse that, that it makes a lot of sense to strengthen our German position and sustain our German strong market position by being more aggressive on the network and really offering the superior quality also with regards to what the previous question was regarding cable. So it's predominately driven by Germany, and due to the deconsolidation of UK, it's going to be reduced by approximately 100 million. And yes, it's correct that we spent significantly less cash CapEx in the first half than last year in comparison to last year. And &#x2013; but there were external conditions mostly responsible for that, like the weather condition which was very strong in Q1. We'll spend a bit more CapEx in H2 than in H1 I think in Germany, but so we don't see any strong reason to change our CapEx guidance for the full year, I mean we'll see how it goes, but the start into the year &#x2013; that we started slowly gives us some flexibility, but we don't consider it prudent to revise the CapEx currently &#x2013; the CapEx guidance downwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, let me answer your question with regard to the GHS and the EBITDA. First of all, please understand we are not giving a sequential guidance on GHS business. Secondly, I think we confirm our guidance of around &#x20AC;20 billion for the year minus the deconsolidation of the T-Mobile UK and this is including all the costs which we see at GHS. Thirdly, I think we should bear in mind that at the GHS level, this is very much characterized through one-timers or as well, additional costs for certain things. First, we have higher costs of Vivento due to an increase of people net that we have shifted into Vivento. Second, this year, we will see a lower contribution from one-timers, especially the sale of real estate, which we always had as a kind of profit in the past at GHS is to be planned lower for this year. Thirdly, the entire development for digital service and our product development is part of the GHS. And, as you know from our strategy, we have a big attempt to improve towards more mobile data and broadband services and therefore even here some increase. Looking now into the numbers, I would say for the remainder of the year, it would be a good indication to take the run rate you have seen for the first six months as an indication for the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Thomas Friedrich from UniCredit, may we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I would like to come back briefly to the German business once again. Yeah, we have seen very strong trends in wireline. With respect to the line losses, especially, I would clearly link it to a weakness of your competitors in the broadband market. There was &#x2013; they didn't win a lot, so you couldn't lose a lot and, yeah, Tim already described the cable performance. My question in this context would be or my notion is that it got significantly better, the situation in German wire line for you, the question is can it get any better from this stage, where it is right now? What do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thomas, I would suggest we look at cause and effect. Our competitors are as strong as they can perform, given also the fact that we have increased our distribution and proved our marketing, our brands, our service levels, our pricing competitiveness, our cost structures. I mean overall, it's a result of our efforts. So, I say this, to be honest, because we are a little proud of what we have achieved in Germany and it's not because the competitors are all stupid, it's because we have been very strong, if I may say that with all modesty.</p>
          <p>So can it get any better? Our objective is to at least achieve on a yearly basis of 45% in net adds broadband, and if you look a couple of years down the road, in order to sustain on that level, or to even improve from that level, we have to, as I said earlier on, we have to really build smartly in the right areas in a very targeted way the broadband network, the fibre-optic network in comparison to broadband wireless and start selling it even more aggressively before we build.</p>
          <p>So it's a combined effort of creating the right marketing package and propositions, the reasons for customer really to create the demand for customer really to create the demand for speed or the need for speed and then sell our packages into the areas whilst we are building in the network. It can't be that we keep building, building, building and the sales are still so underdeveloped. And therefore, the honest answer is, yeah, I think it can get better with regards to the level of connections on the broadband and the premium customers are willing to pay in comparison to the network build out; that's the thing I'd like to improve. And does the market share overall get much better than this? I don't know. I don't think it will be wise to even target something well beyond 50%. I think it's good where we are, and we should try and stay at that level with regards to the share.</p>

          <p>Mr. Ulrich Rathe from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Gen&#xE9;rale, may we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. Two questions please, one is on share, the share buyback. Can you give us a sense of what the thinking was behind the timing of this, what the board's considerations sort of were looking in order to determine the timing? And that would be my first question. Second question is with regard to the cost cutting momentum. If you look at what you've achieved in the first half, especially in German fixed, do you see efforts currently intensifying, or are you sort of relaxing it a bit or is it sort of the run rate that we should be looking at, I'm just trying to get a sense of where the cost cutting momentum currently is? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'd like to &#x2013; first, answer the question with regard to I made a big mistake that I have not bought more shares. That is my first observation because I see the potential on the share and it could be even supported by our share buyback program. We wanted to send an important signal to the market that we are committed to execute on the share buyback program and we have everything in place, so the share buyback program is ready to start. And I think that is the first signal. We have promised to do it this year, and to start with the program, we could now do it. But it's not an indication that we immediately start buying back shares. We will use that because we see &#x2013; we still see a high volatile &#x2013; volatile markets and we see opportunities in buying back the shares at good prices, where we believe it's &#x2013; it's a good value behind it. So with that, I think, and with the development we see, we believe with an undervalued shareholding, we have potential and we could start immediately, but please don't forget, it is always correlating to the total share of the remuneration sum, which we have promised into the market. So if we have the share buyback coming, it will have an impact on the dividend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Mine is both about trends in Germany. First is as regards the progress of Save for Service and what you think can now be achieved in the balance of this year on the German fixed wire side? And the second is as regards the mobile growth rate, I don't know if you &#x2013; you've obviously seen quite a material acceleration, even if we strip out the impact of the changed phasing of mobile termination rates this quarter. Is that rate of acceleration something we should expect to see for the rest of the year or is it now going to &#x2013; are we going to find the comps get a little bit tougher and general market conditions change a little bit against you perhaps? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I missed, I think, the question from Ulrich and &#x2013; with regard to Save for Service and it's the same question was just from Simon here with regard to Save for Service expectation for 2010, sorry for that. For 2010, we expect that the full Save for Service contribution, which we have laid out on our Investors Day. Therefore, we confirm our guidance for 2010 with regard to the 1.5 billion net OpEx savings until 2012 and this is a program that we always said which is not a back-end loaded only it's not hockey stick planning. The main contribution should come already this year. That is what we have said on Investor Day and this is still in our planning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And mobile growth rate, Simon asked the question whether the acceleration can continue or whether the growth rate is going to remain the same. I actually don't think I should give a detailed guidance here on what the percentage looks like, but overall, I'm very bullish with regards to the wireless Internet opportunity and that will continue to grow and Germany was impressive, at more than 50% year-on-year growth rate in wireless Internet services, but coming from a low level, so where are we? We are, I believe at the beginning of the wireless Internet opportunity and there is not yet the game console, not yet the camera, not yet the car connected and everything, so this is driving it. This is driving growth for the next years and this is something we put a lot of emphasis on.</p>
          <p>There is tailwinds from that but there is a little headwind from the termination rate cut, which is &#x2013; we have it in our plans, of course, and it's going to happen in November. So overall, I'm very optimistic on German wireless, but again, there are some tailwind factors and a little bit of headwind factor as well. Bottom line is I think it looks good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me come back to the question with regard to the savings for the group, and about the net savings in the second quarter of this year. I think we did see a net cost reduction of 340 million, but this is including, of course, the UK. Ex-UK, we would have seen a cost increase of 375 million. This is predominately driven by the U.S., where the cost increased by 350 million, and this is partially due to the currency, increase in U.S. dollar terms and, so, foreign-exchange adjusted it was &#x2013; would have been only 95 million.</p>
          <p>In Germany we did see a reduction of approximately 100 million. Keep in mind that we did had a one-timer in that number and GHS there was even some cost increase throughout the year and reflect on that one, especially on the Vivento side. So far, we are in line with the guidance, and I think that is important to know. In Europe, costs were more or less stable, but even here, inflated by the foreign exchange movements. On the foreign exchange adjusted base, the European costs would have been down by something around 50 million. Can we do worse? Let's see, but I could tell you, in each of the regions, we have a Save for Service program up and running to further reduce our costs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, yeah. And obviously, synergies and mergers working in Netherlands and I'm sure the UK. I just wondered if this brings us back to the question in the U.S., as you consider your 4G options, whether a merger with one of the other players is starting to become a most sensible option and whether we should be thinking about that on a one to two year view. And secondly, in the U.S. again, can you quantify to what degree you benefited from a lull in iPhone sales at AT&amp;T? That you saw a low yourselves in Germany ahead iPhone 4. I wondered if you had seen a reduction in port-outs to AT&amp;T and you could quantify the impact of that in Q2? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try and answer the first question of the merger. Justin, I'm afraid I would not stimulate any new speculation on this topic. As you know, we are looking at every option to build a position which allows us to migrate over time into 4G smoothly. And that &#x2013; the range of options are from getting some additional spectrum; we don't need much additional spectrum to begin with, but we should have some additional spectrum ideally. So we could either acquire that by virtue of auction, we could probably lease it from somebody else, or we could do &#x2013; find another way in terms of network partnership, whatever. There are various ways to get there. And the time pressure on the migration to 4G, I think we shouldn't overplay it because our HSPA+ technology currently is really superior, and HSPA+ is not yet at the end of its life cycle, so there will be further upgrades, I believe, with regards to its performance and therefore, we do offer to the customer a full ecosystem form devices to back-end services and wireless Internet services, plus a great network; by the end of the year with 185 million POP coverage with HSPA+.</p>
          <p>So our rate to 4G is &#x2013; we have a number of options to get there. We'll focus on that over the next 12 the 18 months what the best option is. Trust me, we will do a good and we'll focus on this and we will find a good way to get there. iPhone sales lull, I don't quite understand the word, what does it mean? Benefit from iPhone sales?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mathieu (sic) [Justin], if I understood correctly you are asking whether we benefited from people waiting for the iPhone and therefore AT&amp;T porting in less customers, is that correct?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just have some similar questions to Justin, but as I got the floor, I'll ask a slightly different one. Just on Germany, we have seen a slight change in strategy from Sky Deutschland on the back of their slower subscriber development. Are you still happy that your IPTV product is going to be competitive going forward and you can still reach the objectives you've got for that?</p>

          <p>IPTV products is competitive, yeah. I think the customer satisfaction is very high, with those, provided the network is there. And so the customers have a high-speed connection, as soon as they are becoming users, the feedback is very good and therefore, I'm, to be honest, not yet concerned about Sky Deutschland, but we are watching it very carefully and we'll fight back, if need be. Don't worry.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon, thank you. My question again in the U.S., basically trying to understand a little bit what do you think was different in Q2 versus and Q1 and Q4 and explain the positive contract net adds. I mean, was there a particular segment or the calculation of the way you have been more successful, or just broad-based progress? And the second question, with regards to the German mobile, very strong margins, I know that subscriber retention cuts, unit ones are down substantially, so I was wondering if that's something that is a one-off, you have a less competitive need &#x2013; or because your prices are now more in line with competition you don't need to subsidize as much. I guess the question is, can we expect SRCs to be down by that amount for the rest of the year? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I'll go to the first part, what was different. Core postpaid net adds turned positive in the second quarter after the significant losses in previous quarters due mainly because of gross adds. So the churn was really the driver, the churn was still on a level like previous quarters, so it's still something we have to improve on. It's basically the success of the 3G smartphone lineup. We talked about that for a long time, but now the 3G suite of devices is really getting more attractive and we did good promotions in Q2, for instance, the $5 family plan add-on or the other promotion with buy one smartphone and get one free, and so forth, but, primarily, really the network improvements, the device range and the promotional activities mattered most.</p>
          <p>Core postpaid gross adds were 1.36 roughly, which were up by 16% year-on-year, which also explains a little bit of the higher SACs and they were compared to 1.12 in Q1 in 2010. So you see really the postpaid gross adds were the key drivers. And also machine-to-machine net adds were positive in Q2 as of Q1. I think that explains most of it?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's really to repeat the question, which I think you probably just missed, which was what happened with SACs/SRCs in the domestic market in the quarter? These were down I think 5% for SACs, 40% for SRCs, and obviously your margins were extremely strong. So it looks like you've been happy to see contract churn rise whilst reducing SACs/SRCs to the benefit of margins. Is this a permanent rebalancing of that equation or should we expect that situation to reverse in the future?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Without going into all detailed point of the analysis here, but there is an element of customer loyalty in there, customer satisfaction. Really, we are in a good position in the German market and to be honest, it's a bit easier to retain customers than it used to be at this point in time and also, we are focusing on the valuable customers, and really focusing the resources we are putting into the retention efforts, so the efficiency of the retention efforts and the spendings are bigger and also the efficiency or the effectiveness, I think, is a better word here, are better than before. So I don't think it's a magic recipe. It's basically a stronger brand, strong customer satisfaction and also a focused investment on where to put the money, how to run the campaigns.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is also a &#x2013; an impact of seasonality in there because I think it will be probably having more on retention later on this year, especially on the mobile side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions, please. Firstly, at the Capital Markets day earlier in the year, you talked about competition from cable broadband and your attempts to fight back against cable broadband. You mentioned perhaps developing a closer relationship with building and housing associations in an effort maybe to attack the cable market going forward. Could you just give a quick update on any progress that's being made there? And secondly, if we just come back to the U.S. spectrum, you mentioned as well, you were looking at a number of possibilities for buying spectrum in the U.S. market. Could you just give a quick update on any discussions you may have had with the FCC or the U.S. government on the potential release of new spectrum, and in particular, on low-frequency spectrum? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the second point, there is nothing to report other than all the publications on this topic of spectrum from the FCC. So we would not be &#x2013; we would not want to communicate anything other than what you can read from publications from the FCC themselves. Competition in cable &#x2013; with cable I think the best update is really the numbers. If you look at our market share, of growth in net adds in particular, if you look at the market share of cable, what you see is a competition situation which focuses on the network providers, which is Deutsche Telekom as well as the cable guys, and the overall level of new connectivity &#x2013; of new connections in broadband has &#x2013; over time, has decreased and therefore you see we, with about 50% and then to a large extent the cable guys who are growing. The pure resellers are &#x2013; or the alternates are decreasing. So I think it's a fairly polarized competition now, and we are &#x2013; there is nothing new, nothing else to report. Look at the numbers; they are strong.</p>

          <p>Okay. Please go ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is about to end. Should you still have further questions, we kindly ask you to contact the Investor Relation Department. Mr. Hugh McCaffrey from Goldman Sachs, may we have your last question please?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just had one question on the U.S., and one question on the German broadband market. And firstly, on the U.S., in terms of the postpaid churn metrics, can you give us any color on how that is working between your core and non-core postpaid customers? And on German broadband, clearly the net additions are falling off, but are you seeing a fall-off in gross adds? And on the 12-month view, do you expect the overall DSL market to shrink? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the U.S. postpaid churn in Q2, we still had high competitive intensity, for instance, the Evo phone by Sprint was introduced and the iPhone 4 by AT&amp;T and that still led to a significant churn. As you know, the 2.2% is the same as in previous year and that's not really satisfying. We need to work on this further and need to get that down. But nevertheless, we were able to over compensate the continued high churn with better gross adds, as we said earlier on. And we have set up a comprehensive churn management program. Through all the measures we have implemented, we really hope to lower the monthly churn by 20 to 25 basis points in the course of the year, but we have to really focus on the second half of the year; most of the improvements will only come in there.</p>
          <p>Please recall, though, that contract churn is typically also a bit seasonal and it would normally seasonally increase in the second half of the year. So the churn management program really has to be good in order to compensate for this. But again, I can only say we are focusing on churn management, for instance, with upgrade reinventions, a redesigned program to provide customized offers to our best and most loyal customers. Also, we're looking hard on the credit management process because part of the churn, as you know, is forced churn by people who can't pay their bills and we need to have a better outcome there. Handset insurance is something, which are customer pain points. We &#x2013; by buying handset insurance we focus on customer pain points and increase the handset insurance adoption to protect our customers. And then, we also need to work on our coverage further, our indoor coverage, and we need to work on improved network perception, because that is also a big &#x2013; has been a big reason for churn and so forth. So our ambition level in 2012 is really to drive the contract churn to below 1.8%, but between today and there is still long way to go and we are focused on this.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Answering your question with regard to the German broadband market, first, we have no indication, or even not in our planning that the total connections or even the market is declining. The second topic is with regard to the broadband connections, we have currently a penetration of something of 66%, something on that line, so there's still a leading potential for all of the players to grow. Nevertheless, and you have seen that already in the last quarters, that the speed is coming down, so the number of net adds that we have seen in the respective quarters have been slowed, that is one of the reasons that we are so happy that in the last three years when this market really got fast penetrated we gained a high market share of 47%. So overall, don't see a decline on overall connections, see still potential for further penetration, but not at the same run rate as we have seen in the last 12 months.</p>
