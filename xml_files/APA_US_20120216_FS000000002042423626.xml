          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Kandra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the 2011 Q4 and end-year earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Patrick Cassidy. Sir, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kandra. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's full-year and fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>This morning we reported earnings of $4.5 billion or $11.47 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excluded certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $4.7 billion or $11.83 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $10 billion.</p>
          <p>On today's call, we will have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and finally Roger Plank, our President and Chief Corporate Officer. We've prepared usual detailed supplemental data package for your use, which also includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flows from operations, or pre-tax margins. The data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.</p>
          <p>Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick. And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache had an outstanding year in 2011. We had strong production growth, earnings, and cash flow, all delivered with the financial and balance sheet discipline that has characterized our company for 57 years.</p>
          <p>Apache's global oil and gas production in 2011 was 748,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is 14% growth over 2010 and a new record for us. The strong growth delivery was consistent with our performance over time compared with other companies. Whether it's over the last five years or 10 years, Apache grossed production more than most of its peers. And we do this in a balanced and diversified manner, living within our means. Crude oil represented 45% of our 2011 production, and if you add NGL, liquids represented 50% of our production. We already have the portfolio balance that most of our peers aspire to obtain at some point in the future. As we grow competitively, we do not sacrifice our balance.</p>
          <p>2011 earnings, as Pat mentioned, is $4.5 billion, which was 50% up year on year or 36% per share. Our cash flow from operations before working capital items in 2011 stood at $10.2 billion, which was up 39% year on year. The driver of this financial performance is truthfully saying we focus on rate of return, and it shows. This financial performance will continue to fuel our growth as it continues to increase our investment capacity. Needless to say, 2011 was an excellent year for Apache.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to move to 2012 and talk a little bit about our capital program and our production growth forecast. Our initial exploration and development capital budget for 2012 is $9.5 billion, which is a 25% increase year on year on a cash basis. And we'll continue to ramp up our activity in the Permian, the Anadarko/Wash fairways, and development projects in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and also our global exploration. We live within our means, and we do it consistently. I would say, at strip prices, this initial 2012 capital program leaves us with well over $1 billion of operating cash flow surplus. As we always do, we will put our additional investment firepower to use as we go through the year.</p>
          <p>In the Permian alone, our initial budget increased from $1.1 billion in 2011 &#x2013; and I might add, it was $500 million in 2010. In 2012, we'll spend $1.7 billion, and depending on commodity prices, we expect to at least double last year's price. We expect to grow production between 7% and 13% in 2012, which excludes operations divested in 2011. And we delivered this competitive growth with less than half of our capital. As Roger will outline in greater detail, over half of our 2012 capital program goes to projects that grow our production starting in 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we're also stepping up our global exploration activity, and I'd like to briefly list a number of our key exploration steps for 2012. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we expect to participate in six oil prospects with a combined potential of well over 600 million barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to grow our footprint and prospect pipeline there. In Alaska, we will drill our first wells in the Cook Inlet, which is a <mark type="ph" /> contrarian (6:04) oil exploration play, where we are the largest acreage holder with some over 800,000 acres. In the onshore North America, we're taking advantage of our premier acreage positions to progress new liquids plays in which we have critical mass, such as the Canyon Wash in the Texas Panhandle, where we were the first movers last year and are now shifting to a development phase with 14 wells in the play.</p>
          <p>A number of new plays in the Permian, including the Wolfcamp shale play, where we're going to test our 25,000-acre position there. Deepwater Kenya, we intend to drill our first major oil prospect in the third quarter, with a potential of nearly 300 million barrels of oil equivalent and the opportunity to de-risk several additional prospects. In New Zealand, we expect to drill our first four wells, targeting our new onshore unconventional play. We will also continue our exploration in Australia and Egypt, where we have built so much value through the exploration over the years, and we will continue to add new large-scale exploration positions, some of which we are not ready to announce.</p>
          <p>We also started increasing our dividend in 2012, as a few of you noticed. Steady dividend growth has been an important element of our financial strategy over time. We put this on hold as the world went through its turmoil over recent years, but we believe it is the right time to resume our dividend growth. Apache's mission is to build long-term value for our shareholders, and we remain confident that our fundamental value will be recognized. We're going give some assistance from our portfolio evolution and more communication about our unbooked resource potential in the coming year. Over time, the market tends to recognize fundamental performance, and in the long term, Apache's share price has historically outperformed most of our peers, which is consistent with our leading growth and return delivery.</p>
          <p>I might point out that over the last 24 months, we have increased our North American proved reserves by almost 50%, which includes our latest acquisition in the Anadarko Basin. Further, our 18 million acres in the heart of the Permian, the Anadarko Basin, Canada's resource plays, and the Gulf of Mexico hold a premier position of unbooked upside in most new plays across those areas. And it's time we gained recognition for our North American asset base, and we intend to communicate more on our resource upside during this year.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Egypt and the Gulf of Mexico shelf have caused concern over time based on a perceived overexposure for the company. Clearly the events in Egypt have had an impact on our share price over the last year. However, in light of our enlarged portfolio, which includes our announced expansion in the Anadarko/Wash fairway, neither of these regions now represent more than 10% of our proved reserves. Having said that, we remain bullish on both of them. We expect to continue and invest both in Egypt and Gulf of Mexico shelf for many years to come. But the fact is that our enhanced portfolio balance, Apache continues to deliver strong growth without depending on any one region.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn it over to our COO, Rod Eichler.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Steve. I'll focus my remarks on our 2012 plans based on the initial allocation of capital and what this means in terms of production for each of our regions.</p>
          <p>The biggest drivers for our growth and exploration in the year ahead include the following: The Permian and Anadarko basins, where we are going to step up our activity by close to $1 billion. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where we are broadening our participation in high-impact prospects, such as appraisal drilling at Heidelberg, and moving into development of megaprojects such as at Lucius, where our first test well last year flowed at 15,000 barrels of oil per day, a rate that was constrained by surface test equipment. In Australia, we've entered full development of Wheatstone LNG, Apache's first LNG project. And our global exploration &#x2013; or our efforts over recent years are now translating to big steps forward across a number of new portfolio positions.</p>
          <p>During the year ahead, we expect to run between 90 and 95 operated rigs worldwide on a daily basis. This is up from the 80 rigs we averaged during 2011. We are planning up to a 30% increase in new wells drilled, which represents approximately 300 additional wells, compared with 1,100 wells drilled last year. More than half of all planned wells will be drilled in the Permian and Anadarko basins, as we exploit their liquid-rich stacked pay opportunities. Across our portfolio, a shift is under way at Apache to direct our drilling to more profitable oil and NGL opportunities. This will be most evident in North America. Our supplemental disclosure document posted on our website outlines Apache's 2012 capital by region. It can be found on Page 10.</p>
          <p>I'll move on now to discussing our recent highlights. We continue to ramp up activity in the Permian, where we have been active since 1991 and are now the second-largest player in the basin. The increase in acceleration of activity in this region has been steep.</p>
          <p>Until 2009, the area was managed from our Tulsa office. We opened our Midland office in 2010 with a half-dozen employees operating five rigs and executing a $500 million capital program. Last year, we spent about $1.1 billion and increased our rig count to 25. Today we have more than 200 employees in our regional office with 480 field staff. We operate 30 drilling rigs and nearly twice that many pulling units and plan to spend $1.7 billion in the region during 2012 as we continue the steady ramp-up of our drilling program. We plan to drill more than 600 wells in the Permian this year and expect mid-single digit production growth in 2012, as the true contribution of this investment will be realized in 2013. We expect to increase our pace of activity overall in the Permian throughout the year.</p>
          <p>The Wolfcamp play in the Deadwood area will continue to represent about half of our Permian activity in 2012. In the past year, we've cut drilling time in half, further enhancing the already-attractive economics of this play.</p>
          <p>During 2012, we're going to be active in just about every play and area of the Permian Basin. And I'd like to talk briefly about a couple of our catalysts in the region. In November, I mentioned the first two horizontal wells Apache drilled in the lower Cline. We have now drilled four lower Cline horizontal wells at various locations across our 100,000-acre Deadwood leasehold. These wells are contributing &#x2013; three wells are producing in the 6,500-foot lateral, and the fourth is being prepared for fracture stimulation. Results from the last two wells indicate additional production rates of 300 barrels of oil per day and 200 Mcf of gas per day with expected EURs of 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. Based on this early success, there are potentially an additional 565 resource locations on our current leases. We anticipate drilling up to four lower Cline horizontals in 2012 and testing two additional shales in the Atoka/Barnett and the Wolfcamp formations on this acreage.</p>
          <p>In the Southern Midland Basin, we lease 20,000 acres of the Wolfcamp Shale play in Irion County. This brings our total to 25,000 acres. Now, this is in addition to 31,000 acres of former BP leasehold we have in the same area. And during 2012, we plan to drill up to six horizontal wells on these properties. We currently think there's potential for up to 150 locations for horizontal wells in this area.</p>
          <p>Apache is building 30,000-acre positions in the Bone Spring and Wolfbone plays in the Delaware Basin. We currently estimate up to 140 horizontal locations and 160 vertical locations on our position. In 2012, we plan to drill two to three wells in both the Bone Spring and the Wolfbone plays in Loving and Pecos Counties Texas. We're still determining the size, but each of these opportunities has a potential resource and drilling backlog for extensive, long-life development. As we drill more wells and collect more data this year, we'll be able to disclose more about our Permian plays. We plan to conduct a detailed review of our Permian resource potential at our Analyst Day in midyear.</p>
          <p>I'll move on now to the Central region of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. We will more than double our position in the Anadarko/Wash play fairway to more than 1 million acres or 487,000 net acres in the Cordillera acquisition announced last month. Together, Apache and Cordillera are currently running 17 rigs in the region, and we'll assume operatorship of Cordillera's rigs when the deal closes, which is expected in the second quarter. By closing, we expect to have up to 25 rigs operating on the combined properties. We plan to drill up to 160 wells in the Cordillera acreage alone, principally the liquids-rich Granite Wash and the Tonkawa and Cleveland oil plays. As a result, in 2012, we expect to increase our annual production for this region by nearly 50% on our continued operations. This excludes East Texas, which has been divested and represented about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2011.</p>
          <p>As announced in a news release this morning, we also added 96,000 acres to our position in the Bivins Ranch area. Our initial exploratory results in the emerging Whittenburg Basin play have been very encouraging, with 30-day production rates ranging from 107 barrels of oil and 42 Mcf of natural gas per day, to more than 1,000 barrels of oil and 800 Mcf of gas per day. We completed a 240-square-mile 3D shoot on the property during 2011, which we're using to further de-risk and define future drilling locations. Our breadth and scale across these plays allows us to generate efficiencies that increase the value of our position.</p>
          <p>In the Granite Wash alone, we've been able to reduce costs $500,000 per well by optimizing our spacing design, reducing pump volumes, and changing <mark type="ph" /> profit title. (16:01) Across the region, we've implemented a fracture database that's allowed us to reduce frac size and reduce costs by more than 25%. We will continue to pursue these kinds of improvements as we assimilate the Cordillera assets into Apache.</p>
          <p>The Gulf of Mexico shelf continued to fuel our investment firepower with strong free cash flow generation and attractive returns. We manage the shelf as a financial investment, perhaps the best one we've ever made, and not as a growth region. Production there is expected to decline in the high single digit range during 2012, as we have channeled most of the cash flow to growth areas in our portfolio. However, we will increase our activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 2012.</p>
          <p>On the development front, we have proved the Lucius development project in December, and its first oil date is scheduled in 2014. Heidelberg, another potential 200 million barrel of oil development, is currently drilling an appraisal well in Green Canyon Block 903. In the year ahead, we expect to commence production from the Bushwood, Mandy, and Wide Berth subsea tie-back developments, increasing our production from this region by close to 15%.</p>
          <p>We also have a mix of prospect types that we'll test this year, including sub-salt and salt overhang targets where new seismic techniques, particularly wide-azimuth data acquisition and processing, are improving our ability to image in areas that have historically been difficult to map and interpret. We plan to drill and participate in up to nine wells in 2012, including appraisals at Lucius and Heidelberg. This also includes six exploration prospects with more than 600 million barrels of potential resource, and where Apache's working interest averages 35%.</p>
          <p>In our Gulf Coast onshore region, we grew our acreage position significantly last year. Rates of return in this traditional hydrocarbon-rich area are robust, and our willingness to seek opportunities away from the herd puts us in a position of having double-digit production growth in this region in 2012. We expect to run three rigs and drill more than 40 wells, nearly all of them targeting oil reservoirs.</p>
          <p>Turning to Canada, Apache holds approximately 7.5 million gross acres in Western Canada. And while the region is generally thought of as a gas province, we have a substantial multiyear inventory of oil and liquids-rich opportunities, as well as dry gas. Three-quarters of Apache's 170 wells planned for Canada in 2012 are currently in oil or liquids-rich reservoirs. We plan to average a five-rig program for the year, growing production by more than 5%. 80% of our activity will be focused on four plays: the <mark type="ph" /> Glacier (18:33), Viking, and EOR oil plays and the Bluesky liquids-rich gas play. We progressed the <mark type="ph" /> Glacier (18:40) oil play to the development stage during the fourth quarter, with three horizontal wells that tested at an initial rate of approximately 80 barrels of oil per day. We currently hold approximately 162,000 net acres in this shallow drilling play. This success sets up a 37-well program for this year, with EURs ranging from 80,000 to 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. We continue to expand the fairways of these plays in our portfolio as we also test additional oil and liquid plays.</p>
          <p>Our transition into Canada is well under way, but the step change will come with the Kitimat LNG project. LNG gas sale negotiations continue to move forward, as do all development preparation elements of the project. We will announce further developments at the appropriate time as we progress toward final investment decision. Apache's first-mover steps to secure a development-ready, integrated LNG project at a very low cost continues to look better and better for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we're going to double our investment in 2012 as we move into the heart of the construction phase for a number of major projects that will provide Apache with growth for many years. The largest component of our investment is the Wheatstone LNG project, which will provide us with a multi-decade visible free cash flow profile that is oil-rich, provides a steady plateau production profile year after year, and in fact has growth potential via expansion phases.</p>
          <p>Because of long lead times out of our developments and the timing when off-takers' projects come on line, the production profile in Australia can be lumpy. We expect this region's production to decline in the high single digits in 2012, which is absorbed by the rest of our portfolio, and this exploration-region continues to develop projects that drive Apache's future growth trajectory. Australia exploration will be active in 2012 on multiple fronts. Most important will be our de-risking of resources to potentially support additional LNG trains and premium-priced domestic gas projects. This includes appraisal in the Zola area, a 2011 gas discovery on trend with the multi-Tcf Gorgon field, and the BHP-operated Tallaganda exploration prospect.</p>
          <p>In our Egypt region, 2011 was a year of production growth, with net oil production up 5%. One of the more active and successful drilling areas in Egypt last year were the development leases acquired from BP. Since November of 2010, we've drilled 31 wells in our exploration program as a result of the three new field discoveries and two <mark type="ph" /> new field (21:07) extensions. Oil production here has increased 60% to 34,000 barrels of oil per day, and gas production is 140% higher at nearly 90 million cubic feet of gas per day. One exploration well of note is the Spyglass 1X on the AG development lease that tested <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:24) of 21 million cubic feet of gas per day and more than 400 barrels of oil per day for the lower <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:30) formation.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we plan to maintain our 2011 level of investment in growth in Egypt, running 25 rigs and drilling more than 250 wells. Up to 70 of these wells will be exploration tests. We are advancing important new exploration plays across our 11 million gross acres in Egypt. These new plays include <mark type="ph" /> strant rapid traps, the deeper horizons (21:54) in the Paleozoic, and unconventional resources. Like the Permian and Anadarko basins, the Western Desert provides multiple stacked pay opportunities. Each one of these plays has the potential to give our asset base entirely new decades of life cycle beyond the current successes.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, we closed the ExxonMobil transaction at the end of the fourth quarter, which gives us a greatly expanded asset base and talent pool going into 2012. We expect to run six rigs during 2012 and drill 33 wells. The Forties field, previously our sole asset in the region, represents half of our drilling capital in 2012, as we increase our opportunity set with new wells at <mark type="ph" /> Barrow, Fawcus, (22:34) and an active exploration program. These important steps should propel our North Sea production to a 60% increase or more in 2012. The foundation for continued growth in 2013 will also be strengthened during this year as we install our additional platform in Forties and acquire the first field-wide 3D seismic survey over <mark type="ph" /> Barrow (22:54) in 15 years.</p>
          <p>Finally in Argentina, we maintain our financial discipline by living within our cash flow, as we advance the appraisal of what is believed to be one of the largest shale resource bases of any country outside the United States, and Apache is the leading North American company in the shale fairway. Most importantly in Argentina in 2012, we plan to conduct the first oil test in our shale play position on our acreage that is adjacent to the recent wells drilled by YPF at <mark type="ph" /> La Molata. (23:22) Development drilling at areas <mark type="ph" /> high in the (23:25) premium priced gas-plus contracts is expected to drive Argentina production growth about 5% in 2012.</p>
          <p>That concludes the operational highlights. And I now turn it over to Tom Chambers</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to reiterate what Steve mentioned earlier, in that we had record results for the year across the board. Underpinning our 2011 financial results was record production, which averaged 748,000 barrels of oil per day, up 14% from the prior year. More importantly, we achieved record oil production of 340,000 barrels per day, allowing us to benefit from higher oil price realizations. For the year, we reported record earnings of $4.5 billion or $11.47 per diluted share, our first time to break the $10 threshold. When we remove items for comparability purposes, adjusted earnings were $11.83 per share, up 32% from the prior-year period. Record production and oil prices drove cash from operations before working capital items up 39% to $10.2 billion, our best year ever.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell it was a phenomenal year in all respects. Record cash flow enabled us to fund our largest E&amp;D capital budget, acquire assets for another $2 billion in cash, which provide a future platform for continued long-term profitable growth, while we also paid down $925 million in debt. So we were able to end the year and reduce our debt-to-cap 20%.</p>
          <p>I want to highlight the importance of our portfolio's ability to consistently generate cash flow. For 2011, our $10 billion of operating cash flow enabled us to achieve many targeted goals and set the stage for continued growth into 2012. Without the constraint of having to pay down debt in 2012, the 2012 capital budget spending rises as Steve indicated. However, I would emphasize that our disciplined approach reviews capital on a quarterly basis to ensure we do not outspend our cash flow. Or, if prices rise significantly, to potentially allocate any excess to the best projects available.</p>
          <p>These results speak volumes for our balanced portfolio strategy, given the significant volatility seen in commodities. We've been able to benefit substantially from our oil portfolio and the fact that oil currently sells for over 40 times the price of North American gas. Our oil balance also offers us a unique benefit when it comes to price. Dated Brent and sweet crude from the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf Coast onshore areas continue to be priced at a significant premium to WTI-based prices. Approximately 75% of our total production receives Brent index or Brent-comparable index pricing, realizing premiums of $10 to $15 a barrel to WTI.</p>
          <p>While North American gas prices remain depressed, our international portfolio is providing access to rising gas prices, particularly in Argentina and Australia, as you heard Rod just mention. Compared to the prior year, our international gas price realizations were up 27%. Higher realizations and a steady commitment to holding the line on costs allowed us to report solid cash margins of $45.60 per BOE, up 30% over 2010 levels. Pre-tax margins, which includes DD&amp;A, increased 37% to $29.64 per barrel of oil equivalent. These closely watched measures, combined with our focus on returns, drove our return on average capital employed to over 13% for 2011.</p>
          <p>We are very focused on margins and continue to monitor cost trends. Total cash costs during the year averaged $16.24 per BOE, up $0.86 over last year. As with each year, our goal was to keep 2011 cash costs flat with the previous year. We ended up slightly at 6% higher, influenced by the impact of rising oil prices on costs and continued market pressures in nearly all of our regions. Absent taxes other than income, which are basically production taxes linked to prices, we are focused on keeping 2012 cash costs in the range of $13 to $13.50 per BOE for the full-year average. Our recurring DD&amp;A was also up in 2011 from prior-year levels, as you might expect with our recent acquisition activity.</p>
          <p>Through our drilling program, we more than replaced current production by adding 342 million barrels of oil equivalent to proved reserve during 2011. That's about 125% of what we produced during the year. Including acquisitions, sales, and revisions, we replaced 113% of production. We believe our exceptional cash flow provides a critical foundation as we head into 2012. With the confidence of continued strong future growth prospects and financial position, our board of directors at their last meeting increased the regularly &#x2013; quarterly cash dividend 13% to $0.17 per share, as Steve already indicated. The board also indicated that they will continue to review the dividend level annually as we progress further.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, we had a record year, one that provided our best financial results in the company's history, one that has ended with a considerable amount of momentum, and one that sets the stage for continued growth and opportunity into 2012.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. And good afternoon, everyone. 2011 was indeed another year of growth and change for Apache. And I wanted to just take a moment to reflect on how the company has evolved over the last few years.</p>
          <p>In a deteriorating price environment for North American natural gas, in the last two years, Apache turned $7.5 billion in cash flow to $17.5 billion. Through drilling and acquisitions, we've invested $25 million, expanding our production and rebalancing our portfolio in areas with considerable future growth prospects.</p>
          <p>To manage this change and maintain focus on executing and delivering consistent profitable growth, we've added hundreds of professionals, and importantly, three new growth regions: deepwater, Gulf Coast onshore, and the Permian Basin. In addition, recent changes in our Central region, including the Cordillera transaction, will transform this legacy Apache region into one of our most active drilling regions, focused on growing oil and liquids production. The changes have had the effect of beefing up our portfolio in North America. And today, onshore North America represents 38% of our worldwide production, compared to 28% just two years ago. On a pro forma basis, including Cordillera, no single region accounts for more than a fifth of our total production.</p>
          <p>Although our geographic mix has shifted, our production mix has not. Half our production remains liquids, of which 90% is oil. Another aspect of Apache's portfolio evolution is the inclusion of a growing number of long-lead-time, impactful development and infrastructure projects. More than half of our 2012 capital goes to projects that contribute no production this year, but will contribute meaningful volumes in 2013 and beyond. In fact, following additional investment, we expect these projects will add hundreds of thousands of equivalent barrels to our daily production, spread out over the next five years. Fortunately, we have the portfolio diversify and financial strength to make these significant long-term investments while still delivering near-term profitable growth.</p>
          <p>We've also evolved our approach to global exploration. We've established meaningful positions through joint venture agreements and acreage acquisitions in frontier areas mentioned earlier: Cook Inlet in Alaska, New Zealand, and offshore Kenya. Each of these positions target oil and, we believe, hold hundreds of millions of barrels of resource potential. While unproven at present, we believe it's just a matter of time before our exploration strategy gains legs and begins to pay off.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, we aren't too concerned whether our production comes through acquisition or the drill bit, but we do recognize the potential value of internally generated prospect development and active exploration.</p>
          <p>Apache's changes come amid a rapidly changing industry and world. The lowest North American natural gas prices in a decade are squeezing industry cash flows and capital investments. After visiting double-digit natural gas prices, the industry is finally reaching a point of capitulation where companies are beginning to pull in their horns due to lack of funding. This process has a cleansing effect. With industry laying down gas rigs, the upward pressure on cost for drilling, completions, and other services is beginning to subside. Lower cash flow and capital in the hands of the competition will also lead to more attractive opportunities to drill and acquire. That frankly makes for an ideal environment for well-heeled companies with strong cash flows, such as Apache, to excel.</p>
          <p>In closing, following a year of record financial results, driven by our 31st year of production growth out of the last 33, Apache has all the ingredients to deliver standout results again in 2012. Patrick?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon.</p>

          <p>Afternoon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. First, on the Cline shale, how does the Cline compete with other horizontal and vertical opportunities that you're pursuing in the Permian Basin, and can you talk to what your well cost expectations are there relative to the EURs that you mentioned earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, honestly, Brian, I think it's little early to tell how they compete. With our portfolio, we are going to test most of the plays, and the horizontal plays, out there. Whether it be the Wolfcamp Shale or the Cline. And, frankly, we're looking for the highest rate of returns. I think Rod mentioned 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with a cost of, what, Rod?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Including well costs, around $6.5 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, completed well costs $6.5 million. So it'll compete with most shale plays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question is from Pearce Hammond of Simmons &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good afternoon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've outlined your production growth for this year at 7% to 13% and you made some smart acquisitions in the course of the last year, the North Sea acquisition and here recently Cordillera. If we tried to look at just the organic production growth rate without the acquisitions, what do you think it might shake out to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, honestly we don't break that out. I will tell you probably in the high single digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from John Herrlin of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Two quick ones. In terms of your CapEx budget, how much was actually exploration and how much was development? Could you depict those <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:47)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; whether it's in the regions or our new ventures group, it's about $1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine. Next one from me is on Egypt, Steve. Your reserves went down a little bit year over year. Were there performance issues, because you had negative revisions? Normally you have positive revisions there. And that's it for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, what we had is, is we had a negative revision but it all has to do with price, John. You're aware of that concession agreement. And what happens is you get more barrels for cost recovery, but you also have an adjustment on the reserve side. So it's &#x2013; that's counterintuitive. I mean, when you have more production, you have less reserves. And if you have less production, you have more reserves. I mean, it really is the way that the concession agreement works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So because we get to recover our costs, the higher the price per barrel, the lower the reserves you get to report. But the actual reserve performance has been just fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. One of your competitors has talked about a JV or a sale of kind of a million-acre scale asset in the Permian Basin. What's your appetite for that sort of scale transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't really comment on that, number one. And the other one is, is that I think we have a pretty good acreage position as it is. So we're not &#x2013; actually, we're never looking. But opportunities come in a lot in a lot of different ways.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Leo Mariani from RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Just kind of few quick questions here for you. I guess first off, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on your progress there, on Kitimat? Are you guys kind of in advanced negotiations with potential buyers? And a quick question here on the Permian. Obviously you're stepping up the capital pretty dramatically here. And in 2012, and if I've heard you guys right, you talked about mid-single digit production growth in the Permian in 2012. That just seemed like a low number to me. Is there some infrastructure issues there, or maybe I misheard you guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd answer the first one on Kitimat. Frankly, we're somewhat past the polite introductions and that kind of stuff with respect to buyers. We are now in throes of actual negotiations. And in terms of the Permian Basin, you understand we're the second or third largest producer out there. So you get 93,000, 94,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day starting off with. So it's a &#x2013; high or single-digit growth is a pretty good number. Especially with the kind of capital that we're putting in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's also a lot of timing involved. We have a lot of wells that are being drilled throughout the year. All those wells probably won't make it on production until early parts of 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from John Malone of Global Hunter Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Just in Argentina, can you guys give us any color on the La Calera well? Is the indication so far that they're actually seeing liquids in that? And really just overall, can you give us some thoughts on trends, what you're seeing in Argentina in terms of export repatriation, the politics down there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The exploration test we drilled at La Calera in 2011 was specifically targeting the shales in the gas window. So it was designed to be a gas test, and that's what we have been evaluating. The subsequent wells we'll be drilling in 2012, as I mentioned, will be oil tests that are in the shale oil window as we presently map them adjacent to the recent discoveries announced by their operators.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to your question about the politics down there, I think it's well to take a look at the circumstances that YPF, Repsol, and the government of Argentina are in. I don't think there's any question that the Argentine government would like more money spent by YPF or Repsol in country. I think &#x2013; personally, I think what you're seeing is a lot of discussions that really revolves around a specific issue. So we're not &#x2013; truthfully, not concerned about the wholesale expropriation of oil industry down there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, Apache has been held up by the government in their recent press releases as one of several companies who <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:45) increasing the production and meeting or exceeding their production targets outlined in their concession agreements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question is from Mario Barraza of Tuohy Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. It's actually Craig Shere. Mario had to jump off. But we had quick question as a follow-up on Argentina also. Can you remind us how large the acreage positions are in the <mark type="ph" /> gassy (41:18) and in the oil shale windows, and if you're still looking to expand acreage in either of those? And remind us the details regarding the 2012 drilling effort in the oil shale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the first part of your question, we have about 1.7 million gross acres, about 900,000 net acres in the shale fairway. We do not break that out &#x2013; or I do not have a breakout of that by oil province or gas province, in that fashion. But it's the central part of the Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin.</p>
          <p>And the second part of your question was &#x2013; what was &#x2013; ?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Capital in 2011?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2012. All right. 2012. We're looking at about $250 million as a primary capital allocation for our Argentina projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and our &#x2013; just so you know, that's not an opportunity number. That is more of a prudency with respect to staying within our cash flows down there. And we're really testing ideas. If you look at any of our areas, when we talk &#x2013; Brian asked a question about the Permian Basin. We have built meaningful acreage positions in some of the best hydrocarbon basins in the world. And what we are trying to do is build long-term value for our shareholders. So we're &#x2013; in the Permian, we're going to test a number of different shales and a number of different ways, horizontal. And the same we're doing in the Neuqu&#xE9;n. And we are a legacy owner in the Anadarko Basin. So it's not surprising that new technology catches up with a lot of hydrocarbons.</p>
