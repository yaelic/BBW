          <p>Good morning. Before Ken Lewis and Joe Price begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. And these factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry, and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents. And with that, let me turn it over to Ken.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kevin. Well, good morning, and thanks for joining our earnings review. Before we get started, I want to say a couple of things to the investment community. This is the first time I've addressed you since my announcement to retire, and I just wanted to say thank you for the support you've shown me during my time with you as well as the support you've shown the company. It's been a pleasure to lead Bank of America and to interact with all of you. As I've said before, we have a vast amount of talent in the company and we have market-leading positions in geographies, businesses and distribution capabilities that are the envy of the industry. I have no doubt that Bank of America will thrive in my absence, will not slow the momentum that is starting once again to move this company forward.</p>
          <p>Okay. While it's never easy to talk about earnings when you're reporting a loss, there's several things this quarter that indicate that there are better days ahead. Frankly, earnings this quarter were fairly consistent with the expectations we discussed three months ago.</p>
          <p>We indicated in July the profitability would be tougher in the second half of the year versus the first half due to the absence of several unusual positive items that helped first half earnings as well as due to the normal seasonal drop in revenue that occurs in the second half. We did experience a seasonal impact, and although revenue overall dropped in the third quarter, results were better in some businesses than the normal seasonal pattern. Overall, the pace of deterioration in credit quality slowed and was somewhat better than expected in several portfolios.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, earnings reflected the impact of the charge for terminating the government asset guarantee term sheet associated with the Merrill acquisition, as well as the negative accounting impact associated with the improvement in our credit spreads. But as I said last quarter.  I'd rather see the operating improvements and take the accounting loss that come with our company's improving spreads.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter of 2009, Bank of America had a net loss of $1 billion before preferred dividends, or a loss of $0.26 per diluted share after deducting preferred dividends of $1.24 billion, including almost $900 million related to the government TARP.</p>
          <p>The termination of the government asset guarantee term sheet resulted in an expense of approximately $400 million in the quarter, the mark on the Merrill structured notes was a negative 1.8 billion, and the mark on company's owned derivative liabilities was 700 million.</p>
          <p>Total revenue on an FTE basis was in excess of $26 billion while pre-tax pre-provision income was approximately $10 billion including the impact of the three billion of negative items just mentioned.</p>
          <p>There were several positive trends in the quarter. The balance sheet continues to be managed prudently, resulting in lower risk weighted assets, increased liquidity, and improved capital ratios.  As we experienced in the second quarter, Merrill Lynch continued to provide a significant contribution to operating revenue. The capital markets environment was better than expected and resulted in a 37% increase in sales and trading revenue, and solid investment banking revenue, although down seasonally from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Results in Global Wealth and Investment Management reflected higher asset management fees and brokerage income, driven by increased client activity and stabilization among our financial advisors. New deposit generation maintained its positive momentum with overall corporate-wide average deposits up more than $14 billion.</p>
          <p>We continue to meet or exceed many of the milestones around both the Merrill and Countrywide integrations.</p>
          <p>Finally and not the least, we believe we may have peaked in total credit losses this quarter, although the levels going forward will continue to be elevated and certain businesses will still experience higher losses.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the earnings impact of these positives this quarter were more than offset by a continued high level provision expense, lower customer activity due to the economic environment and the items, the other items that I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Total credit extended in the third quarter was $184 billion, including commercial renewals, versus 212 billion in the second quarter. The larger components were 96 billion in first mortgages, 66 billion in non-real estate commercial, and eight billion in commercial real estate. The remaining $14 billion includes other consumer retail loans and small business loans.</p>
          <p>Despite these new extensions, loan growth overall declined due to lower consumer spending and a resurgence in the capital markets, allowing corporate clients to issue bonds and equity, replacing loans as a source of funding. Additionally, companies continue to be very cautious and we are not seeing the level of seasonal inventory builds or capital expenditure spending at any meaningful level.</p>
          <p>Provision expense in the third quarter decreased from the second quarter by 1.7 billion, but included a $2.1 billion addition to the reserves, and that's versus the 4.7 billion in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And before turning it over to Joe, let me make a couple of comments about the current environment. Merrill Lynch continued to be accretive to earnings year-to-date as these market sensitive businesses offer diversification to offset the core credit headwinds we're facing. Although expected to peak this year, net loss levels will continue to remain high going into 2010.  Additions to the reserve will most likely continue at least through the fourth quarter, but as you saw this quarter, the level of reserve addition is down substantially.</p>
          <p>We continue to position the balance sheet to ride out the recession, which you can see in our de-levering actions earlier this year, shrinking certain asset positions and substantially adding to reserve levels. Our outlook for the economy is close to the consensus view, with unemployment peaking around the 10% level. We believe the pace of new bankruptcy filings for individuals has slowed somewhat, but still see some additional pressure on home prices. Based on this economic scenario, results in the fourth quarter are expected to continue to be challenging as we close the year.</p>
          <p>While we still have several quarters before we can discuss actual normalized earnings, we believe that the economy is stabilizing and customer sentiment is improving. At this point, let me turn it over to Joe for additional color and commentary.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ken. I plan over the next few minutes to cover the performance of each of our businesses, credit quality, and some other topics. But before getting into business results, let me highlight the large items that impacted earnings in the third quarter. You can see these on slide five. As most of you are aware by now, structured notes issued by Merrill Lynch, which are marked to market under the fair value option, resulted in a hit to earnings of 1.8 billion on a pre-tax basis due to narrowing credit spreads. If you remember, the mark was a negative 3.6 billion in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, as a reminder, the impact of marking on cash liabilities does not impact tier one capital.  Credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities, and these are principally in our trading businesses, were re-valued, resulting in a negative impact of 714 million versus a negative impact of 1.6 billion in the second quarter. Again, a good thing, but still negative to earnings.</p>
          <p>Market disruption valuation adjustments this quarter in our global markets business were actually a net positive of 200 million.</p>
          <p>On the CMBS and related exposure side in global markets, we took a charge of approximately 600 million related to exposures in the hotel industry and equity investments. On our remaining CDO related exposure, we recorded a loss of 138 million. These negative charges were offset by positive marks in legacy assets, primarily on the recovery of value on exposures wrapped by monolines.  This enabled us to recover a portion of the valuation allowances against the reduced receivables from monolines.</p>
          <p>Now, the third quarter tax rate or tax benefit of the loss, was higher than statutory due to a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings globally. In the fourth quarter, we expect the effective tax rate to trend towards statutory absent any unusual items.</p>
          <p>Now, let me quickly touch upon some highlights in each of the businesses this quarter. In our deposit segment on slide seven, earnings were 798 million in the quarter, up from 509 million in the second quarter. Net interest income of 1.7 billion was flat with the second quarter, while non-interest income of 1.9 billion increased 10%.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense of 2.3 billion declined 11% due to the absence of the FDIC special assessment charge that was incurred in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, on slide eight, you can see average retail deposit levels for the quarter, excluding Countrywide, were up almost eight billion or 1.2% from the second quarter, which we believe is above industry growth. We continue to see product mix shift from CDs to higher margin checking accounts.</p>
          <p>Now, Merrill Lynch continues to show momentum here, as financial advisors provide to customers the benefits of an expanded product suite. Checking balances now represent over 40% of our retail deposit base.</p>
          <p>Now, in late September, we announced changes to our overdraft fee policies. These changes were intended to help customers avoid excessive overdrafts by better managing their finances. As a result of these charges, future fee revenue streams will be negatively impacted beginning in the fourth quarter. Now, we're assessing proactive strategies to further strengthen customer trust, or consumer trust, and more evenly balance our fee structure across our entire customer base.</p>
          <p>Additionally, as most of you are aware, the Federal Reserve is expected to issue a final ruling in the fourth quarter addressing Reg E. The proposed ruling may further impact our fee revenue on a go-forward basis. We'll be more explicit about the impact once the final ruling is known. But as things currently stand given the changes we've made, absent any mitigating action, I'd expect revenue to be negatively impacted between 150 million and 200 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The Global Card Services is on slide nine. Although a loss of a billion dollars was recorded, this was an improvement over the second quarter results by almost 600 million due mainly to lower managed provision expense. Both managed revenue and expense levels were flat with the second quarter. The provision dropped 766 million due to reserve reductions of approximately 560 million this quarter, which occurred in consumer credit card, consumer lending, and small business as delinquencies improved. Now, I'll come back to this in a minute, as we actually reduced reserves 1.2 billion, but we had to put up reserves of about 600 million associated with maturing credit card securitizations. Average managed consumer credit card outstandings were down 2.4% from the second quarter to 168 billion.</p>
          <p>Now in the third quarter, retail purchase volume, which would be both debit and credit volume, was flat with the second quarter, although down 7% from a year ago. We continue to add new accounts, 700,000 new domestic retail and small business credit card accounts in the quarter, with credit lines of approximately 4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, home loans and insurance, and you can see this on slide 10, experienced an increase in mortgage rates for most of the quarter, although we've seen a drop in the 30-year fixed rate closer to 5% at the end of the quarter. As a result, total revenue for the quarter was 3.4 billion, down a billion from second quarter levels due to lower production and lower MSR hedge results.</p>
          <p>Production revenue decreased 565 million due to the lower volumes and margins. Servicing income decreased 672 million primarily due to lower MSR performance, net of hedge results, reported in the line of business as forecasted HPI or the Home Price Index improvements, hurt our MSR valuation. HPI improvements increase the chance of repayment and refinance by increasing projected prepay speeds.</p>
          <p>Now, capitalization rate for the consumer mortgage MSR asset ended the quarter at 102 basis points, down seven basis points from the second quarter. Provision increased 171 million to 2.9 billion, and reflected an addition to the reserves of 900 million, most of which was associated with the home equity purchased impaired or the SOP 03-3 portfolio. Total first mortgage funding in the quarter were 96 billion, down 14% from second quarter, or 111 billion. Approximately 39% of the fundings were for home purchases versus approximately 30% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And we continued to maintain strong market share during the quarter, estimated to be in excess of 20%.</p>
          <p>Now although we've seen or we have seen volatility in the rate environment, it started to cause the refi volume to trail off for most of the third quarter, we have observed volumes picking up with the recent decline in rates.</p>
          <p>Global Wealth and Investment Management, you can see this on slide 11, earned 271 million in the third quarter, down from second quarter levels, due mainly to higher provision expense. Growth in asset management fees and brokerage income was more than offset by additional Columbia cash support to purchase all remaining SIV, or structured investment vehicle, exposure and other troubled assets, principally from certain cash funds.  Provision was up 277 million due to charge-off of a single commercial client and higher additions to the reserve.</p>
          <p>Assets under management ended the quarter at 740 billion, up 35 billion from the end of June, as the improvement in market valuations more than offset outflows from the money market funds. We ended the quarter with approximately 15,000 financial advisors, flat with the end of June and an indication of ongoing stabilization in that group. Also, as you already know, we finalized details on the sale of the long-term asset management business of Columbia to Ameriprise that's expected to close in the second quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>Using the low end of the range we disclosed, think of this as having minimal P&amp;L impact, but monetizing nearly 800 million of goodwill and intangibles, thereby improving capital slightly.</p>
          <p>Now, Global Banking, you can see this on slide 12, and remember, it encompasses our Commercial Bank, Corporate Bank, and the Investment Bank, essentially broke even in the quarter with 40 million in net income, down from the second quarter due to the absence of the gain from the sale of our merchant processing business to a joint venture. Loan spreads continued to widen as facilities were repriced at higher market rates.</p>
          <p>Although commercial and corporate clients are being cautious given the economy, and balances are down, we continue to see improved credit spreads, as market prices reflect underlying risks.  Provision expense decreased 9% to 2.3 billion, but still included a sizeable reserve addition during the quarter of 592 million, mainly associated with commercial real estate.</p>
          <p>Average loans as reported for the quarter were down 4% from the second quarter as clients continued to aggressively manage working capital and operate at capacity levels. Significant bond issuance for loan repayments also impacted balances. However, average deposit levels increased 10 billion or 5% from the second quarter levels.</p>
          <p>Investment Banking fees, and this is across the corporation, were down 392 million, and this is detailed on slide 13, to 1.3 billion, versus the second quarter, but still represented a strong quarter in our mind given the seasonal trends.</p>
          <p>The combined Bank of America &#x2013; Merrill Lynch franchise ranked number one in high yield debt, leveraged loans, and MBS; number two in ABS and syndicated loans; and ranked number three in global, <mark type="audio gap" /> number two in U.S. Investment Banking fees for the first nine months of 2009.</p>
          <p>Global markets on slide 14 earned 2.2 billion in the third quarter, up 800 million or 58% versus the second quarter. Strong sales and trading results, which you can see on slide 15, combined with lower market disruption charges, drove the increase. Risk weighted assets declined 5%, reflecting a more efficient use of the balance sheet and market value changes.</p>
          <p>Now, as you can see on slide 15, Sales and Trading revenue in the third quarter were 5.3 billion versus 3.9 billion in the second quarter. Lower credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities, which were an actual negative mark in the quarter of approximately 700 million and lower market disruption charges where we had an actual positive mark of approximately 200 million in the quarter, helped this quarter. But even so, results were better than we expected given the normal seasonal slowdown.</p>
          <p>Structured products, rates, and currencies and equity trading all improved versus the second quarter. Non-industry expense was down from the prior quarter due to merger related cost saves and a change in compensation that delivers a greater portion of the incentive pay over time.</p>
          <p>We detail on slide 16 and 17 a number of the most pertinent legacy exposures in the Capital Markets business. I won't go into detail, but as you will see, most of the exposure showed improvement or reductions versus the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And not included in the six business segments is equity investment income of 886 million in the third quarter, due mainly to improved market valuations. In addition, on a consolidated basis, we had security gains of approximately 1.6 billion, partially offset by impairment charges on non-agency RMBS of 411 million.</p>
          <p>Now, let me switch to credit quality, and this starts on slide 19. Consumers continue to experience stress from higher unemployment and underemployment levels, ongoing high bankruptcy levels, as well as depressed home prices, leading to higher losses in almost all of our consumer portfolios.  Likewise, commercial portfolios reported higher charge-offs as a result of the prolonged recession and the impacts of continued stress on the consumer and housing related sectors, and deterioration in non-home builder commercial real estate. The third quarter provision of 11.7 billion exceeded net charge-offs, reflecting the addition of 2.1 billion to the reserve, which was lower than the addition of 4.7 billion in the second quarter. We even had reserve reductions in certain portfolios.</p>
          <p>Consumer reserve additions were 1.5 billion, 1.3 billion associated with the reduction in expected principal cash flows on the Countrywide purchased impaired portfolio, 660 million for consumer real estate loans, 600 million associated with card securitizations that matured and came on the balance sheet during the quarter. Offset by reductions in the allowance for credit cards that were already on the balance sheet, and where delinquencies improved 600 million, and a reduction in the allowance for consumer lending and dealer financial services of 530 million.</p>
          <p>Commercial reserve additions were approximately 600 million, essentially all earmarked for commercial real estate. Although a decrease of 140 million in reserves for small business were offset by an increase in other, non-real estate commercial. Our allowance for loan and lease losses now stands at 35.8 billion or almost 4% of our loan and lease portfolio. Our reserve for unfunded commitments now stands at 1.6 billion, bringing the total reserve to 37.4 billion. Now, we expect some reserve increases, including reserves from maturing card securitizations for the next quarter or two, but as Ken said, at levels reduced from the current quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, even though the economy has shown some signs of stabilization that point toward recovery, the ultimate level of credit losses and reserve additions will be dependent on whether the stabilization is sustained as well as the duration of the credit cycle.</p>
          <p>Now, I should note here that my comments about future reserve additions do not take into account the impact of FAS 166 and 167 that will be implemented next year and will result in the consolidation of certain assets such as the credit card trust on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now, the held <mark type="audio gap" /> net charge-offs across all businesses in the quarter increased 923 million or 49 basis points from the second quarter levels to 4.13% of the portfolio, or 9.6 billion.</p>
          <p>On a managed basis, overall consolidated net losses in the quarter increased 1.2 billion to 12.9 billion.  Of the 1.2 billion increase, the consumer increase was almost 60%, or 720 million.</p>
          <p>Due to the reduction in balances, principally in unsecured products, the loss rates are somewhat distorted, so that's why I'm talking in dollar terms. Credit card represents 53% of total managed consumer losses. And as you can see on slide 21, managed consumer credit card net losses were 5.5 billion compared to five billion in the second quarter. Losses increased due to a jump in early stage delinquencies in late 2008 and early 2009. If you couple that with the 180-day charge-off policy, you can see why losses increased this quarter. 30-day plus delinquencies in consumer credit card decreased 868 million, the second consecutive quarterly drop, leading to the reserve actions that I mentioned earlier. Now we continue to be cautiously optimistic that delinquency trends signal a stabilization in losses. However, as I mentioned earlier, a delayed recovery in the U.S. economy beyond expectations or unforeseen events could obviously keep pressure on this performance.</p>
          <p>Credit quality in our consumer real estate business continued to deteriorate in the third quarter. But before I get into the individual consumer real estate products, let me remind you of a couple of important drivers as I did last quarter. Total consumer NPAs, which are highlighted on slide 22, increased 1.9 billion in the third quarter compared to an increase of 3.2 billion in the second quarter, now total 21 billion. This is primarily comprised of consumer real estate with the lion's share being first mortgage.</p>
          <p>Now, there are a number of things affecting this portfolio, but as a reminder, we generally place consumer real estate on non-performing at 90 days past due and take charge-offs at 180 days, at which time we write the loans down to appraised value. We perform quarterly valuation refreshes and take additional write-downs as needed.</p>
          <p>We also have troubled debt restructures, or TDRs, which we explained last quarter, that reflected as NPAs even though most were not 90 days past due when the restructuring or modification was made. While our efforts are to responsibly keep borrowers in their homes and paying, as we think that reduces the overall costs, the impact is that the NPA number is elevated.</p>
          <p>Now, formal moratoriums on foreclosures have been lifted, the MHA program and other modification efforts are now up and running. Therefore, once a loan has been evaluated under all the various programs, if no other alternatives exist, that loan will be released into foreclosure.</p>
          <p>Now, our residential mortgage portfolio, and I'm on slide 23 now, showed an increase of 162 million in losses to 1.2 billion or 205 basis points, an increase of half as much as we saw in the second quarter. Much of the increase was driven by a revision of our estimate of the impact of the REO process and what that has on net realizable value. Absent that catch-up adjustment, charge-offs were virtually flat at 1.1 billion, or 180 basis points.</p>
          <p>30 plus delinquencies rose 1.9 billion, representing the repurchase of delinquent government insured or guaranteed loans from securitizations. Excluding the repurchase, 30 day delinquencies were up slightly, about 139 million.</p>
          <p>Now, on the non-performing asset front, we saw an increase of two billion, less than the 2.8 billion in the second quarter. Non-performing TDRs increased 841 million in the quarter. Approximately 60% of the new TDRs into non-performing were performing at the time of re-classification. Of the 16.5 billion of residential mortgage NPAs, TDRs make up 18%.</p>
          <p>Now, about 57% or 9.4 billion of the NPAs are greater than 180 days past due and have been written down to appraised values, which should be considered when evaluating reserve adequacy.  I should also note we saw stability in both severity and average size of charge-offs this quarter.  Our reserve levels were increased on this portfolio during the quarter, and represent 1.87% of period end loan balances versus 1.67% in June. Now, given the weakness in the economy and the continued pressure on home prices, we may see continued deterioration in this portfolio, and therefore, may have further additions to the reserve.</p>
          <p>Now switching specifically to home equity, and I'm back on slide 24, net charge-offs increased 131 million to 1.97 billion in the third quarter.  However, we accelerated charge-offs of 223 million during the quarter related to an adjustment to our loss severities due to the protracted nature of collection on some insurance contracts. Excluding that adjustment, net charge-offs would have dropped in the quarter. 30 plus performing delinquencies are up 184 million or 15 basis points to 1.4%.</p>
          <p>Non-performing assets in home equity, principally loans greater than 90 days past due, decreased to 3.8 billion, a decrease of 146 million, which is the first decrease since the start of this credit cycle.</p>
          <p>Now, as I explained last quarter, we've been working with borrowers to modify their loans to terms that better align with their ability to pay. When we do that, under most circumstances, the loans are identified as TDRs. Non-performing TDRs on home equity increased 218 million. Almost 90% of the modified home equity loans were performing at the time of re-classification into TDRs, elevating NPA levels.</p>
          <p>Now, to give you some color, TDRs where we have improved the likelihood of repayment, make up 43% of home equity NPAs. In addition, about 17% or 656 million of the NPAs, are greater than 180 days past due, and have been written down to appraised values. Now, we increased reserves for this portfolio to 9.7 billion or 6.39% of ending balances and that would be 5.12%, excluding the purchased impaired loans, due to further deterioration in the purchased impaired portfolio and continued elevated levels of delinquency on the rest of the portfolio. While delinquency growth has slowed versus the previous quarter, delinquency levels continue to be elevated.</p>
          <p>Now, on slide 25, we provide you details on our direct and indirect loans, which includes the auto and other dealer related portfolios as well as consumer lending.</p>
          <p>Net charge-off in dealer finance decreased 3% to 194 million or 1.85% of the portfolio, as we've experienced improved collateral values. We saw the expected leveling off in consumer lending charge-offs and expect them to decrease due to the improvements in delinquent amounts.</p>
          <p>Now, slide 26 shows the details of the purchase impaired Countrywide portfolio, which shows lower charge-offs. But with actual trends of frequency and severity continuing above our expectations, we added 1.3 billion to the allowance on this portfolio. We've provided more details on the slide for you, given the charge this quarter, so I won't go through that in detail. And looking forward, I'd say this portfolio's valuation, remember the purchased impaired portfolio is a life of loan reserved portfolio, is more sensitive to HPI and our success under the modification programs. We would also expect a lion's share of the charge-offs to come through in the next few quarters. Now, similar factors were the drivers behind our valuation of non-agency CMO securities, which drove the OTTI charge that I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Now, switching to our commercial portfolios, you can see this on slide 29, net charge-offs increased in quarter to 2.6 billion or 309 basis points, up in dollar terms about 25% from the second quarter.  Net losses in our 18 billion small business portfolio, which are reported as commercial loan losses, increased 23 million or 796 million compared to an increase of 140 million in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As we've discussed before, many of the issues in small business relate to how we grew the portfolio over the past few years, which is now compounded by the current economic trend.  However, we think we're close to the peak in small business losses, as indicated by several linked quarter declines in 30 plus delinquencies, as well as 90 plus delinquencies, which are down more than 10%. Our current allowance for small business stands at 15% of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now, excluding small business, commercial net charge-offs increased 505 million from the second quarter to 1.8 billion, representing a charge-off ratio of 228 basis points. The losses in the quarter were split almost equally between non-real estate, which was about 52%, and real estate. Of the 261 million increase in non-real estate losses, 72% was driven by two fraud related losses. And within commercial real estate, net charge-offs increased 244 million to 873 million, representing a charge-off ratio of 4.67%.</p>
          <p>Now, this is the first quarter that non-home builder losses now constitute a majority, or 57%, of our commercial real estate losses. The increase in net charge-offs from the non-home builder portion of the portfolio was driven primarily by multi-family rental and multi-use property types. Commercial NPAs, and this is detailed on slide 30, rose approximately $1 billion, an increase of just about half of the second quarter to 12.9 billion, or 12.7 billion excluding small business. 44% of the increase was due to commercial real estate, driven by non-home builder exposures. Home builders actually dropped again this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, let me give you some color behind the make-up of our commercial NPAs. Commercial real estate makes up about 59% of the balance, or about 7.6 billion, with a little less than half of that being home builders. Outside of commercial real estate, the balance is concentrated in housing related and consumer dependent portfolios within commercial domestic. NPAs are most significant in commercial services and supplies, think realtors, employment agencies, office supplies, et cetera, at 6% of the total commercial NPAs, followed by individuals and trusts at 4%, and vehicle dealers and media at 2% each. No other industry comprised greater than 2%. Now, just over 90% of commercial NPAs are collateralized, and approximately 34% are contractually current. Total commercial NPAs are carried at about 75% of original value before considering loan loss reserves.</p>
          <p>The reservable criticized utilized exposure in our commercial book increased 2.9 billion in the third quarter compared to an increase of 8.5 billion in the second quarter, and is the lowest increase since the fourth quarter of 2007. However, it was still an increase and reflected of the continued deterioration in the U.S. economy with about 60% of the increase being real estate. Commercial real estate criticized increased 1.7 billion to 22.9 billion. And while home builders was 6.7 billion, still represent the largest concentration, we actually saw a reduction there of about 670 million. The largest increases were in office, multi-family rental and multi-use properties.</p>
          <p>Outside of commercial real estate, we saw further weakening in, again, housing related and consumer dependent businesses. 85% of the assets in commercial reservable criticized or secured, of which approximately 10% is our highly secured asset based lending business.</p>
          <p>Now, while we obviously will see some continued deterioration, our past rated credit discussions over the past couple of quarters have felt much better, which is translating to lower flows into criticized. And as I mentioned earlier, we added to commercial reserves in the third quarter, of which almost all was related to commercial real estate. Total commercial reserve coverage at the end of September increased to 2.76% of loans.</p>
          <p>Now, let me move from credit quality, and talk about net interest income, and here I'm on slide 32.  Compared to second quarter, on a managed and FTE basis, net interest income was down 356 million. Managed core NII dropped approximately 283 million while market based NII dropped by 73 million. The core NII decrease was mainly due to lower loan levels almost across the board, due to weaker demand and the impact of our earlier de-leveraging of the ALM portfolio, partially offset by the impact of the favorable rate environment and improved pricing. Also impacting our net interest income was the drag from asset quality, both non-performing as well as interest reversals.</p>
          <p>This negative impact on core managed NII in the third quarter was 1.15 billion due to non-performing assets, approximately 330 million in interest reversals, approximately 820 million. Combined, this impact was approximately 40 million worse than second quarter.  Now, most of the interest reversals relates to credit card business. The core net interest margin on a managed basis decreased six basis points to 3.65% due mainly to lower loan levels and higher yielding assets such as cards.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to our interest rate risk position, we continue to be asset sensitive, where we benefit as rates rise and are exposed as rates decline. As you can see from the flowchart on slide 34, which as you know, is based on the forward curve, our interest rate risk position is slightly more asset sensitive relative to how we were positioned three months ago. The change in sensitivity is primarily due to the lower level of rates. Depending on how low rates are, we remain flush with liquidity, and believe an asset sensitive position makes sense, as we're positioned to benefit as rates rise in the future.</p>
          <p>Now, let me say a few things about capital, and you see this on slide 37. The tier one capital ratio at the end of September was 12.46%, up 53 basis points from the second quarter due mainly to managing the size of our balance sheet. Our tier one capital level is 100 billion, in excess of the 6% well capitalized minimum requirement. Tier one common increased 35 basis points to 7.25%, while our tangible common equity ratio increased at 4.82%. Tangible common equity rose as a result of the improved valuations in the securities available for sale, which increased OCI. As a reminder, the appreciation above our current carrying value for either BlackRock or China Construction Bank is not included in OCI.</p>
          <p>Preferred dividends this quarter were $1.24, or excuse me, 1.24 billion, of which almost 900 million was associated with TARP preferred, or $0.10 per share per quarter given no tax benefit. I remind you that this is up from the second quarter due to the preferred exchanges for common in the second period, which recognized the discounts from the exchange. This level of preferred dividends in the third quarter is expected to remain about the same next quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, going forward into the final quarter of 2009, and in line with Ken's remarks, we believe we're to peak in total credit losses or at least very close to it. Having said that, it's difficult to call the specific quarter when credit costs start to drop substantially from the peak. Excluding the purchased impaired portfolio and the amount we put up for maturing securitization, the reserve additions would have been minimal this quarter. Now, once we hit the inflection point on losses where we no longer have to build reserves, we should get some lift.</p>
          <p>We improved our strong balance sheet again this quarter with a robust and even more conservative liquidity position, stronger credit reserves, and higher capital ratios. With credit losses possibly peaking soon, we believe the level of our reserves and revenue generation over the next several quarters will enable to us get through the period with minimal impact on capital levels. Merrill Lynch, once again, contributed positively to earnings, as its done so over the first nine months of the year.  The Merrill Lynch integration effort is on track and continues to make headway. With Countrywide, we're in the process of launching significant system conversions over the next several quarters, and plan to finalize the Countrywide integration by June of next year.</p>
          <p>Cost saves at Merrill were approximately $1 billion this quarter or 2.2 billion for nine months. So we're well on our way towards exceeding 45% of the total cost saves, which were projected at seven billion annually in 2009, and well ahead of our original 2009 goal.</p>
          <p>We continue to see decent business momentum this quarter, and with further stabilization in both the economy and credit quality, we can continue to improve our competitive position, which should enhance the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Now with that, let me open it up for questions, and I thank you for your attention.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple things. One is, I was wondering, in looking at the sort of consolidated P&amp;L, we still see other than temporary impairment losses on AFS debt securities. And just about every credit spread that we look at improved during the quarter, and I was just curious why are there still losses there given the environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Losses there were, Chris, driven principally off of two places. One was, as I mentioned in the remarks, in the non-agency CMOs that principally came over from either Countrywide or some from the Merrill Lynch investment portfolio, and as we recalibrated the severities and the cash flow expectations off of all those, that's what drove the impairment for us from that standpoint. The other &#x2013; probably the other third is probably two-thirds or maybe closer to half-half, related to some of the market disruption charges that I mentioned in the markets business, where the CEO charges. Some of those securities, and you can see this in the supplement or where, if you go back in the 10-Q, have a piece of them carried in the available for sale, and it was related to that same charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, again, it's just odd because all the market seems to have improved. The other thing was the $277 million reserve to a single client out of Global Wealth Management. In general, I think of that as sort of a granular non-credit intensive business. Can you give some color on that and give us comfort that there aren't others like that in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The charge &#x2013; I think you're referring to the total change in credit cost, and when you &#x2013; as opposed to just the particular charge.  So it was probably half of that. But it did relate to a fraud-related item, one of the larger credits, but a fraud-related item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I don't know if there's any comment you or Ken can make about the announcement -- timing on the succession announcement?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I can just say that there's an appropriate sense of urgency, but combined with wanting to obviously make the best decision, it's the most important decision a Board can make. And so there's a &#x2013; I'm assured that the proper balance in getting it right, but also doing it with a sense of urgency, and, but I can't give you a date.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple questions on credit and earnings power. On credit, if I back out what you provided for in the CFC provision that you did this quarter, which -- is it fair to say that that's kind of a catch-up provision? And you would think that you're done with that. Is that a fair assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm thinking this whole downturn, Betsy, I've learned never to be done with... done with anything. But we tried to lay out on the slide the detailed characteristics. So you can see the delinquency improvement and kind of the trends on it in the package. So we &#x2013; if we're not done, that should be the lion's share. But it is sensitive to home price indexes or home price out into the future and then also modifications, but the lion's share should be behind us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what are you thinking about in terms of home price change one year forward? Because I think that's what you would be reserving for, is your forward look for one year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for 03-03, it's a life of loan thing, so you kind of look forward. But we're pretty consistent with kind of the Case-Shiller details on both the state level as well as nationally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is the provision that you would get to about 10 billion, ex the CFC, a core run rate for this quarter, do you think, or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you just did the math and took that and said, what did you build? I think I made this comment in the remarks, if you took that out, the 03-03 provision, and then you took maturing securitizations, everything else kind of netted off, is the way, but we're not suggesting that charge-offs have absolutely peaked. We think we're near or somewhere near from that standpoint. And then hopefully, if the economy can continue to show stability and improve, we could &#x2013; we would not have to have the level of reserve build on top of that. So I think that's the way to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And reserve build really is a function of NPL growth, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It differs by the pieces, so it's less about NPA growth and more about our view of the forward-looking charge-offs on the consumer products. And then principally on the commercial corporate side, it's pretty much loan by loan and risk rating driven. So think of the reservable criticized as driving a big piece of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and how do you think about what your reserve does over the next couple of quarters or the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably tracks economic activity. The better the &#x2013; if you think about credit quality, in general, the core is where the charge-offs go. And obviously, if the economy continues its path to stabilization and then growth, we ought to be able to track that. That would suggest to you that at some point those are not needed, but right now, it's too early to call that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the earnings power question, it seems like you're indicating that as rates rise and as demand for credit comes back, you've got some earnings power. The other question I had is just the liquidity that you indicated, a significant amount of liquidity at this stage. What would drive you to put some of that excess liquidity back to work sooner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, earlier, it was probably as much about making sure we got the Merrill Lynch BAC or BAS platforms put together, understood the contingent liquidity requirements and things of that nature. We're kind of through that exercise. And now it has probably as much to do with opportunity and maybe a little of the other still left over. And so you'll see us put some to work in what I call a liquidity portfolio, we've done some of that this quarter, but the duration will probably stay reasonably short until we see the curve in an appropriate position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there anything associated with TARP repayment? Are you holding any excess liquidity to pay back TARP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, the most beneficial thing would be to take the TARP dividend out with some of that liquidity. And so that's obviously one of the things in the thinking, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there any expectation that you can give us on timeframe for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't hear you, Betsy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything you can give us with regard to expectation for repaying TARP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All I'll tell you is we're supplying &#x2013; we have all the information and doing everything we can on our part. But you probably heard that some more specific guidance is supposed to come out from the regulators regarding repayment criteria very shortly. So we'll need to make sure that we meet those criteria, but nothing else has changed from what we've said in the past. That's our goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you use any excess liquidity to pay down debt as opposed to issue? You've got some issuance coming due over the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this quarter, if you looked at what we did, we had &#x2013; we probably had about 3.5 to four times the maturity than we had issuance. We were out in the market, we issued &#x2013; showed, part of showing that we could, and then where we wanted to keep the avenues open. So you'd probably see us do a little more of that over time too.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Loans continue to decline at a pretty rapid rate both for the overall industry and for you as well. And I was just wondering with some signs that the economy is bottoming, is your appetite to make loans and keep them on your balance sheet increasing at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; I would just say that we're actively looking for every good loan we can make.  I mean, obviously, it's the core of how we make money. So the attitude hasn't changed, but if the economy starts to get better and there's demand, then we will be there to supply credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have thoughts of where we might first see that demand, which categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. Joe, do you have any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, my guess, I would think on the commercial side, you would probably see it first in middle market in the areas because once business confidence comes back, and you see the middle market companies begin to build, build their inventory and spend more on CapEx, put people back to work, et cetera, that's probably on the commercial side where you'd see it more so than maybe large corporate, which would tend to go into the marketplace a little bit more. And on the consumer side, it's probably first mortgage and areas of that nature versus home equity and things of that nature that you'd see it first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just separately, I just had a clarification question. On slide 15, where you show the sales and trading revenue. Obviously, both periods are being impacted by the CVA write-downs as well as some market disruption noise. If we look at the equity income line, is that a pretty clean number quarter to quarter? I figure there's not that much noise in those two numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The only reason I'm hesitating, Matt, is to see how much derivative liability impact you had in there. It shouldn't be &#x2013; it should not be a whole lot. It's probably a little bit, but I think compared to fixed income, that one's pretty apples to apples.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just lastly, if I may, and I apologize if you addressed this and I missed it, but the tier one common dollars actually went up a couple of billion quarter to quarter, even though net income was negative. And I was just trying to figure out, is there more deferred tax assets that are now being allowed, or what's driving that increase in capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a piece of that that relates to deferred tax assets, where our carryback capacity, where we refined our carryback capacity and had some incremental ability. So there was a piece of that. And let me -- I'll come back to you or get Lee or Kevin to, on anything else that was <mark type="audio gap" /> made, but that was one of the bigger drivers.</p>

          <p>Okay. And do you know offhand how much additional DTA is being excluded that could come back in over time?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have a lot of haircut DTA there.  What, we do have some remaining for GAAP purposes, and therefore, it's not in the DTA, unutilized or let's call it reserved against carryforwards. And so it's more that. But count it in several billion, not a ton more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the regulatory capital from here will be mostly driven by net income and then whatever happens in the balance sheet side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, you do have volatility from the DTA to the extent that, over time, you move out of carryback into carryforward, things -- a lot of moving parts on it.  So you could get a little bit there, but I wouldn't, it's not -- it shouldn't be that big a number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I had a question mainly on the credit card. Could you talk about how, if your loan mod-ing some of those credit cards, and are they coming up in the TDRs? And how they're impacting both the NPAs and the credit card portfolio, and the reserve methodology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when you talk about modify, there's a lot of different ways you can modify credit cards.  There's two principal ways that you think about it. Those that are in early-stage collections are some, and then those that you kind of put on a fixed plan. And in both of those cases, the re-performance period is, I think, three and four months respectively from that. So you're not really -- you would only see it after &#x2013; you'd only see it "change" in the delinquency stats after they met the full minimum payment for those periods. So that's the real impact. Less impact on TDRs. That's more of a mortgage product related thing for consumer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, I mean, are you -- I mean, the issue is we don't &#x2013; we're hearing a lot of anecdotal data about a lot of credit card modifications taking place.  And we're just wondering, what type of &#x2013; are you loan mod-ing your credit card portfolio? And how much of an impact is it having on the overall performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, yes, we are trying to help our customers there and we are modifying in various &#x2013; and trying to do various workout strategies with customers. But once you do that, you still have to meet minimum payment standards and requirements, and you have to meet &#x2013; they have to meet full re-performance for, again, three to four months before you see them change in delinquency status. So I think what &#x2013; any impact on the delinquency status that you're seeing I think is true performance driven, sustained performance driven.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First is a quick question. Joe, you made a comment about capital ratios right at the end of your remarks, in terms of capital ratios staying relatively stable through the next several quarters. And I was wondering, did you mean that to include with the impact of FAS 166 and 167, or excluding the impact? And if it is excluding the impact, what would you say 166 and 167 impact is on your capital ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would exclude &#x2013; I was talking about kind of from an operating standpoint, Ed. From a FAS 140 standpoint or amendments to FAS 140, best we can tell right now, we'd project there to be about 125 billion that comes back on the balance sheet in January. Think of about 70 of that being in cards. So you can make your own estimate on what you think the reserves would be.  The rest of it would be, the delta between those two would principally be multi-seller and some home equity securitizations. But the lion's share of the reserve impact will come out of credit card. And since that's on the balance sheet already for regulatory purposes, the risk-weighted impact really would exclude card that's already on there. So think of that number, again, if we were estimating or if we're trying to call today what we think it'll be out in January, somewhere in the 25 to $30 billion range for RWA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So that's additional RWA and then you have the reserve impact as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You got it, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and is there any way to quantify those two things together in terms of basis points on tier one ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the only reason I'm hesitating is I'd just as soon you make your own view as to the reserve cost, to what the reserve requirement will be on the various components that come on because we're not settled yet on that. But think of the 30 billion of RWA -- I'm looking at Kevin, I'll come back to you on the exact number of RWA for basis point. And then the other one would simply be the reserve impact. So that's more of a dollar thing for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second question comes back to the issue with respect to declining loan balances. I don't know if you can give any, number one, if you can give any sense of sort of how many more quarters, I know it's a tough question to answer, or to what additional extent you would expect loan balances to decline before they stabilize? And as that's happening, what's your appetite to replace net loan runoff with investment securities or mortgage backed securities given the very low rate environment on MBS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess the -- one way to think about further declines in loan balances is just to kind of look at the ending balance versus the average, because you can see that there's some categories where you still got downdraft coming into next quarter on it for a little while. When that actually changes, it's probably got, it goes back to my earlier comment. It probably has a little more to do with where business or economic activity is from a demand standpoint, as Ken referenced, than anything else.</p>
          <p>In the interim, kind of back to Betsy's question, what's the best use of our excess liquidity during this period? Clearly, repayment of some TARP would be on the agenda when we can meet the &#x2013; when we get approval for that. Clearly, you can manage through some of this by reducing the debt footprint while you have excess liquidity, and let maturities outrun new issuance. And then when you get to deploying excess liquidity and securities, the appetite, I would say, we have some but we're not -- we're going to be patient. And then we'd probably -- if we do something short-term, we'd probably keep the duration in reasonably well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your inventory level number is probably going to be a key one going forward because you do have some companies with very, very tight inventory levels. And as you start to get the economy improving, they're going to have to start building inventory levels and then you'll start seeing some at least working capital loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. So I guess it would be fair to say that in the current rate environment, sort of in the near term with MBS yields this low, that your first sort of reaction in terms of the use of excess liquidity would be to pay down higher cost debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't know that I'd put it first, second, third, I'd just say that's one of the ones that you saw us do this quarter where we let maturities outstrip issuance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Joe. Just following up on the NII. When you net together those balance sheet considerations with maybe a little bit better trend in interest reversals, is your hope to keep NII, core NII, pretty flat going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you've got a couple things. I mean, it also depends on where short-term rates go because you got a deposit impact when you start coming out of this thing that will be a favorable. So I kind of put credit drag in the deposit side on the favorable piece, and then the demand &#x2013; until demand picks up, that's going to be the challenge. So over time, those are the factors that are really going to deal with. In the near term, I don't want to forecast fourth quarter margin or net interest income on there, but our goal would be to try to retain reasonable stability there. Obviously, I've got some hedge and effectiveness and things like that that can work against me in the near term, but that would be &#x2013; that's clearly the goal. But demand of higher yielding -- demand per higher yielding loans is, kind of be the wildcard on us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the reserve additions for card loans that are maturing, is that typical for these to come on with a natural maturation or is this related to you supporting some of these trusts where the excess spreads have come down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, natural maturities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a question on Global Wealth Management. Are we seeing leverage there to the improving markets? Investor sentiment, obviously, this quarter was hurt by the provisioning and cash support charges. But is that a business you feel like is under earning and should have some leverage as things get better here?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Once you take some of these things that Sallie's [Sallie Krawcheck] business had to absorb this quarter out and then start looking forward, both the stability of the FA trends, the productivity levels that we saw out of that, a lot of very positive momentum when you add that market lift, and that should take us forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and a question for Ken. Since it is the first time, as you said, you've addressed the shareholders, the investment community, since the announcement, maybe you could give us some thoughts on what drove your decision and the timing?</p>

I'd always thought I would intuitively know that, and I did. It was just 40 years with the same company and eight years as the CEO is enough.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also if I could ask, to what extent will you be involved in the screening and the selection process for a successor? And do you have any views on whether an insider or outsider would be best for the company and the shareholders?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions here. You said that Merrill was accretive in the quarter and you talked about the stabilization of FAs, et cetera, et cetera. Could you just tell us or give us some kind of color on whether you're at the place in revenue generation with Merrill that you'd like to be right now, or whether some of the -- some of the loss of personnel et cetera that were very publicized in the last couple of quarters have actually cost you revenue that you now can start to recoup?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's hard to quantify any of that, Nancy. I would say that just in terms of expectations, that we're right where we thought we should be, and then of course, we're ahead on expenses. I've been very impressed with Tom Montag's ability to attract really outstanding people when we have lost or needed to fill a position. So we probably would &#x2013; we would be at a point now that's better than we were three months ago or six months ago. And so I think each quarter, you're going to see us more going toward our full potential than maybe the first and second quarters, and things have settled down obviously a lot more. And then you could say the same thing on the Wealth Management side. I'm very pleased with what &#x2013; with the things that Sallie Krawcheck is doing. And we do now see stabilization in that financial advisor network, and that was very important to get to that point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And on the issue of loan demand, et cetera, can you just comment on utilization of lines? Are we starting to see a flattening of the decline there, or it is still sort of accelerating at an accelerating rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nancy, nothing sticks out to me across on the utilized lines. Clients are obviously conserving cash that is by some of our deposits. They're not using their lines. Back in the disruption period, you clearly had a bounce in a couple of industries, but if anything, you're seeing less utilization. And in some cases in maturities, people actually permanently cutting down or coming in at lower overall amounts to in essence to pay their commitment fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Joe, one question for you.  On the tier one common ratio, it started out with I think the regulators were saying 4% target, and then it became a 6% target. And it might be a 7% target. Do you have any sense at this point about where that number is going to need to go over the long term? Can you bring it down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nancy, I don't know that I have a good prediction. There's so many different opinions out there that you hear, and none are necessarily official. I do feel like, though, the pressure will be on higher quality of capital with your total capital structure in that the focus while still on tier one will be more acutely on tier one common over time. So the way we think about it when we run the company is, what's the baseline? And if the baseline is four or five, just let's define that. And then what's the cushion over that, that you need to absorb unexpected and to have room to operate. Then the question will be, is there something on top of that, and I think that's kind of the discussion. It will also be driven obviously by the business mix, especially to the extent that they increase the capital needs around certain trading activities and things of that nature.</p>

          <p>Well, we're actually looking for mitigation actions and other things we can do.  Some of those may be on the expense line, some of those may be off of there. But right now, that's our best estimate of the raw impact of the changes we made.</p>

          <p>Okay.  And then commercial real estate loan losses had a big jump, from 3.3 to 4.7%. How much of that jump would be due to, say, refinancing, and how much from TDR, and how much from borrowers simply not paying? Just a rough sense.</p>

          <p>Hey, Mike, you've got a ton of feedback. I can barely &#x2013; I could catch about half your question.</p>

          <p>Can you hear me right now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, how much of the jump in commercial real estate loan losses related to borrowers not paying or refinancing or TDRs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say the biggest &#x2013; I don't have the exact breakdown. I'll have to come back to you on stuff, but think of the appraisal process as probably being one of the biggest drivers of the losses. As we try to keep our appraisals accounted in a couple of months in terms of how current we try to keep them. And that, as property values fall and as these appraisals have really come in, that's been the biggest &#x2013; probably one of the biggest drivers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the catalyst for a renewed appraisal process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When something goes substandard or when something goes into your classified categories, you clearly would do it.  Once it's in there, the formal requirement, I guess, is an annual one, but we try to stay as current as we can on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And correct me if I'm wrong, even if the appraisal says the value of the property is way down, but the borrower is still paying and is expected to pay, you don't have to write that down, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Each credit &#x2013; there's some truth to that, but each credit depends on the exact circumstances of the individual credit, the reliability, the repayment terms, all the other things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  And then a very simple question with a tough answer. If credit losses have peaked perhaps by your estimate with your assumption of unemployment of 10%, how much higher would the credit losses potentially go if unemployment goes to 11%? Or just what's the ongoing sensitivity of your credit losses if unemployment goes higher than expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a good estimate for an overall number for you like that. I do &#x2013; it kind of depends because it's really net new claims that I think are part of -- or what we see as really driving it. So if you saw kind of a gradual role, I think it would be very manageable. If you saw an instant spike, it would be &#x2013; it would have a pretty big impact on us across the board because that would suggest the rest of the economy is very weak also.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then just I guess I'm not sure if it's Ken's last conference call, but kind of any lessons from the last year, five, twenty years that kind of thoughts you want to kind of leave us with, Ken?</p>

          <p>Mike, I sit here at the moment thinking that we have built the best financial franchise in the world. And that I look forward, it'll be from a far I guess, but I look forward to seeing it play out over the next few years.</p>
