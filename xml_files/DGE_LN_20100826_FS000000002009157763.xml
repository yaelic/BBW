      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for your time today.</p>
          <p>We're staying with our usual format, although Nick is doing this for the last time. He and I will take you through the results we've released this morning in some more detail, and then we'll take your questions. At that point, we'll be joined by our four regional presidents; Stuart Fletcher, Ivan Menezes, Andrew Morgan, and Gilbert Ghostine. We also have Deirdre Mahlan, our CFO-designate with us.</p>
          <p>As we expected, the year brought both challenges and opportunities, characterized by the mixed performance of the global economy. In developed markets, there has been a fragile and uncertain recovery. Consumers continue to search for value in their discretionary spend and to shift from on to the off-trade. In contrast, there was continued strength in the developing markets of Latin America and Africa, the developing markets in Asia Pacific recovered, and in Europe, Russia returned to growth.</p>
          <p>Given the trading pattern of the previous year, we knew that the first half would be especially difficult and our results would improve in the second half. This is exactly how it played out. Net sales decline of 2% in the first half was replaced by second half growth of 6%, with all four regions posting growth.</p>
          <p>The pricing environment was difficult throughout the year, and the weakness in the on-trade limited our ability to trade consumers up. But through innovation and improved on-trade customer marketing, we created opportunities to grow at the super premium end. Our reserve brand portfolio grew strongly in Latin America and global travel, and Ciroc continued to outperform in the United States.</p>
          <p>In a difficult year, and after having increased marketing spend as a percent of net sales, we delivered 2% organic operating profit growth. The actions that we took to hold COGS flat and reduce overheads maintained margin in a tough year. Currency movements again benefited our reported results with net sales up 5% and operating profit up 6%.</p>
          <p>EPS pre-exceptionals grew 13%, driven by organic growth, favorable FX and lower interest. Our free cash flow generation is at a record level at over &#xA3;2 billion, reflecting our focus on improving working capital. Our confidence that our business is stronger allows us to recommend a 6% increase in the final dividend.</p>
          <p>Markets, categories, price points, and brands were all affected by the economic downturn, but in different ways and to differing degrees. To deliver these results, we had to be agile in our response. The question that we continue to ask ourselves as we manage in a volatile environment has been, how do we make this business stronger?</p>
          <p>We stepped up our marketing spend significantly in the second half behind proven campaigns and category momentum. The biggest increases in spend were behind our biggest brands in their biggest markets, Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Captain Morgan.</p>
          <p>We continued to grow our sales capability, investing to build strong category management skills and deeper shopper understanding. Our relationships with our biggest customers and distributors has never been better. We've increased our category captaincy positions around the world. And we are generating above average growth with our four largest global retailers. We've extended our brand positions, gaining share in two-thirds of our top-20 markets.</p>
          <p>The global restructuring program that we announced last year is complete. It has delivered a leaner cost base and faster, more efficient working practices. Further cost savings will be delivered primarily as a result of changes in the supply organization and in the North American wine business.</p>
          <p>Strong cash generation, up &#xA3;800 million and improved return on invested capital to 14.8%, has again enhanced our financial strength.</p>
          <p>Later, I am going to return to how each of these actions has enhanced the business, but first let me handover to Nick.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul and good morning everyone.</p>
          <p>I'll now take you through the figures in more detail. Looking first at net sales, exchange rate movements benefited reported net sales by &#xA3;267 million, as the US dollar, the euro and the Korean won all appreciated, offsetting the impact of the depreciation of the Nigerian naira.</p>
          <p>During the year, we acquired distribution rights in respect of a number of brands &#x2013; Grand Marnier and Windhoek- and consolidated the outstanding shares in Stirrings. At the end of last year, we discontinued our interest in the French agency wine business in North America.</p>
          <p>So turning now to organic net sales growth on a regional basis, in North America, there have been signs of recovery, but they are not consistent. The market is not yet returned to a period of sustained growth across all categories and price points. And consumer confidence remains weak. However, we were quick to find the right way to reach consumers in this tough environment and we grew share of our key brands.</p>
          <p>We launched some great innovations and up-weighted our marketing activity around proven growth drivers. And this contributed to 3% net sales growth in our US spirits business in the second half.</p>
          <p>Innovations and some improvement in the on-trade led to strong growth of our premium and super premium Vodka brands in H2. Performance in Europe was mixed as we expected. GB and Russia delivered growth, while Spain and Ireland continued to decline, albeit at a slower rate as the tough economic environment continued to negatively impact the on-trade in both of those markets.</p>
          <p>Following a very strong performance, particularly around Christmas, the GB business continued its positive trend in the second half, driven by Wine, Smirnoff and Baileys. In the second half, Russia returned to growth, driven by Johnny Walker, White Horse and Bell's, as the market recovered quickly from the downturn. And whilst there has been margin erosion, double-digit net sales growth of Johnny Walker in the second half is an encouraging indication that premiumization is returning to Scotch in Russia.</p>
          <p>In Greece, the impact of the tough austerity measures introduced towards the end of our fiscal year had limited impact on the full year results, and we expect more of an impact next year.</p>
          <p>In the second half, Asia Pacific's performance improved, driven mainly by Johnnie Walker. The de-stocking in China, which drove over 20% net sales decline in H1, was replaced by strong growth in H2. Johnnie Walker Black Label in China posted double-digit net sales growth and gained over two percentage points of share in the second half.</p>
          <p>As you've seen, it was the performance of our international business, which again was the engine for growth. The 7% organic growth delivered last year was reinforced by 13% growth this year. Each hub performed strongly, as you saw from this morning's announcement. Our international business increased net sales by over &#xA3;300 million. There were a number of excellent performances. Scotch in Latin America and beer in Africa both increased net sales by over &#xA3;100 million.</p>
          <p>Great sales execution in global travel retail, as traveler numbers improved, delivered very strong performance. We delivered growth in spirits in Latin America, spirits in Africa and ready-to-drink across international. It was a strong overall performance, which demonstrates the strength the Diageo's brands and routes to market in these developing markets.</p>
          <p>If we compare our performance in H1 with H2, we see how each was impacted by the comparison against the prior year. The first half was lapping relatively strong performance and good price mix in H1 fiscal '09 as our business was not really impacted by the global downturn until November 2008.</p>
          <p>Performance improved in the second half, primarily because comparatives eased. However, underlying performance also improved as we increased marketing spend, launched a number of innovations and developing markets continued to perform strongly.</p>
          <p>Through the year, we've maintained the strong price mix that we achieved in Fiscal 2009. Even though promotional activity was more intense, and as Paul said, the pricing environment was difficult, our brands have continued to sell at a price premium, providing a strong foundation for the year ahead.</p>
          <p>Looking at the growth of our business by segment, in contrast to the first six months of the year, all segments showed growth over the full year. The growth in the value segment was driven by consumers trading down in Vodka in South Africa and by the growth of Senator in Kenya. This was partially offset by the decline in value brands in North America and Europe.</p>
          <p>Within the standard segment, growth of Johnnie Walker Red Label and Cacique in Latin America and growth from Lager in Africa offset declines in Jose Cuervo and Smirnoff in North America and Guinness and J&amp;B in Europe. The strong performance of Johnnie Walker Black Label together with growth of the Singleton in Asia and Buchanan's and Old Parr in Latin America drove growth in the premium segment.</p>
          <p>Vodka drove the improvement in super and ultra-premium, led by Ketel One vodka and Ciroc, as both benefited from innovation and an upturn in the on-trade in the some parts of North America. Johnnie Walker Super Deluxe in international, Old Parr Superior in Latin America and Windsor XR in China also contributed to this growth.</p>
          <p>So, turning now to operating profit; in a difficult year, organic operating profit grew 2%. On a reported basis, the FX benefit to operating profit was &#xA3;126 million. A translation benefit of 37 million and a transaction benefit of 133 million were offset by an adverse movement of 44 million under IAS 21. For fiscal '11, foreign exchange movements, excluding any potential changes to the Venezuelan bolivar, which I'll come on to in a moment are currently expected to increase operating profit by &#xA3;80 million and decrease interest by &#xA3;5 million.</p>
          <p>The current situation in Venezuela, with respect to currency controls and the official exchange rate is uncertain. In fiscal 2010, we had local currency operating profit of approximately VEB450 million. And under current accounting treatment, these local currency profits were translated at the official rate of 2.15 to the US dollar in H1 and 4.3 in H2. And if the translation exchange rate is changed in fiscal '11, this would most likely create an adverse FX movement.</p>
          <p>So, moving onto operating profit by segment, and I'm going to start with corporate; corporate costs grew by &#xA3;34 million. And as you remember, corporate costs were up &#xA3;49 million in H1, and we expected to see a fall in H2, reflecting overhead savings from restructuring. The performance by region is reported using forecast exchange rates and the difference between our forecast and actual exchange rates for fiscal '10 is taken to corporate. This amounted to an adverse movement of &#xA3;82 million.</p>
          <p>If this adverse movement were allocated back to the regions, it would have some impact on organic growth rate, primarily in North America and international. It would not have any impact on the overall operating margin, which was maintained at 28.3% of net sales.</p>
          <p>In North America, despite a decline in net sales and a significant increase in marketing spend in the second half, operating profit was flat and operating margin improved driven by overhead savings and gross margin improvement.</p>
          <p>In Europe, operating profit was down, the reduction in marketing spend, more than offset the decline in gross margin to deliver some improvement in operating margin. Overhead benefits from restructuring were offset by lapping VAT reclaim in GB in fiscal '09.</p>
          <p>In international, gross margin improvement driven by scotch delivered strong operating profit growth and operating margin improved. Improved gross margin and lower overheads, which were partially offset by higher marketing spend led to operating profit growth in Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to the other lines in the income statement, there was a &#xA3;22 million reduction in associate income mainly due to Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy. Against this, there was a significant decrease in net finance charges and therefore profit before tax and exceptionals was up by &#xA3;271 million.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the net finance charge in more detail. Net finance charges have decreased by &#xA3;130 million, net interest charges decreased by 141 million, driven by a significant fall in average floating rates and lower average net borrowings as a result of our strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>Net other finance charges were &#xA3;87 million. They included 47 million in respect of post employment plans, 18 million due to unwinding of discounts on liabilities, 16 million in respect of a hyperinflation adjustment in Venezuela and translation differences on intercompany funding of &#xA3;10 million.</p>
          <p>For fiscal 2011, I would expect our interest rates, excluding the impacts of IAS 21 and 39, to be slightly higher than the 4.8% we achieved in fiscal 2010. Floating rates are expected to increase, and I think it may be appropriate in fiscal '11 to fix in some of the historically low rates we are currently seeing in the market.</p>
          <p>This will benefit our interest charge long-term, but will increase the charge in fiscal '11 as we move to a higher proportion of fixed rate debt. Other finance charges are likely to be lower in fiscal '11 as the charge for post employment obligations under IAS 19 is expected to be about &#xA3;5 million.</p>
          <p>Moving now to exceptional items, total exceptional charges were a 177 million for the year. Charges in respect of the restructuring programs we previously announced amounted to &#xA3;190 million, in line with our guidance. The restructuring of our wine business, which we announced in May 2010, resulted in an exceptional credit of &#xA3;48 million as the profit arising from the sale and leaseback offset the restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>Brand value adjustments in respect of Ursus, which is essentially dependant on Greece, gave rise to a &#xA3;35 million charge. The cash outflow in fiscal '10 was &#xA3;145 million, compared with 53 million last year. This is below the guidance I gave in February as supply projects were delayed slightly and as costs reduced, for example, in our Scottish projects where we've seen people take up relocation rather than redundancy.</p>
          <p>And I expect the exceptional charge to be &#xA3;30 million in fiscal '11, primarily in respect of the restructuring of global supply operations, while cash expenditure is likely to be approximately a &#xA3;150 million.</p>
          <p>In addition to the exceptional items, there is also a charge in respect of sale of businesses, which relates mainly to our planned disposal of non-core wine brands in the United States.</p>
          <p>The overall tax charge increased by &#xA3;191 million. As you recall, the reported tax rate last year was 14.4%, reflecting changes to tax assets and provisions held on the balance sheet, which had to be recognized in the P&amp;L. There are no such adjustments this year and therefore the reported rate is 21.3%. The underlying tax rate remains around 22%, at 21.6% this year against 22.1% last year.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier fiscal 2010 has been about investing behind capabilities and brands, controlling our cost base and a real focus on cash generation. The result of that focus is the exceptional cash flow of over &#xA3;2 billion. Higher operating profit, lower interest and a reduction in tax payments, all contributed to the improvement.</p>
          <p>However, the major driver was the introduction of new policies and procedures which step changed our management of working capital and delivered a cash flow benefit of &#xA3;587 million. Net capital expenditure was also lower, benefiting from the proceeds of the sale and lease back on wines in North America.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure before disposal proceeds increased by &#xA3;19 million as a result of investment in additional costs in North America and more spend on information systems. Other movements in cash flow include a reduction of &#xA3;63 million in dividend income from Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy and the reversal of non-cash items in the P&amp;L such as the gain on the sale and lease back. This has been an exceptional year for our free cash flow.</p>
          <p>In fiscal 2011, we expect working capital ratios will be maintained and net CapEx will be higher largely due to spend in developing markets. So, whilst I do not expect fiscal '11 cash flow to be this strong, I do see that we can move beyond the average we've delivered in the past.</p>
          <p>The increase in free cash flow was the biggest driver of the reduction in net borrowings. Dividend payments were 914 million and exchange rate movements increased net debt by &#xA3;429 million due to the strong dollar, partly offset by the weaker euro.</p>
          <p>Purchase of businesses includes a &#xA3;123 million placed on deposits with China's securities depositary and clearing agency in respect of our possible tender offer to increase our shareholding Shui Jing Fang.</p>
          <p>It also includes nearly &#xA3;30 million for setup costs for our South Africa JV and 25 million to increase our shareholding in Nuvo.</p>
          <p>EPS before exceptionals was &#xA3;0.72, an increase of 13% against last year. Foreign exchange benefits drove seven percentage points of this growth, and organic operating profit growth and lower interest drove six percentage points of growth.</p>
          <p>Diageo's financial position as always been a key strength, and whilst it's been a challenging year, we took a number of decisions, which were aimed at enhancing this. We broadly maintained our operating margins, improving our gross margin with strict control of cogs and production overheads.</p>
          <p>We invested in marketing, which together with increased innovation, maintained the price mix we delivered last year. Economic profit increased by &#xA3;78 million to 890 million. And our return on invested capital increased by 30 basis points. These improvements were driven by the increased in operating profit.</p>
          <p>Debt was reduced, as was the interest charge, and we accessed the debt market during the year in order to optimize our long-term maturity profile. We have agreed an efficient funding plan for the UK and Irish pension schemes, which gives the trustees security and maintains the companies cash contributions at this year's level for a number of years.</p>
          <p>And we're recommending a 6% increase in the final dividend, which is modestly ahead of expectations, and given our financial strength, we anticipate at least maintaining this rate of dividend growth in fiscal '11. We have the capacity to fund the growth of the business and balance future shareholder returns between dividend growth and share buybacks as appropriate.</p>
          <p>Fiscal '10 was a tough year, and while we are expect the global economy to grow faster in fiscal '11, the level of growth in the developed market is uncertain. Signs of recovery in North America are muted, and have not yet proved to be consistent and may therefore not be sustained. In Europe, the consumer remains cautious as governments look to address deficits.</p>
          <p>In contrast, the developing markets benefit from more stable economic growth and a growing middle-class. These markets are now a significant part of our business, and will again be the engine of our growth. We expect to hold cogs flat in fiscal '11 and our hedging policies provide some certainty about this outcome.</p>
          <p>This is underpinned by cost savings, which our restructuring will achieve. And we again expect to benefit from currency movement in the year, although moderated by events in Venezuela. In fiscal '11, our interest charge will benefit from the fall in net debt we delivered in fiscal '10 through our strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>As I said, I do not expect that our cash flow will be as strong in fiscal '11, but it will be above the average we've achieved for the last few years.</p>
          <p>Floating interest rates are likely to increase. So, I do expect a slight increase in our overall interest charge, but this is likely to be offset by lower net financing charges as the IIS 19 charge reduces.</p>
          <p>Taken together then, in the new fiscal year, we will face a number of uncertainties, but we have taken the actions, which will allow us to control our costs and fund increased marketing. This is the basis on which we've issued our guidance today for organic operating profit growth in fiscal '11 to improve on the 2% we achieved in fiscal '10.</p>
          <p>In summary, I'm pleased to say that in my final set of results, Diageo has weathered the economic challenges of fiscal '10 extremely well. And we have taken some tough decisions to position us well to generate future brand growth.</p>
          <p>I'm leaving a company that has the financial strength to invest in its brands and geographies and provide good returns to its shareholder. And on top of all of this, Diageo is full of very talented people, including of course the new CFO. He will take the company to even greater heights, and I shall miss it all.</p>
          <p>And with that, I shall say for the last time and now back to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nick.</p>
          <p>The global economy improved during the year, but the recovery was fragile. We were quick to respond to the disruptions and changes, which occurred in our markets last year. We've honed these skills, as we reduced our cost base and held COGS flat, now we have a more agile organization, which can move quickly.</p>
          <p>Our performance was different between the two halves and different between the developed and the developing markets. In half one, we were lapping a tough comparison well in half two, the comparison was easier, but our performance in the second half did benefit somewhat from the actions we took to increase innovation, increase marketing and increase our consumer and customer marketing programs.</p>
          <p>In the developed markets, we prioritize resources on the biggest value creating opportunities. In the developing markets, which is where we're experiencing more stable growth, we've capitalized on our leading brand positions and great roots to market.</p>
          <p>So it's been a year in which we've done a lot. We've taken cost out. We've reprioritized spend and we've made a number of decisions, which although difficult will serve as well for the future. At the same time, we delivered growth, improved our cash generation and improved our returns.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at how this has positioned us for the future. We spend over &#xA3;1.4 billion a year to build our brands. We spend it behind campaigns, which drives sales and build brand equity, and we spend it effectively. In the first half, there was a reduction in spend, mainly in Europe, which merits the consumer downturn there.</p>
          <p>In the second half, more growth opportunities presented themselves and we increased spend by 14%, well ahead of net sales growth of 6%. We made our allocation decisions through two lenses. Firstly, we invested behind proven growth drivers, which we can execute at scale. This drove increased investment in the US, where we have some of our most developed campaigns.</p>
          <p>Investments in Johnnie Walker was increased significantly in GTME, in Mexico and in Brazil with the Strides and the Walk with Giants campaigns, both of which have part of our successful Keep Walking platform. Investment increased behind the global Smirnoff, Be There campaign as the brand continues to offer consumers unforgettable experiences across the globe.</p>
          <p>Marketing spend increased over 35% on Captain Morgan, focused on its heartland of North America and on growth opportunities in Europe, behind the signature serve with Cola and the campaign of Got a little Captain in You?.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we invested where we saw opportunities emerged by market or by category. For example, Guinness investment was increased in Africa, up 8%, strengthening the brands equity and supporting the brands premium price positioning in Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana.</p>
          <p>Let me now show you two specific examples. In the second half, we increased global spend behind Captain Morgan by over 75%. The brand is the fastest growing spirit in the impact top 20. Its growing share in the United States and momentum is increasing internationally.</p>
          <p>This year, the brand grew net sales over 40% in Europe and we launched it into several markets in Latin America. In F '11 we will begin to test the brand in Asia. Even in the more difficult environment of Europe, we have to step change the trajectory of the brand in Northern European markets, especially Germany.</p>
          <p>We took the North American growth drivers that we know work, and applied them in Europe. Non-working spend was minimized and utilization of existing assets maximized. The majority of the spend was behind the campaign of Got a little Captain in You?, driving awareness of the brand and communicating the personality of the Captain. Supported by Captain and Cola the promotions in the on and off-trade during the football world cup, net sales doubled and made a significant contribution to the growth of the brand globally.</p>
          <p>And secondly, an example of where we invested behind a specific growth opportunity as the travel retail channel recovered from the global economic recession, we invested behind this momentum, in particular, behind Johnnie Walker Black Label.</p>
          <p>In the first half, the 100 year anniversary program was activated at scale, resulting in massive visibility in store and grabbing the interest of the consumers at point of purchase.</p>
          <p>We activated the Walk with Giants campaign in over 50 airports in the second half. Much of this activation is centered around our Grand Prix Sponsorship. Images of Louis Hamilton created an engaging brand story at the point of purchase. Executions in Abu Dhabi and Singapore at Changi airport were recognized as best-in-class for the travel retail industry.</p>
          <p>Investment in duty-free drived both domestic sales in developing markets and the increase in spend behind activations in Shanghai airport was a key driver of the growth in Johnnie Walker in China in the second half. The results were clear. GTME sold 1 million cases of Black Label. It's best year ever. And the brand is again the number one deluxe scotch in travel retail. With momentum that can continue into this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Innovation has provided us with significant net sales growth again this year. As consumer behaviors change, innovation provides customers and consumers with new products and formats. Our approach is simple, to innovate primarily within our core brands, finding opportunities quickly, but founded on deep consumer and shopper insights.</p>
          <p>The breadth of our brand range provides us with a competitive advantage in doing this. This approach is focused on four key areas. In developing markets, improving accessibility can be a powerful growth driver. In Africa, for example, innovation around can beer and premix spirit has brought out brands to new consumers and into new occasions.</p>
          <p>In developed markets, we used innovation to broaden our offering, and maintain consumer interest. Flavored innovation across our vodka brands in North America and Europe is a great example of how this works.</p>
          <p>We're also successfully innovating against the increasing trend for home consumption in these markets. We use innovation to bring premium offering to consumers who continue to desire the quality assurances of our brands, but are looking for something new.</p>
          <p>The Super Deluxe Johnnie Walker innovation that we've introduced are a great example, but Crown Royal Black in the US and Old Parr Superior in Latin America are also enjoying success in the premium and super premium segments. And finally, we sustained innovations through the coordinated transfer from the innovation team to the in-market team, so that innovations prosper in the long-term.</p>
          <p>The concept of our entry level single malt whisky, the Singleton was developed by the innovation team four years ago. A successful transition to the in-market teams has led to its position as the world's fastest growing single malt.</p>
          <p>This year, we have significantly up-weighted our focus on our customer marketing capabilities. We now have 500 people across 30 countries dedicated to customer marketing. The result is closer, strategically focused relationships with our key customers, both retailers and distributors both on-premise and off-trade.</p>
          <p>We're now engaging with each of our customers at every level in their organization, from our regional presidents to our regional sales people to agree the outcomes that we are going to target for the year.</p>
          <p>We partnered with our customers to make it easier for shoppers to find, choose and buy brands in the category. We delivered a large number of multi-brand and category events in addition to our single brand activity.</p>
          <p>Some of these were market specific like the Summer Spirits Campaign in Great Britain, others like the Whisky Festival who are global.</p>
          <p>The result is that our share of shelve is improving, with for example share of 1.5 percentage points in the US off-trade. And as you can see from this slide, our sales with the biggest off trade customers is out pacing our competitors.</p>
          <p>Our investment in customer marketing is providing our customers with growth opportunities, which were increasingly moving away from traditional price driven activations. We recently surveyed on-trade customer in our top 20 markets. Today we have received results from 14 markets, and in 12 of them, Diageo is rated as the number one supplier today on trade.</p>
          <p>It's an amazing accolade and the results of our work to provide targeted on-trade solutions, such as the example from Ireland on this slide. Diageo's scale, geographic reach and brand range position us well to develop customer marketing as our key sales driver in F'11.</p>
          <p>In the developed markets, the microenvironment was challenging with fragile economic recovery and weak consumer confidence, and net sales declined 2% in fiscal 2010. I couldn't do a lot about the economy, but I could ensure that our businesses were in good shape.</p>
          <p>In North America, we increased marketing to strengthen our core brands; Smirnoff, Captain Morgan and Johnnie Walker. Innovation had its best year ever. Diageo delivered over half of the new product launches in the US spirits, as we premiumized our brands and broadened our consumer appeal. As a result, our priority brands grew share, both in volume and value.</p>
          <p>Europe was once again the most challenging region. In a flat beverage alcohol market in Great Britain, we strengthened our relations with the increasingly important off-trade retailers, where Diageo's spirits brands grew 18%, and the category, 6%.</p>
          <p>The Irish market remained a single digit decline and we again grew share of beer and spirits. Guinness has grown share in the on-trade every month for the past 2.5 years with great campaigns such as the 250th Celebration.</p>
          <p>Southern Europe was particularly tough. Though the rate of decline in Spain has eased, the on-trade remains depressed. However, our innovations tailored to new at-home occasions are performing well in an off-trade that's now growing.</p>
          <p>The developed markets of Asia Pacific also experienced some category weakness. However, we maintained our leadership of spirits in our two largest markets through increasing marketing spend on Windsor in Korea and Smirnoff in Australia.</p>
          <p>The developing markets of the world were again our growth engine, up 11% in the year. These markets now represent a third of our net sales. The market fundamentals for the future are positive. High population growth, rising personal affluence and the large increase in the number of middle-class consumers who aspire to our brands.</p>
          <p>We have strong exposure to all the developing regions in key categories, scotch in Latin America, Russia and Asia, and Beer in Africa. In Latin America, we have well established roots to market and leading brands. We're investing strongly behind scotch to develop new categories such as vodka.</p>
          <p>In Africa, we've iconic Lager brands together with the non-alcoholic Malta Guinness. Guinness remains the only true pan-African beer brand with strong equity and a significant price premium. In the South Africa, we operate across all beverage alcohol categories. We generate consumer insights to direct our targeted marketing programs. Our investment behind our scotch brands in the year has positioned us well as the economy starts to improve. Through the Brandhouse joint venture, we have now over 18% share of beverage alcohol, up 1.5 percentage points from last year.</p>
          <p>In China, Johnnie Walker, Black Label, the heart of our business there, grew strongly and gained share on the back of a significantly increased marketing spend. In Russia, we are the leader in scotch and the growth we delivered throughout the second half gives us confidence that the momentum will continue.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our investment in developing market, building our routes to market in Vietnam, India, Angola and Tanzania to take advantages of the future opportunities of these markets.</p>
          <p>It is worth spending some time looking at our performance by category. Challenges and opportunities varied, but this plays to Diageo's strength, the range of our brands across categories. We have strong global brands carefully built over many years, complimented by brands which have resonance with consumers at the local market level.</p>
          <p>In Scotch, Johnnie Walker grew strongly gaining share in many of its largest developing markets, as well as in the United States. Our category approach positions brands alongside Johnnie Walker to appeal some consumer in a different way, either through a different price point such as White Horse in Russia or with a different proposition, for example, with Buchanan's Leave a Legacy message in Latin America.</p>
          <p>The Vodka category has been competitive in most markets, especially in the price range at which Smirnoff is positioned. However, our super and ultra premium vodkas remained in strong growth with Ketel One vodka, up 5% and Ciroc, up 46%. You saw the strength of Captain Morgan earlier; in addition Zacapa, contributed to the performance of the category and to the growth of our reserve brand portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our Beer brands had another strong year. The performance of local brands in Africa drove our 5% net sales growth, while Guinness outperformed in tougher European markets. Our customers think in terms of categories, but we have the brand range to work with them by category.</p>
          <p>This year we've taken significant steps to improve the efficiency of our organization. The global restructuring program that we've announced last year is now complete and has delivered a leaner cost base, which will benefit the business in F'11.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we've addressed key areas of our supply base to ensure that our production cost remain competitive in to the future. In Roseisle, we invested a further 40 million to build additional capacity and reduce distilling cost.</p>
          <p>High quality spare site malt for our blends will be available from 2012. The consolidation bottling into two sides, the expansion of our grain distilling capacity in Cameronbridge will also delivered significant cost benefits from 2011.</p>
          <p>In Ireland, we're consolidating kegging operations from Kilkenny, Dundalk and Waterford into St James's Gate, which will benefit our cost base by &#x20AC;20 million annually once completed in 2011.</p>
          <p>In North America, we've reorganized our wine business. The sale in leaseback in Napa Valley, released capital, while the rationalization of brands and the reorganization improved focus and margins.</p>
          <p>We've now passed the halfway stage in the construction of the new rum distillery in the US Virgin Islands on schedule. It will be operational by January next year and the distillery will supply the rum for Captain Morgan in the United States transforming the economics of the brand for us with improved COGS and financing higher marketing spend.</p>
          <p>Before we take your questions, let me summarize what we've covered this morning. In North America, our restructuring program has enhanced our focus on the key brands and improved margins. Increased investment behind proven marketing campaigns and behind innovation has led to share gains in the year and does position as well for F'11.</p>
          <p>Europe delivered a robust performance in a tough environment. We enhanced our customer marketing capabilities and put ruthless focused behind our marketing and the result were share gains and a business capable of out-performance in the coming year.</p>
          <p>International is again the growth engine of our business, strong brand positions together with our well-established routes-to-market will continue to drive growth in these advantage markets for the short and the long-term.</p>
          <p>And in Asia-Pacific, we've up-weighted our focus on scotch, gaining share across the region. We've invested in new markets and strengthened our routes to market. Each of the steps we've taken enhances our business and will benefit our F'11 performance.</p>
          <p>We've controlled our costs, built our brand marketing and customer marketing skills and increased our investment in our brands and the developing markets. We therefore finish the year with more confidence and our guidance for F'11 is that we will improve on the growth in organic operating profit, which we delivered in F'10.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm joined by my colleagues, and we'll take your questions, if you could open the lines operator. And if you are asking a question, please mention your institution and your name. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our first question for today comes from Mitch Collett from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Mitch Collett from Goldman Sachs. I'd just like to ask about your guidance. Is that predicated on essentially no recovery in the US still difficult trading conditions in Europe and such strong trading in international and Asia? And secondly you mentioned that the new facility in the US Virgin Islands will transform the Captain Morgan. Perhaps you could give a bit more color on what that means. Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Mitch, I'll ask Ivan to speak in a moment to the Captain Morgan distillery. But, first of all, our guidance. Guidance is made up of two elements. Clearly, our confidence in the business, the fact that we have had record cash generation, very strong market share gains gives us confidence in our business. That's why we are accelerating the rate of dividend increase. However, we also have to accept that the world is still somewhat uncertain, and it's very hard to call at the moment.</p>
          <p>We are confident that no matter what the global economy delivers to us, we will perform well. However, the rate of improvement will condition the rate of momentum that we can build upon the growth rate that we reported last year. Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On Captain Morgan, as you know this is a fast growing and a very important brand for us in the US. We have entered into a very unique partnership with the US Virgin Islands, whereby we are investing and building a state-of-the-art distillery there. And we'll be sourcing in about 18 months rum from the Virgin Islands in the future.</p>
          <p>And with that, we get a significantly improved economics, which will enable us to invest behind the brand more strongly, thereby driving growth for the Captain Morgan brand, as well as benefiting the US Virgin Islands, which needs the economic support and development.</p>
          <p>So, it's a real win-win partnership. We're excited about it. The distillery is nearly two-thirds or 80% of the way through. It's absolute state-of-the-art, and the partnership is working very well for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jamie Isenwater from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions, probably for Ivan and Nick, the first one in terms of North America, there's obviously a big step up in innovation activity. I was just wondering whether there was an inventory build that benefited the second half on the back of that or whether we should expect something to come through in the first half of this year. The second question for Nick is on Venezuela. If we assume no new change to the currency rates and just annualize the current rates, what sort of impact should we expect in the first half of the current year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ivan, you want to do the innovation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. If you look at our innovation track record in North America over the last three years, we've steadily had a significant impact every year. As Paul indicated, fiscal '10 was a terrific year for us. We had a very strong second half. But I would say the inventory position in the marketplace is really no different than it has been from prior years. For example, Ciroc Flavors, which have been tremendously successful as they went into the second half, we had a great success, but that momentum is continuing as we start the new fiscal. So, overall I'd say the inventory levels are normal and in line with our pipeline planning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Venezuela, unfortunately is not a simple answer, because when you say sort of annualize the current rate that opens up the question about what rate. Because as you know in Venezuela, for long time, there has been an official rate and there has been a market rate. Those have moved significantly over the course of time. But at the moment, you might say there is actually only the official rate, because there is swap market is effectively closed. And, as we said in the results, we've used the official rate in translating the second half of last year; that's 4.3 bolivars to the dollar.</p>
          <p>What you saw in the market before the market closed, obviously was a very different rate, but moving around all the time. In predicting, therefore and guiding what's going to happen in Venezuela, I think we have to be very clear with you, there are number of factors at work here.</p>
          <p>One is indeed the exchange rate and various people will have a view as to where that is moving. The second is, there are some restrictions even on the amount of currency that you can buy, as somebody kind of importing product into Venezuela as all kind of scotch players are. And then thirdly, there is the factor for us, which actually is helpful to us that we have a very large kind of domestic business in Venezuela. So the answer to your question maybe actually a bigger combination of factor than what is the rate?</p>
          <p>In giving the guidance, I think we can tell you that we've tried to assess the whole range of outcomes and possibilities, and certainly in organic terms, organic profit terms or changes to our organic profit from any of those components, that's all taken account of in our guidance i.e., at the moment in organic terms, we're going to see, we think, a material impact in organic terms.</p>
          <p>In reported terms, it's a question of what rates do you think or what rate might we see on the translation, and that's why we've taken the rather unusual step of giving in the release the actual profit we make in bolivars in Venezuela, it's about VEB450 million. Because frankly, you'll probably, at least as good as me at picking a rate that we're going to see in the marketplace in the next six months, and you can translate that bolivar amount based on the rate that you see.</p>
          <p>So, I'm afraid that's a kind of rather long and more complicated answer to what was a very simple question. I think it is that complicated, right now in Venezuela. I think perhaps the simple bottom line is, in giving you the guidance we've given, particularly for the full year, but it would be true to the half year as well. We don't right now see it being a material enough impact that it would affect our guidance. This is a moving feast, I'm sure we will be updating you throughout the year. But it is a meld of all those components, not just what rate do you choose to use on translation. But at the moment, we're saying not a material enough impact to change our guidance.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, one regarding an update on the outlook for 2011 for South Africa for both beer and spirits. Then secondly, any update on the likelihood of a share repurchase over the next fiscal year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me take the question on share repurchase or delivering cash back to shareholders, which is a broader issue and then maybe Stewart you can cover South Africa. First of all, we feel very good about our cash generation track record, and certainly in the year that we're reporting on that performance has been stepped up. So we have a high quality issue to discuss here.</p>
          <p>The confidence in our business allows us to accelerate the rate of dividend increase to 6% and we've said that is the start point for the fiscal year that we've just entered. We recognized that if things play out as we expect will to do, we will have more firepower. And therefore the debate between a further dividend increase beyond the 6% or we starting the share repurchase, is a debate that we will have at the Board level as we progress through the fall and we will update the market accordingly.</p>
          <p>But we do want to see how events pan out, but we are confident, and we believe that this is a high quality issue to be debating. Stuart?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On South Africa, obviously in FY'10 despite the very difficult market environment, were very pleased to continue to see volume growth, NSV growth and continue to increase our A&amp;P ahead of our NSV growth. And we did that because we believe we have an incredibly strong portfolio there. As you know and have said covering beer, spirits and indeed ready-to-drink and in all three of those categories we did well, in spirits and in beers specifically the two categories you asked about.</p>
          <p>We continue to grow share in FY'10, and indeed we believe the platform that we've have built with our brands and indeed across the whole category play that we have there, sets us well to continue to both perform well and grow share in FY'11. There is no doubt, however, the market is incredibly competitive, particularly in beer. But even in that competitive environment, we are continuing to see very good share growth and we're very pleased with the portfolio and the whole partnership there is working well for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add to that. It's interesting to reflect that we've now got 18.5% market share in South Africa. Five years ago, it was minuscule. It's a very strong partnership, and I think it is a model that not only will serve us as well in South Africa, but there are other markets where we can apply this.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the Trevor Stirling at Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Three questions please, the first one for Stuart. Stuart exceptionally strong performance internationally second half. If my numbers are right, organic sales up 20% and organic operating profit up 40% in the second half. Can you just give a bit more color on what's driving that huge increase in organic margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's take them one at time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Trevor, good morning. You're right. It was a very, very strong second half. Like most businesses, in the first half, we were somewhat impacted by the rather late cycle of the economic impact flowing through to international markets, so our second half actually was cycling a pretty poor, in relative terms, second half of the previous fiscal. So, we had some good comps that we were cycling. However, beyond that, we did step up our investments significantly behind our brands in Latin America, in Africa and in global travel in Middle East. And in fact the biggest growth benefits that we had were really in global travel in the Middle East and in Latin America in the second half.</p>
          <p>And that was pretty broad based, both across markets and indeed brands and categories. So, really it would be inappropriate than unreasonable to pick out one particular brand, one particular category or one country, because it really was very broad based in Latin America. Global travel Middle East, as Paul described in the presentation, some tremendous lift there from returning travelers, but also from the new marketing approach that we took we took with airport operators and retailers together to create shopping and drinking experiences for travelers.</p>
          <p>And in Africa, we continued to see great growth, particularly through beer innovation. So, it really was very broad based, but we were cycling poorer comps obviously in the previous half. So, that's what gave rise to that very significant NSV growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing that's very interesting in the second half is we saw an acceleration &#x2013; in fact, a return to quite healthy growth rates in our reserve brand portfolio certainly that benefited from some of spirits markets, but it was broader than that. So what was a decline in the first half in our higher end reserve portfolio reserved and we saw in fact I think 6% total growth in reserve brands in the second half, and that clearly will help margin. Your second question Trevor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, second question is probably one for Ivan. In the US Ivan, you've had to take price cuts on many of your brands. Price promotion intensity has risen through fiscal year '010. As you look into fiscal year '011, what's the environment for pricing? You've talked in the possibility of a price increase in October, and do you think that the promotion intensity might actually decrease through fiscal year '011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trevor, I'll give you just three points to this, because we obviously are looking and managing this very closely. The first is the external environment, which as you know, is still uncertain. And we look at consumer confidence, unemployment and the strength of the on-premise, all three indicators &#x2013; the on-premise is a little better. Consumer confidence and unemployment is still tough.</p>
          <p>The second thing is the industry mix is improving a bit. If you look at the last couple of quarters and even in our business, we are actually seeing the return to growth in the super and ultra premium end of the business. Our reserve business, for example, was up 9% this year in the US.</p>
          <p>The third thing is we've stepped up the investment behind marketing in our brands. And I guess what gives me the most confidence in terms of where the business is right now is the equity on our priority brands is improving. We've got proven campaigns and we've stepped up the spending behind it.</p>
          <p>As you look at F'11, given what I am seeing right now, I expect most of our benefits to come through in improved mix. But we are going to be poised to take pricing as we see some more sustained confidence in the marketplace. We're not yet there, but I would see mix is probably the key driver in terms of improvement in fiscal '11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I also think that you saw promotional intensity eased in the second half &#x2013; and maybe you want to speak about it Andy, if you look at our brands, relative to their categories, we have maintained our price position, if not enhanced it throughout this period, Andy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's true Trevor. If you look at the individual brands in each category compared to the nearest rival, and we're either at the same gap whether its premium, or we've widened it during the course of the last year. So that coupled with the investment, Ivan talked about, and the innovation program, gives us a lot of confidence as we look forward into F11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And our brand equity scores are very, very strong. So, okay, Trevor, thank you. Next question.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I've got three questions, please, two to follow up on Trevor's questions regarding the US. First of all, is it a fair assumption then, based on what you're saying that price mix for North America will be positive overall in fiscal '011 even if we weren't to see headline prices?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you just confirm that the innovation that you're launching in the US and have launched is mix accretive to your portfolio. Then my third question is regarding A&amp;P as a percentage of net sales stepped up to 14.5% for fiscal '010. Have you done most of the heavy lifting in terms of the rebasing there? And how should we be thinking about the year on year increase into fiscal '011? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe if I take the third question first and then Ivan you can speak to the US profile. I don't know whether its heavy lifting. We have increased our investment in the second half as we said we would. And I believe that if the momentum continues to come through, I could see us continuing that trend i.e. A&amp;P will advance at a modest rate ahead of sales growth.</p>
          <p>As I've said, our brand equities are strong. We are very encouraged by the delivery of some of the growth drivers and therefore it makes eminent sense to invest behind them. So, to your point Melissa, I would say expect A&amp;P to grow slightly faster than top line sales. Ivan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Melissa, I would say we are looking at price mix improving in F'11, and mostly, as I said earlier, through mix. On your point on innovation, it's interesting. If you look at our innovation profile, actually we're having some of the biggest success and impact at the Super Premium and Ultra Premium end of the portfolio. Ciroc Flavors have been a tremendous success and are really going exceptionally well. Ketel One, we did a line extension again going very well.</p>
          <p>And then the biggest success in new products in the US right now is the Crown Royal Black. Now that's a product that's at a $5 premium to Crown Royal. And so to your point, innovation we manage very closely to ensure sustainability as well as ensuring we are improving our price mix &#x2013; accretiveness of the profile of innovation. And we managed that pipeline very tightly. So I am pleased actually through a tough economic environment with the focus of innovation successes we've had in Super and Ultra Premium.</p>
          <p>The last point, which Paul touched on, if you look at &#x2013; we have stepped up our A&amp;P reinvestment as you know in fiscal '10. I would expect us to improve it slightly going into fiscal '11 as well, because we've got confidence in marketing campaigns and we have confidence in the innovation pipeline. So, I certainly want to retain the past year of maintaining and investing ahead of NSV growth in the US over the next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Simon Hales from Evolutions Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen, Simon Hales from Evolution. Three questions if I can, maybe firstly, just sticking with the US. Given the fragility of the consumer, I wonder if you've had any comments or any discussions you maybe had with your wholesalers recently, and are we at risk potentially Paul, that we could see a potential period of further destocking in the wholesale chain or do you think that's not going to be the case as far as you see things right now?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of cost savings you talked quite a bit about the further cost savings to come on the supply chain side. My understanding was the majority of those savings were going to really come in fiscal 2012. Can you give me an idea of the level of synergies you do expect to flow through in F'011?</p>
          <p>And then finally just on the associate contribution of Moet Hennessey, it looked a little bit weaker than I and the market were expecting. Is there something in that that we've missed? Obviously, there's a strong pick up in the second half organically for the group, but it still looked in absolute terms, pretty weak for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe Nick can take the cost saving question. Let me try and answer the issue around Moet Hennessey.</p>
          <p>The softness in the MH numbers was clearly led by Champagne. We saw sales as we always do at times of economic weakness, suffer quite markedly. They have started to come back, but that trajectory is in its early days of formation, and therefore calling it is difficult. But that's the main reason why you saw some softness in the MH numbers.</p>
          <p>Regarding the US, I was recently with some of our distributors, and maybe Ivan, you want to add to this in a moment. But I am not sensing any degree of expectation that we're going to be in for another round of inventory reduction.</p>
          <p>There are encouraging signs in the US. If you look at footholds at restaurants, it's up slightly. You've already heard that if you look at sort of price per bottle, you look at the Nielsen data, the mix is improving, it's a little bit better. I feel better today about the US than I felt a year ago.</p>
          <p>All that said, I don't believe the US is going to snap back, and I think we are in for a period of recovery, but I think it will be a gentle recovery. I don't expect it to fall down either. I actually have a lot of confidence in the US consumer. But that's my perspective. And certainly, talking to our distributors, that's kind of where they are, too.</p>
          <p>Ivan, would you add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's it Simon. The stock levels we expect to stay stable, both at wholesale and retail level. We've come through a couple of years of some stock adjustments, particularly at retail, but I think we're at the level now where, going forward, we expect them to stay stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final point is that no matter what the economy gives us, we will outperform.</p>
          <p>Nick, on cost savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, cost savings. Simon, you will recall that we've essentially got three programs sort of running.</p>
          <p>The first was the major, what I'll call, overhead structural changes across the whole business that was going to generate about 120 million of cost savings. That is pretty much done and in place. Then, on top of that we had some changes to our Irish operations, and then the Scottish supply footprint. Those are the major programs.</p>
          <p>In total, I think we signaled about 180 to 185 million of savings, some of that through cost of goods, most of it through the overheads line. You can assume the first 120 is done and the remaining balance to get us up to 180 or 185 will come through this year and next year, and I think, probably broadly, a reasonable 50/50 split.</p>
          <p>So we should well be done by F'12. The supply changes always take a bit longer to get through. We are well on track to realize all of those savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, thank you. Just going back to your comments on the US, I wonder Ivan, can you give us a flavor for the momentum in the US business, as you exit the year, going into the new fiscal year, i.e. what sort of growth rate in sales were you delivering in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, if you look at our results H1 versus H2, it gives you a good indication of the improvement that's happened in H2.</p>
          <p>But I would draw your attention to the brand performance that's in the press release, when you look at the share performance in each of the categories and brands. Our premium plus portfolio, which is where we make more than 70% of our profits, has good momentum. We're outperforming the industry in value and volume. And I actually feel very good about the improving brand equity, the strength of the innovation program, and additional spending that we're putting behind marketing.</p>
          <p>So I would expect the premium plus portfolio to continue to outperform, and that's very much a posture we're taking to the marketplace into FY'11.</p>
          <p>What's hard to predict is indeed the consumer side of it. And I think, until we start seeing the US consumer &#x2013; both in unemployment and confidence terms &#x2013; begin to improve, I suspect the industry is still going to stay at about same sluggish rate as it's been in F'10.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Antoine Belge from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Antoine Belge from HSBC. Three questions.</p>
          <p>First of all, could you perhaps elaborate a little bit on Western Europe, especially which are the countries that are worrying you at the moment and which ones are perhaps doing better.</p>
          <p>Then, on the cost of goods, I understand that it should be flat next year. Can you comment specifically on input costs separately.</p>
          <p>And finally, it seemed that in the second half, the price mix effect in Asia slightly deteriorated compared to the first half. So first of all, can you confirm that that was the case? And if so, what is the reason for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's interesting you folks always have three questions. Maybe you can make it two.</p>
          <p>Andrew, you want to talk about Western Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd love to, yes. Antoine, we have some contrasting situations in the Western Europe as I am sure you know. The markets in Ireland and Spain remained particularly tough, although the levels of decline are tapering off a little bit. We've got declines in Ireland in the beer market, the long alcoholic drinks markets, as we call it, of 4 to 5%. And in Spain, particularly in the on-trade, it's still down about 8%. But those numbers are gradually reducing. I don't expect a big change in that going into the coming fiscal and calendar years.</p>
          <p>The other issue we have of course is Greece, where the excise increases have resulted in the price of a bottle of international spirit going from about &#x20AC;12 up now to &#x20AC;18. And if you add to that the decline in discretionary income, which has come from increases in direct taxation for Greek consumers, clearly that's having a big impact. So, we are looking for declines in volumes in Greece in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Set against that, as you know, we've had a particularly good year in the UK, and we are seeing recovery in Russia. I think in the UK it's a very small growth in the total market, but what we've been able to do is to take advantage of the growth at-home consumption. So we've got a very successful year in the off-trade, where we've gained 2.5 points of share of the total spirits market. We now have in excess of 25% of the spirits market in the off-trade in the UK, and that's come from working much more collaboratively with our biggest off-trade grocery customers.</p>
          <p>We've also had a 20% growth in our wine business in the UK, which is largely about the Blossom Hill brand, but we've also taken on a couple of new distribution deals in our wine business.</p>
          <p>But really the strength of our UK business comes from our big spirits brands, working together as a category, working with the retailers, partnering with retailers to grow the category for them and to grow our market share within that category.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we continue to gain share with Guinness in the UK. We're now up to our highest ever share of Guinness of around 8% of the total beer market, with the number two beer of any kind in the South of England. So that continues to be a very positive story for us. So I do think that success can continue in the GB market.</p>
          <p>In Russia, I think most commentators now have sort of taken GDP forecast down to around 4 to 5% for the next sort of 18 months. That fits pretty well with what we're seeing in sales trends. If you add some pricing, which we are getting in Russia, I can see sales upward sort of high single-digit growth versus prior year. And that's the sort of planning number that we're using for the coming year.</p>
          <p>And broadly speaking, those upsides in the UK and in Russia offset the downsides in those tougher markets in South Europe and Ireland. So, it's pretty much a balance looking forward unless something changes economically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the performance in GB and our market share performance has been outstanding. And the work that we've done on a pan-European basis with our major retailers I think is also going to serve us well. And the share performance for Scotch in Russia &#x2013; we're playing from a very, very strong platform.</p>
          <p>Nick, on COGS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On COGS, obviously that sort of net realized COGS year-over-year is a factor of two or three things &#x2013; input cost prices, efficiency programs that are always running through our supplier operation, and frankly, procurement negotiation, which is always going on. And so the fact that we had pretty much zero COGS last year and expect zero COGS next year doesn't imply of course that all input prices are at zero.</p>
          <p>Last year, I think, was a particularly good year in terms of procurement and procurement efficiencies, procurement negotiation. I think our procurement team did a fantastic job.</p>
          <p>The biggest battles they're up against I would say were again glass. Glass plus prices definitely were rising last year, somewhat a function of capacity constraints within the industry, et cetera.</p>
          <p>We had a relatively benign year last year in terms of things like milk prices, grain prices and some energy prices. This year, I actually see that switching round a bit. We are already seeing pressure on grain prices. Actually, glass &#x2013; I think through some long-term contract negotiation, we're going to be in a better position.</p>
          <p>So a little bit of a switch going on between last year and this year, but still, over and above that, some of the supply footprint changes will bring COGS efficiency. And of course, we always expect the procurement team to earn their salary in terms of negotiation.</p>
          <p>So a little bit of a switch. Then overlying all of that, of course, is what have got in terms of hedging in place. On some of those key commodities, we do hedge a proportion of our exposure out about 12 months, and the good news right now is, against major grain contracts, we are reasonably well hedged. And so the kind of nervousness that you were seeing in the market around that particular input set of prices, we're actually reasonably immunized from.</p>
          <p>So that's a kind of trends that are going on I would say year-to-year right now in input prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gilbert, do you want to cover the Asia Pac mix issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Antoine, regarding the price mix issue in the second half in Asia Pacific, this is mainly driven by a combination of market and category.</p>
          <p>The growth came from Southeast Asia markets, where we trade through third partly distributors &#x2013; and obviously our margins are different and lower with the party distributors &#x2013; and also came from the pricing pressure on RTD in Australia.</p>
          <p>Overall, we need to take into consideration that we have improved our gross margin by 80 basis points for the full-year. I think this is something that we can also replicate and maintain in F '11.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Chris Pitcher from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Chris Pitcher from Redburn. A follow-up question on your currency guidance. Would you be able to give the transaction rates that you're using for F'11 for both dollar and euro, and whether given current rates, we should expect a transaction negative in F'012?</p>
          <p>Then as a sort of follow on to the currency and the Venezuelan issue, it looks like you put through a 21% price increase in Venezuela, which has added about three points growth I think to international, and almost 1% of the group level. If Venezuela devalues again, will you continue to treat these price increases as organic?</p>
          <p>Then, final question on GB. Second half price mix looks to have gone significantly negative, and I appreciate that you had growth in premix in the off trade and some discounting, et cetera. I just wanted to be reassured whether if we see continued negative price mix in the European region as we've seen in the second half that you can still hold profitability stable with the cost savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to take that one, Andrew, and then Nick can come back <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There are a couple of reasons for price mix issue in the UK and that gross margin dilution. The main one is channel mix. It's essentially the move of consumption at-home and away from out-of-home, and that's going to continue for the whole industry, I think, as far forward as we can see.</p>
          <p>Second one is I already mentioned we had a lot of growth in our wine business. That is not as profitable as our spirits business. So, just growth in that business does have an impact on product mix, if you like. And then also there's been a bit of trading down, that's more in Southern Europe, moving into own label &#x2013; in places like Spain and obviously Greece, people are trading down to.</p>
          <p>So those are, if you like, to some extent, structural. What we are kind of doing about that is being proactive about how we improve the mix, and mostly that's in product mix. So, like in the US our innovation portfolio is very strategic. It's set up against the way consumer needs and behaviors are changing, but also it's set up to improve our profitability. So we're not introducing innovations which are not significantly more profitable than existing brands in those particular categories. So that's one way that we look to offset it.</p>
          <p>Another way in Europe is to invest in Russia quite frankly, which is our single most profitable market. So, every case I sell in Russia improves my country mix very significantly, given that that's where the growth is as well. So it's a no brainer for us to continue to invest behind our Russian business.</p>
          <p>We then have the whole area of our trade turns and our promotional spend. And we've been finding, year-on-year-on-year, ways to improve the efficiency of our trade spend right across Western Europe in particular. So either reducing the level of spend or actually getting more growth from the spend that we have in partnership with the trade. So direct delivery from those promotional investments into stuff that actually drive sales growth and market share.</p>
          <p>So this is really about us offsetting the some of the structural issues that we've got on product mix and channel mix with initiatives that will improve our profitability, both at gross margin &#x2013; that is a little easier, as you suggest, at operating margin, because we've got the A&amp;P and the overhead lines to play with. We're keeping a very, very tight control in Europe as you expect on the overhead line.</p>
          <p>I am looking to try to improve our percentage of sales of the A&amp;P line in the coming year. So if we don't have further sort of problems that we haven't anticipated maybe in Southern Europe, then we will be looking to start to restore some of the spend that we took out in the first half of last year on the A&amp;P line. So that's not going to be hopefully an area that we go to for cuts.</p>
          <p>So it's about offsetting the structural issues that we've got mostly from channel mix.</p>

          <p>Just on the point of the Irish and Scottish supply savings, those savings will be spread across the end markets where supply goes to. You're not getting a disproportionally high share of that residual 60 million?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On currency, very quickly, our guidance on currency is a composite against all of the rates that we deal with &#x2013; transaction and translation. So, let me just stick to the dollar because it's by far the biggest. Otherwise we will be here all morning.</p>
          <p>This year we've just closed, the translation rate was about 1.57, the transaction rate was about 1.67. So the bulk of the improvement that we're anticipating in our guidance is coming from transaction. In fact, the average rate we're expecting on transaction next year is pretty close to where we are right now, i.e., mid-1.50s. So you'll get quite a lot of benefit transaction, relatively little on translation, if we stay where we are.</p>
          <p>The good news about that, of course, is on transaction, where we are locked in, we pretty much know that we have that benefit. We don't know where translation will go over the course of the next year.</p>
          <p>So short answer, I guess Chris, is it's using rates that are pretty much where we are right now, because when we set the budget, this is sort of where we were. I know the dollar has been stronger, but it's now moved away again.</p>
          <p>So that's the dollar. You have to factor in all the other currencies, but the dollar is the biggest component.</p>
          <p>On Venezuela, I will make it a very short answer, because there may be other questions waiting. We're not planning to change, right now, the way we do our accounting for Venezuela, in terms of what goes into organic and what doesn't vis-&#xE0;-vis price increases, et cetera, et cetera. So the very short answer &#x2013; you may want to come back offline, if it's more detailed &#x2013; we are not planning to change the way we do the calculation right now.</p>

          <p>Yeah, good morning gentlemen. I guess there's quite a lot of us listening on the call thinking that the guidance that you've given us today looks pretty conservative, given the very positive comments we're hearing around the business as a whole. And I appreciate that there's some noise around the double-dip in the US.</p>
          <p>But one specific thing I wanted to ask about, I think Nick said earlier the 49 million additional corporate costs in H1 of FY'10. Now, one assumes that disappears in FY'11. So that basically gives you a starting growth of about 2% for FY'11 to start with doesn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ian, as always, I am reluctant just to pick out one particular point from the whole corporate section, or in fact any part of our results, because while you are absolutely right &#x2013; there may be some costs in there that maybe non-recurring &#x2013; there are also lots of other things that go into corporate, as you know like the residual FX impact, which may or may not go the same way.</p>
          <p>So if you were to just sort of pick out that one thing, then absolutely you may say and we're off to a helpful start there. But there may be lots of other things that go the other way, which is why when we give the guidance, it really as a composite of all sorts of things going both ways. And it's slightly unfair to just pick out one thing that might kind of in your words get us off to a good start.</p>
          <p>So, on that particular item, yeah, you're probably right. We shouldn't see that same negative impact, but we can probably compile a nice list for you of other things that will go the other way. So, we just have to be a little bit careful in leading it down the wrong path. If we say that goes away start with 2% plus, because there are a lot of other things, many of them in corporate, but not all of them that can go the other way as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the broader issue of guidance, Ian, first of all we offered guidance back in January, and we've delivered against that guidance. But the way that we've delivered it is probably quite different than how we expect to deliver when we offered it back in January. We had to contend with Greece, with Thailand, with Jamaica, with Venezuela, and I think that's the virtue of this business is we've got a lot of different levels by category, by country, by price point and you should expect us to be very agile in how we handle the problems that are thrown at us.</p>
          <p>Now, I do maintain that we have huge confidence in this business, and our actions around dividend, our market share positions demonstrate that. It's still an uncertain world out there and our guidance is predicated on that uncertainty. Having said that, we continue to see things get better in the developed markets and we hope that that trend continues, but you're always going to judge of that trend as we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Perhaps if I can just get one point of clarification. I think Nick talked about the interest charge, possibly being higher in FY'11 rather FY'10. I just wondered whether he was really referring to interest coupon. Presumably the interest charge itself will be down in FY'11 given the lower debt levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, absolutely the number to key off is the 4.8% affective interest rate we have this year, could that go up by couple of tens of point. I think it could, if we decide to take advantage of some great long-term rates that are in the marketplace right now. Offset against that absolutely, we should see average debt levels coming down. And therefore in terms of the net-net interest charge or perhaps even more importantly, the net-net finance charges in total, we should be in reasonably good shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much indeed.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Nico Lambrechts from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Paul, I have eight questions but I won't ask them all. First question is just, could you give us an indication of how growth would be balanced between the first half and second half?</p>
          <p>Obviously in third quarter, you had the big spike but that was just inventory coming back. So, on top line growth and EBIT, how should we expect the first half/second half split? In line with the comps or smoother than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're in slightly better shape in sales terms in the first half but then if you look at the second half, we did get a benefit in the year we're just reporting on from some restocking. Overall, I would think top line should be pretty balanced, Nick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's always unfortunate when you're comping against a year where you've had very different kind of half-year results. And as a business, we will tend to want to try and smooth those out. Operationally, it is a bit more difficult when you've got a sort of wild swing half-to-half. Whether to Paul's point, we can smooth it all out over the course of F'11, we'll have to look. It might take just a little longer to kind of get back to a more normalized pattern.</p>
          <p>But, I think broadly we do not want to replicate, just reverse the swing again in F'11. We have to try and get out of that. And so I think broadly, we're going to be trying head towards, particularly, at the top line, a much more even balance. The bottom line actually will be somewhat dependant on how we choose to phase our marketing spend.</p>
          <p>And a lot of that again is about the confidence we're seeing in the market place from the consumer, a lot of that will be about our confidence level in all of the programs we have, et cetera, et cetera. So, the EBIT line we probably have, a little bit more flexibility on, and you might see a little bit different. Top line, I think we're going to be wanting to try and get the business back to a smoother trajectory.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't like the profile last year any more than you did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the profile is what it is. Yeah, exactly, that was driven by the economic crisis, but ... so top line will be smoother. And we shouldn't take the comps as the base but the bottom line you might choose to have it more varied between the first and second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that will be very transparent through to A&amp;P spending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, excellent. Then Paul a second question; in your previous answer, you made it clear that you have many levers to pull and you do change them during the year. How do we think about the Diageo Group then? Because, over the last &#x2013; this year we've seen no operating leverage.</p>
          <p>And what I mean by that is the organic growth at top line and organic growth at the bottom line. In a downturn when you have down trading, you offset some of that negative impact by cutting A&amp;P and then the upswing that's reverse. Should we expect that the growth at the EBIT line is very similar to the top line for Diageo with the current portfolio, regards mix going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually think in raw terms, Nico, you should see improved leverage. If the trends we talked about around reserve brands, around higher price points per bottle if those all sustain themselves and we think they will, then you should get operating leverage coming through. However, if we see the opportunity to invest in A&amp;P, we will do that too, and therefore that may offset some of that operating leverage. But all that will be very transparent in the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly my question. If there is up trading, you will get positive operating leverage, but you control the decision to increase A&amp;P. Will you increase A&amp;P, i.e. then offset operating leverage? That's the message I just got from your answer in a certain extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the success we are seeing with some of our brands, if I see the momentum building on that top line, we will invest behind that success.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then final question, on the dividend. The financial health of the group is very very sound, refinancing rates are extremely attractive. What is the caution of the Board or management in not moving the dividend to grow in line with earnings? The other groups which have similar financial help, similar consumer companies do that. Why is it taking so long to move towards that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think it's taking that long, because originally in our statements, we've said we would re-look at our dividend policy for the fiscal year that we've just entered. I believe the Board in accelerating the increase to 6%. So, they were giving somewhat of helping hand to our investors based on the financial strengths that came through in the year we're reporting on, primarily the cash flow.</p>
          <p>As we move through the fall, we will revisit not only how much we can redistribute to shareholders, but what the form of that will be. But, the first priority is always to generate the cash. We've demonstrated we can do that. We now have the high quality issue of debating what we do with that. So, we think that we're giving our investors a bit more in the year that we've just closed out, and we've said that that is the starting point for the new fiscal year, and we recognized that we still have more firepower, and we'll report on how we will deploy that firepower in due time.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Operator. That was the last question. Now, before we close today, I do want to acknowledge the huge contribution that Nick has made to Diageo, not only in these results for fiscal 2010, but over more than a decade. The people on this call know better than most the strengths that Nick has brought to the role of CFO, and indeed, to Diageo.</p>
          <p>In addition, Nick is a great colleague and a friend to many here, and indeed, many in the business. So, we all wish Nick well, and indeed, we wish his family well to whom is very devoted. Nick, you said that you would miss us. We're certainly going to miss you.</p>
          <p>Thank you everybody, and I'll be meeting many of you one-on-one in the course of next week. Thank you very much.</p>
