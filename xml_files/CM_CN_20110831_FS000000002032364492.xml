        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Geoff, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me remind you that my comments this morning may contain forward-looking statements. Today, we reported our results for the third quarter. Net income was $808 million and cash earnings per share were $1.91. We are very pleased with these results. We reported higher revenues, an improved efficiency ratio and balanced performance across our three main operating businesses, Retail and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Wholesale Banking.</p>
          <p>Return on equity for the quarter was also strong at 21.5%. During the quarter, we announced a strategic investment in American Century Investments, a leading U.S.-based asset management company. This investment complements our strong Canadian asset management franchise and provides a platform for growth internationally in a business with attractive demographic and risk characteristics. We have now received all regulatory approvals for this transaction, which should close very shortly and is expected to be accretive to earnings by $0.15 per share in 2012.</p>
          <p>This quarter, CIBC's tangible common equity ratio increased to 11% from 10.6% in Q2. Our pro forma Basel III common equity ratio is estimated at 8.2%, exceeding the 2019 minimum standard of 7%. As previously announced, we completed the redemption of 400 million of preferred shares on July 31. Also, on August 17, we were pleased to announce that OSFI confirmed non-viable contingent capital treatment for approximately $900 million of convertible preferred shares. These actions optimize our long-term Basel III capital structure and fill in approximately 50% of the non-common Basel III Tier 1 capital requirements that are due by 2019.</p>
          <p>Our industry-leading Basel II Tier 1 ratio remains very strong at 14.6%. On the topic of dividends, the dividend payout ratio is between 40% to 50% of our earnings. Another quarter of strong earnings continue to put us within that target range. And as a result, we have announced a $0.03 per share increase to our common dividend today.</p>
          <p>Turning to our business results. Retail and Business Banking reported net income of $539 million, up 2% from a year ago. Revenue was $2 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2010. Loan losses were $285 million, in line with the same quarter last year. During the quarter, Retail and Business Banking continued to invest in providing greater access and choice for our clients. We were recognized by Global Finance Magazine as the Best in Mobile Banking among North American banks, the first time this award has been presented.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we introduced the CIBC Mobile Brokerage app, becoming the first bank to allow Canadian investors to execute trades using their mobile device. And we added Visa payWave, a contactless payment feature, on all newly issued and renewing credit cards in the Aerogold family as well as CIBC Classic credit card. David Williamson is here this morning to answer questions about our progress in Retail Business Banking.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management also performed well this quarter. Revenues up 12% from a year ago driven by growth in our Retail Brokerage and Asset Management businesses. We continue to experience strong sales and performance in our Mutual Fund business. Year-to-date long-term fund net sales of $3.2 billion are up $1.2 billion or 64% compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>We're very excited about our investment in American Century that will enhance the strength of our Wealth Management franchise by adding increased capabilities and scale. Victor Dodig is here this morning to answer questions about our progress in Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking continued to perform well this quarter, generating solid earnings with historically low levels of risk as reflected by our low VaR. Net income was $145 million. Excluding items of note, net income was $158 million. Wholesale Banking participated in a number of significant client transactions across our Capital Markets Investment Banking and Corporate Lending businesses.</p>
          <p>These included key roles advising on equity and debt offerings in the Financial Services and Communication sectors, corporate lending activity in the Energy sector, as well as mergers and activity &#x2013; mergers and acquisitions activity.</p>
          <p>Also this quarter, we were proactive in launching leading-edge technology capabilities to meet the needs of our clients. These investments will allow us to leverage our industry-leading strength and equities trading into other products such as foreign exchange while simultaneously strengthening risk management capabilities. Richard Nesbitt is here this morning to answer questions about our progress in wholesale banking.</p>
          <p>In summary, we are very pleased this quarter. We experienced balanced revenue growth, our cash efficiency ratio improved to 58.3%, our industry-leading return on equity increased to 21.5%, and our capital levels are strong, positioning us well for investing in our businesses looking forward. We also announced our investment in American Century which should close shortly. All of these strengths have allowed us to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.90 per share.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the meeting over to Kevin Glass for his financial review. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gerry. I'm going to refer to the slides that are posted on our Web site, starting with slide 5 which is a summary of results for the quarter. As Gerry mentioned, we reported strong results this quarter which were helped by higher Wholesale Banking revenue, volume growth in Retail and Business banking, as well as higher Wealth Management revenue, and it was hurt by lower Retail and Business Banking spreads.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share this quarter were at $1.89 or $1.91 on a cash basis. As listed on the top right of the slide, we had three items of note this quarter, the net impact of which nets to zero. The first item of note was a net gain of $0.06 per share due to a reduction in the general allowance. The next item, is a loss related to structured credit run-off, was a totaled $0.03 per share. And I'll provide more details on this in a few moments.</p>
          <p>The last item was related to the premium on redemption of preferred shares in the quarter. This had no impact on net income but it did reduce earnings per share by $0.03.</p>
          <p>As Gerry mentioned in his remarks, our capital position remains strong and we finished the third quarter with an industry-leading Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.6%. Our tangible common equity ratio was 11%.</p>
          <p>Slide 6 provides a summarized statement of operations on a reported basis showing net income for the quarter of $808 million. Last quarter, we announced changes to our organizational structure, whereby Wealth Management and International Retail Banking operations, including CIBC FirstCaribbean, will be separated from CIBC Retail Markets. This is the first quarter where results are reported on this basis.</p>
          <p>As a result of these changes, we now have three strategic business units: Retail and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Wholesale Banking along with Corporate and other.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our business results, let's start with Retail and Business Banking on slide 7. So, revenue for Retail and Business Banking in the quarter was $2 billion, up $57 million or 3% from the same quarter last year. Steady year-over-year revenue growth was supported by growth in each of the Personal and Business Banking segments.</p>
          <p>If we look at the results of the specific business lines on this slide, Personal Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was up $61 million or 4% from the same quarter last year due to solid volume growth in most products, as well as higher fees partially offset by narrower spreads due to the low-interest-rate environment and competitive pressure on mortgage and lending spreads.</p>
          <p>Business Banking revenue of $358 million was up $5 million from the same quarter last year. While revenue was hurt by narrower spreads resulting from the low interest rate environment, Business Banking continues to grow volume in both deposit and lending products.</p>
          <p>Other revenue were down $9 million from the prior quarter last year but up $42 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to the impact of treasury allocations.</p>
          <p>On slide 8, net income for this quarter from Retail and Business Banking was $539 million, up $13 million or 2% from the same quarter of the prior year. We've discussed revenue already, which is up $57 million. The provision for credit losses of $285 million was up $4 million from the same quarter last year as a result of write-offs on the acquired MasterCard portfolio which is mostly offset by improved economic conditions on the remaining portfolio. Tom Woods will discuss credit quality in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses were $1 billion, up $53 million or 5% from the same quarter last year, primarily due to the impact of HST, servicing fees related to the acquired MasterCard portfolio and pension expense. Retail numbers are down 6 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily due to margin pressure on mortgages.</p>
          <p>Results for our Wealth Management business are shown on slide nine. As noted earlier, this is the first quarter with separate reporting for Wealth Management. Revenue for the quarter was $404 million, up $44 million or 12% from the same quarter last year. As Gerry highlighted, Wealth Management continues to show strong year-over-year revenue growth in the Retail Brokerage and Asset Management lines of business.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results of the specific business lines on the slide, Retail Brokerage revenue of $263 million was up $28 million or 12% from the same quarter last year due to higher fee-based revenue from improved capital markets and higher commissions from new issues and equity trading activities. Asset Management revenue of $116 million was up $17 million or 17% from the same quarter last year, and this is primarily due to higher client assets under management resulting from improved capital markets and continued strong net sales of long-term mutual funds.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 reflects the net income this quarter from Wealth Management of $68 million, up $15 million or 28% from the same quarter of the prior year. Again, we have discussed revenue and non-interest expenses were $307 million, up $24 million or 8%, year-over-year, and this is mainly due to performance-related compensation.</p>
          <p>Turning to Wholesale Banking on slide 11, revenue in this quarter was $454 million, up $61 million or 16% compared to the prior quarter. Excluding items of note, Wholesale Banking revenue is $455 million, up $14 million or 3% on the same basis. During the third quarter, revenue for our core Wholesale Banking businesses of Capital Markets and Corporate and Investment Banking was $483 million, up $28 million or 6% compared to the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>The main drivers for this increase were higher merchant banking gains and a higher advisory revenue. This was offset to a certain extent by lower fixed income revenue and lower equity new issues revenue as a result of weaker market conditions and lower client activity.</p>
          <p>In the Other segment, revenue of $20 million was up $37 million from the prior quarter, but this was primarily due to lower losses in our Structured Credit Run-off business.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, Wholesale Banking net income was $145 million this quarter, up $33 million from the prior quarter. The revenue was $61 million for the second quarter for the reasons we have previously discussed.</p>
          <p>Credit quality continues to remain strong with a provision for credit losses of $6 million this quarter compared to a $1 million in the prior quarter. Non-interest expenses were $294 million, up $23 million from the prior quarter, mainly due to higher performance-related compensation.</p>
          <p>Excluding all items of note, net income for this quarter was $158 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter on the same basis.</p>
          <p>This next slide summarizes our Structured Credit Run-off results. We had a pre-tax loss of $18 million for this quarter versus the loss of $17 million in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Starting with row one, here we had a loss of $15 million on the credit valuation adjustments resulting from credit spreads widening and declines in the underlying value of holdings hedged by financial guarantors. On row two, we had a gain of $16 million on purchased credit derivatives that are mark-to-market which hedged loans that are carried at amortized cost. This is largely a timing issue, and there was a gain in this quarter due to declines in the market value of the underlying loans.</p>
          <p>On row three, we had a net gain of $13 million resulting from the unwinding of positions. These transactions reduced our <mark type="ph" /> northern (14:38) exposure by $9.6 billion, increased our Basel II Tier 1 ratio by approximately 7 basis points and increased our Basel III common equity ratio by approximately 4 basis points.</p>
          <p>The loss on row four, represents a net effect of gains and losses on the remainder of the hedged and unhedged positions as well as interest and expenses. So, in summary we had a very strong third quarter results. Compared to the same period last year, both our Retail and Business Banking and our Wealth Management businesses demonstrated solid revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Our investment in American Century which was announced this quarter will further improve our wealth management performance. Amidst volatile market conditions of the third quarter, our wholesale banking business produced very strong operating results. The clients-driven strategy of this business continues to produce steady and risk-controlled performance.</p>
          <p>So, if we look at the bank overall, we continue to have good loan loss experience. We maintained our expense discipline which contributed to an improved cash efficiency or <mark type="ph" /> mix (15:41) ratio, and our capital position remains strong.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention. And I'd now like to turn the meeting over to Tom Woods.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> (15:45-16:39) of 7.1% in Q3 '09. Losses were up $14 million versus Q2 due primarily to the MasterCard portfolio as expected. Our cards delinquency rate showed an improving trend quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 22. Our U.S. Real Estate Finance business had $2.6 billion of drawn exposures, $552 million <mark type="audio gap" /> (17:05). In Q3, we took loan loss provision of $7 million, up from $4 million in Q2. We had a $161 million of net impaired loans. As discussed in our Q2 webcast, we could see a slightly higher loan loss run rate in this business in the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>Our European leverage finance run-off book had $471 million in drawn exposures and $97 million in undrawn. In Q3 there were no provisions or reversals in this portfolio. Our U.S. leveraged finance run-off book had $176 million in drawn exposures and $173 million in undrawns. There were recoveries of $1 million in Q3 in this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Turning to market risk, slide 24 shows the Q3 distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios. In Q3, we had positive results 83% of the time. Our average trading bar was down 21% from Q2, and we reduced risk in the more volatile market towards the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, our Tier 1 ratio was 14.6% at Q3, down from 14.7% at the end of Q2. Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 11% from 10.6% last quarter. The 0.1 percentage decrease of Tier 1 ratio was mainly due to the redemption of 400 million of preferred shares and slightly higher risk weighted assets partly offset by earning net of dividend and equity issued in our dividend reinvestment plan.</p>
          <p>The risk weighted assets increase this quarter came mainly from slightly higher corporate and commercial loans outstanding, as well as a normal course Basel II parameter update. CIBC is well positioned for the Basel III transition. Our pro forma Basel III common equity ratio, as Gerry said at July 31, was 8.2%, exceeding the Basel III 2019 minimum requirement of 7%. Our Basel III ratio would be about 7.6%, after giving effect to the American Century Investments acquisition, which is expected to close shortly in Q4.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We will now take questions from the telephone lines. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> There'll be a brief pause for participants to register. Thank you for your patience.

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. A question for David Williamson. Dave, the other banks &#x2013; some of the other banks that reported weak margin trends in Q2 had a reasonable bounce-back this quarter, but your margin continues to be under pressure, and I think it was down another six basis points. So can you flesh out the margin trend a little bit more for us for Q3 and speak to your outlook going forward? Do you think after a couple of quarters of relatively weak trends there, you may be in a position to outperform the group in the near term, or do you think the margin will just ebb and flow with peers from Q3 levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, yes, let me talk to that in sort of how we're affected specifically. So, starting off from where we jumped off last quarter, that point &#x2013; the point of those two dynamics that are pressurizing, putting some pressure on margins, so first, just the impact of the sustained low-interest-rate environment in which we find ourselves currently and the competitive pressure in the lending market. So neither of those two conditions improved this past quarter, and that led to the decline in our retail margins by the six basis points you referred to. So the biggest driver of the decline in spreads for us is mortgage spreads where prices do remain very competitive, and we feel that more than some of our peers, given the relative size of our mortgage portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, looking forward, I'd say the current view is that we're looking at &#x2013; it would appear right now, a prolonged period of low interest rates which does put pressure on deposit margins. True for us and true for the industry generally. On the asset side, it's different. So that depends on market pricing and our ability to optimize prices within that context. So, as we know, asset margins have been under pressure across the industry although this quarter we'll be &#x2013; if we look on a quarter-over-quarter basis, what I see is some of it have changed in direction. So, of note, although a quarter doesn't indicate a trend, what we're seeing in our Business Banking and our Small Business Banking is NIMs actually expanded on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So, it's just a quarter but it does indicate that there's maybe some change in the market on spreads.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was Small Business Banking, what was the other area where you saw some slight margin expansion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. In Commercial Banking, we also saw a quarter-over-quarter expansion in spreads.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a quick additional one, card balances. Tom, your comments sort of cut out and I missed it. But on card balances there was a reasonable lift this quarter. For David or for Tom, can you give us a sense of how much of that growth was due to the Citi deal, and how much of it might be considered more organic?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a follow up on the NIM question, briefly, the NIM contraction in Community Banking. I would have thought it actually would have gone up because of the prefunding activity from last quarter, if you can kind of walk us through the dynamics there.</p>
          <p>And then just my main question on the U.S. Real Estate Finance business, one we don't normally pay much attention to, but it looks like balances increased 40% sequentially. Is this higher line utilization, some organic growth? I believe you positioned this thing for growth again. If that's the case, maybe you should move it out of the run-off disclosure and just kind of let me know what's going on with that business right now. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Gabriel, it's Kevin. Why don't I take the first part of that question? So, in fact, we are seeing the benefit of that prefunding. Our overall bank NIMs this quarter were up a couple of basis points, and part of that is because of higher treasury net interest income. That higher treasury net interest income, however, is allocated through to the businesses through the Other line. And so, in terms of the direct retail NIMs that you see, that wouldn't reflect the immediate benefit of that prefunding because that flows down through the Other line, which is not used to calculate retail NIMs.</p>

          <p>It's Richard. I'll take that. So, Real Estate Finance is, as far as I know, not in run-off. We've been operating as if it's an ongoing business and we're going to continue to do that. Real Estate Finance, I've been saying for the last several quarters now, is a business that we decided to begin to grow again. We had suspended our new loan activity from late '08 right through till the beginning of this year. But we have laid out a plan for &#x2013; to begin to grow that business at the time where we think that with the written-down values of the real estate properties in the United States in the commercial area, and particularly, if you focus on the right regions, this is a very good opportunity and the pricing remains very attractive in this business.</p>
          <p>So we've set out a plan to grow that business over the next three years in terms of the current horizon, both on the taking &#x2013; growing our balance sheet position in that business as well as reengaging in the CMBS market. Again, I talked about over the last several quarters of our joint venture we have with Blackstone, where we were assembling a fixed-rate loan of mortgages, a portfolio of mortgages to sell into the CMBS market in the near future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a question for David on the supplemental package, page six. I noticed the loans and acceptances to deposits ratio sort of flips over the last couple years, goes from 106% loans greater than deposits to 96% today. So, what's driving that? Is that just more securitization in covered bonds, or is there something more fundamental happening in terms of your deposit gathering? If you could talk about how that flip in that ratio might impact NIM. And I guess I'll just leave it at those two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So those lines are impacted by treasure activities I highlighted, so that will impact some of the dynamics there. What I can do is just stand back a bit and just talk about some of the dynamics in our deposits and lending...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...business because I don't know if those lines would &#x2013; are indicative of what's going on in the business itself due to some of the impact of treasury activities. Does that make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; that'd be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, if we look at volumes and I might comment on NIMs thereafter. So first on a year-over-year basis and then in a quarter-over-quarter basis, give a little bit of a sense of a trend, what we're seeing is, on the lending side, first personal lending, good growth, good year-over-year growth. And on the business banking side, both small business and in commercial banking, we're seeing a very good volume growth, like 10% or better.</p>
          <p>So, compared to deposits, deposit-gathering activity is strong. So, on the personal side, it's as strong as our lending activities. So, good growth but not as strong as what we're seeing in business banking where it's on both the lending and the deposit side. We're at about 10% or better, so we're very strong deposit gathering, very strong lending activities in business banking and stronger than what we're seeing on the personal side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're getting 10% year-over-year growth in business lending and deposits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'll see that in our results on the market share side. You'll see we're up 17 basis points in business lending, and you'll see that last quarter, good solid growth. So, we're seeing market growth in our business lending quarter-over-quarter. We're seeing it again this quarter, and we're also &#x2013; similar growth on the deposit side.</p>
          <p>So now, if I kick over to quarter-over-quarter, what we're seeing is Personal lending and the deposit side is picking up steam. Actually it's growing at a faster rate even to what our year-over-year basis is, and that's in the Personal.</p>
          <p>On the Business Deposits and the Business Lending, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, a bit different. So, on the Business side, it's still lending, it's still growing, growing quite well. Not at that same year-over-year pace. And on the Deposit side, that's where on a quarter-over-quarter basis we saw a decrease. So, we've had really good business deposit-gathering now for a few quarters. This quarter, it came off and not systemic. We have a couple of balances that left during the quarter and that affected our quarter-over-quarter results. So, that could be what you're seeing on slide six, but, again, I think more of that's treasury activities.</p>
          <p>So, big picture: very strong growth in deposits and lending in Business Banking. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we've lost some deposits, so that affected the deposits quarter-over-quarter. Not a trend we believe. Overall that franchise is strong. And then as I mentioned earlier, and it's just a quarter, it's not necessarily a trend, but we're actually seeing spreads expand on the Business Lending side.</p>
          <p>Now, the other NIM factor I referred to before is in respect to interest rates, and we're just in this low-interest-rate environment. Us and I think any other bank on the street is going to feel some compression on deposits be it personal or business. So, hopefully that gives you some insight.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's Kevin. I can give you a big picture. I think there was about $80 million that we're talking about and about half of that would have related to the extra days and volume growth with the balance relating to the treasury and tax interest. The tax interest was well under $10 million. So, the balance would be the treasury and net interest income.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to make sure I've got that right. So, the tax interest is under $10 million and the treasury benefit?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the treasury benefit would be about $30 million odd, something like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I'll also ask a question for Gerry that I've asked on all the other calls. Can you give us some comfort about liquidity of U.S. &#x2013; European banks and what are you doing to protect yourself from a liquidity event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Michael, in terms of giving comfort on liquidity of U.S. &#x2013; excuse me, European banks, I don't have &#x2013; you're asking me about their status, I don't have really anything to add to what you're hearing in the marketplace about the status of European banks. So far, all of our counterparties are acting actually in a reasonable business as usual fashion, with an environment that's a bit strained. So, I don't have anything to add to the status of the European banks.</p>
          <p>In terms of our status as to our exposure to European banks, we're in good shape. And I'll turn it over to Tom Woods to layout for you what that is. Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Michael. Just for the benefit of everybody, in our disclosure, we talk about this in three buckets, particularly as it relates to the peripheral countries. We've got no direct sovereign exposure to the peripherals, number one. Number two, we've got about $40 million direct exposure to investment grade banks and three of the peripherals. We've got nothing in Greece or Portugal. So, $40 million in Italy, Spain and Ireland.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, a little under $500 million exposure to corporate through our CLO run-off book. Corporate is located in the five peripherals. But we've got high subordination points on that. So, I think if you compare that disclosure to other global banks including the Canadians, we're definitely at the low-end of that. And as it relates to non-peripheral European banks, our exposure is very manageable there. We're in the &#x2013; it's all investment grade except for, I think, about $2 million short-term, diversified, largely U.S. dollars. So, that's a very manageable exposure as well.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. First, on the pre-funding last quarter, that was what was offered as an explanation for the significant increases in the interest bank deposits with the banks. Now, that number has obviously declined this quarter pretty much back to where it was in Q1 '11. And we also see that in business deposits, business and government deposits coming right back down.</p>
          <p>So, if you could just describe the dynamics, did you just sort of change your mind on the pre-funding? And so, what's actually happening there and what are the risks of those balances moving up and down? And then, secondarily, if you could just comment on the sustainability of the lower tax rate this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, it's Kevin Glass. So, let me talk about the prefunding. Actually, when we spoke about it last quarter, there were two factors that resulted in the increase in liquid assets, so the first one is prefunding and that &#x2013; what we've done with that prefunding is we've managed to redeploy some of that into term assets which is now yielding a higher return. So, that strategy is playing out although we still do have some element of excess funds relating to that.</p>
          <p>But the other &#x2013; and actually from a balance point of view, bigger number is market conditions have just now provided an opportunity to take short-term funding at advantageous rates, and we took advantage of that and placed it into liquid assets. So, what we've done is those balances have come down, again, they're very liquid and will likely stay at these lower levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to be clear, the opportunity you saw was in Q2 '11.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The opportunity is not there in Q3, so what changed from Q2 to Q3 that caused the opportunity to go away, just declining interest rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just market conditions in terms of our ability to invest that money in short-term instruments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the sustainability of the tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our tax rate is lower this quarter, and that's a result largely of business mix, so it's somewhat lower than we would anticipate moving forward, but not significantly. So, we do anticipate a slightly lower tax rate than we have had moving forward, but perhaps a little higher than we've seen this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you say a little higher than this quarter, are you talking maybe a few points, 2% higher, something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If that &#x2013; and then we need to bear in mind that the good news is next year we'll get the benefit of lower corporate tax rates as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a question for Gerry. Gerry, on the dividend, it looks like your paying out about 47% of current quarter's earnings, and you've talked about being at the lower end of your 40% to 50% range, just given the volatility in the marketplace. One could read into that that you see some pretty nice growth next year. But has your view of managing towards the lower end of that payout ratio range changed or you're still sticking with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, my view has not changed. And I don't give forward-looking guidance, but we feel we're very solidly within our existing range and dependent upon the environment that we would continue to look to work down in the range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And then just on the U.S. Real Estate Financing, it looks like, Tom or Richard, most of the increase is coming in multifamily and multiuse than Other. Could you give an indication of what Other exposures are, Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sure. Other would be commercial buildings, office buildings. This is all commercial real estate. So, I think that would probably be the other major category.</p>
          <p>Let me just tell you a little bit more about Real Estate Finance to follow on from my previous answer. So, we've been in this business, at least with the team that we have in place today, for almost 15 years, performed very well through the credit crisis. We have about 60 people in New York, in this team. And had one year, we maybe had a small net income loss; I think that was last year, through the whole credit crisis. So, the team performed very well. The portfolio performed very well. We didn't have zero loan losses, but they were able to earn their way through the entire credit crisis.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at the environment now, buildings have been written down 40%, 30% 40%. You're providing loans that are the 60% to 70% loan to value because you're providing senior financing and you're getting spreads that are far superior to spreads that you would get for an equivalent unsecured corporate loan. So, you've the building, you're getting higher pricing. We've got a great team in place.</p>
          <p>The other thing that's changed, of course, all of the European banks are gone from the marketplace. So, we are competing primarily with the domestic U.S. banks and we're one of the few foreign bank teams left. Other Canadians are involved but the Europeans are gone. So, all those conditions put together make this a very attractive marketplace to participate in. And we, at CIBC, think we are pretty good in terms of our credit evaluation of commercial real estate loans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. First question is for Kevin. Just to circle back on that discussion regarding the benefit of the net interest income of the all-bank level received from treasury. Can you give us maybe a helping hand here as to what exactly the drivers are for that treasury line on a quarter-to-quarter basis in terms of the contribution treasury <mark type="ph" /> ANR (41:00) receives? Is it changes in interest rates, shape of the yield curve, positions you put on it. I'm sure that all plays a role. But a little bit of help here would be useful given how volatile this line seem to have been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think generally speaking this is a volatile line and will continue to be so. But in the current quarter, if we take the two big components flowing through, they would be our cost of funding as well as the charges out to the business units. So, because spreads have widened in the current quarter, charges out to the business units which negatively impact direct NIM which we've seen in retail, that's a benefit flowing into treasury. The funding cost which we spoke about, our pre-funding is lower than it would otherwise have been, again, because of the widening spreads this quarter.</p>
          <p>So, we've seen the benefit of that in treasury and then that gets allocated out to the business units through the Other line. So, that's why you'll see quarter-over-quarter, Other is going up in our business units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if I think about Q4, since the end of Q3 you've had a steep decline in, let's call it, risk-free rates for lack of a better term, and at the same time I think there's been further spread widening. Does that mean, as far as treasury within corporate or Other is concerned, it continues to get the benefit from those factors where retail markets, for example, gets hurt on the other side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's safe to say, but, again, say that's all things being</p>
          <p>equal, right? So, it's a very dynamic place &#x2013; funding conditions continue to change. We keep rolling over our funding but, by and large, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question &#x2013; last question is either for Kevin, maybe for Gerry as well. Non-compensation expenses this quarter, if I look at it on a adjusted or operating basis, it looks like the bank actually posted a quarter-over-quarter decline. It was pretty flat year-over-year. This is coming after a period where you've shown quite steady increases in expenses. Is there something new at play here in terms of a management process of some of the project expenses that you've talked about in the past run their course? And a little bit of a helping hand here on what you should expect from costs going forward would be important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm glad you pointed that out because we did make important progress on our mix ratio this quarter. As we've indicated, one of our major cost metrics that we use is the mix ratio and that's because we want to make sure that there's the right balance of investment in the business and measuring expenses versus revenues is one of the ways to do that.</p>
          <p>I have to tell you that we are looking at a reasonably steady state in terms of our expenses. There are a number of initiatives that are underway that have to do with fairly large consolidation of expenses or changes of systems that have a beneficial impact. And as a result of that, I would say that the expense picture is reasonably good looking forward.</p>
          <p>All that having been said, I want to go back to my most important metric that we use on this which is the balance of revenue versus expenses, and that is what we are targeting. So, does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it does. It's fair to say when I go back a few years, maybe when you were initially in the role expenses were something that the bank talked about quite regularly in terms of managing to a specific level. The last couple of years that leverage trend or that mix trend had started to go back in the other direction and that's why it caught my attention this quarter that you were able to hold that level pretty flat. So, I guess that's the key question. Are we back at that kind of the stage that we had back in '06, '07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to think that we've maintained the discipline all the way through, but to go back, and I would tend to generally agree with your narrative that originally, we set a target of a median mix within the industry. And the reason why we did that was because we wanted to make sure that the investment versus expense reduction balance was correct and the marketplace would move. And the marketplace had been improving in terms of mix ratios, so, it was a way that we ever greened our targets.</p>
          <p>Originally, we calculated that we had a dollar number that we had to reduce our expenses in order to get to the median, and that's why we originally set out targets for you. Here is the &#x2013; I think it was $500 million at the time.</p>
          <p>We did achieve those targets which did get us to the median. And as a result of that, we started to talk more so about the median because we felt that the opportunity for CIBC was at least as good in terms of improving our revenue profile as it was in reducing our absolute dollar expenses.</p>
          <p>All that having been said, in the last year or so, there were some headwinds that we've talked about in terms of HST costs and pension costs. And as Kevin has noted, there is a certain element of those abating. And in addition to that, we do have some projects ongoing that will be of assistance in allowing us to see in a abatement in the absolute dollar level of expense increase.</p>
          <p>So, mix is still our target because revenues are important, but we do have a number of initiatives on the go. And they are efficiency initiatives or systems initiatives, they're not just cutting up costs, and we do see the impact of those coming in over the course of the next while. And there's some spending on integration costs of a number of our recent acquisitions that are also abating because those costs were at a level that we thought we should just absorb them. We will now get the benefit of those costs abating. An example that would be, we just completed our conversion from running two systems on the MasterCard purchase, and we're now running only one system. And that also gives us a cost reduction. We had been bearing that cost since the acquisition and it was something that over the course of the year was substantial.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Darko Mihelic from Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. I think I'll avoid asking a question on treasury, but maybe, Kevin, I'd love to sit down with you for a bit, talk through it. So, I'll ask my question on trading, I'm certainly going to reference Tom's remarks. Tom, you mentioned that a lot of the losses occurred in the back half of the quarter but when I look at page 28 of your Shareholder Report, I actually don't see any of that in this table. I do see the VaR that you're referencing.</p>
          <p>So, what my question is, and maybe it's for you, Tom, maybe it's for Richard. I'm not sure who wants to answer the question, but we're almost finished August and it's been a pretty rough month and you have been reducing your VaR, so my question is, is the VAR been reduced consciously? Given what's happened in August, is it having the desired effect of reducing volatility within trading results. And maybe these trading results that I see here on page 28, maybe they have the structured credit run-off embedded in it. I don't know. So, maybe you can talk to trading ex-structured credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll start and then hand it over to Richard for a business comment. Just a couple of things that you said there, Darko, Page 28, those results do not include structured credit. So, that is your non-structured credit trading results. To your question about the VaR reduction, was it conscious? Yes, it was absolutely conscious and it's a joint decision driven by the business with risk involvement.</p>
          <p>And you'll see on page 27 of the MD&amp;A, although we had average VaR of 6.1 which would be the lowest of the Canadian banks in the quarter, we finished the quarter at 3.5 which is as low as I can ever remember it in probably over a dozen years here at CIBC. And that's just a reflection of caution within the market and limiting and focusing our activities on client business as opposed to directional views. So maybe with that comment, I'll hand it over to Richard to add to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you look at the record, we started taking down the VaR during the early part of the third quarter and took it down pretty consistently through the quarter. You could see the volatility in the market starting to pick up. And certainly, we can't predict the future. But our view is that volatility &#x2013; it's gone from being volatility to erraticism, so much worse than volatility. I don't mind volatility. It's erratic markets that are difficult to manage.</p>
          <p>And so, you can see it coming. So, we took it down deliberately. And I would say, in August, I'm very pleased with the performance in August; so far, so good. And while it's been &#x2013; certain of the books have had little challenges on an overall basis, I would say so far, so good.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Andr&#xE9; Hardy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. For David Williamson, please. On slide seven, just a couple quick clarifications and then a more important question. So, on Business Banking, you talked about 10% loan growth and deposit growth, but your revenues didn't change much year-over-year, is that all spread compression? And then in Personal Banking, if you take out the beneficial impact of the acquisition of the MasterCard portfolio, I would think you basically had no growth. Can you please confirm that?</p>
          <p>And then the more important question is, starting from revenue growth of next to nothing, what's going to change going forward? I'm sure your plan is not to have a business that's stagnant from a revenue growth perspective, but what will help that revenue growth, which is very, very small, get better over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andr&#xE9;. So, in the Personal Banking side, it was offsetting dynamics, so good volume growth, good growth in fees, cards and also on the deposit accounts, and the impact of the acquisition. And you're right, the headwind against that was the dynamics and spreads, which we spoke of, right? Both the compression on deposits and on the lending side.</p>
          <p>So a couple of things there: one is our book in mortgages is substantive, so that puts some pressure on our relative results when there's pressure in the mortgage market. There are some signs that some of that recent pressure is abating a bit and that would help going forward. On the Business Banking side, different trends, good volume growth, some offsetting spread compression, but again, I referred to, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, even expansion on the lending side. Still seeing pressure on the deposit side. I think that's the trend that will be throughout the market until rates start to increase. But on the asset side, a different dynamic, and we are seeing some uptick there.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, what can we do for growth? I think within the context of competitive pricing, we can look to optimizing our own pricing. What you'll see in some of our results in the market share, we're expanding branch market share and giving up market share in some of the broker-related channels speaks to a couple things. One is there's enhanced returns on the branch side; enhanced opportunities to engage with our clients more effectively. We're finding the &#x2013; some of the broker space more competitive. And hence, we're maybe not pushing as hard in that space, but accelerating our growth on the branch side.</p>
          <p>We also are pushing hard on the mobile banking front. We've been recognized, as Gerry said, recently for our leadership in that space. And I think that's an area that we'll continue to explore for growth. We've recently been expanding on the branch side. We've put 16 branches in so far this year, with a plan for 27 for the rest of the year. So that's an opportunity for growth as well.</p>
          <p>I spoke about the business banking growth, 10% year-over-year, picked up 17 basis points on a market share basis, so it seems like we've got some growth there. And then we've deploying capital effectively as well. We talked about American Century, but in my business unit, we've got the cards acquisition. We're now a dual issuer. We've got our conversion done. We've introduced four PayPass cards that are now contactless, so we are very well-positioned for growth in the card space. So, we've got the work done, the conversion done. We're now a dual issuer, and I think positioned well for growth. I think some of the platform changes we've got and some of those dynamics position us well to accelerate growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Thank you. And would it be fair to summarize your comments by saying that the balance growth, the volume growth, you're still fairly comfortable with and hopeful that spread compression will decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. We're pleased with the volume growth. That's been consistent. On the Personal side has even picked up recently. Business banking has been for a while now fairly consistently strong.</p>
          <p>On the NIM side, look forward on interest rates, it does look like that for the whole industry is going to continue to provide pressure. But on the asset side, that's different, and I think there's an opportunity there. One is there's some telltale signs that the market may &#x2013; some of the competitive pressures may be coming off. But even not, I think it's down to us to optimize our pricing within that context, and I think there's scope for us to do that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks very much. I had a question with respect to the trading activity in the quarter and this rather large loss, I guess it's on Page 10 in the Structured Credit and Other, $129 million loss this quarter versus $50 million last. I was wondering if you could put that in context. On the one hand, we have what we call a Run-off Structured Credit business that lost $18 million, I think it was, in the quarter, and we have &#x2013; we're showing here in trading something referred to as structured credit that's producing much larger losses. I'm just wondering, are there two Structured Credit businesses being operated here, one that's in run-off and one that isn't?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad, it's Kevin. No, the answer to that is absolutely not. We have &#x2013; one Structured Credit business is enough, but what you are seeing is just some accounting geography issues. So, going through trading is where we have some of the underlying collateral and the trading positions that are in structured credit, but that's shown gross on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So, mark-to-market good movement on that collateral and some of the losses on particular unwinds would go through trading. So, that's why you'd have had a big negative impact on trading. However, that's offset in our FDO revenue line almost exactly where we have gains on the protection side of things where we've got instruments that are designated as fair value option, and they essentially offset those.</p>
          <p>So, those two lines have to be taken together. They essentially offset and that's why in Structured Credit overall, you see that weights more a loss.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the $18 million is the net number between those two then? Is that correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct. And then obviously, there'd be a couple of other things in there but big picture that's exactly correct.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. My question is about securitization revenue. Kevin, when I think about 2012 IFRS earnings versus 2011 GAAP earnings, is this higher securitization revenue that we've seen in the last couple of quarters turning into a headwind for next year's earnings?</p>
          <p>And I can appreciate that there's a lot of moving parts here on IFRS and you probably don't want to comment on the specifics, but even directional comments would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and then we won't give guidance but I mean, the short answer to your question is no. There's a lot of noise in securitization so I think along with that, a lot of people will be pleased when that's gone. I mean what you will see from an overall securitization point of view is, I think, less volatile earnings. So we won't have some of the gains on sale that you see periodically. But our NRI will be far more even.</p>
          <p>So, I think that, what you'll see is, as a result of the NRI drag that you've seeing today, that will flow through earnings on a regular basis, so once we end <mark type="ph" /> IFRS (59:46). Rob, you still there? I think we seemed to have lost Rob.</p>
