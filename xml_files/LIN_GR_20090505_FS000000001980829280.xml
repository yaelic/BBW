        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody from my side too. Looking at the key facts on page three, you see that overall, regarding the severe downturn of economic conditions around the world, we have posted relatively stable results in the first quarter 2009. Group sales of &#x20AC;2.695 billion and Group operating profit of &#x20AC;538 million were down 5.3% and 7.3% respectively excluding currency effects.</p>
          <p>The reported earnings per share declined by 29.2% to &#x20AC;0.68, while the adjusted EPS decreased by 23.2% to &#x20AC;0.99. With an increase of the operating cash flow by 22.3% to &#x20AC;412 million, we have maintained a strong cash flow generation in what is result of the tough market environment.</p>
          <p>As you know, we are working hard to adopt our organization to the change in the economic environment and have accelerated our HPO initiative within our High Performance Organization program. This has led to restructuring charges of &#x20AC;20 million in the other consolidation segment in the first quarter. In the next month, we expect additional restructuring charges of around &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>Group operating profit before these restructuring charges was down by 4%, with an operating margin on last year's level of 20.7%. The adjusted EPS before restructuring charges declined by 17%. Looking forward, as visibility overall is still low, we keep a scenario-based approach for our 2009 outlook.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the details of our quarter one figures now with the overview of Group sales by division on page four. The Gases division posted revenues of &#x20AC;2.157 billion, down 6.3% on reported basis. The comparable sales growth in quarter one was minus 4.4%, driven by volume impacts from lower customer activity levels.</p>
          <p>Pricing contributed positively to the year-on-year comparison. Including bolt-on acquisitions, the comparable figure would be minus 1.7%. In the reported sales development, negative translation effects on the British pound, South African rand, and the Australian dollar together with the natural gas price effect have offset the positive contribution from the US dollar and the consolidation of Elgas in Australia.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Engineering division of &#x20AC;549 million were slightly above previous year, with revenue recognition as usual on a seasonal low in quarter one. Note that as in quarter four 2008, the other consolidation segment posted a negative sales figure in this quarter again. This reflects the high level of intra-company consolidation related to those plants being built by the Engineering division for our Gases business.</p>
          <p>Group operating profit on page five was down 10.6% to &#x20AC;538 million. Again, please be aware that the &#x20AC;20 million restructuring charges have to be taken into account here to put the reported Group operating profit and margin in perspective. Adjusted for these expenses, the margin achieved was 20.7%, last year's level.</p>
          <p>On a divisional basis, the Gases business saw a decline in operating profit of 6.8% to &#x20AC;546 million, of which more than half is related to exchange rate effects. Adjusted for the currency translation, operating profit was down by 3.2%. Hence given the severe economic circumstances, the operating margin did hold up well at 25.3% where that was 25.5% in quarter one 2008.</p>
          <p>This is the result of the lower natural gas price pass-through in our tonnage business, the profit contribution from joint venture activities, and the first effects from our accelerated restructuring measures within the HPO program.</p>
          <p>In Engineering, the execution of our project backlog is progressing on plan. With 8.2%, our margin hence remains strong and stays above our 8% target.</p>
          <p>On page six, you find the sales bridge for the Gases division. The combined price/volume effect was as mentioned minus 4.4%, with volume decline partly cushioned by positive pricing.</p>
          <p>Exchange rate changes had a major effect of 2.8% on reported sales in the quarter. Do not forget here that our combined revenues in British pound, South African rand, and Australian dollar are well above our US dollar sales.</p>
          <p>The effect from natural gas price changes also turned negative for the quarter at minus 1.8%. As a brief reminder, this contractual pass-through towards our tonnage customers thus only affect the sales but not the operating profit figure of our Gases division.</p>
          <p>The consolidation effect, finally, was positive with 2.7% as we are consolidating our former joint venture in Australia, the LPG business, Elgas, since the first quarter of 2008. And for the first time in quarter one 2009, we have also consolidated the Saudi Arabian business, SIGAS.</p>
          <p>I am now on slide seven. You'll find the quarterly review of sales and operating profit in our operating segments on the next four pages, starting now with Western Europe. Sales in Western Europe were down 9.2% on reported basis to &#x20AC;935 million.</p>
          <p>Operating profit of &#x20AC;247 million was down 12.7%. We hence saw some impact of the lower capacity utilization level on our profitability, but overall the margin in Western Europe remained with 26.4% on a high level.</p>
          <p>Within these reported figures, you should also have in mind the strong negative effect from the British pound devaluation in this region. On comparable basis, so adjusted for currency, natural gas price changes, and the consolidation effects, sales retreated indeed by 3.5% only.</p>
          <p>Volumes were actually down year-on-year across all countries, whereas just as in all our other operating segments, the price effect remains positive. The strongest volume decline in the Western European markets was visible in the bulk and tonnage product area, while volumes and sales in the Healthcare business continued to grow.</p>
          <p>The operating segment Americas posted sales of &#x20AC;501 million, 5.1% below quarter one 2008. This is on page eight. The comparable sales growth for this region was minus 7.1%. Operating profit meanwhile reached exactly the previous year level of &#x20AC;104 million. The 110 basis point improvement in the operating margin towards 20.8% is supported by lower natural gas prices and the contribution from our joint venture activities.</p>
          <p>Also, as the US was the first bigger economy to be impacted by the economic crisis, it was important for us to implement restructuring measures very early in this region. This has also contributed to the positive margin development in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In North America, we have seen a positive development in Healthcare and also in our Food &amp; Beverage business. Nevertheless, volumes in the whole regions were still significantly down. Our business in South America has held up quite well, even with the weaker market environment in Brazil. One reason for this positive development was the strong growth in healthcare. Also, as in the other regions, positive pricing has helped to mitigate the overall volume reductions.</p>
          <p>On page nine, we come to Asia &amp; Eastern Europe. Sales in this operating segment of &#x20AC;428 million show a decline of 7.8% on reported basis or 7.9% on comparable basis. Helped among others by joint venture ramp-ups, the operating profit held up much better at minus 1.5% to &#x20AC;129 million. The operating margin hence improved by 190 basis points to 30.1%.</p>
          <p>In China, volume declines in existing tonnage schemes were partly offset by the start-up of new projects out of our pipeline. With signals staying mixed all over the world, China offers perhaps one of the strongest hopes of at least a solid stabilization of customer demand, especially in the steel industry. Eastern Europe was mostly impacted by lower activity levels among its manufacturing customer base.</p>
          <p>Beginning of April, we've signed another important contract in China. The new joint venture with Sinopec daughter company, Sichuan Vinylon Works in Chongqing, will allow us to further expand our footprint towards Inland China. This contract can also be taken as another positive signal for the attractive long-term business potential in the emerging market region. Independent of those volatility in current economic conditions, our strategic set-up in these important structural growth market remains strong.</p>
          <p>The operating segment, South Pacific &amp; Africa, posted a sales increase in quarter one; this is on page 10. Sales advanced 4% to &#x20AC;309 million. On comparable basis, the sales growth was 2% as the consolidation effect of Elgas more than offset the adverse currency impacts in the region.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was down moderately by 2.9% to &#x20AC;66 million. The reported decline in the operating margin towards 21.4% can be attributed mostly to a product mix effect from the consolidation of the LPG business of Elgas.</p>
          <p>Overall, the South Pacific region has held up very well in all product segments, also in the industrial areas. Supported by our pricing initiatives, Africa saw only a slight underlying sales decline. However, ongoing cost pressures did also contribute to the year-on-year margin dilution of the operating segment.</p>
          <p>The volume impact in most of our industrial end markets is also reflected in the comparable sales performance by product area on page 11.</p>
          <p>Bulk sales declined by 6.9% on comparable basis to &#x20AC;536 million, while cylinder sales decreased by 5.5% to &#x20AC;871 million. The slightly better development in the cylinder business is supported by the contribution from the rental side as well as very diversified customer base. In both areas of the merchant business, positive pricing helps to offset partly the volume declines.</p>
          <p>In the tonnage product area, the underlying volume decline was cushioned by our take-or-pay contracts as well as contributions from the ramp-up of new projects. Tonnage sales were down 4.4% on comparable basis to &#x20AC;499 million. The Healthcare product area defied the economic circumstances with a 5.5% comparable sales growth to &#x20AC;251 million.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 12 with the update on our pipeline of major new projects in the Gases division. As a reminder, we are taking into account here all projects with an investment size of above &#x20AC;10 million and the date refers to the planned start-up of the plant.</p>
          <p>Our number of projects remained unchanged, with 64 major plant start-ups worldwide in the years 2008 to 2011. Since our last communication in March, we have seen the postponement of one additional project from 2009 to 2010 as a result of the regular discussions we have started with our customers.</p>
          <p>From a sales recognition point of view, you should be aware that the major contribution out of the pipeline will be visible in 2010.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, we give you the overview of our joint venture contributions. The proportionate sales not included in our topline figures are, of course, strongly down year-on-year due to the full consolidation of the former joint venture, Elgas, as of October 2008.</p>
          <p>Regarding the share of net income on the right-hand side, the strong increase towards &#x20AC;18 million in quarter one was mainly driven up by start-ups and ramp-ups of several projects, especially in Asia. For the full year, I stay with my guidance of 50 to &#x20AC;60 million contribution from our joint venture activity.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, you'll find some more details of our Engineering business. As mentioned earlier, the Engineering division delivered an order execution in line with our plans so that sales were slightly higher than last year's level and the operating margin above our target of 8%.</p>
          <p>Order backlog remained strong at &#x20AC;4.1 billion at the end of the quarter, giving us good visibility for the next 18 to 24 months. The cancellation rate that we have seen in the last month is not different from usual level. Cancellations are mainly related to our own project pipeline in the Gases division.</p>
          <p>Order intake declined 29.8% to &#x20AC;285 million. You should have in mind that engineering is a project-based business and looking forward, we still see opportunities for project signing out in the marketplace in 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 15, we come to the key element of our cash flow statement. Cash flow from operating activities in the reporting period was &#x20AC;412 million compared to &#x20AC;337 million in the same period in the previous year. This is an increase of 22.3% and is mainly the result of a stronger working capital management compared with quarter one 2008.</p>
          <p>The investment cash outflow in the first three months of 2009 was &#x20AC;282 million compared to &#x20AC;225 million in the previous year. Investments in the reporting period were &#x20AC;267 million. And therefore, 4.3% higher than the figure for quarter one 2008 of &#x20AC;256 million. The main reason for the increase was the execution of new projects.</p>
          <p>Hello? I now hear music. I hope that I will be heard further with my communication. I am still on page 15 with the Group cash flow. And I was just talking now about the acquisition line. There were 60 million for acquisitions included, which is mainly the payment for our subsidiary, SIGAS, in Saudi Arabia. The free cash flow before financing activities increased during the reporting period by 16.1% to &#x20AC;130 million compared to &#x20AC;112 million of net cash including 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 16, you find an overview of our financial position. Per end of March, net debt of &#x20AC;6.5 billion was almost stable compared with the end-year figure. As you know, our financial position is very solid. Our net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.5 at the end of 2008 was well within our target range of two to three times. We have a well spread long-term maturity profile with around 80% of financial debt to be due beyond 2010. With &#x20AC;1.7 billion, we have also a strong liquidity reserve. The cash position of &#x20AC;847 million per end of quarter one and the &#x20AC;2 billion credit facility cover all financial maturities until the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>As you have maybe seen just a few days ago, Standard &amp; Poor's revised its outlook for the Linde Group to positive from stable; the BBB+ long-term credit rating was affirmed.</p>
          <p>Coming to our outlook for 2009 on slide 17. As mentioned earlier in my business update, we had a mixed picture with, on the one hand, positive signals like for example in China and on the other hand, a further deterioration in some other regions. But overall, we've seen a certain stabilization in the last month of the first quarter. If this is good enough for turning point is difficult to argue, especially when you consider that GDP expectations have been taken down further since we last met.</p>
          <p>Also the further development of the currency exchange rate during the course of the year remains uncertain. So given the unchanged limited visibility, we continue with our scenario-based approach for the 2009 outlook.</p>
          <p>Forecasts for Group sales and earnings range from the same level as the prior-year figures to a reduction versus 2008. Seen from today's standpoint, we need to anticipate for a decline. Only if there were a significant improvement in the global economic environment as the year progressed would it be possible for Group sales and earnings, adjusted for the restructuring costs, to reach the same level as in the prior year.</p>
          <p>For the Gases division, we expect sales and earnings still to range between a slight increase and a year-on-year decline. As a result of the most recent forecasts for global economic development, once again revised down, the probability that the weaker scenario will prevail has increased.</p>
          <p>For the Engineering division, as I've said earlier, our strong order backlog is a good basis for relatively stable business performance in the next 18 to 24 months. However, in our weaker scenario, we assume that new orders will not be sufficient to achieve the same level of sales in 2009 compared to 2008. And as I also explained, our target for the operating margin remained nevertheless at 8%. As you have seen, we have accelerated our HPO program and confirmed the target of gross savings of 650 to 800 million in the period 2009 to 2012.</p>
          <p>As a brief word of conclusion, I think we have shown in quarter one that we have the stable setup even as we are, of course, not immune to these slight unusual economic circumstances. There is as of today not enough light at the end of the tunnel to call a trend change. That's why we are fully committed to work on our internal efficiencies and stay focused on our profitability and cash flow performance. This will allow us to be in an even better setup when the growth opportunities for our leading Gases and Engineering operations will eventually strengthen again.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. We are happy to take your questions now. Operator, please.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Tony Jones from Redburn in London. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. I just got a couple of questions. Firstly, on the outlook for the number of projects and startups. You've given some guidance until 2011. Could you give any color on what you think might happen beyond that date? And also could you split it by downstream markets, say, for example, what will be polyolefin-type sites?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on the tax rate. It seems to be oscillation in the tax rate over the past 12 months or so. So with the tax rate being a lot lower this quarter than the previous year, could you give any more guidance or any updates on what it's like to do for the rest of year? And then finally, could you give a view on &#x2013; and the split between volume and pricing for the Gas business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with your first question on the outlook for the projects, I think you refer to the presentation on page 12. As you see the split on the regional perspective, these are all on-site projects within the Gases division. So there is HyCO business and air separation units included, but we do not have the tonnage business, which is an operation for an acetylene plant. Of course, we supply air separation for acetylene plants but we do not won operations for acetylene plants. So if you mean what are air separation for acetylene plants, there are of course within this pipeline a support of air separation for these plant types, but this is not a major proportion.</p>
          <p>And referring to your 2011 sales number, we don't give a sales number for 2011. As I said in my presentation, 2010 will be the year with the biggest contribution for the on-site business when you look into the different ramp-ups from 2009 to 2011. On the tax rate guidance, we refer more or less in the range of our year-end guidance, which is around 25%, 25 to 26%. I think this is the number to work with. And can you please repeat your third question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure. Could you split out volume and pricing for the Gas business, ideally if possible for bulk, cylinder and tonnage? Is that possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We have, of course, seen overall volume reductions in the bulk business, which is in average &#x2013; I'm talking about average because, of course, we can distinguish between liquid nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and liquid CO2. But in average, I'd argue it's double digit, down with a trend in the last month, which was slightly up. You also see a trend that liquid CO2, for example, is slightly better in average than the rest of the liquid products. Cylinder, of course, volumes were below 2008, but rental is up compared to 2008 with some positive trends in the first quarter within the months. Related to healthcare, I was referring to the different regions that healthcare is overall up in this business split and tonnage of course is from a volume perspective double-digit down. But it is volume related and taking our take-or-pay contract into consideration. You're seeing a much slower decline on the sales number. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Matthias Cornu from Exane in Paris. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just to start a follow-up from the previous question, when you said on the bulk that last month was slightly better. Do you talk about last month in Q1 March or last month calendar and you talk about the month of April? That was my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question I got is on the pricing, have you seen any price increase in Q1 compared to Q4 last year. And what do you expect going forward in term of pricing in the cylinders and the bulk business? And the last question is one of your competitors highlighted the fact that the German economy has been very weak over the first quarter, and could even deteriorate in the second quarter of this year. Can we have your view on that market, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. So to your first question, we're in the first quarter call, so I'll first refer to the last month of this quarter, which is March, not April. A pricing increase comparison between quarter one, quarter four, yes, there is some slight increase on the pricing side. As you can assume, we have started pricing initiatives when we have seen the first deterioration of the markets, which was happening in the first quarter 2008. So we have implemented ahead of that deterioration in the market, of course, price initiatives, which are going now through the months into the year of 2009.</p>
          <p>I'd like to hand over to Aldo on the deterioration of the market environment in Germany. As you have seen, of course, GDP forecasts for Germany were down when we have discussed that in March. So we are now on minus 6% from a German GDP perspective compared to minus three. And yes, we have seen a weak performance, but I hand over to Aldo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, definitely, we can say that Germany is not performing extremely well as compared to other regions in the West even though UK is slightly worse, I'll say. With regard to their projections, we have seen that the volumes are fluctuating in March and late part of Q1. We do not expect a further deterioration.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Nobert Barth from WestLB in Frankfurt. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Nobert Barth, hello, Georg. Perhaps also some questions. First one regarding the HPO program, you accelerate that with additional cost. Can you say if you see the saving on the other side, how they accelerate perhaps in 2009 compared to previous expectation and how it is split over the four years?</p>
          <p>Second question also perhaps related to what was already a little bit asked but in other way, can you give us the volume decline effects if you look on to your end customer groups like you had presented I think on page 12 in the March presentation for mainly in chemistry manufacturing and so how this was?</p>
          <p>And also if you said now on the outlook that you are more calls &#x2013; or say, at the current state it looks to be a decline in 2009, do you &#x2013; on the other side rule out that you also cut your dividend because you said normally the benchmark is the operating profit result or has your statement added to this? And perhaps fourth question on Eastern Europe, as it looks like that especially there, markets are accelerate to go down, do you see a special risk for your major business there as you are the market leader?</p>

          <p>Yeah, a handful of questions, Nobert. Thank you for that. I will answer the first three and will hand over for the Eastern European development to Aldo. So starting with the HPO program, as we have referred to our gross cost savings, we are going for a number which is 650 to 800 million over the four years between 2009 and 2012.</p>
          <p>I focus more on 2009. I think when we talked about that earlier, the average was roughly 120 to 200 million, and we always said that this is from a structural perspective because we are working, for example, in consolidation of our IT systems and these kind of processes which will take a little bit of time. The project is rather developing at the end of the period, which means 2011 and 2012 with higher contributions. Nevertheless, we are going with the restructuring expenses we have charged for in quarter one and the anticipated additional 50 million to come in the next month. We anticipate to go for the higher number, which was a 200 million number for 2009.</p>
          <p>The volume decline referring to the big customer segments within the tonnage business which is mainly steel, which is the chemical businesses and of course, in the end refinery businesses supported by HyCo steel. I mean overall the picture has not changed really in the last quarter or in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>I was referring in my presentation to China, where you have seen a positive development in volumes related to some of the steel projects, we do have there implemented in our joint venture activities. So we see slightly better volume takeouts in China. And overall, as you know from a tonnage perspective, of course, we are holding up the level with our take-or-pay contractual agreements within the different schemes. But overall, steel is significantly down, chemicals is significantly down in average across the globe.</p>
          <p>On the dividend, we are in the first quarter call. I think it's a little bit too early to give a clear guidance here. Of course, our intention is always to perform even in very difficult market environments. Our rule and guidance for dividend development was that this is related to the operational performance, I think this is the answer I want to give at this stage, but there is no precondition at that point of time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Aldo. I'll take the question on Eastern Europe. You've asked whether there is a special risk. In order to talk about the special risk, of course, there must be a meaningful amount of business. So I focus my answer on the big economies of Eastern Europe, Poland, Czech, Hungary and Romania for us. I would say that Hungary is fairly diverse and Poland is very best. In terms of large accounts, of course, we have reinforced our contract management in order to defend our take-or-pay positions, which so far are resisting well.</p>
          <p>In terms of, of course, the manufacturing business, this is something, which is strictly depending on the overall economy. These countries are supplying products and services, for instance, to Germany. So they are very much depending on the economy of Germany. There is, of course, a decline as I say Hungary is suffering a lot. But so far, we have not yet seen vital impacts on our revenues and profits in this part of the world. But we have, as I say, reinforced our attention and the key account management is very alert in order to preserve our position there.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. A couple of questions actually. Firstly, I wonder if you could just go back some of the slides where you showed the regional performance. And just comparing the operating leverage between the regions, I appreciate that there are some factors within each region such as in Asia where you've consolidated JVs not in the sales line but further down. But talk about any other comparative reasons why the operational leverage might be different in the different regions, particularly in Western Europe, the Americas and Asia. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question just specifically on the cash flow statements, could you just shed a little bit of light on the 79 million that is the change in provisions, what that was and where it fed through the income statement? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Neil, for the questions. I think on the regional performance, we have discussed this in previous calls already. I mean there is no change in the structural setup and the differences between the regions is mainly driven by the setup of the segmentation of our tonnage business, merchant business which is bulk and cylinder and healthcare business. And the different market share situations. As you know that in the merchant business, we have more than 70% in areas where we do have significant market share positions. So that is all over the places.</p>
          <p>When you compare Americas for one moment, then North America is an area where we do have more or less on-site business and bulk business and then North America, in Canada, we do have packaged gases business, and of course, overall the North American continent, we do have specialty gases activity. But the main difference here comes from the higher proportion also of HyCO business which you see included for refineries, so that is lowering a little bit the margin. That is one structural impact.</p>
          <p>The other impact for Western Europe here from the comparison, I think you have to take into consideration here the product deterioration from an exchange rate impact in the British pound. I think this is the most significant deterioration here in an area where we have some very high profitability overall. I think these are more or less structural changes. But in the rest of the region in Europe, we have a quite similar setup. In Continental North, we have a strong on-site and a strong merchant business.</p>
          <p>In UK, of course, we do have stronger merchant and healthcare business than tonnage business in average. I think these are the main differences. As you said in Asia, there is more joint venture activity, mainly within the China business in the Greater China region. I think these are the main differences, which I can compare here.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; coming to your second question which is change of provisions, I think this is a normal utilization of provisions, mostly driven by our engineering business here from an operational perspective. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. I had a couple of quick questions. You mentioned that the rental income was obviously helping the Cylinder business at the moment. Coming back on that, I was just wondering in particular different markets at the moment like the UK if you've seen any material return of cylinders impacting that sort of rental income?</p>
          <p>And then following on from that the UK market itself, you mentioned again that it's probably the most difficult as you did at Q4. Just wondering how that business is holding up. I mean it seems to be holding up pretty well if you allow for the currency, just judging by the numbers, certainly in terms of the margin anyway.</p>
          <p>And then finally, on the cash flow, is there a chance of a working capital inflow this year because obviously the performance in Q1 is quite encouraging in terms of that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer the cash flow question related to the working capital and I will ask Aldo to give a deep dive into the UK performance and the development there related to the rental income into Linde. So when you look into the cash flow statement which is on page 15, you've seen an increase of 22% on the operating cash flow. Nevertheless, you have seen a little bit of deterioration in the change of working capital in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Of course, compared to quarter one 2008, it's a strong improvement in a more difficult market environment. Overall, of course, we are working very hard to get our accounts receivables and have clear visibility of this level with our customers. We have a very different program in place compared to last year, also referring to the bankruptcy risks in our customer base. I think this is very important that you are operating on a visibility level with your customer range. And we have clustered of course all over the world, our customer relations according to the profiles and different business profiles of our customers.</p>
          <p>So I am confident that we can compare to the business situation that we can work hard for our improvement on the working capital side. Overall, it's very difficult to forecast if you experience additional bankruptcies. So as you have seen us with a line there by there in the Chapter 11 situation in North America, here we can even report and good outcome within the Chapter 11 solution and our working capital management was here very successful. But overall the legislation in the different parts of the world is different. So there is not all over the world Chapter 11. So the difficult part is really coming through additional bankruptcies when we're looking to working capital. So I hand over to Aldo for the first part of your question which was UK related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As you correctly pointed out, rental in the UK is a very, very significant portion of the revenues. UK is ranking among the best rental, I would say, business cultures in the world and there is no indication that this is changing. Of course, the volumes as Georg pointed out in his &#x2013; one of his answers are now double digit. This is due to the overall slowdown. But there is no erosion in terms of specific rental revenues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A couple of questions. Firstly, back to China, encouraging, Georg, to hear you talk about some improvement in the steel market. I just wonder if you could talk around any other exposure you have within China, for example, in petrochemicals and if you're seeing a similar sort of improvement albeit from a low base, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is on cash flow. You saw in the other asset and liabilities year-on-year 127 million improvement. Could you just explain maybe some of the main factors behind that and also within cash flow where we are with the pension top-up phasing for this year, which quarter it comes in and CapEx guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think best would be that Aldo would answer the question on the Chinese development and I'll go then with cash flow pension top-up and CapEx guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, the rebound in China in the steel industry has been remarkable and unexpected. As early as in February, we had no steel plant taking less than take-or-pay and now they are all above. With regard to chemistry is still struggling. We had these shutdowns in January, February like the Nanjing side of Sinopec. Now they are back on stream, but at let's say turndown modes. It's not yet visible if and when they will be back at full production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I go with the other questions. On the cash flow side, I think on the change in the line of other assets and liabilities in the cash flow statement, this is the number of small initiatives heading up to this 127 million improvement. For example, tax-related things are here included which is one important part. On the pension top-up, I think we are exactly there where we have communicated when we negotiated post BOC acquisitions with the trustees here. I think there is no change. So we are sticking to the guidance, which we had given two years ago, which is roughly &#x20AC;90 million contribution for this year. This is now compared to the previous year on a monthly basis and working through the numbers of the different quarters. So from that perspective, pension top-up as planned.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx side, as we discussed earlier, of course, with the significant ramp-up in the tonnage pipeline, we are working through a number of projects which is in strong contribution for the CapEx development in 2009. On the other hand, of course, we see reductions in the gas and distribution equipment when it comes to volume declines. From an average perspective, the guidance was 13% across the cycle, 13% CapEx sales ratio. And we have split this into half tonnage and the other half gas distribution equipment and one-third of the other half, so one fixed related to maintenance and repair.</p>
          <p>We assume from a total perspective that we are ending up within 2009 roughly on &#x20AC;1.35 billion CapEx level, which I think is the most accurate guidance I can give. And in 2010, when you walk through the book &#x2013; when you go through the quarters, we will see a further reduction if no further tonnage pipeline contracts would be signed. But that is much too early and I think we are still negotiating a couple of contracts, and as you know, we have signed up in quarter four, for example, an additional tonnage contract. So I think we are quite busy here that this would be too early to talk about the further reduction. I would rather speak to our average CapEx pipeline, which is 13% CapEx sales ratio is Gases.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry for what happened. Yes, sorry, I will try with four questions, sorry for that. First, the two last ones should be quite straightforward, but the first one is really to come back on the order intake in Engineering, quite a weak quarter for the order intake in Engineering and I was wondering and I don't know if you could elaborate on &#x2013; or what's the portfolio of projects you are currently discussing and how long kind of the customer postponed these projects. In other words, how long do you believe we could continue to see those weak quarters in terms of the order intake? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is the financial question, just if I can get the reconciliation on the evolution between 31st December at the end of the Q1 for the gross debt in the balance sheet? If I look at the balance sheet, the gross is down 59 million, when I look at the mix of redemption in new loan issuance, it's a decline of 259 million we should have expected. So there is a 200 million difference and I'd like to know if that's all related to currency or there is some change of consolidation that explains this difference?</p>
          <p>The third question is in the cylinders in the bulk, and I wonder if you could share with us the pricing index, so we can compare your performance to the two other gas companies? And last question related to the productivity gains, I've noted a little more than 1% reduction of the employees at the group level and at the gas level for &#x2013; in your report. I am wondering if you could put some figures &#x2013; some light on the flexibility you have on the employee side in order to match your productivity targets? That's for my questions. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I am taking the first one that you suggested on order intake for Engineering. Jean, as you maybe remember, we have been quite successful indicating our pipeline virtually at the turn of the year with the order intake from India. That order could have well been booked into January if the customer would have waited the little bit. This is the life of engineering contractors. These are singular events, which might take place one week or the next. But in general, you're right, there is a reluctancy in awarding big contract at the moment. We are very much engaged in the Gulf region and there is a good possibility that in Q2, we might register a good order &#x2013; significant order intake from that part of the world.</p>
          <p>In terms of the rest of the geographies, I can tell you that we are seeing a resilience of contracts, which at let's say, two, three months ago, were quite at risk. I'm talking about big petrochemical projects in Venezuela, for instance, or in Russia, which we are executing more or less at sight, meaning that the customer is paying us in installments and we execute the projects according to the installments only. So you see very marginal order intake increments, but the projects are all going ahead. So a slight optimism, definitely not euphoria, but I'm confident that this situation will turn to the better maybe still within the course of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Related to the balance sheet question and the gross debt development, this is mainly related to currencies and to derivatives within our net investment hedge structure. So it is &#x2013; from a cash flow perspective, we have paid back debt. And on the balance sheet perspective, we have still currency, mainly the increase through the debt figure, which is on the one hand currency and on the other hand, the fair value hedges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding to the development of the cylinder business and the bulk business and the pricing index here. I think we don't split this for all the different segments as always, but I think I've given a good overview from development when we talk about volume, when we talk about the cylinder development here on the rental side and on the volume side. So we have an overall positive contribution from the pricing side; otherwise, we would look very different.</p>
          <p>On the productivity improvement, yes, this is a reduction of employees across all geographies. I mean as I mentioned earlier, we have started within North America first, but now of course, we are going through all other regions where we see significant capacity adjustments we have to adopt here this structure within our set up also related to employees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But should we expect an acceleration of the employee reductions as the next quarter as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's definitely the case. Although overall number is roughly 3,000 across the gas set up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Just kind of following on really from your comments back at Q4 and you also alluded to it today in terms of your concern or either possible customer bankruptcies. Clearly it's almost impossible to forecast what may happen going forward, but have you seen any noticeable change in the trend in the last few weeks or any unexpected bankruptcies coming to the fore, or is it very much the case from your perspective of waiting to see what happens in the second half? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's nothing significant which we can report here luckily. So compared to Linde Basel there was nothing which is comparable. Of course, Chrysler went into bankruptcy which was a very small number for us, not mentionable here. So from that perspective, we only can work actively with our working capital management against potential customer bankruptcies. This is the only thing which we really can do that we do not run up your account receivables if you feel nervous with your customer base, I think this is the answer I can give you.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks very much. Just two very quick questions, first one on the change in provisions 79 million, sorry to ask again, but just to clarify, did I get it right that there was no cash outflow for &#x2013; well, no big impact from HPO outflows or pension top-ups in the 75 million &#x2013; 79 million, sorry.</p>
          <p>And then the second question on project contributions. I think you did say that we shouldn't expect any big impact from these new projects in 2009 but rather 2010, and I was just wondering if you could clarify is it because of the size of all these 17 or 18 projects, or is it because they are all due towards the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I hope I get all your &#x2013; I got all your questions. On the provisional side, yes, this is not related to the pension development, it was related as I said earlier to the operational performance of Linde Engineering. I think this is the answer I can give to that question. The others I had difficulties to understand to be very honest, because your voice was on a very low level here. I don't know if we get additional problem with the line but can you repeat this, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I was asking about the contribution from new projects &#x2013; on 70 new projects. I think you said that we should expect the bigger impact for 2010, not 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I was just wondering why this was the case? Is it a matter of the average size of all these projects or it is because they're all due towards the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, this is a mixed impact, I mean not only because of the size, it's also because of the ramp-up date which is rather second half of 2009 and then bigger projects in 2010. We do have ramp ups in 2009, but this is more a joint venture activity driven here. And therefore, it's not a top-line contribution.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, I need to come back on the project situation, because in the quarterly report, you mentioned that there were a couple of more plants coming on stream in the first quarter than in the first quarter last year. Can you possibly quantify the number and also possibly quantify the impact this had on your underlying sales growth in Gases?</p>
          <p>And the second question refers to your relatively cautious comments on a rebound in March that you've seen Asia. I am just wondering whether you could give us at least a slight flavor for what's happening in April, is this continuing or has this come to a halt again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first of all, the quarterly communication on the ramp up, this is not new projects. I was referring to good projects.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is referring to additional volumes out of projects, which went already on stream in last year. So there is no new project which re-went on stream within the first quarter. It is in --</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Rhian Tucker from Credit Suisse in London. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Most of them have already been answered. I'd just like to go back to two accounting details. The first is this 20 million of restructuring charges. Can you explain why you didn't take those as an exceptional item, given you've previously and historically taken integration charges as exceptional items? You also said the 50 million will come in the next month. Does that mean in Q2 or spread over the course of this year?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is on the IFRIC adjustment. The guidance for this year seems to have gone down for the contribution from that. Is that because the tonnage plants you have are having less volume and you haven't won any new business there? Can you just explain that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Starting with this first, Rhian, it is about the development of the maturity within the IFRIC line in the balance sheet. This is nothing extraordinary, it's all the same numbers, but of course, some ended, some are coming on stream. So it's the average of the IFRIC number in the balance sheet. So from that perspective, that is no significant operational change, because of volume reduction. It's rather the opposite. This is &#x2013; IFRIC is untouchable by volumes. Only if bankruptcy was experienced, this would be a change, but volume is not an issue in IFRIC contracts.</p>
          <p>On the restructuring effort, the additional 50 million experienced is restructuring charges within quarter two and I assume also within quarter three depending on their geographies. This is related to negotiations with works councils and therefore, it will take a little bit of time more in Europe, for example, than in other geographies. So overall, I assume mainly in quarter two, but also quarter three.</p>
          <p>Why this is not adjusted in our communication of adjusted earnings? We have exclusively reserved these adjustments for the BOC acquisitional impacts, which was a PPA, the amortization of the purchase price allocation and the disposal proceeds post BOC acquisition. And that is the reason why we haven't put that in not to confuse people, but to make clear that this is something we want to get rid off in a way from a communicational perspective in the future. Last year, we had, as you know, in quarter one a positive impact to the disposal. When we compare our next year figures, we will not have any additional adjustment. So from your perspective, it's an additional effort to in a way adjust for our restructuring expenses, but this is the answer.</p>

          <p>Gentlemen, just two questions. Has the percentage of doubtful receivables increased as a result of end customer default, or the risk of end customer default? The second question is, can you give me an update on the low-density polyethylene market, especially in China? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
