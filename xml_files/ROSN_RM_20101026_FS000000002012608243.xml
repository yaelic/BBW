          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Rosneft's third quarter 2010 results conference call. My name is Alexander Palivoda, and I am responsible for Investor Relations, and I am joined in our Moscow headquarters by Antonina Kim, Chief Accountant, Artun Sechenka, Deputy Chief Accountant, Neil Potapov, Head of International Accounting, Galina Goshova, Head of Marketing Analysis, Peter O'Brien, Vice President for Finance and Investments, as well as Pavel Fedorov, First Vice President for Economics and Finance.</p>
          <p>I will now pass over to Pavel Fedorov, who will make the overview of main topics and trends, which will be followed by a Q&amp;A session. Pavel, please.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alexander. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the call. First of all, I'd like to focus on the recent developments that relates to taxes, as you have probably heard quite a bit of noise on the subject and have quite a few questions. Then we'll switch to key points of our performance of quarter three of this year.</p>
          <p>As some of you know, there was a meeting in Samara last week, dedicated to the future of the Russian's oil industry and the general scheme for development <mark type="inaudible" />. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Putin. There were quite a few of representatives of the government in the meeting as well, all the Russian oil majors.</p>
          <p>As a result of this, we have received a final decision on the Vankor export duty break. As you have seen, we will benefit from another four months of reduced trade at the beginning of next year, before switching to the full standard trade. That should allow Rosneft to save approximately $800 million before income tax, an oil price of $75 per barrel.</p>
          <p>With regards to Europe, while there is no formal decision, we hope that we will get a confirmation of the tax regime that is appropriate for us to start development of this field in the near future.</p>
          <p>In terms of the broader tax discussion, there is still intention to introduce a new tax provision for the industry starting January 1, 2012. There is a fairly constructive dialogue with the Minister of Finance and Minister of Energy on the subject, and we're obviously very much are trying to push this forward.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the financial results. We released the headline figures a week ago, and you saw that the results were fairly strong, outpacing quite a few of our international peers. The financial statements, MD&amp;A, and investor presentation were all made available yesterday at our website.</p>
          <p>Of course, it was a good quarter for Rosneft. We continued to demonstrate leading oil production growth rates. The crude production growth rate for a full year was increased, as you saw, from 5% to about 5.5%, 6%, with the total Group production, including share and affiliates to more than 6% for the consolidated subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>Our biggest production enterprise, Yuganskneftegaz, continues to outperform the plan, and the daily output stabilized for the last two weeks at 12.34 million barrels per day, after a period of strong growth.</p>
          <p>Refinery throughput was very much in line with our plans. The growth of around 12% was due to maintenance works in quarter 2. We managed to sell practically all of the additional product volumes on the domestic markets, at what we believe are strong net back levels. We continue to grow retail sales. Those increased by 12% quarter on quarter, following the seasonal growth in demand to the recovery of the domestic market.</p>
          <p>With respect to downstream margins, they were strong, but the dynamics was clearly affected by the introduction of the investment tariff for the Tuapse refinery. As you know, we expand Tuapse by more than two times, and the pipeline through which the crude has been delivered to the refinery needs to be expanded as well.</p>
          <p>Starting from September, we are paying a tariff to Transneft that effectively allows us on the sell &#x2013; on the full pass-through basis, compensate us for the reconstruction costs of the pipeline. The process will last for about 19 months. The volume of crude oil subject to the higher tariff is fixed at 7.2 million tonnes. In total, it will cost us about 20 billion rubles to construct the pipeline. These expenses have always been reflected in the model of the refinery upgrade that we had.</p>
          <p>Transneft made another increase in pipeline tariffs starting from August 1st. This increased amounted to 3.3%. From our side, we demonstrated a quarter-on-quarter decline in transportation expenses, as the flows are redirected from exports to the domestic market, and the volume of product sales at so-called FCA terms, which is when we do not pay for transportation increased due to growth of Urals shipments. This effect will revert back in quarter 4, as the mitigation period will end. Transneft plans to increase the tariffs by 9.9% starting from December 1st, so this is something you should expect.</p>
          <p>We continue to show discipline in terms of our costs. Lifting costs, as you know, are below the initial estimates, and we have all chances to beat our target, which is the growth of lifting costs below inflation.</p>
          <p>I'm sure you were expecting somewhat better performance of the refining expenses, but of course, we will continue the maintenance work at some of our refineries, mostly at our Angarsk plant and to be even more specific, at its petrochemical block. You may say that &#x2013; see that it's resulted in decrease of petrochemical product output.</p>
          <p>In terms of other minor points, some of you may have noticed the growth in our G&amp;A expenses, most of it attributed to bad debt allowance. In quarter two, we decreased this line by $6 million, as we received payment for some of the bad debts, but this line was increased back by $23 million in quarter three, which created sizable quarter-on-quarter effects. These are non-cash, one-off expenses. SG&amp;A was also inflated by payments in the CPG quality bank, payments to employees related to summer holidays, and additional bonuses specifically at Yugansk for outperforming the plan.</p>
          <p>There were a few minor consulting expenses and services that were included in SG&amp;A that led to its growth. We are now in the process of looking at quite a few, call it strategic reviews in some of our key businesses that relate to the development of the strategy for the overall company, development of the strategy for our service block and creating its operational efficiency, looking at our real estate portfolio, et cetera, et cetera. These are &#x2013; the costs that are the strictest control, and we believe that in terms of the shareholder value, to have some pretty meaningful positive impact in the near future.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position, now it stays at slightly below $14 billion. This is pretty close to the level before all the major acquisitions in 2007. More than $6.5 billion of cash, and we'll draw on the remaining $4 billion of the Chinese facility by the end of the year. Quarter four has all the chances to be cash flow negative, as CapEx will increase in anticipation of cap expense next year. And we will pay also about $700 million of dividends.</p>
          <p>CapEx plans for 2010 technically as of now remain unchanged, but the chances are high that we'll be at the lower end of our guidance range, i.e., around $9 billion.</p>
          <p>All in all, we're in the process of finalizing the business plan for next year. We'll have to make a few strategic decisions as total CapEx requirements are pretty high for our product portfolio. In line with our policy, we'll come out with the figures by the year-end directly after our board meeting that approves the business plan for next year.</p>
          <p>Now, let me stop now, and pass it over to you for questions. Peter and myself will be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Your first question comes from Pavel Kushnir from Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, and thank you for the presentation and for the call. Can you please talk in more detail about the cost increases in SG&amp;A segment in other downstream segment, so to say. You did mention that some of the SG&amp;A costs were one-off. Can you probably give a number of SG&amp;A excluding all the one-off items, so the items which you consider to be one-off.</p>
          <p>And relating to the other downstream expenses, if I take a refining cost, and &#x2013; or downstream costs, and get back to the refining cost, I see that other costs in this segment increased from approximately $170 million to more than $200 million in the third quarter. Can you please explain why this happened? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Pavel, hey, it's Peter. Thanks for the question. I mean, I think if you recall back to our guidance we gave in January as to full year, I would focus on the full year guidance and not get so concerned about quarterly to quarter movements, whether it's upstream &#x2013; and what we said, I think I'd be happy to remind everybody, was that we anticipated that unit cost growth will be at and hopefully better than the level of Russian inflation.</p>
          <p>Now, if you just look at &#x2013; whether it's upstream, unit costs, or refining unit costs, or even SG&amp;A, and you keep in mind that we've had in the first nine months of the year, I think a ruble move from a little more than 32 per dollar, to a little over 30 per dollar, i.e., about 7% ruble appreciation. On top of that, we've had Russian inflation. And on top of that, we've grown volumes. I think you'll find on all of these, even SG&amp;A, where we've had a move up in Q3, that we're outperforming our guidance. And rather than go into any more detail, I'm just happy to confirm that we stick with our guidance for the year, and that will be reflected in the fourth quarter. Okay?</p>
          <p>Can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Constantine Cherepanov from UBS. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Maxim Moshkov from UBS. Thank you for the presentation. I have a couple of questions.</p>
          <p>First, when do you expect EMEA obstruction to take hold, and for the Vankor field next year &#x2013; I mean, for how much, how much, how long you think it will last for next year actually?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, given this Purneftegaz propane government approval for the pipelines, will you consider further talking with TNK-BP to connect its company's field to the Vankor propane pipeline, or will you be just utilizing this pipeline by yourself? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll try to answer these together, but on your first question, I mean, I think you know the way it works. It's 25 million tonnes, we've produced a little more than 3.5 million, or 3.5 million tonnes last year. I think we expect production this year to come out about 12.7, so that takes you up to a little more than 16 million tonnes, which means we have about 9 million tonnes of holiday left. So it's going to take us through at least the first half of next year. And we'll come out with more exact details on our Vankor production, as Pavel said, and as we always do, at the end of the year, once the business plan has been through our board.</p>
          <p>In terms of your second question, participation with TNK-BP, and the pipeline that's being discussed today in the newspapers with Transneft et cetera, no current plans for Rosneft participation in that project, and we anticipate that our own production plateau for Vankor, which hasn't changed at about 500,000 barrels per day, in addition to the potential we see in other assets around Vankor, we'll be able to make good use of the pipeline that we've built for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Vadim Mitroshin from Otkrytiye. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah, yes, good afternoon. This is Vadim Mitroshin from Otkrytiye Bank. Just wanted to clarify on your performance in Yugansk. I wonder &#x2013; I understand that production this year is going to be just slightly under 65 million tonnes. I wonder what we should expect next year. I understand that your plans for the upstream segment will be finalized at the board of directors meeting, but maybe you can provide us some rough indication now what kind of production we should pencil in for next year, and for how long we can project this plateau.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. It's Alexander Palivoda. Unfortunately before we finalize the business plan, we cannot provide any exact figures for Yugansk for next year. But what we can say as of now is that we still expect the recesses to plateau at the level between 64 million tonnes to 65 million tonnes for the next four years, approximately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from Evgenia Dyshlyuk from TKB Capital. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, this is Evgenia Dyshlyuk from TKB Capital. I have a couple of questions on the refining side. My first question is that you mentioned in the presentation that you had some issues with distribution of additional oil products. Could you please elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Evgenia. We increased the refinery throughput in Q3 over Q4 by approximately 12%, so actually, the product output increased by practically the same amount. And instead of &#x2013; and splitting with additional output into exports and domestic markets, we managed to sell practically all these new volumes on the domestic market, because the netbacks were better on the domestic market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and what is the problem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a problem. It was some kind of challenge, because the growth was sizeable, and it's not so easy to increase the sales, the domestic sales, within such a short period of time, by such a huge amount. And if you look at our retail sales, for example, they increased by 12% as well. Our bunker operations grew by 31%, etc.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This gives me the second question. The second question is, I've got here that the refining throughput, the Tuapse refinery was up. Is it related to the modernization program, and the &#x2013; how &#x2013; what is the progress with modernization of Tuapse, there, and how are you going to deal with that, inflation on Tuapse's products, so on the modernization is completed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; just in terms of Tuapse, it's all very much so far as we expected. The process is well underway. I think we'll complete our program within the budget. That was an issue.</p>
          <p>In terms of the timing of the start on the refinery, very much depend on the speed of the completion of the pipeline. You know, that was synced up to be &#x2013; sort of setting up with the plant and completion of its modernization.</p>
          <p>So that's &#x2013; we don't really see any issues there, and once it's completed, I wouldn't &#x2013; I wouldn't see any issues in terms of &#x2013; if I understand your question correctly, in terms of the sales of the product. We really don't see much of an issue there, right because it's probably going to be one of the best European refineries just sitting on the right &#x2013; right of the Black Sea port. We really &#x2013; given the demand surge in all products in our Rosneft export division, really had seen absolutely no problems placing these volumes in the European markets. And actually, in terms of volumes dynamics, it's not currently linked to the object program, so just some seasonal factor, which we witnessed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks. And my last very quick question is about your purchase of the stakes in the German refineries. I was just wondering if you could give us some more of your &#x2013; like if you're planning to acquire retail size. So what is the view of your &#x2013; on your expansion to Europe? Because previously, we thought that you would be expanding to the Asian markets. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, I think our strategy, again, will remain building up on the back end for our pipelines, what we see as a sort of measured pace.</p>
          <p>German transaction, in our view, gives us some of the best refining sites in Europe in what is a rather unique location. You know, we made it very clear when charting out our strategy that going in and buying besides ourselves probably was not the right approach. What you want to do is ensure the maximum transfer of technology to know how, which we can receive from our partner in venture which we control.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; now are deploying a new management team. Rosneft represents at the German refineries. That will become the important core of our restructured, modernized refinery division back in Russia.</p>
          <p>In terms of our opportunities, we are obviously &#x2013; are always in the process of looking and scanning and assessing potential attractive opportunities for the firm. At this stage, we have come &#x2013; we have not come into any sort of definitive agreement of acquiring the other sites. Both Europe and Asia-Pacific obviously are important regions for the sale of our all products and crude oil, but as I said, so far, no definite plans have been made until now.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. I have two questions. First of all, can you please tell us now when you are going to post cash flow &#x2013; cash outflow from the acquisition of German assets? I mean, if it would be a fourth quarter, and this is the reason for negative free cash flow, or it will be at first quarter of 2011? And the second question is about Verkhnechonsk field, and your plans for 2011. Can you please give us more details, when you are going to disclose details? I mean, if it will be second half of November, first half of December. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Svetlana. We actually plan to finalize the German deal in the first quarter of next year, so you will see the cash outflow exactly in the first quarter, if everything is okay and there are no delays.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I think we just left out the second part of your question, and answer it &#x2013; on Verkhnechonsk, we are hoping to hear in the next few months, but as this definitely, there's many other discussions that we're having on that front, there is no firm timetable. We hope to hear in next few months, hopefully we do so by the end of the year, so before our board meeting, so we can go into this business planning discussion with full inputs from the government side. But it's very difficult to pin down the dates</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it means that the development of Verkhnechonsk wouldn't depend on the tax benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it would. That's exactly what I'm saying, is that we will go into board discussions once we have full clarity from the government on the tax regime for Verkhnechonsk field, which will hopefully &#x2013; anticipate to happen before our board meeting in December.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your next question comes from Igor Kurinnyy from ING Bank. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. It's Igor Kurinnyy. Just wanted to quickly ask you about your downstream CapEx plans. Because there were some statements I think that you made in the press that I read. So basically, if you could explain your plans for next, maybe, five years, and then also, if you could talk a little bit about the project to build the refinery in North and Far East. How it is progressing? Where do you stand on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure, I think starting with the second question, we are obviously very closely watching the developments in the Russian tax regime where it comes to the refining segments, right then. Export duties for all products. You know, we've seen a few statements by Mr. Chatelis which we now believe reflect the view of the Ministry of Finance that there has to be quotation of export duties for the refined Russian oil products, and we are currently in the process assessing the impact of that on our refining modernization program, like whether we need to modern &#x2013; whether we need to amend any of our plans on that basis.</p>
          <p>The decision on the Far Eastern refining complex will very much depend on the outcome of the discussions with the government. You know, we believe that there are ways that could still work even in a new tax regime, and we'll be coming with our plans, in that, I think by the end of the year as well.</p>

          <p>Actually, Igor, on the CapEx guidance we may give, is that we still plan to spend approximately $7 million on the refineries' upgrade. That's within 2010 to 2014. But if the tax situation changes, we may review these plans and introduce some amendments into this program.</p>

          <p>Question from <mark type="inaudible" /> Capital. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much for your call. A few questions, if I may. One on Vankor production plans. If I'm not mistaken, you previously mentioned that your production plans and investments will depend on the extension of export duties. Do you think that this four months extension is enough for you to continue ramping up production for your target of 25 million tonnes, or will you still be reviewing your plans? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for asking this. I think from our perspective, looking at the economics of Vankor now, I mean, obviously, from the corporate finance perspective, most of the investments were already made in Vankor. And as such, you know, if you look at the IRR for incremental investments in Vankor coming out to reach our production peak levels, certainty well the return that we make on this investment, there, is very high, is well above our threshold.</p>
          <p>The argument and discussion we had for the government was about the expected rate of return and disclose fair rate of return for Vankor as a whole, including our historical costs. So from this perspective, they gave us an allowance to achieve what they believed was a fair rate, and we respect it and, so we take it and we'll move on with developing the company, right?</p>
          <p>From investor's perspective, and from our perspective, if you look at the sort of &#x2013; it was more of a corporate finance size, I mean, the investments in Vankor are fully justified, and do allow us to achieve the IRRs well above our target IRR levels. But again, that relates to our marginal, incremental CapEx into this project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Thank you very much. And one more question. On your gas business, do you have any plans to expand it specifically to win more market share domestically, or to actually try to cooperate with, maybe, Chinese partners, and there was some reports on that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. Obviously, it is an important part of our overall portfolio. We do believe that our gas business is a very valuable piece of Rosneft's overall valuation. As you know, we have hand on Borski field, which is right in the heart of Gazprom producing assets. And as a field, it's actually very interesting, and very exciting development, from our perspective. That alone could be worth quite a bit of money</p>
          <p>Now the question, obviously, as you appreciate, is much more about negotiations and finding the right constructive notes with our Russian partners and sort of any interested partners here. And this is what we intend on doing, just advancing this dialogue to make sure that they have a good impression of our gas portfolio, which, as I said, nevertheless is quite impressive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe a last final question. These details that have partially been revealed after the meeting in Samara on the potential changes to taxation, are they clear enough for you to make your future investment decisions, specifically do you think that your IRR, future projects in upstream will be higher, compared to the current tax regime, or will you actually see a --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question, right. But I think the whole point here is that in Samara there were no decisions made on the future tax regime, right. I mean, what we're relying on is a set of decisions made in Samara that relate to our concrete projects and two very specific situations that do represent large scale stations for us i.e. Vankor and Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye. At the same time, the rest of the portfolio, we don't have much of a clarity except for the directional message sent by Mr. Putin on how the regime should be restructured. That hopefully would make our upstream development more economic. However, so for exact numbers, precise numbers, the exact threshold, the changes to legislation itself, are still very much in the workings. And as of now, we do not have much of a visibility on that and probably will not have for the next six to eight months.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening, gentlemen &#x2013; ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for the presentation. Just have two questions. First question, just wanted to clarify, the mineral extraction tax exemption. When do you expect that to expire in Vankor? And the second question relates to your acquisition of the German refineries. You did mention that this is sort of a know-how acquisition for you, for the development of the Russian refineries as well. But in that acquisition, purely from the cash flow perspective, did you achieve your internal IRR threshold of approximately 20%? And if you did, what assumptions did you make about the future of refining margins in Europe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Karen. In terms of mineral extraction tax exemption for Vankor, so it will be in place up until the accumulated production reaches 25 million tonnes, and we expect it will be reached approximately in August next year. And in terms of the profitability of German refineries, I think, Pavel will lead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think German refineries, I mean obviously, in terms of our numbers, we certainly get to levels that are on an expected basis above our IRR threshold, the price at which the refiner is required is a very reasonable one. A lot will depend on to what extent we monetize some of the synergies that we expect at the time of acquisition, especially where it comes to sort of procurement of crude oil for the refineries, and transfer of know how. I think that's &#x2013; for that we need a year or two to come back to you with an answer. But that's the situation that will produce IRRs well above our 20%.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. This is Constantine Cherepanov from UBS. I have one question &#x2013; basically, I have the first question on Vankor. If I remember correctly, the guidance from CapEx for Vankor for 2010 was $2.5 billion, so for nine months this year, were in investments amounted to 1.5 billion. So should we expect massive increase in Vankor CapEx in the fourth quarter, or some portion of CapEx will &#x2013; was just simply redistributed from 2010 to 2011? So basically, could you give some guidance on CapEx for Vankor for coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Constantine. You should expect the increase in CapEx in Q4. This relates to Vankor as well. This is actually &#x2013; this is connected to our planned budget and issues and to the process of payments to our contractors. In terms of CapEx for following years, I think we'll give guidance for 2011 by the end of this year, after we complete the business plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And one more question, please. So do you plan to increase oil sales to Asia, I mean, to sell more than Vankor produces? And also with respect to this, I mentioned that &#x2013; I noticed that in third quarter, the premium to euros &#x2013; if we take a look on your sales to Asia, the premium to euros declines, and this direction became less profitable for you.</p>
          <p>Do you &#x2013; was it some seasonal issue, or do you see any, I don't know, oversupply in this direction, and you &#x2013; should we expect any decline in profitability of your Asian crude oil sales going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the issues you would have seen in Q3 relate some extent to how different Asian, Eastern sorts of oil traded, Dubai, for example. And going forward, if you look at 2011, you should know, I assume that our new contract with the Chinese will take effect from January 1. We'll be sending 15 million tonnes to the border entirely by pipeline, 9 million of which we will sell, 6 million of which we sell to China at effectively the same net back for us.</p>
          <p>And that actually &#x2013; that direction will actually improve substantially over current logistics, because the volume will all be going through the pipe and not partially by rail. So I think on balance, we expect our net backs heading East to improve.</p>

          <p>I am sorry, it is Maxim Moshkov again, so sorry for utilizing the time from UBS side. But one question on your <mark type="inaudible" /> project, as far as I understand the &#x2013; one major item of the cost items for the project is the transaction of the pipe or the trunk pipeline linking the field with the Transneft system.</p>
          <p>Given this, the <mark type="inaudible" /> financing, why wouldn't you jointly consider these construction costs with other producers in the region like TNK-BP's Slavneft and Gazprom Neft and Gazprom to minimize the cost of the project per se and probably increasing the IRR for it? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Maxim, I think that's a very fair point and you should assume that we are doing that, because, as you know, there are a number of other licenses around Europe chain, including owned by the companies you mentioned. And there could be some benefits to that. So we will consider that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Lev Snykov from VTB Capital. Just a quick follow-up question to maybe make it a little bit more clear on Vankor. So as a base case, assuming there are, so far in 2011, no major changes in taxation system, would you expect four months to be the whole term granted for reduced export duty, or you would then negotiate some prolonged reduced rates, and do you think the government would be ready to negotiate it?

          <p>Hi. Just a final question if I may, to clarify on your German acquisitions. Would it be correct to assume that you have no plans whatsoever to acquire a 50% stake very from BP in the foreseeable future?
