        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, operator, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining the call. As you know, we announced our full year 2011-2012 results this morning in the UK. So let me take you through these at the high level before I open to your questions.</p>
          <p>So we recorded total revenue of &#xA3;46.4 billion, which is an increase of 1.2% in the year and we now have over 400 million customers for the first time. Our full-year organic service revenue growth was 1.5% or excluding mobile termination rates, it was up 3.7% with a fourth-quarter growth of 2.3% on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA margin was 31.2% which is a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared with the prior year. If we strip out some small restructuring costs that we took, actually the decline in margin was 0.6 percentage points so continuing the trend that we had last year and very much in line with our expectations. Verizon Wireless service revenue was up 7.3%, as many of you will know, and our share of its profits was up 9.3% to &#xA3;4.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted operating profit was &#xA3;11.5 billion or if we applied the same foreign exchange rates as we used in our original guidance was &#xA3;11.8 billion on a guidance basis, i.e., right at the top of the range of our original guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>Finance cost increased in the year partly as a consequence of our decision to increase the proportion of debt that is fixed and partly because of the non-recurrence of some credits from the previous year. Our effective tax rate was up very slightly year-on-year at 25.3%. We booked a gain on the disposal of our interest in SFR of &#xA3;3.4 billion and conversely booked &#xA3;4 billion of impairment charges covering the four Southern European countries.</p>
          <p>Overall, the earnings per share declined 11%, but 8% of that was due to the businesses that we disposed of, and the balance was due to the decision to fix interest rates. Our reported free cash flow for the year was &#xA3;6.1 billion. Again, if we put that on the same foreign exchange rate that we used for our guidance, that was the equivalent of &#xA3;6.2 billion, so comfortably in the middle of the range of &#xA3;6 billion to &#xA3;6.5 billion that we indicated a year ago. Our CapEx was slightly higher than last year, a conscious decision to invest in a couple of places, so up by &#xA3;0.2 billion to &#xA3;6.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Just very briefly by region, Europe, the service revenue there fell slightly year-on-year, down about 1.1% after the MTRs, up about 1.4% before them. And broadly, the story there was our major markets in Northern Europe, both Germany, UK and Netherlands all grew in the &#x2013; where weak markets of Southern Europe, mainly Italy and Spain, continuing to suffer from the poor macroeconomic environment.</p>
          <p>Conversely, the AMAP region, we saw very strong organic service revenue growth, about 8% there fueled particularly by India where we saw a very significant 19.5% growth, price is stabilizing and we now have 150 million customers in the Indian market. And also the Vodacom business in Africa grew by 7.1% with continued growth driven by customer additions, and particularly the international businesses outside South Africa also saw very strong growth.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned -- bright spot -- Verizon Wireless performed very well. Its share of our adjusted operating profit is now approximately 42% of that of the whole group.</p>
          <p>Just moving then onto return to shareholders, we've announced a final dividend of 6.47 pence, which is a 7% increase, consistent with our previous commitment to 7% increases. That gives us total dividend for the year of 13.52 pence including the four pence special dividend from Verizon Wireless, so a very significant increase in returns over the year.</p>
          <p>In fact, if we go back over the last four years and add the total dividends, special dividends and share buybacks, we have actually returned &#xA3;26 billion to shareholders, which is equivalent to about 30% of our market cap. We have one further year remaining of growing our dividends by 7%, the 2012-2013 year, which we have reconfirmed is our objective.</p>
          <p>In terms of guidance for the year that we are now in, we have taken cognizance of the fact that we will not get a continuation of the SFR dividend that we got last year and we have also in the light of recent foreign exchange rate movements, we have slightly changed the assumed foreign exchange rate, particularly the euro, such that we're guiding on a 1.23 to the pound basis rather than the 1.16 we actually experienced last year. On that basis that sort of restates the number for last year down to about &#xA3;11.1 billion on the adjusted operating profit. We are going to guide &#x2013; we are guiding for the current year &#xA3;11.1 billion to &#xA3;11.9 billion, so that is an increase essentially in the underlying projections for the guidance on the adjusted operating profit. And on the free cash flow, the sort of restated equivalent of last year's &#xA3;5.6 billion and we're guiding at &#xA3;5.3 billion to &#xA3;5.8 billion for the current year, so basically a fairly stable cash performance.</p>
          <p>So, in conclusion, I think a robust financial performance during the year. We saw top-line growth. We saw gaining market share in most of our markets. We hit the guidance that we gave for the year. In fact, we were at the very top of the range on profit. We have got margins coming down as we expected. The cash flow remains very strong. We have returned, in total in the year, dividends and buybacks about &#xA3;10 billion to shareholders, and our underlying guidance for the new financial year is for an increase in profit and stable cash flows.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I will happily take any questions that you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Stanley Martinez at Legal &amp; General Investment Management. Please go ahead with your question. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. The first question on Verizon Wireless, Andy, you described the distributions as this strongly continuing beam a few months ago. And wondered whether there was any consideration given to establishing a policy on use of proceeds from potential future <mark type="ph" /> cellphone (8:30) partner dividends beyond the 7% increase in the final that you announced today or will a use of proceeds be communicated, if and when future distributions are agreed?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on LTE. Insofar as network differentiation is the key part of the super mobile strategy and you've reached 35% LTE cost-coverage in Germany, can you describe the financial impact? I noted that your service revenues rose about &#x20AC;0.13 year over year in Q1. There was a good performance in terms of data growth. But could you dimension that for me so that we might be able to ascertain the impact if you gain network differentiation in some other markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. So the first question on the Verizon Wireless dividends, we haven't made a policy as to what we will do when we receive those dividends largely because we haven't got a policy for when we actually do receive them. So when -- or as and when a discussion occurs on the next year's dividend, we will decide at that point in time what we're going to do with it. I think one should take a clear steer from what we did last year that we are pretty minded to return a good proportion back to shareholders, but I think that that is something which we should look at on a case-by-case basis as and when it arises.</p>
          <p>On the LTE front, we have got, I may say, early days, I guess is probably the point to make here. So Germany is the first substantive market in which we have launched. They have now got to about a third of the population that is covered, but that is sort of 2,700 base stations something like that and we've got about 130,000 customers at this point in time. So it's very early days. They are typically rural customers because of the license obligations build out into rural areas first, and they are typically customers who did not necessarily have broadband at all previously, and therefore this is giving many of those customers a broadband access in their homes for the first time. We have seen a good take-up. It has absolutely matched our expectations. The ARPU's strong and particularly the customer feedback has been well above the average for our base overall.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of LTE going forward, I think the key thing to remember particularly about Europe is that unlike the U.S. the spectrum has been made available relatively late and it has been made available at different times in different markets. And secondly, that on the GSM technologies we actually can get more data speed out of the HSPA technologies at a reasonably low cost anyway. So it's not that we're having to rush into this space, but I think over the next three years, we are of a view that we will progressively be rolling out LTE to the point we'll have about a third of the European customers covered over that sort of period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it's a bit too early to dimension the impact, but I suppose it gives you more confidence in the 2015 view that you've communicated. Is that a good way to think of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Absolutely. That would be a very fair summary, Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks again, Andy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from the line of <mark type="ph" /> Bill Hanley at Williams Trust (11:54). Please go ahead with your question. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. This is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We cannot hear your question. <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Hanley (12:02), if you can turn your phone off mute please. Okay. As there is still no sound what I'll do is ask. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Okay, we go back to the line of <mark type="ph" /> Bill Hanley at Williams Trust (12:38). Please go ahead with your question. Your line is now open.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Hello, the line from <mark type="ph" /> Williams Trust (12:46), if you could take your phone off mute, we can't hear you. Okay. We're going have to go past that question. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>As there are no further questions, can I please return the conference to you, Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you for that, given that we clearly don't have too many questions, we will call it there. And I'd just like to reassure you. I think it's a solid set of numbers from us, big, big focus upon relative performance and outperforming many of our major competitors in our markets. Guidance for next year as I say is slightly up on profit, stable on cash flow and still a very strong focus on returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So, with that, thank you very much. Have a good day.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>This now concludes the call. Thank you very much for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.</p>
