          <p>Good morning. My name is Stacy , and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Celgene Quarterly Conference Call. As a reminder today's call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to David Gryska, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I am Dave Gryska, Celgene's Chief Financial Officer. And I would like to welcome you to Celgene's Second Quarter 2008 Conference Call.</p>
          <p>With me are Celgene's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sol Barer, and President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin.</p>
          <p>The press release reporting our second quarter financial and operating results was issued earlier this morning, and is also available on our corporate website. I'll start the call by sharing our second quarter results, then I'll take through our financial outlook for 2008.</p>
          <p>Bob will then review our operational and commercial results for the second quarter, and give you the outlook for the rest of the year. Sol will then conclude with a strategic perspective on 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Before we start, we want to remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934.</p>
          <p>Certain forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, delays, uncertainties, and other factors not under our control may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from the results, performance or other expectations implied by these forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>These factors include the results of current or pending clinical trials, research and activities, our products failing to demonstrate efficacy or acceptable safety profile, actions by the FDA, EMEA and/or other U.S. or international regulatory bodies.</p>
          <p>The financial condition of suppliers, including their solvency and ability &#x2013; and abilities to supply product and other factors detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as our form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports are referred to in the press release issued this morning.</p>
          <p>Now I'll take you through the financial results. We believe the results speak for themselves.</p>
          <p>Quarterly revenues and earnings climbed to new highs, while we continue to drive commercial expansion and pipeline advancement in all markets. Non-GAAP total revenue for the second quarter increased to $567 million, an increase of 63% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>This increase was driven by multiple growing global revenue streams, including record quarterly results of REVLIMID, very strong sales of VIDAZA and solid sales of THALOMID in the U.S. and thalidomide in the international markets.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.37 in the second quarter and $0.73 for the six-month period ended June 30th, 2008, demonstrating our commitment and focus to grow our commercial opportunities worldwide by continuing to invest in our R&amp;D, but not at the expense of our bottom-line performance.</p>
          <p>We are successfully penetrating U.S. and European markets with REVLIMID. We have made significant progress in the major European markets and are now launching in the peripheral European markets and preparing to launch in Canada and Australia. Sales of REVLIMID increased to $326 million, an 80% increase from year-ago results and up 14% from the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>European commercial launches of thalidomide are underway and contributed further to our record results. Combined THALOMID and thalidomide, net sales were $132 million for the quarter, compared to $118 million in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>We anticipate sales from international thalidomide will grow as we continue commercial country-by-country launch activities throughout Europe and the rest of the world over the next 18 months.</p>
          <p>Our third major revenue stream, VIDAZA was acquired through our purchase of Pharmion in March. So the second quarter reflects the first full quarter of that sales under Celgene. We are pleased to report that VIDAZA sales came in strong at $60 million for the quarter. As a point of reference, VIDAZA sales for the full quarter ending March 31 were $50 million. We expect VIDAZA to launch in Europe in the first quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to 538 million for the second quarter, up 69% from $319 million in the year-ago quarter, benefited by the strong growth of REVLIMID and the addition of VIDAZA to the product portfolio.</p>
          <p>Revenues from the FOCALIN and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $26 million compared to $25 million in the year-ago quarter. ALKERAN net product sales generated $20 million versus $19 million in 2007. Excluded from non-GAAP revenue for second quarter are product sales of Innohep and Refludan, which we plan to divest.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP gross profit margin for the second quarter was approximately 88%, compared to around 90% in the first quarter. The decrease in gross margin was due to higher sales of ALKERAN and VIDAZA, which have lower gross margins, and certain one-time costs incurring during the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the remainder of the year, we expect gross profit margins to stabilize near 90%, with the product growth of higher-margin REVLIMID.</p>
          <p>Regarding operational expenses, we increased our funding of R&amp;D to advance clinical development of our pipeline and support global regulatory filings. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, the company incurred R&amp;D expenses of $133 million. This is up 52% from the same period last year, when R&amp;D non-GAAP expenses were $87 million. These expenditures support clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs, including significant incremental investment for advancement of REVLIMID in NHL and CLL and development of VIDAZA, amrubicin and other important compounds. As a point of reference, the Pharmion development programs were not in the 2007 expenses.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation, were $162 million for the second quarter of 2008, compared to $103 million for the second quarter of 2007. The increase reflects the integration of the Pharmion commercial organization, marketing support related to ongoing European product launches of REVLIMID and thalidomide, and continued expansion of Celgene international operations in over 60 countries.</p>
          <p>As the global post-acquisition assimilation process of Pharmion continues, we will incur one-time integration costs, primarily related to SG&amp;A and clinical expenses of approximately 25 to $30 million in 2008, of which 16 million has been spent year-to-date. This estimate of one-time integration costs are unchanged from the last quarter. I'm happy to report that all integration activities are on schedule.</p>
          <p>Turning to taxes, our tax rate for the quarter was 24%, a reduction of about 1% as compared to last quarter, due to greater international profitability. This rate reflects the approximate tax rate for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the sequential foreign exchange effect on revenues, the impact of foreign exchange on second quarter 2008 represents less than 1% of total revenue. While the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was minimal to sequential quarterly financial results, we plan an early stage implementation of a hedging program at the end of the third quarter due to our growing presence in Europe and other ex-U.S. markets.</p>
          <p>Next, we want to update you on our financial outlook for 2008. Based on strong performance for the first six months and commercial and regulatory timelines, we expect total global revenue to reach approximately $2.2 billion in 2008.</p>
          <p>The third quarter is off to a great start. But it is important to recognize that growth for the remainder of the year may be subject to historical trends and the unpredictability around regulatory timelines. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share should advance to about $1.50 for the year.</p>
          <p>On a non-GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately 610 to $620 million. This will support multiple revenue driving activities, including the re-launch of VIDAZA with survival data in the U.S. and launches in international markets, ongoing product launches of REVLIMID, thalidomide and VIDAZA and continued expansion of Celgene international operations outside of Europe. It also reflects the impact of one-time Pharmion integration activities, which will be substantially complete by year-end.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to review our cash flows and balance sheet. We ended the second quarter of 2008 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.2 billion, and we expect this balance to be approximately $2.6 billion by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>At the end of the second quarter, the company had no debt, because the last of our outstanding bonds were converted to stock in June.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we believe our strong financial position enables us to maximize opportunities in global markets and accelerate our mission to become a preeminent global pharmaceutical company.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin, who will expand on the global, commercial, clinical and regulatory successes of the second quarter and give us a look at what's ahead on the operational front.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Excuse me. The results of the quarter were exceptional. Outstanding operating results were achieved while simultaneously advancing key corporate objectives including the continued aggressive development of the international strategy and the successful execution of the Pharmion integration.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with a review of the commercial results. Several factors contributed to the success of the quarter, with strong growth in REVLIMID revenue highlighting the quarter's commercial achievements.</p>
          <p>REVLIMID revenue totaled $326 million, an 80% increase over the year ago quarter and a 14% rise sequential. This substantial growth was the key driver in the sharp increase in total revenue to $567 million.</p>
          <p>This increase in revenue allowed us to continue to make the important investments in our research and development initiatives, in our global expansion, initiatives which are designed to produce sustained long-term growth for our company. At the same time, we have not lost focus on commercial execution, and the importance of producing superior near-term results, with the increase in the adjusted earnings per share to $0.37 accurately reflecting this focus. Strong performances in both the United States and European markets contributed to the outstanding REVLIMID results.</p>
          <p>In the United States, REVLIMID prescriptions grew by more than 10% over the first quarter. Increased market penetration and duration gains in multiple myeloma accounted for most of the prescription and revenue growth.</p>
          <p>The trends that we've reported in previous quarters continued during the second quarter. Independent third-party market research reported that market share gains continued to be recorded in both the previously treated and newly diagnosed myeloma market segments. Duration of REVLIMID therapy and multiple myeloma continued its upper trajectory with the average duration in myeloma now exceeding nine months.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the continued expansion into new markets was highlighted by the commercial introduction of REVLIMID into Italy. These new markets and increased penetration in the existing major markets contributed to very positive results. REVLIMID revenue trends continue to indicate that it is likely that the revenue run rate exiting the year will be approximately two-thirds U.S. and one-third from international markets.</p>
          <p>Our other key products THALOMID and VIDAZA also performed well in the second quarter. THALOMID product sales increased to approximately $132 million. THALOMID results continue to benefit from the overall expansion in the total number of actively treated myeloma patients in the United States, and the early commercialization phase in Europe.</p>
          <p>VIDAZA is beginning to make a significant contribution to our financial performance, with net sales of nearly $60 million recorded in the second quarter, up from approximately 50 million in the first quarter. With near-term regulatory action expected in both the U.S. and Europe, growth in VIDAZA should become an increasingly important component of our growth strategy. I'll review VIDAZA in greater detail in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>As Dave mentioned, based on the very strong results in the first half of the year and the positive outlook for continued growth for the remainder of the year, we've raised our annual revenue guidance to $2.2 billion. In raising this guidance, we also took into account summer seasonal patterns in key markets, the importance of implementing appropriate control distribution procedures in new thalidomide markets and continued reimbursement and pricing pressures in various markets.</p>
          <p>The strong operating results of the quarter are all the more impressive as they were accomplished while effectively integrating the Pharmion team and products into the Celgene organization.</p>
          <p>Let me now review some of the key developments and progress achieved in furthering our international strategy. With the commercial launch in Italy, approximately 75% of the developed European markets now have reimbursed access to REVLIMID. Progress has generally been quite good in achieving reimbursement across Europe. With the exception of the United Kingdom, where the acceptance of innovative products remains challenging.</p>
          <p>We've also made good progress in other international regions during the quarter. We continue the development of Celgene organizations in the fast-growing central and eastern European countries, including Russia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Turkey in preparation for clinical, regulatory and commercial activities.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, thalidomide was approved in the European Union and Australia for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We are now beginning the commercialization process similar to the roll out of REVLIMID with reimbursement and risk management program discussions taking place on a country-by-country basis.</p>
          <p>Pre-commercialization named patient sales continue to account for virtually all of the revenue recorded to date. Based on thalidomide's history in Europe, we are proceeding with great respect for the specific circumstances of each individual country. We expect formal launches to begin in several countries over the next four to five months.</p>
          <p>In Japan, both MDS and multiple myeloma regulatory time lines continue to be on schedule for REVLIMID regulatory filings late this year and the first half of 2009. We're optimistic that we'll receive approval approximately one year after each filing.</p>
          <p>As the second largest oncology market in the world after the United States, we're working diligently to ensure that we are fully prepared to commence commercial operations following regulatory approvals.</p>
          <p>We're also leveraging the progress being made in major markets in additional regions around the world. Good progress is being achieved in making REVLIMID available in markets in Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p>
          <p>The addition of VIDAZA to our product portfolio was a key value component of the Pharmion transaction. We're indeed fortunate to now have both REVLIMID and VIDAZA as important growth drivers for Celgene.</p>
          <p>Let me update you on our plans to capitalize on recent and upcoming events regarding VIDAZA. Last week, we held a U.S. national sales meeting to ensure that our commercial team is fully prepared to re-launch VIDAZA later this quarter following FDA action.</p>
          <p>Assuming a positive FDA outcome, we anticipate that we will be able to promote the unprecedented survival data from AZA001. The international randomized controlled Phase III trial that compared VIDAZA to conventional care regimens in the treatment of patients with higher risk MDS.</p>
          <p>As presented at the most recent ASCO meeting, the VIDAZA arm of this trial produced a median survival of 24.4 months versus 15 month for the conventional care treatment arm. A nine month survival advantage for patients receiving VIDAZA, making this therapy the first and only drug to show survival benefit in this difficult-to-treat disease, and demonstrated a two-year survival rate of over 50% versus 26% for the comparator arm.</p>
          <p>The significance of this strikingly positive data and the difficulty of effectively treating this high-risk patient population was further highlighted by the recent announcement of the negative results in a European Cooperative Group study of a competitive therapy. The competitive therapy DACOGEN failed to demonstrate a survival advantage over supportive care.</p>
          <p>Having attended the national sales meeting, I am very confident that our strengthened U.S. commercial team is ready to capitalize on the expanded label for VIDAZA that we expect later this quarter. VIDAZA is also an important part of our international growth strategy. Our marketing application that is under active review in Europe is supported by the unprecedented survival data just discussed. We anticipate an outcome from European regulators late this year or early in 2009.</p>
          <p>Once we receive this approval, we'll begin rolling out VIDAZA in a similar manner to REVLIMID and thalidomide on a country-by-country basis over 12 to 18 month period. Based on the 10 year orphan drug regulatory exclusivity available to VIDAZA in Europe, several studies are underway exploring its potential usefulness in additional indications. Included in these studies are trials combining VIDAZA with other highly active compounds including REVLIMID.</p>
          <p>VIDAZA is a great addition to our hematology/oncology portfolio and should become an important component of our revenue growth over the next several years. I look forward to updating you as we advance VIDAZA over the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Let me now spend a couple of minutes updating you on our progress in advancing our REVLIMID franchise. We've already reviewed the exceptional progress achieved in commercializing REVLIMID globally. We're also committed to realizing its full potential in a wide range of hematological and other cancer indications.</p>
          <p>Our extensive clinical trial program has already produced significant data in a number of key additional indications for REVLIMID including newly diagnosed myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and others. It is our intention to expand on this data, leading to additional presentations and publications and ultimately using the data to support regulatory applications in these new indications.</p>
          <p>In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, market research indicates that increasing numbers of physicians are prescribing REVLIMID based on the presentation of data demonstrating an unprecedented survival advantage and favorable toxicity profile when compared to other treatments.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, updated data from the SWOG and ECOG Phase III studies of REVLIMID dexamethasone, in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were presented at major medical meetings.</p>
          <p>The data presented illustrated the unprecedented 93% survival rate for patients at two years, regardless of age, excuse me, or eligibility for stem cell transplant. These presentations updated survival data previously reported and demonstrated a continuing deep and durable response to treatment.</p>
          <p>Despite the strong response to this data in the marketplace, we are committed to gaining regulatory approval in the front-line myeloma setting. We're continuing to work with both the SWOG and ECOG cooperative groups to ensure that the quality of the data can support regulatory scrutiny. When we complete this analysis and any additional remediation, we will finalize discussions with the FDA to determine the acceptability of such a filing. As soon as there is a definitive resolution, we will provide additional updates.</p>
          <p>Our newly diagnosed regulatory strategy is further supported by MM-015, our multicenter Phase III trial evaluating REVLIMID plus melphalan and prednisone versus melphalan and prednisone alone. It is anticipated that data from this trial will be available in 2009.</p>
          <p>REVLIMID has become the drug of choice in many cooperative studies, examining numerous combination therapies in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Demonstrating our commitment to this market segment, we've initiated the largest international Phase III randomized controlled front-line myeloma trial evaluating REVLIMID and low dose dexamethasone versus melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide. We believe that the results of this pivotal 1,500 patient study will delineate the standard of care for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma for years to come.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the characteristics of REVLIMID durable responses and manageable toxicities position us ideally in a maintenance setting. There are multiple trials evaluating REVLIMID's utility as a maintenance therapy post autologous stem cell transplant, due to its improved response over time and comparatively low toxicity, which supports long-term use.</p>
          <p>We're committed to ensuring that REVLIMID is positioned to provide myeloma patients the maximum benefit possible. We're also working vigorously to advance our clinical and regulatory programs in both non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p>
          <p>As a result of encouraging findings reported from Celgene Phase II studies NHL-002 and NHL-003, there are now multiple clinical trials evaluating REVLIMID alone and in combination with Rituxan and other synergistic regimens in various NHL sub-types.</p>
          <p>The first peer-reviewed publication of results from the REVLIMID NHL trial was recently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. NHL-002, an international Phase II study showed that REVLIMID had meaningful activity with a low toxicity profile in relapsed/refractory aggressive NHL.</p>
          <p>We are now already halfway through enrollment of NHL-005, our clinical study evaluating REVLIMID plus dexamethasone in aggressive NHL. Based on the positive findings in NHL-003, it is our intention to initiate our first Phase III special protocol assessment trial in mantle cell lymphoma by year-end. To support potential international regulatory filings, we also plan to initiate MCL-003, a Phase III randomized study, evaluating REVLIMID maintenance therapy versus placebo after first-line chemotherapy and mantle cell lymphoma.</p>
          <p>In patients with relapsed/refractory NHL, we're planning to initiate a Phase II randomized study of REVLIMID monotherapy. Additionally, we're planning to initiate a Phase III randomized study evaluating REVLIMID as maintenance therapy versus placebo after first-line, or CHOP, in high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</p>
          <p>We are encouraged by the clinical findings to date and by the enthusiasm expressed by clinicians to help us fully explore the potential of REVLIMID as both a monotherapy and combination therapy treatment for NHL.</p>
          <p>We've also made important progress advancing our programs in CLL this quarter. We are nearing completion of our dose finding CLL-001 trial, which will allow us to begin our regulatory trial program. Pending discussions with the FDA, we are planning to initiate our first SPA trial &#x2013; Phase III trial late this year. Investigator interest in CLL is also very high.</p>
          <p>In part, due to multiple peer-reviewed publications reporting significant activity in relapsed and refractory CLL patients, treated with REVLIMID. The journal, Blood, published data from a Phase II trial that showed REVLIMID induced complete and partial remissions in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL. The Journal of Clinical Oncology has also reported similar findings.</p>
          <p>Currently there are 13 active REVLIMID CLL trials with others soon to be initiated. Leading research centers such as M.D. Anderson and cooperative groups like the CLL Research Consortium are enrolling patients in monotherapy and Rituxan combination studies of REVLIMID in untreated elderly symptomatic patients. Other investigator initiated trials include studies evaluating REVLIMID alone and in combination therapy in patients who are previously untreated, relapsed/refractory patients and in the maintenance setting. REVLIMID has high potential in CLL. We are making good progress in important areas of research and look forward to the initiation of regulatory trials later this year.</p>
          <p>REVLIMID and VIDAZA are exceptional commercial and clinical properties. We are committed to fully exploring their global potential. Though we spend a majority of our time on these assets, we're also making substantive progress in advancing our other hematology, oncology programs, including pomalidomide CC-4047 that is currently being studied in myeloma and myelofibrosis.</p>
          <p>Amrubicin our third-generation anthracycline is accruing patients in its SPA Phase III trial in small cell lung cancer. We are also advancing our clinical plans for CC-930, our JNK Inhibitor and plan to submit our first IND for PDA 001, our placental stem cell product, this quarter. We also accelerated key apremilast trials studying our promising oral TNF-alpha inhibitor.</p>
          <p>It was quite a quarter for Celgene. Strong commercial results and significant progress achieved on a range of important corporate goals, an exceptional first half of the year for us to build upon.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the call over to Sol.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. Our first full quarter post Pharmion acquisition was truly extraordinary by all measures and further exemplifies our unique position as the premier global biopharmaceutical company. We're in an excellent strategic position with our sustained and rapid financial growth, our growing and significant financial resources, our strategic portfolio of cancer products, our geographic expansion, bringing life-saving therapies to patients around the world, our world-class people, our strong and diverse pipeline targeting unmet medical needs, our partnering and alliances focused on further accelerating our pipeline with innovative therapies and our single minded strategy on becoming a pre-eminent company.</p>
          <p>This past quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic integration plan by combining the best of both organizations. We built on our already world-class commercial team to create an extraordinarily powerful global sales and marketing capability. We optimized our worldwide presence, creating centers of expertise, focused on delivering exceptional results by exceptional people. We created global cross functional project teams focused on key products and product candidates towards accelerating development and commercialization.</p>
          <p>We substantially amplified our translational science efforts to increase the efficiency and focus of our early clinical programs while defining extended clinical utility for our products and pipeline candidates. We also strengthened our capability in pharmacoeconomics, a function that is becoming increasingly critical around the world. We executed on key regulatory, clinical and commercial milestones. We optimized the financial structure and operations of the new combined company.</p>
          <p>We continue to make significant progress towards our objective of creating a powerful and pre-eminent global company focused on building for the future while providing exceptional results in the present.</p>
          <p>Overall, as a result of the strategic acquisition, we are optimizing the clinical, regulatory and commercial opportunities around an important portfolio of cancer therapies with survival benefits.</p>
          <p>Our financial performance this past quarter reflects this extraordinary commitment focused on execution. We achieved a record total revenue of $567 million, representing an increase of 63% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We once again, for the 20th consecutive quarter, reported profitable results for non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. These very positive results enable us to reinvest in our robust research and development engine as well as improving our cash position.</p>
          <p>Building for the future and giving us a strategic capability and flexibility to respond to opportunities globally. Our global team has now launched REVLIMID in three quarters of our targeted countries in the EU. Contributing to the growth of global REVLIMID revenues, the $326 million for the quarter, an 80% year-over-year increase, but this is just the beginning.</p>
          <p>We have established a foundation for accelerated growth and are executing towards maximizing the global commercial opportunities for REVLIMID through launches in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Japan and Asia, Canada, Australia, Latin America and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Nearly 100 countries within the next five years as well as label expansion to newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Overall extending the potential patient populations by hundreds of thousands around the world, providing life extending therapies to seriously ill patients while building significant value for Celgene shareholders.</p>
          <p>We also advanced VIDAZA, that standard of care for MDS which is now poised for significant growth based on the recent unprecedented survival data reported at peer-reviewed medical meetings showing a nine-month benefit over conventional care. The first and only product to demonstrate a survival benefit in MDS. We are preparing for the re-launch of VIDAZA in the U.S. later this year with an updated label that includes survival data in the EU and we'll submit additional regulatory applications around the world. In addition to MDS, VIDAZA has significant potential in AML for which it received orphan drug designation in the U.S. and the EU this past quarter.</p>
          <p>We also made significant progress with thalidomide this past quarter, with its approval in the EU and Australia for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, providing patients in those regions with an important therapeutic option and providing us our third truly global franchise.</p>
          <p>We advanced amrubicin, an exciting and potentially revolutionary third generation anthracycline important as part of our strategic expansion into solid tumors, the major cancer market. Amrubicin, which received orphan drug designation in both the U.S. and EU for small cell lung cancer has demonstrated favorable results in controlled Phase II trials in this indication and is undergoing an international SPA approved Phase III pivotal trial, in small cell lung cancer.</p>
          <p>We also advanced a strategy towards a fully integrated supply chain. During the quarter, we received U.S. and EMEA clearance to open our new manufacturing facility in Switzerland. The state-of-the-art facility provides us with operational and financial advantages for delivering our lead product REVLIMID and potentially other oral therapies to patients worldwide.</p>
          <p>The flow of clinical data is the life-blood of a pharmaceutical company. The success of our products is driven by peer-reviewed data published in leading journals and presented at major meetings.</p>
          <p>Highlighting the second quarter were the nearly 100 studies presented at ASCO and EHA in June, where findings from across the spectrum of Celgene therapies were presented. There were important publications on the activity of REVLIMID in NHL and CLL as well as several studies reporting pharmacoeconomic evaluations on REVLIMID, and its positive impact on patients' quantity and quality of life, and its cost effectiveness to healthcare systems.</p>
          <p>A pharmaceutical company is only as successful as its pipeline. REVLIMID represents a pipeline in and of itself and is a key driver of our business. Over the next several months, we anticipate a number of important milestones, including the continued expansion of REVLIMID geographically, progress with a newly diagnosed myeloma strategy, initiation of the first CLL, NHL pivotal trials and the initiation of a multitude of cooperative group and investigator initiated studies in combination trials. But our pipeline is much more than REVLIMID. It is a deep and diverse portfolio of promising compounds in various stages of development focused on transforming therapies in areas of high unmet medical need in hematology, oncology and inflammation.</p>
          <p>In 2008, notable milestones will also include progress on VIDAZA with a U.S. label incorporating survival and regulatory action in the EU. Our inflammation franchise potentially targeting very large numbers of patients is progressing with our lead compounds apremilast and CC-11050 answering a number of trials across a broad range of inflammatory diseases.</p>
          <p>We are advancing our solid tumor and hematology pipeline. Our placental-derived stem cell program as well as our lead clinical stage JNK Inhibitor. In addition, we have a robust partnering strategy, which serves as an important adjunct to our internal research and encompasses alliances with innovative companies in our core therapeutic areas, including relationships with Acceleron, with new biologics affecting bone growth with potential implications ranging from cancer to osteoporosis, array biopharma in oncology and inflammatory diseases, PTC and novel oncology mechanisms and others. All of these products and more continue our focus on the development of breakthrough therapeutics for serious diseases with unmet medical needs.</p>
          <p>Our achievements during the quarter would not have been possible without the contributions of the remarkable individuals that make up the Celgene family. We are fortunate to have a culture that reflects the best of the talented and devoted employees who have joined us from around the world, and this is just the beginning. We continue to remain committed to the evolving needs of patients worldwide to ensure that medical progress goes hand-in-hand with our promise that patients who can benefit from our discoveries have the opportunity to do so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Question for you on REVLIMID growth in the U.S. You've seen actually an acceleration versus prior quarters despite competition. I'm wondering if you can give us color as to the key drivers. Is it share? Is it duration? And I have a follow-up on Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that REVLIMID was strong in the U.S. and was strong outside the U.S. and Europe. I think the trends that we are seeing in the U.S. specifically are really a continuation of what we've seen for the last sort of six to nine months. It's benefiting from a combination of increasing market share. We've seen increased market share in both newly diagnosed, in the second quarter as we saw in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year, and improved market share in the previously treated segment of myeloma.</p>
          <p>And also that we're just seeing, over the past sort of nine to 12 months, steady progress in the building of the average duration where we were a year ago in the five month, the sixth month kind of duration, where now, we have now exceeded nine months of average myeloma duration. So I would characterize the second quarter in the United States as a very positive one, but very consistent with the trends that we've seen for a number of quarters. We've seen just good continued progress of market share growth, and duration extension. So very pleased with what we've seen in the second quarter, and continue to look &#x2013; our outlook is very similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up to the extent that you can comment. Can you give us your expectation of the countries specifically in the EU that you would expect to roll out in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in the EU we are making a very, very good progress, both on a reimbursement and launch perspective. We've just recently submitted to NIHCE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] our application for their review. So we do expect at around the turn of the year that we'll get some &#x2013; hopefully some feedback, and we'll review that and figure out how that progresses. Clearly getting a positive NIHCE whether it's the first time or second time or third time around is critical to adding the UK as a major revenue driver. If you look at all of the products that don't get NIHCE approval, it's difficult to achieve significant revenue growth in the UK, but once you do, you get NIHCE approval, you have an opportunity to have the UK as a meaningful major market.</p>
          <p>And we're optimistic that whether it's the first or second time, we will find, we will get approval or from NIHCE and get through that successfully. Well, we've got to do that over the next six to 12 months. I think what we're seeing the good progress in Europe is on the peripheral, the smaller countries where it takes time to go through the regional and reimbursement agencies. And get the budgets aligned, because often small countries, the budgets are designed on an annual basis. And it's difficult as a project is approved during the course of the year. So I think we're making good steady progress.</p>
          <p>It's different from country to country &#x2013; got a little bit better success in some countries than others. And we've had to modify our strategy country-by-country. But I think when we look at the core markets of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, we've got different strategy in each, but we're feeling very positive about what we've achieved in our outlook for the next 12 to 18 months. And as we've expanded beyond that, its &#x2013; that's where we're getting additional traction and where we think in '09 and '10 we'll see significant benefit from the emerging European markets in central Europe and Eastern Europe over the next one to two years.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, for taking the question. And congratulations on the quarter. Could you clarify a little bit more the real timing that we should expect for your filings for REVLIMID in the U.S. in front line myeloma and also in NHL. You indicated that you're still scrubbing the data with the cooperative groups. How long is that likely to take? And when do you think we'll have an answer on whether you have to wait for the ongoing trial or whether you can file on the existing trials? And more or less the same question on NHL. When will you know whether you're going to be able to file on the two Phase II trials or whether you are going to have to wait for the SPA trial? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, first of all, on the upfront myeloma, we continue to make good progress, but we've got to ensure the quality of that data is as good as it's going to be before we get the FDA to give us a final answer. We've had good, constructive, cooperative discussions. I think it's going to still take us a couple more months at a minimum before we're going to get resolution on that of whether we're going to be able to use it or not.</p>
          <p>So we're doing everything we can to work with both groups to ensure we can do it as quickly as possible. So &#x2013; and then obviously in parallel track we're moving MM-015 as quickly as we can to get that. So we still have work to do. We haven't found anything has made us less optimistic, but we've got to be realistic that there are cooperative group trials. They weren't designed for regulatory approval. But as soon as we have resolution on it, we'll be very clear about that.</p>
          <p>On the NHL front, I think we have a number of different strategies. We're, one, very pleased to get out first peer-reviewed publication in NHL just in this past quarter. I think the base case has to be approval based on the Phase III trials. We obviously will continue to examine the Phase II data as we get them in. And if there's a possibility, we will have aggressive discussions on the usefulness of it. And we want to get additional publication so that we do, that we can support physicians and patients through potential compendia listing in NHL over the next year or so by getting that second publication.</p>
          <p>So I think the bottom line with NHL is I think we're going along on multiple tracks. I think the base case has to be the Phase III trials that we're initiating now for NHL, and in fact, for CLL also. But I think that we're very pleased with the peer-reviewed publications on the CLL front. We're pleased that we're making good identification of what the starting dose needs to be in CLL, and that will allow us to strengthen our compendia argument in CLL, now that we have multiple peer-reviewed publications there and have the presentation at major medical meetings of the starting dose that should be used for CLL.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. I have two questions. One is on the SG&amp;A. I mean, just looking at the guidance. It implies basically flat expenses in terms of SG&amp;A for the next two quarters. If you can just give some more color on that. And secondly if you could give the timelines for MM-015 a little bit more precisely, also for the interim analysis possible, in what timeframe can that be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sapna. It's Dave. Yes, that implies about flat SG&amp;A for the next two quarters. The SG&amp;A is up. Remember, our thinking was initially at the beginning of the year due to some of the additional expenses for launches in Europe, getting ready for a VIDAZA launch and also the re-launch of VIDAZA in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on MM-015, we sort of have mixed emotions about the trial in the sense that, the longer the trial goes, the better off likely the results are, and the impact of REVLIMID in that up-front myeloma setting. But there certainly is the opportunity for interim analysis based on number of events that are taken. I think that if history repeats itself, based on REVLIMID's activity in &#x2013; whether it's front-line or in any sector of myeloma, that there is the potential for interim analysis. But again, that's something &#x2013; it's event-driven, the trial allows for it, and as soon as we have that data, it's &#x2013; obviously it's blinded to us, as soon as we have any information, we would disclose that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. The first one is on VIDAZA. Can you give us a sense when are you expecting the CHMP to meet to discuss the application? And perhaps give us a little bit of a sense as to how fast do you think you can perhaps capture some of DACOGEN's market share? And then the following question has to do with 10004, can you give us an update on when are we going the psoriatic arthritis study and the psoriasis study? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, Yaron, on the VIDAZA, we expect the review in Europe on VIDAZA to really be finalized in the fall and early winter and an outcome around the end of the year. So we'll &#x2013; obviously that will accelerate as we go forward. The data is quite strong. So we're optimistic that we'll have an outcome late this year.</p>
          <p>On the market share issue, we're seeing, in the United States, positive trends over the past few months in terms of VIDAZA's market share. I think that there are several issues that I think I'd that give us the potential for making a meaningful difference in the coming months, really probably more the fourth quarter and the first half of next year, where we'll hopefully begin to see significant improvement in market share gains.</p>
          <p>One is getting the label itself, and the PDUFA data is here in the next month or two. So we're optimistic. And that's the reason we had the sales force &#x2013; national sales force meeting, to bring the new sales force together. We have a now combined organization with a very strong focus on both myeloma and MDS, and at the same time, the EORTC data that came out very recently will give us another impetus as we have the front-line label. So I think we've seen some improvement in market share gains, not to the extent that we think we'll see as the label is expanded and the full impact of the DACOGEN failure is into the marketplace, and that patients and physicians understand that you have a proven data set, and &#x2013; where on the other competitor product, you have only a failed trial.</p>
          <p>And, you have to remember that when you're thinking about market share gains, that we're talking about new patients. I think that patients that are on a certain therapy either continue on that therapy until either they fail or physicians get new patients. So we're encouraged, but we've got still work to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, to talk about 10004 for a moment, Yaron. The psoriatic arthritis trial is in randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial. The n is about 200 patients, and we've enrolled about three-quarters of those now. So I would expect, over the next several months, we'll finish enrollment &#x2013; sometime in 2009 we should be having results of that. In addition, we have a number of other signaling trials is what I call them that are being initiated. These trials are looking at validated TNF alpha diseases as examples that we're going to be looking at, such things as ankylosing spondylitis, and so on. We've actually started a small trial in cutaneous lupus. And from those trials what we expect to do is to get a good perspective on the breadth of activity of 10004 while we pursue the psoriatic arthritis and the psoriasis trials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks. Congratulations on a great quarter. I'm wondering if you can give me some additional timing on the Asian filing and what you see as the opportunity there for myeloma and REVLIMID?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Asia, it's multiple markets. Clearly the most important market for us in the near term is Japan, and we're on track for the MDS filing by the end of the year, with an expectation of a one-year review. And then sometime, hopefully early in 2009, the myeloma application will be ready; and again, we'd expect a one-year review there. And again, we're going to commercialize in Japan ourselves. We've already begun applications outside of Japan in Southeast Asia. We're hitting each individual country one by one.</p>
          <p>We have country managers now in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, obviously Australia. We already have approval in myeloma and we are working, hopefully by late this year to get a reimbursement, if not early next year to be able to really have a commercial launch in Australia. In China, we see China as a longer term or medium term attractive market for REVLIMID. There is obviously a very significant population there of people that have healthcare benefits, that have the opportunity to take advantage of an innovative therapy like REVLIMID. We are going in the China market looking at it in several different ways, there are different regulatory strategies that we're investigating. We've got, I think, good consultants there, and we're hopeful in the next six months to have clarity as to which path in China would be the best for us to pursue.</p>
          <p>But it's probably by the end of year that we'll have more resolution on that. But our view is that we want to, as we're doing in Latin America, ensure the drug is available in as many markets despite their size so that we have access to whatever markets where patients have a need, and we can have &#x2013; there's a market enough for us to launch the product. So Asia is an important part of our long-term strategy, I think you're going to hear a lot more about it over the next 12 to 18 months. But in the near term, Japan is primary, a few of the smaller markets in Southeast Asia, and you'll have more information on the clinical regulatory strategy for China over the next six to nine months.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Also I wanted to add my congrats to a good quarter. My question is about your guidance. In raising your guidance total revenue from 2.1 to 2.2 billion, you sounded a little cautious. You mentioned the seasonality particularly for the summertime, you also mentioned it for the regulatory arm certainly, and I guess you meant VIDAZA. Could you be a little more specific?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think Jason, the future is always unpredictable. We like the trends that we see. We like the results of the first six months. I think, under always competitive markets, our products have performed extremely well and are positioned to do very well. You remember last year, we had very strong second and fourth quarter results, and the third quarter did have a seasonal pressure on it in Europe, and so that, I think we have to recognize that there have been patterns in previous years in the third quarter. Hopefully our team is going to minimize those to the maximum extent possible.</p>
          <p>I think we also have to recognize that we've had great success on reimbursement, we've had good success on pricing, but we continue to fight reimbursement challenges in every market, pricing challenges in every market. I think we want to be balanced in our outlook, and we don't want people to extrapolate out without recognizing that with most drugs, there are seasonal patterns, and certainly oncology drugs, August can be slow. Hopefully not the case for us this year. And that things don't always go exactly as you want, and we're strengthening our capabilities in every market with reimbursement and pricing experts, but we're going to see challenges in the pricing front for REVLIMID in different markets over time. And I think that we raised the guidance because we feel very good about what we're seeing, but we also want to make sure that in raising that guidance you're aware that we do consider other factors that we're going to continue to be challenged by. But we wouldn't raise it if we weren't optimistic about the outlook for the growth of our products.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can you talk a little bit about the market share of REVLIMID in the U.S. and also some of the leading countries in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In the U.S., we continued to steadily make market share gains as we've talked across them. I think in the newly diagnosed setting, we've increased over the last quarter a few percentage points. We're in the mid to &#x2013; it's not exact, but in the &#x2013; we're starting to break through to 25% market share in newly diagnosed on a spot basis, on current basis, on a 12-month basis, it's continued to improve every quarter. Overall we're in the 30s and we think there's another opportunity for us to be &#x2013; probably in the low 40s would be a good goal for us to have in overall market share in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we have a lot more upside on the market share front. The drug hasn't been out as long. And in Europe, based on budgetary constraints, you tend to see new drugs like REVLIMID starting in the letter settings. In some markets, we've had more success in getting to the front line for early stages of treatment, where we have maybe as much as 25% market share in the second line, and in some markets, 5 to 10% share in the front line as physicians &#x2013; decided to use it. But I think, we're seeing the most use of REVLIMID, so for in Europe has been in the third-line setting, where some markets we have very high market share, and some at maybe in the 25, 30%. So in Europe, the market share opportunity is very significant. The challenge there is going to be more on the budgetary front as the allocation to each drug and often is capped over time, or on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>So, I think, from an execution point of view, we feel very good about our strategy, what we've achieved in the U.S. and where we're going over the next 12 months and what we can achieve. The upside in Europe is clear, and it's an individual country-by-country strategy.</p>
