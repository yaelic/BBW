        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining our conference call for the First Quarter 2009 Results. I will run through the numbers first, and then our CEO, Fulvio Conti, and I will be available for questions.</p>
          <p>Today, we will present to you a very good set of results related to first quarter 2009. Once again, Enel continues to deliver growth beating market expectation even in an unfavorable economic and financial environment. This confirms the soundness of our strategy, which protects margins mainly through forward selling, hedging activities on commodities, efficiency programs implementation, and improvements of our productions.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at the numbers. First, let me give you a snapshot of some financial highlights on chart number two. Group EBITDA increased by 14% driven by the very good operating performance of Endesa and other international activities, as well as our newly incorporated renewables company, Enel Green Power, and our Italian operations. Group net income amounted to &#x20AC;1.9 billion and includes &#x20AC;970 million of a positive contribution of Acciona's put option entirely reversed to the profit and loss as a consequence of the agreement signed with Acciona at the end of February this year. This amount is not part of the ordinary income, and therefore is not to be considered as part of our future dividend. Excluding the extraordinary impact of this put option and the results of the discontinued operations, Group net income would be equal to almost &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Net debt has increased to five &#x2013; &#x20AC;50.8 billion, due to some extraordinary items, which have more than offset the positive contribution of our cash flow from operation, despite a negative evolution of the working capital mainly due to seasonal effects, which recur every first and third quarter of each year. But I will be more specific on this later on.</p>
          <p>Now moving to chart number three, EBIT increased by almost 26% due to higher EBITDA and the write-down of Viesgo in 2008 for &#x20AC;168 million. Also our net financial income amounted to &#x20AC;316 million. This is effect of the following: First, lower interest charges of &#x20AC;184 million mainly due to lower average cost of debt and lower stock of debt versus the first quarter 2008. The average cost of debt is 4.6%. Second, higher income resulting from the fair value evaluation of our Acciona put option for &#x20AC;970 million in the first quarter 2009 versus &#x20AC;110 million in the first quarter '08. The Group's tax rate fell from 31.2% to 26.3%. Excluding the positive contribution of the evaluation of Acciona's put option, the tax rate would be equal to almost 38%.</p>
          <p>The increase versus the first quarter '08 is mainly due to the following: First, higher taxes on current income of &#x20AC;55 million regarding Italian generation and sales activity as a consequence of the new fiscal law introduced last year. Second, taxes on extraordinary dividends coming from Endesa for &#x20AC;58 million.</p>
          <p>On a normalized basis, the tax rate should be slightly above 33%. Before going through the EBITDA composition on chart number four, you find the reclassification of first quarter 2008 EBITDA in order to reflect the new organization of the Group. In particular, let me remind you that during 2008, we have transferred some operation from Generation and Energy Management Italy and the International division to the newly incorporated Enel Green Power. Moreover, we transferred some other operations including Endesa from the International division to Iberia and Latin American division. The chart shows all the effect of such organizational changes.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our EBITDA composition, starting with chart number five. Our portfolio benefits from a unique mix of assets and technologies, which means a good balance between unregulated and regulated activities. As far as our regulated activities are concerned, Enel can rely on its technological and geographical diversification focused on minimizing the Group's risk profile. Our well balanced fuel mix with nuclear at 13%, Hydro and other renewables at more than 30%, coal at almost 29%, and the balance mainly consisting of CCGT, oil and gas open cycles. All of this coupled with our ongoing hedging strategy allow us to expect solid cash flow also for the coming years.</p>
          <p>But let me give you an update on our hedging strategy, in particular on forward electricity sales. Let's move to chart number six. As far as Italy is concerned, we have hedged 100% of our 2009 production and 47% of 2010 production at an average base load price equal to &#x20AC;80 per megawatt hour for 2009 and 84 for 2010. As far as Spain is concerned, we are 60% hedged for 2009 and 30% for 2010 at an average base load price of 63, &#x20AC;64 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>In the Latin American region, we are 70% hedged for 2009 and 60% for 2010. In Slovakia, 2009 production is 100% hedged, while we're already 58% hedged for 2010 at an average price of &#x20AC;66 per megawatt for 2009 and 58 for 2010. Of course, all of this will help to explain our EBITDA evolution in chart number seven.</p>
          <p>Before detailing each division, let me underline that excluding currency translation effects, our EBITDA growth versus last year would have been increasing for 16%. Now, I will go through the results of each division and let me remind you once again that all the first quarter 2008 figures are given on a pro forma basis. First, Generation and Energy Management Italy on chart number eight. The increase in the Generation margin equaled &#x20AC;9 million due to the following: A positive &#x20AC;103 million thanks to forward contracts and more favorable fuel mix, a negative &#x20AC;84 million due to lower volumes, and minus &#x20AC;10 million of lower margin in the ancillary service market.</p>
          <p>Additional items are &#x20AC;172 million of trading and gas margin. That is the sum of &#x20AC;16 million of pure trading margin, and &#x20AC;156 million trading on gas mainly due to favorable gas sourcing during first quarter 2009. &#x20AC;189 million mainly due to the delta per value for &#x20AC;237 million and higher cost for external and intercompany sources.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a quick look at the fuel cost evolution on chart number nine. Net of ancillary services, the unit margin in the Italian thermal generation is &#x20AC;22 per megawatt hour in line with full year 2008 results due to our forward sales and commodity hedging activities. The overall generation unit margin, net of ancillary services is &#x20AC;43 per megawatt hour in 2009 versus 38 of last year. Thanks to the increase in hydro production.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the EBITDA evolution analysis of the Market division on chart number 10. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;116 million versus 192 of first quarter 2008. This is the cumulative effect of the following: First, the decrease of &#x20AC;26 million in the contribution of the free markets, mainly due to lower electricity margin as a consequence of lower selling prices partially offset by a positive contribution of the forward selling strategy and higher volumes sold, higher gas margin of &#x20AC;4 million, and second, the decrease of &#x20AC;50 million in the electricity regulated markets mainly due to positive non-recurring items recorded in first quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 11 on Domestic Infrastructure and Networks division, EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;895 million nearly flat versus first quarter 2008. This is the net result of the following: First, the improvement of &#x20AC;20 million in the energy margin mainly thanks to positive price components, and second, lower connection fees mainly due to the unfavorable economic environment.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 12 on International operations, EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;381 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;110 million versus the first quarter of 2008. This is again the cumulative effect of the following: In the Centrel region, we continued to see a positive contribution of Slovensk&#xE9; elektr&#xE1;rne of &#x20AC;21 million. In particular, first quarter '09 EBITDA of this company was equal to &#x20AC;239 million. A good performance of South-eastern Europe with &#x20AC;16 million contribution during the quarter. In France, a positive impact of &#x20AC;21 million due to higher volumes and prices, and for the first time, OGK-5 in Russia contributed for &#x20AC;53 million during the first quarter '09.</p>
          <p>Before moving onto the following division, a quick look at the Russian activities on chart number 13. OGK-5 reported first quarter '09 EBITDA of &#x20AC;53 million. That represents a 44% increase versus last year on a like-for-like basis. This is the result of higher unitary margin, better procurement condition, the increasing capacity payments and efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Let's focus now on Endesa results on slide number 14. EBITDA for 100% of the company totaled &#x20AC;1.7 billion, representing an increase of 6% versus first quarter '08. This growth has been boosted by a balanced contribution of Iberia and Latin America. In particular, in Iberia, growth has been achieved thanks to higher final prices as a result of Endesa's forward selling strategy, better generation mix with a greater weight of nuclear and hydro capacity equal together to 60%. All of this has more than offset the effects of lower volumes and pool prices.</p>
          <p>EBITDA growth of 2% was reported including the negative effect of Royal Decree on CO2 equal to &#x20AC;53 million. In Latin America, higher power prices and improved distribution margin boosted Endesa's EBITDA by a 10% versus first quarter 2008, once more improving the growth rate versus the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>And now Enel Green Power on chart number 15. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;293 million representing a 21.6% increase on a like-for-like basis versus first quarter 2008. This improvement is due to the contribution of &#x20AC;79 million from Italy, mainly driven by higher generation margins minus &#x20AC;29 million from North America due to the contribution of negative non-recurring items, and &#x20AC;2 million from Spain.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt evolution is concerned, you see on chart number 16 that net of discontinued operations overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;50.8 billion. The &#x20AC;864 million increase is the result of a reclassification of a portion of the net debt pertaining to discontinued operations of &#x20AC;296 million, which reflects the final perimeter of Endesa's renewable assets that will be sold to Acciona and negative foreign exchange difference of &#x20AC;396 million due to quarter end translation effects and a cash out equal to &#x20AC;314 million mainly for the acquisition of ESB Ireland by Endesa. The increase has been partially offset by a positive net operating cash flow equal to &#x20AC;142 million. Despite as I said at the beginning, a negative evolution of the working capital, mainly due to seasonal effects, which recur every first and third quarter each year.</p>
          <p>On top of this, let me also highlight that Enel has improved its 2010 maturity profile by almost &#x20AC;4 billion mainly thanks to the dividends cashed in from Endesa. The additional funds from the sales of the high-voltage grid to Terna will further improve our position. In the annexes you will find all the relevant details.</p>
          <p>Finally, if we take into consideration the forthcoming rights issue, we have substantially addressed our 2010 debt refinancing needs. We will of course update you with further details on the rights issue in due course. Thank you for listening. And now opening the Q&amp;A session, I will leave the floor to our CEO, Fulvio Conti, who had just joined us.</p>

          <p>Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready to collect questions both from people connected on the web and people who are now listening on the phone. We have the first question coming from Mrs. Susanna Invernizzi, Barclays. Susanna, can you please post your question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First of all, if you can elaborate a little bit more on working capital and specifically on the amount relative to the seasonal factors that you are mentioning if possible? And then if we can have maybe an update on your CapEx guidance for the year, vis-&#xE0;-vis what's reported in the quarter? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, Susanna, with regards to the working capital seasonal effects, I'm particularly referring to our Italian operation and the amount we are talking about is in the region of &#x20AC;750 million. We can also hedge another &#x20AC;200 million in Spain as well, therefore at the Group level we are talking about something very close to 900 plus million euro. With regards to the CapEx plan on the basis of what we've seen as CapEx spent in the first quarter, what &#x2013; let me first remind you that in the first quarter, we are still consolidating Endesa on a 67% basis. Therefore, this number has to be &#x2013; cannot be compared with what we present in terms of CapEx including our strategic plan, which I remind you was in the region of &#x20AC;7.5 billion, assuming 100% consolidation of Endesa. For the time being, I don't think we still have to revisit this CapEx profile. Of course, we should assume few hundred million euro less, but I think I would like to confirm the guidance for the year for now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. I have three main ones, please. The first one is if you can comment on the outlook for the power markets in Spain and in Italy, we have seen that Endesa the other day talked about zero spark spread from forward sales in 2010, and you're talking about &#x20AC;22 per megawatt hour achieved currently in Italy. Can you justify the difference between the two spreads, although the Spanish market is much more oversupplied than the Italian one, and even on a spot basis, the spread talking about in Italy appear quite high. Can you explain the dynamic, and do you think this is a set to last? And if you can comment maybe as well a bit more on how you see transferring purchasing power from generation to the market <mark type="inaudible" /> been a bit volatile? On &#x2013; just following up as well, can you please elaborate on the capital allocation? You don't directly access the cash flows from Endesa maturity dividend, and Endesa receive dividends from Enel.si. So can you talk about how you see the transfer of cash flows from your subsidiaries to the parent company, which is more levered, so are you planning to increase dividends in Endesa, do you plan intra-company loans, how do you think about that? And lastly just a quick recap on the non-recurring, because there are quite a lot of them. Am I right, that there is 190 million basically, 189 fair value of non-recurring in G&amp;EM. The put revaluation of 970 and the tax rate, which was 26 versus your ongoing 33%, anything else I have missed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just start with outlook for the year -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; on spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start from your first question. Well, Alberto, of course, starting from Spain and from Endesa, our colleagues told you that the projection for the entire year is basically for the markets is spark spreads close to zero or slightly negative. When it comes to the Endesa position, the difference is mainly driven by two effects. The first one, once again the forward sales, which has been down in the past and which are equal to more than &#x20AC;60, and therefore you just have at least &#x20AC;15 on top of the spot price if you want to elaborate the Endesa spark spread, which is for this year in the region of &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour, even something more. And when it comes to the dark spread again in Endesa, we are talking about something in the region of &#x20AC;12 per megawatt hour. So, we still foresee for the entire 2009 a spark spread at this level with regards to Endesa. Of course, the market is showing a different level of spark spreads because the difference as I said is in the forward sales, and also I would say in the good contract &#x2013; sourcing contract Endesa has.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Italy, we have just recorded at the end of the first quarter '09 a clean spark spreads in the region of &#x20AC;18 per megawatt hour, 18, &#x20AC;19 per megawatt hour, and the dark spreads between 25 and &#x20AC;27 per megawatt hour. Now, if you ask me what we expect during the course of this year, since we have basically already secured and hedged 100% of our output, we expect to basically confirm these numbers for the coming years. When it comes to 2010, we still foresee in Italy a level of spark spreads very close to &#x20AC;20 per megawatt hour. And if you look at the spot price in 2010, if I'm not wrong they are very close to &#x20AC;65 per megawatt hour. So, I think, we can still count on an average of spark spread in the region of 20s, when it comes to Italy. Despite the current economic scenario, which of course is negative, and as you know, we have seen in the first quarter, electricity demand decline between seven, 8% both in Italy and Spain. And I think the same can be said for &#x2013; when it comes to April. But as we said all of that, even in April, our results are showing an improvement particularly in Italy and I think in Spain, we are work &#x2013; well, in fact, are maintaining the positive performance of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the non-recurring items, which is your fourth question, well, in this first quarter, we have recorded, you're right, &#x20AC;970 million regarding the reversal to profit and loss of the put option with Acciona. This is the result of the fair value evaluation, which is zero now, since we are talking about liability and this liability does not exist anymore since we have finalized the agreement with Acciona. And therefore, we had to make an evaluation, which is equal to zero. The &#x20AC;970 million is the result of that.</p>
          <p>Of course, this is not recurring. When it comes to Generation and Energy margin, well, we have &#x20AC;189 million of fair value. Let me just tell you that this is just a variance analysis. So this is the sum of minus 148 in 2008 and plus 88 in 2009. Now, this 88 will be absorbed as a fair value during the course of the year, therefore they will not be repeated. You're right, they'll be considered sort of non-recurring item, but we will maintain the &#x20AC;172 million of gas margin also in the coming years &#x2013; in the coming months, sorry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>There will be no change to our policy that Endesa will carry on with its own plan. Endesa will continue to be an independent company when it comes to its own merits and they will be following the same dividend policies they have been following and announcing for the market as we have been to some extent confirming over the last few months. Therefore, you would not expect any further significant financing transfer between the two companies, not for the ordinary dividend flow that will flow at the time when the final year results will be approved by shareholders' meetings.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I have three questions, please. My first question was I mean this is following on in some ways from Alberto's question about cash in Endesa. The Spanish Royal Decree, a couple of weeks ago, seems to have addressed some of the tariff deficit issues, I just wonder whether or not that's going to improve your ability to recover regulatory receivables there, and what that means to the overall Group financial position, if you can give us any indications on that yet? And the second question was really &#x2013; just simply a clarification really on where we are on the whole asset sales program. Can I say to you that the idea that was floated a while ago of selling 30% of your low voltage electricity distribution grid in Italy, is that sort of an idea, which is alive or has that died? And then just a final question, do you have a timeframe for a decision on how and what &#x2013; how you see Enel Green Power, whether it's an IPO or trade buy, is there a timeframe you have to expect to make that decision? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me handle these questions, Chris. When it comes to deficit, you're right to say that there has been a piece of legislation being approved by the government, which has to pass through the Congress, the local Parliament. The good news is that this is about to solve the long-standing issues of running a deficit altogether and it sets the base for recovering some time during this year and the early part of next year, the existing backlog of deficit. The extent of this measure will have to be, to some extent, assessed when the Royal Decree will be passed by Parliament, and will be reassessed by the instructions from the ministers in the future. It's good news. It will help in readdressing some of the old backlog of deficits accumulated into Endesa books as well as the other operators. But it's too early to give you dates and numbers about the final recovery of the existing outstanding amounts.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the questions of low-pressure gas distribution, let me clear the air. I mean, we have received a binding offer from a willing buyer of this. We think that we have a good platform for refining this final offer that we have received. We will have time extended towards the May, the 28 to conclude the negotiations on the share purchase agreement and ancillary agreements. Therefore, we are pressing on and we will be keeping you in touch &#x2013; we're keeping you aligned with the development of this positive discussion that we're having with the buyer.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Green Power, after the Investor Day presentation, we have received more than a dozens manifestation of interests, which is a lot to look into. We will be taking our leisurely pace to look into those manifestation of interest. And as I expect, we'll be in a position to sell to a willing strategic partner of ours towards the end of the year, this deal will be consummated, this is my prediction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is coming from Alberto Ponti, Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. Yes, but all my questions have already been answered. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. We have also questions coming from people connected on the website. So I will start having a read at the most relevant of them. We have some question coming from Oscar Nahar, Santander Group. He is asking basically a couple of questions. First, how sustainable are the &#x20AC;172 million of trading and gas margin in the Generation and Mangement Italian division? Second, if we can elaborate a little bit more about the item others in the same division?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start from the first question. How sustainable are these &#x20AC;172 million. Well, this is a profit that we are going to have &#x2013; we had in the first quarter because of let's say, the positive time lag between sales to the final customer and purchases from our gas supplier. And this is a positive effect that we are going to keep and we &#x2013; and of course, we'll not be equal in the same way in the coming months, but it will be &#x2013; will remain in our profit or loss, and will not be released.</p>
          <p>When it comes to other, well as I said before, here we are talking about the fair value of our main commodities hedging activities. In particular, this &#x20AC;237 million that I mentioned is the net result of a negative valuation in the first quarter 2008 for &#x20AC;147 million and a positive of &#x20AC;88 million in 2009. We expect that this &#x20AC;88 million due in 2009 will be delivered. And therefore, this positive income will be absorbed. In other words, we confirm 88 will not be repeated in the following quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have also some questions relating to Endesa and Iberian scenario. In particular, some people are asking about, our plan as for Endesa in terms of both ownership and dividend policy; then they are asking whether that will continue to be issued at Endesa level or not? And finally, if we expect to do impairment test on our assets in Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me handle some of these questions. There is no update on the plans for Endesa. There's nothing related to Endesa's share holdership structure, we're happy the way it is. I know there are circulating rumors in Spain about something related to our placing or whatever, this is rubbish. We are not going to move on the existing share holdership structure. And we are not going to change the dividend policy, I already commented on that. I hope that clarifies. When it comes to issues, it will depend on the financial requirements of the company. We think Endesa is self-supporting and to some extent any operation will refer to the &#x2013; after the new syndicated loans that have been achieved recently, I don't see any specific need for the company to move into the financial markets. And when it comes to Latin America, we don't fear any impairment. The company is well performing. The results have been demonstrated by the first quarter results. We are happy and content with the actual current trend of the company and performance outstanding any fair valuation that we can run today and tomorrow.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is one other question coming from Antoine Metro, Exane. What is the volume risk attached to the Italian forward sales and how would the average price move &#x2013; would move, in the event of some contracted volumes could be eventually not sold?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Sure. Luigi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, assuming, let's say the current situation is going to continue in the coming months, therefore assuming in Italy a decline in the electricity demand in the region of 6% on average, we have at risk something in the region of seven to eight terawatt hours. The effect in terms of impact on our EBITDA and therefore on our profit and loss could be in the region of &#x20AC;200 million maximum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another question coming from John Honore [Societ&#xE8; Generale]. He's saying whether the exceptional item, the 970 million for the &#x2013; related to the Acciona put option will be eliminated over the course of the year or is this a permanent gain? And also, John Honore is asking whether we are planning possible further bond issue, as for Enel, in the near future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x20AC;970 million is &#x2013; can be considered a permanent gain on the basis that we have finalized the agreement with Acciona. The only hypothetical and theoretical change could come if this agreement is not finalized, but I don't think it's the case. Therefore...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, so it's permanent. When it comes to the bonds issue, of course, first of all, I think we have to finalize our rights issue process then it's an opportunity that we could evaluate during the year or the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Sir, we've got five questions from the conference call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with the first one.</p>

          <p>Okay. First question is from Anna Maria Scaglia of Credit Suisse.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good evening. Anna Maria Scaglia from Credit Suisse. Can you please elaborate a little bit on the forward sales in Italy and the reasons why 2010 forward selling is not increasing, what are your reasoning, do you expect improvement in prices was about? The second question regards on cost of debt, can you please give us an indication, what are your expectations for the full year, and also can you elaborate what's your outlook for the full year? I know, there is issue on the timing of Endesa full consolidation, but can you provide us some visibility particularly on your Italian Generation division? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Luigi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, you are right when it comes to the Italian operation in particular, when it comes to the forward sales activities, we have just increased this percentage of two, 3% maximum. There is of course a slowdown in this forward sales activities. This, first of all, is the result of the current economical environment, but it's also a specific decision from our side to be focused on the segment of the residential and again, the small office and homeowners which requires of course more time. Therefore, you don't see a huge increase in terms of terawatt hours sold, but you see a steady increase in terms of number of customers. Anyway, we confirm our target to reach by the end of the year, again, 100% of our entire &#x2013; our expected output to be completely sold forward.</p>
          <p>Just to update you, by the end of this month, we expect to reach anyway, 50%. We have seen in these days a recovery of the commercial demand. And the price I think we are starting from a very good backlog in terms of average price, higher than &#x20AC;8. And as I said, the spot price in 2010 in these days is between 65 and &#x20AC;70 per megawatt hour, so I think this is really encouraging. When it comes to the cost of debt, we have recorded 4.6% after three months. I think, we should assume for the entire year to be something in between four, 4.5%, also taking into account the last decrease in the interest rate of the Central Bank. As you might recall, almost 50% of our debt is variable and therefore we are going to benefit from these changes.</p>
          <p>The last question, if I'm not wrong, regarding the outlook of our Generation and Energy Management division. Well, I think the first three months show a strong set of results. April is in the same line, so I think we should expect to have an entire year slightly improving versus last year. So despite the electricity demand decline, I think the performance of the Generation and Energy Management division are pretty good. So we should see at least the same amounts of last year EBITDA.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Most of my questions have been addressed. The only two questions remaining are on the cash flow. If I am correct your cash flow on operations last year was in excess of &#x20AC;1.7 billion, so there has been a small decline. Is it attributable to a bigger hit from negative working capital or is it due to other reasons? And the second question is on Enel Green Power, where we have seen very strong performance in the Italian division. Should we see that recurrent &#x2013; as a recurrent performance due also to a benefit of forward selling in Enel Green Power or is there any one-off in the first quarter in Italy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will start from the second question. Of course Enel Green Power is part of the Enel Group, and therefore is part of our forward sales strategy. Therefore, they have the same positive impact of our forward sales into their accounts. So I think this improvement will be confirmed during the course of the year being connected to the contract that we have signed with the final customer. So they have the same average price to final customer as Generation and Energy Management division. When it comes to the cash flow, well, I &#x2013; we have to compare &#x2013; if you compare the, let's say, the operating cash flow in the first quarter versus this year of course it's not so simple, because you have to take into account of some changes in the working capital. What I can tell you is that this year in the first quarter in particular, we have been negatively influenced by these seasonal. First, for &#x20AC;1 billion including Spain plus Italy.</p>
          <p>And second, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter, we have collected huge amounts of regulatory receivables which of course have not been repeated in the first quarter. We expect to collect an addition &#x20AC;400 million of regulatory receivables during the second and the third quarter. So I think most of the difference has to be linked to the dynamic of the regulatory receivable.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good evening, everybody. I just have a question on slide number six. I missed some of the details you gave out on average forward prices, in particular on Italy and LatAm; if you could please repeat them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, when it comes to Italy, I said that with regards to 2009 forward sales, I was &#x2013; I referred to an average base load price equal to &#x20AC;80 per megawatt hour for 2009 and 84 for 2010. When it comes to Latin America region, we can assume an average base load price in the countries where we are present in the region of $70.</p>
