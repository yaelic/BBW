          <p>Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Boeing Company's first-quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst and media question-and-answer session are being broadcasted live over the Internet.</p>
          <p>At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Diana Sands, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Sands, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Boeing's first-quarter earnings call. I'm Diana Sands, and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and James Bell, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>After brief comments by Jim and James, we will take your questions. In the interest of time we ask that you limit yourself to one question. As always, we've provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we may include in our discussions this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release, in our various SEC filings, and in the forward-looking statement at the end of this web presentation.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn the meeting over to Jim McNerney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Diana, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with some comments about our first quarter, and then James will walk you through the results specifically. After that I'll say a few words about what's ahead and then take your questions.</p>
          <p>Starting with slide two please. Our first-quarter financial performance has us off to a very good start for the year. Our two big core businesses continue to demonstrate strong performance and remain well positioned in their markets. Virtually all of our programs are meeting or exceeding targets by driving growth and productivity initiatives. This performance is providing us the resources we need to manage through our product development challenges while still meeting our financial commitments.</p>
          <p>Our financial highlights for the quarter included solid revenue growth, strong cash flows and operating margins over 11%. Earnings per share and net income both grew about 40%. Our backlog continued to grow and reached another record level of $346 billion, which equals over five times our current annual revenues.</p>
          <p>Integrated Defense Systems generated another strong quarter of double-digit margins by executing well on its large and balanced portfolio programs. IDS increased its backlog to $75 billion driven by a new multiyear contract for the V-22 Osprey. With one of the industry's leading backlogs, IDS continues to demonstrate a breadth of capabilities to meet evolving customer requirements.</p>
          <p>As you know, during the quarter the U.S. Air Force awarded the KCX tanker program to Northrop Grumman and Airbus parent EADS. On March 11th, we filed a formal protest of that award. This was a decision we took very seriously. Boeing had not protested an award with the GAO in over a decade. We felt this protest was necessary because of what we believe were serious flaws in the selection process. We believe we offered the most capable tanker for the war fighter at the lowest cost to the taxpayer as measured against the government's request for proposal. We expect the GAO to rule on the protest by early summer.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that while the tanker program was one we wanted to win and in fact are still fighting for, its loss should not have an adverse impact on our overall outlook. Our growth prospects for the company and for IDS remain solid regardless of the tanker outcome. The strong financial performance, a balanced portfolio and opportunities to grow, IDS is healthy and continues to build on its momentum from a series of contract wins last year. As I mentioned we finalized the V-22 multiyear contract in the first quarter and we will see our customers making decisions this year on various opportunities including TSAT and a number of international programs. In addition, we expect a decision on the CSAR-X competition near the end of the year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we also saw outstanding financial performance at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA revenues rose 8% and it delivered 12% operating margins. Team successfully increased its 737 production rates in the quarter and continues to drive productivity throughout the business. BCA also continues to push ahead on its development programs. The 777 freighter and the 747-8 programs remain on track.</p>
          <p>As you heard from Scott Carson and Pat Shanahan earlier this month, we have revised our schedule for the 787's first flight and first delivery and we are planning a more gradual ramp up to full-rate production. While we are deeply disappointed in our performance to date and the impact our delays will have on our customers, new plan reduces our schedule risk significantly. It is based on the lessons we have learned on the program thus far, discussions with our major supplier partners and a rigorous analysis of the capabilities of our overall supply chain.</p>
          <p>We are having discussions with our customers on how the new 787 schedule will affect them and we will work together to minimize its impact. I have personally been in close contact with Scott, Pat, and the team throughout this process, and I believe the plan outlined earlier this month is one that we can achieve.</p>
          <p>During my most recent visit to Everett last week, I saw good progress towards the completion of airplane one and meeting our commitments for power-on and first flight. Static and fatigue airplanes are also moving along and the condition of assembly from our structural partners were noticeably improved on airplane number two and similarly on components we've already started to receive on airplane number three.</p>
          <p>We will get through the start-up of this innovative, some would say leading-edge, program, and when we do, we will be delivering a breakthrough new product years ahead of its competition and one that will offer substantial efficiencies and value for our customers. 787 continues to see strong demand from the world's airlines with 75 aircraft orders during the quarter and 892 firm orders since launch.</p>
          <p>Turning for a minute to the overall market environment, during the first quarter, we have seen the U.S. economic situation become more tenuous as capital markets have softened and several small and weaker airlines have filed for bankruptcy. We are closely monitoring this situation.</p>
          <p>Right now, these developments are not having a significant impact on us. Our total backlog grew 19 billion in the quarter and remains diverse by region, product type, and customer. Only 11% of BCA's $271 billion backlog is from airplanes based in the U.S. A strong portion is with customers in Asia and the Middle East, where economic conditions are more favorable.</p>
          <p>In general, our commercial airplane backlog is comprised of established quality customers whose financial strength exceeds the market average. In addition, nearly half of the company's total revenue is generated from our defense business, which is fairly well insulated against the recent economic volatility.</p>
          <p>Commercial airplane demand globally remains strong and is being aided by high fuel prices and environmental concerns. In addition, there is still a significant need for airplane replacement within the U.S. carriers. So while the market environment has become more volatile, it is not currently impacting our growth forecast. If there is a more significant economic downturn, I believe Boeing is in a good position to weather it.</p>
          <p>Our backlog has never been more diverse. Our production programs and services businesses are performing well, and we have the right products for the market. And we have a relentless drive to continually improve productivity. All of this is serving us well today and will do so through the economic cycles.</p>
          <p>Let me wrap up my opening comments by reiterating my confidence in our position and prospects flowing forward. The breadth and depth of capabilities across our commercial and defense businesses is allowing us to pursue a wide range of opportunities. Capturing those opportunities and continuing our enterprise focus on productivity is what will secure an even stronger future. Potential for this company can be seen in our financial outlook, which reflects significant earnings growth in 2009 as we continue to drive growth and productivity while making progress on our development programs.</p>
          <p>With all that said, let me turn it over to James for a review of the numbers. James?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I will begin with the first-quarter results on slide three. Our revenue increased 4% in the quarter driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries and services growth. Our EPS grew 43% to $1.62 per share while our net income expanded 38% to $1.2 billion. Operating margins increased to 11.3%. Our earnings were driven by solid business performance from both BCA and IDS as well as lower unallocated pension and deferred compensation costs.</p>
          <p>Now, let's start our business unit review with Commercial Airplanes on slide four. BCA continues to profitably manage its production ramp-up while growing its record backlog and investing in its growth. BCA delivered 115 airplanes in the quarter, which along with the higher service volume drove an 8% increase in total revenue to $8.2 billion. The higher delivery and service volumes was somewhat offset by lower aircraft trading sales.</p>
          <p>Operating earnings grew to $983 million, producing an operating margin of 12%. BCA's margins reflected volume and performance improvements across its products and lower R&amp;D expense. This quarter included $50 million of supplier development cost-sharing payments while there were none during the same period last year. BCA expects cost-sharing payments for all of 2008 to be roughly equal to those received in 2007.</p>
          <p>As discussed earlier this month, we expect 2008 R&amp;D spending to be higher than previously thought. This is due to extending the 787 testing period prior to first flight as well as additional costs on the 747-8. The revised R&amp;D guidance results in total spending that is relatively flat for the remainder of the year with R&amp;D costs decreasing in 2009.</p>
          <p>Commercial program margins exceeded unit margins this quarter due to product mix and pricing that reflects airplanes sold several years ago in a tougher pricing environment. We captured 289 gross orders in the first quarter, which lifted BCA's backlog to another record of $271 billion. This represents greater than seven times current BCA revenues, and we continue to expect our book-to-bill ratio to exceed one this year.</p>
          <p>Now Jim has already talked about the new 787 schedule that was announced earlier this month. But let me discuss the financial implications of the new plan. As Jim noted, we are engaging with our customers on the impact of the 787 delays and appropriate mitigation plans. This will take time and could ultimately take various forms including interim lift capability and revised terms on orders.</p>
          <p>Now in our 2009 financial guidance, we have assumed that the 787s delivered during that year will have a 0% program accounting margin. We believe this allows for sufficient reserve to deal with customer issues and other costs associated with the delay. The accounting quantity for 787 will not be determined until the final &#x2013; until the middle of next year in advance of our first delivery in Q3 2009.</p>
          <p>Now I should point out that it is typical for new commercial programs to start with very low margins that increase over time as we go down the learning curve and achieve productivity benefits. We expect the 787 to do the same. With 892 orders since launch, we firmly believe that the 787 will deliver significant value over its life to both customers and shareholders. I want to reiterate that BCA continues to perform very well on its production and service programs, which are generating good topline and bottom-line growth during this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide five and our defense business, IDS delivered strong margins of 11.4% on revenues of $7.6 billion in the quarter. Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems and Support Systems continue to generate strong double-digit margins of 11.9% and 12.5%, respectively, reflecting outstanding performance on production and support programs.</p>
          <p>Network and Space Systems nearly doubled its margin to 9.9% driven by performance across its products and a favorable settlement on a satellite program. IDS captured new and follow-on business including the V-22 multiyear contract that Jim discussed and a F-22 multiyear sustainment contract, as well as the intent from the Missile Defense Agency to sole source the GMD follow-on development contract.</p>
          <p>Also during the quarter, IDS delivered the first two KC-767 tankers to Japan, and the P-8A program began final assembly on its first aircraft. Our defense business remains well positioned for growth and profitability with this broad portfolio of development, production, and support programs, and with good sales opportunities both domestically and internationally. The IDS team is performing very well across its businesses and is on track to achieve its growth and double-digit margin goals.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide six. Boeing Capital delivered another solid quarter, with pre-tax earnings of $61 million on revenue of $185 million. BCC continues to reduce its portfolio, which totaled $6.3 billion as of March 31. First-quarter Other and Unallocated costs have decreased approximately $150 million due to lower deferred compensation and unallocated pension expenses. We expect total Other and Unallocated expenses to be about $1.1 billion in 2008 and about $750 million in 2009, due to lower estimated pension cost.</p>
          <p>Total pension expense is forecasted to be around 800 million in 2008 and 500 million in 2009. Now in 2009, expense could vary depending on interest rates and market performance as of our measurement date, which will be December 31st, 2008.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to our cash flow on slide seven. We generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. Strong net income and noncash items were somewhat offset by a planned $500 million contribution to our pension plan. The quarter also included certain advance payments that we anticipated receiving later in the year.</p>
          <p>We continued our balanced cash deployment strategy as we invested in organic growth programs; used $1.2 billion to repurchase 15.6 million shares; contributed to our pension plans; and paid a 14% higher dividend to our shareholders. Share repurchase will moderate the remainder of the year as we expect to use about the same amount of cash in 2008 as we did in 2007 to buy back shares.</p>
          <p>Now moving to cash and debit balances on slide eight. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. We ended the first quarter with $12.1 billion in cash and in liquid investments. This was flat versus year-end as strong operating cash flow was used for capital investments, share repurchase and dividends paid to shareholders. Our debt balance is also flat versus the end of 2007. We do expect BCC to pay down debt later in the year, which will reduce our consolidated debt balance by year-end.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our financial guidance on slide nine. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2008 and forecasting significantly additional EPS growth for 2009. Our outlook reflects strong performance from our core businesses, increasing commercial airplane deliveries, decreasing R&amp;D and pension costs, and company-wide productivity improvements. Boeing's revenue guidance for 2008 is unchanged at between 67 and $68 billion. Revenue for 2009 is expected to grow to between 72 and $73 billion. Earnings per share guidance for 2008 remains unchanged at $5.70 to $5.85. We expect earnings in the second half to be slightly higher than in the first half, reflecting delivery mix and timing of period expenses.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we expect EPS to grow approximately 20% to between $6.80 and $7 per share driven by higher airplane deliveries and progress on growth and productivity initiatives as well as lower R&amp;D and pension expenses. We're forecasting operating cash flow to exceed $2.5 billion in 2008 and exceed $6 billion in 2009. Our guidance includes potential supplier advances and customer impacts due to the revised 787 schedule.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the segments. BCA deliveries and revenues forecast for 2008 remains unchanged at 475 to 480 airplanes and 34.5 to $35 billion, respectively. 2009 deliveries will grow to between 500 and 505 airplanes including approximately 25 787 Dreamliners. We expect further growth in deliveries in 2010. 2009 BCA revenue is expected to be between 37 and $38 billion.</p>
          <p>Commercial airplane margins are forecasted to be about 11.5% in both 2008 and 2009. This reflects lower R&amp;D costs and continued strong performance on production and service programs, offset by margin dilutions from the 787 deliveries in 2009.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 IDS financial guidance remains unchanged with revenue of 32 to $33 billion and operating margins of approximately 10.5%. For 2009, we expect revenues of 33.5 to $34.5 billion with growth across all segments. 2009 margins are expected to expand to greater than 10.5%. We expect total R&amp;D expense to be between 3.6 and $3.8 billion in 2008, reflecting the new 787 plan as well as higher 747-8 costs. 2009 R&amp;D will decline over 13% to a range of 3.1 to $3.3 billion. Additional guidance information is provided in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn it back to Jim, who will give you some final thoughts. Jim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, James. As our numbers for the quarter attest, we are off to a strong start in what we believe will be another year of improving financial performance for this company. We are methodically working through our challenges, including the start-up of the 787. And our people remain focused on satisfying our customers and leveraging growth and productivity into better bottom-line and topline performance.</p>
          <p>With many of the early challenges on the 787 behind us, we can see our way to getting electrical power on the airplane by the end of June, then flying later this year and beginning deliveries of this game-changing new airplane next year. Our production and services programs continue to perform well, and we are driving productivity throughout this company to fuel future growth, deal with our challenges and deliver on our financial commitments. You can see from our outlook that our goals for the remainder of this year and next are ambitious. We expect outstanding earnings growth and continued financial strength.</p>
          <p>In summary, then, our businesses are executing well, and we understand and are working on the challenges before us aggressively. Our outlook remains bright, and we continue to drive towards being the strongest, best, and best-integrated aerospace company in the world for today and tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Now with all of that said, we would be happy to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Steve Binder of Bear Stearns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Good quarter. Maybe just about your '09 guidance. I mean James, you touched on you're assuming a zero margin on the 787 program. Just assuming &#x2013; since you have not fully scrubbed, I guess, supplier payments, renegotiation with suppliers as well as kind of your new schedule as far as your ramp costs with respect to a new production schedule. Just wondering: do you feel confident? Would you characterize your cost estimates to be, on the initial block size, to be conservative, such that you won't need to take a reach-forward charge in the --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would. I would say that it's our best ability to estimate but a couple of things that we have high confidence in. One, we have confidence that we have almost 900 orders today which would help us relative to set what the pricing is relative to that. We have negotiated quite a bit of the subcontractor cost, and we have pretty good idea of how we're going to finish in negotiating as it relates to some of the impacts of some of the changes we've experienced. The area, obviously, that is of less certainty is what &#x2013; how do we settle all the issues we have with our customers, although we think we are being relatively conservative by starting out with the zero margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also related to '09, I think if you assume if the R&amp;D decreases mainly coming out of BCA and you take out the 787 sales and zero profit contribution, looks to me like you're still assuming some decline in your mature business and services businesses in margin rate in '09 versus '08. Is that just conservatism? Is that giving you  cushion in case there is any R&amp;D spike, and maybe just characterize that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Steve; it's what we've talked to you about before. We're &#x2013; prior to putting the airplanes, the 787, into service, we have some expense associated with that that would come out in what we would call our fleet support area, not out of our cash area, in terms of training manuals, things of that nature, that support the entry into service of a new airplane. So that's some of the impact that you seeing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. One other thing: in 747, are you assuming 747-8 deliveries in 2009?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Troy Lahr of Stifel Nicolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. You touched on it a little bit, but I'm wondering if you can give us a little more insight into discussions with international customers, specifically the guys that are taking deliveries over the next two to three years. Are more and more customers talking about deferring some of these deliveries now that we're in a tough environment with higher fuel, or are these guys really just seeing new jets as a way to kind of ease the pressure from higher oil? And then secondly, what you are hearing from the domestic carriers regarding recapitalization efforts now that oil's at 117? Are we still on track to start seeing more domestic orders in '08 and '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jim. Internationally we have had very little indication that the customers want to reschedule. So that's been a relatively stable situation. I think the financial turmoil as we have seen it has mostly been U.S.-centered. So the answer to your first question is, hardly any.</p>
          <p>U.S. carriers -- I think that the new oil reality is a tough one for them to deal with. It is impossible for me to know exactly what oil price they were assuming in their models as we've begun discussions with them. But we are in active discussions with most of them, and I think that should unfold over the next 12 to 18 months. And if there is an impact, we haven't seen it yet, but the new reality has hit us pretty quickly here. So I think we're all in an ongoing situation; it will unfold, but no direct indication there either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think the domestic guys still recapitalize, within a year, year-and-a-half. This probably hasn't delayed it at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think if anything the oil price situation could accelerate some moves that would, in the minds of the airline management, strengthen their businesses. I think you look at the Delta, the proposed Delta-Northwest, merger. I think &#x2013; which has yet to play out fully, obviously, but I think that is a move to strengthen, introduce more scale and insulate competitively from all kinds of price and marketplace pressures. So the extent to which this accelerates that, that could get you there faster actually.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, and great quarter, guys. You have pretty ambitious cash flow next year given the 787 delay. Could you quantify for us what was the cash flow impact on '08 and '09 from this latest delay of the 787?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cai, this is James. It is reflected in the guidance, number one, but I think which you are seeing in terms of the lower cash flow in '08 is the production buildup not only of the 787, but of the production aircraft that also are being produced at higher rates. Then you couple that with a slide out based on the prior schedule shift of about 75 787s out of '08 into '09 or out into outer years now as we know -- understand the schedule better. So that's how we got to 2.5 this year. And then next year obviously we are upping our deliveries, which will again help the cash flow to get to the six billion we are guiding you to as well as we'll start relieving the inventory on 787s as we deliver the 25 we are expecting to deliver next year, Cai.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what sort of impact does this assume? You're paying Spirit per their 8-K looks like 350 million plus that was not in the plan. You presumably have some payments to airlines at some point. What do though the suppliers and airline compensation requirements do to this cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are not going to get into the specifics of what we have assumed, Cai. But believe me that the impact of what we believe based on what we know today of cash that would be extended out because of the payment flow coming from customers as well as what we would have to pay for &#x2013; pay the suppliers to be fair and because of contract terms are included in the guidance for both '08 and for '09.</p>

          <p>I have a question about the performance of the commercial company in the first quarter. The difference between the program accounting and the unit accounting was some $330 million, which is the largest number we have ever seen, I think, in a single quarter. And 71 million of it, which is pretty much consistent with what we've been seeing, is related to the 777-300 ER. I wondered if you could sort of tell us what was going on that caused the actual performance to be so different from the assumed program performance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, some of it was &#x2013; again, we're still experiencing the impact of the more aggressively priced airplanes several years ago that we are delivering which as you know has a more profound impact on unit margins and programs. And then coupling that with the mix that was delivered in the quarter had the -- increased the gap a bit based on what's in the accounting quantity relative to that mix and the pricing associated with it, Joe.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are only talking about the difference in pricing on 777; there is a mix difference also that would be associated with better-priced airplanes out in the out years, Joe.</p>

          <p>You have the portfolio size at Boeing Capital going down this year and next year &#x2013; does that mean that you won't finance any of the American planes that they are going to get next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>George, that doesn't mean that. What it does mean is we are preparing ourselves in the event it's necessary to use BCA, BCC and our balance sheet in order to finance airplanes. Right now given what we know we are not anticipating we'll need to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what's the thinking, James? Intuitively with the tighter credit out there now, I would think that Boeing Capital Corp would be in the mode of being called on more to increase their financing. So are you taking a different view on that as to what Boeing Capital Corp will do in saying that the portfolio size is going to be lower in '08 and '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, in our current backlog we see that the XM base is going to finance about 80% of it. And what I did say to you is that we have over the last several years have been preparing BCC and the Boeing balance sheet that if called upon we can answer the call. Right now, we don't have any information that suggests we will be, but if we are, we will deal with it then, and BCC and the Boeing backlog will be more than able to do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your projection of lower is just assuming that the environment, economic environment doesn't get any worse than what it is today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well George, this is Jim. I mean, there is two things. One, we see what we see on the economic environment, and secondly, in contrast with coming out of 911, where much less than half our planes were financed XM internationally, we now have 80% of them financed XM internationally, which puts us in a stronger position to absorb any financing requirements we have. And that's James's point; we have run the portfolio down. So we have plenty of capacity to deal with it if we need to, and what we have to deal with will be significantly less than the last recession we had.</p>

          <p>On BCA margins in your guidance for '08, you've added 400 million more to R&amp;D, and yet you've kept the margins at the same level. Could you talk about what the sources of improvement are and I would say if there is a way to divide that into the '37, the 777 and overhead reduction, what's allowed you to essentially bring the ex-R&amp;D margins up?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>All of it. I mean, it's our absolute focus on productivity; it's the benefit we are getting from the moving line and 777 as we continue to experience good progress on that implementation. It's the productivity we are getting on '37 as we continue to harvest that mature program and the mature concept that is deployed there on the moving line. And it is our efforts on really looking at every cost that doesn't end up in our products to see how we can be more productive in doing those activities that create those costs and driving those costs down while we increase the quality of that effort. It's all of it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk a little bit about the IDS growth maybe from a program basis, what's driving that in '09? The midpoint is around 5% which is a little bit stronger than I would have thought. And then secondly, Jim, can you maybe just talk about how you feel about the competitive position of IDS moving forward? I mean, even beyond Tanker, the win rate on some of big programs hasn't been that great recently. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. I mean &#x2013; I think the current growth is across the board. I mean it's &#x2013; all the production programs are running well. FCS, GMD, very high award fees, recent reaffirmation of our status as the systems integrator. Those are big, big programs, as you know. C-17 sustainment, the multiyears on Apache and F-18 &#x2013; we're at the midpoint there. Some international orders that we're now delivering on in Korea, Singapore, other places. So -- it's SPI net. So it's really an across-the-board story.</p>
          <p>And also, as you know, we have divested a couple of businesses over the last couple of years and &#x2013; which sort of muddied the growth look at IDS, and we are now beginning to outrun some of that. And so having said all of that currently, the order rate &#x2013; the facts are we won nine big competitions last year, as I think we have pointed out, nine of 11 of the major competitions we were in. That is one hell of a record, quite frankly. And admittedly, we have lost one or two since. But okay, so now it's nine out of 13. So our hit rate recently has been very, very high. And when you look at this year and see a number of international orders that promise to come through and a number of major orders in the United &#x2013; satellite orders in the United States and a couple of other ones, I think, even if we return to our normal hit rate, the two-year period would have been outstanding by any measure in terms of new business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the assumption this year is that we will &#x2013; that obviously we'll continue and we'll also be continuing production next year; that is the assumption. And as you know, the international order base continues to strengthen. The smoke signals out of Washington are strong right now in terms of an '08 supplemental and a potential order in the '09 base budget next year. So we feel -- we are always a little bit on tenterhooks here, but we feel relatively strong about the prospects short- and medium-term of C-17.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, when you -- James, I guess -- when you go through and analyze the range of possible additional costs on these customer penalties and supplier support, in totality what's the highest negative cost outcome that's realistic? I mean, does that number ever exceed four billion? We are really struggling on the outside to conceptualize this. I mean, if we kind of think of it as two to four billion, is that a reasonable bandwidth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Heidi, you know the fact of the matter is, we go through and struggle with that same thing ourselves. And with the information we have today it's hard to set a number. And that's why we obviously have taken the position that we are going to start off booking the program at a zero margin to make sure we have adequate reserve in order to deal with that. I can't predict what the number will be. I just know that our past history would suggest that we do a pretty good job of mitigating that and not having it roll through to be a significant impact to our financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, you gave us color on when you're going to make the decision on the program block, but maybe can give us more transparency on the process of how will you make the determination through the accounting block size for earnings recognition? And when we look at all of this backlog that you have, obviously the implications of the entire nonrecurrings is very different, if you use a 400 block or an 800 block. Can you walk us through the process of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can, I can, Heidi. Let me start with history. Typically when we get to a point of delivering the first airplane, we've sold about a hundred, just in round numbers on our new airplane models. And as you mentioned, typically the block turns out to be -- the initial block turns out to be in about the 400-airplane range. So what that is beyond the known order, as you look at what the market potential is for the airplane, you look at a time period over which you can estimate your cost and estimate your revenue. And so you take those things in consideration and then you settle on what the accounting quantity is and then what your booking margin ought to be on these airplanes as you deliver them.</p>
          <p>Well, in the case of the 787, we're going to have probably a thousand sold by the time we deliver it. So we're going to be more constrained by -- which obviously gives us great opportunity over a time period to produce good earnings and value for both us and our customers, and it also gives you great capacity to deal with unknowns that you don't understand -- you'll experience as you look back to today. But &#x2013; so what we'll be more constrained about is what we will be able to estimate over a time period and what we will be able to produce in that time period. So you can get the significant opportunity we are going to have on the initial opening quality here, but what we see today and what we understand based on what our contracts have in them, based on our very, very preliminary discussion with our customers, it's hard to estimate what the customer settlements will be, but we do believe that whatever the opening quantity will be based on the criteria I just described, there will be significant profitability in the program today to cover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's interesting. So basically in the scenarios on this additional program block, you're saying that in every scenario the costs are still less than the revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay; thank you. And then one last one, if you don't mind. Again a bit of a devil's advocate question for you. You had one 747 order in Q1 and a great bookings quarter of 289 planes. You had 25 747s in '07, yet you are raising the R&amp;D and raising the nonrecurring on the 747. You have gone from some two -- changes on the wings that started off mildly to what looks like to a whole new wing design which is kind 3 to $4 billion. Help us understand: why is that the right answer? I mean, when you see customers backing out the door to buy 787s and your costs are rising on the plane, we can understand it, but in this situation your costs are rising and we are not getting confirmation for higher customer demand. Could you walk us through your rationale there?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Heidi, this is Jim. I think we have about 110 orders for both the freighter and the passenger. And I think James just talked historically about models we have introduced at about that rate. And so we are already there and we are still over a year away from introduction. Now having said that, I'd be less than candid if I didn't tell you I wish we had more intercontinental orders, which is, I think, while you were talking about, Heidi, the passenger version.</p>

          <p>No, but we're in discussions with about eight to ten -- serious discussions with eight to ten major carriers. It's impossible for me predict how many of those will order, but typically when we're at the stage, a large number of them would. So I think we are still basing our spending on what we perceive to be the market and, oh by the way, we are off to a pretty good start with 110 orders with over a year to go before we have to set accounting quantities and the like. But I also wish we had another couple major intercontinental orders right now, and the guys are really working hard at that, and I think there is good chance we'll have some soon.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is on your production rate on non-787 models. Your 2009 guidance shows flat production on non-787. You've said that you are studying the '37 a few months ago. I'm wondering if you've come to any conclusion there. And I'm wondering on the '67 if there is any thought as to when we might see an uptick, potential uptick, there for interim lift for '87 customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your observation is correct on the non-'87 production rates <mark type="inaudible" /> and as you know, we are pausing after a series of increases on -- across our model line. And we are taking a hard look at the '37, Joe. I mean I think the -- it's fair to say if the economic situation doesn't deteriorate into something that we don't currently anticipate, if that doesn't happen, that the bias would be to the upside there, longer term after '08. But we have time to make that call. And so we will take that time to make that call, as we are moving forward.</p>
          <p>But on the '67, the death of that program has been predicted for many years, and the demand over the last couple of years has been strong even without the tanker situation. So I think we're out to like 11 or 12 on that program right now. And so that's another decision we don't have to face into. And believe it or not, we're having honest to God discussions with people right now about that airplane. So it could extend beyond that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I want to go back to the R&amp;D. You kind of -- I mean, we all live in glass houses in one form or another, and you sort of had to go through this a couple of times and raise that. Is there any change in process that, Jim, that you need to look at in terms of helping you think about estimates for programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can be better. I think if you're looking for a root cause, it would probably center on the '87 development. As we've struggled with getting the supply chain in place and the costs associated with recovering from that, we have been forced to keep an experienced set of engineers on that program that had been planned to go on off to other programs, the 47-A. That increased costs as we scramble to find the engineering capacity we need, the training we need, outside help supplementation from time to time, a little more costly. So I think part of what you're seeing is the scramble.</p>
          <p>But having said that, I'm not happy and Scott Carson is not happy with our inability to get our arms around predicting the development cost. The business case for both airplanes remains good. But we need to do a better job there, and we're working hard to do that. And we do not have a shortage of business reviews around the subject.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sort of a broader strategic question for you, Jim. If the tanker stays with EADS, and Airbus ends up setting up a wide-body production line in North America, I mean how does that change the kind of strategic outlook for the industry? I mean what -- how do you have to consider that now if you got your competitor here in a dollar cost structure putting together wide bodies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean I think it wouldn't change the nature of their business. It would -- and it wouldn't introduce another competitor, but it would change where they produce or have the capacity to produce some things, so ultimately it gets down to a dollar-based production site.</p>
          <p>If they end up winning this thing, believe me, that site will be preoccupied with modifying freighters made in France for a long time. So I'm not sure they'd immediately convert that into something else. So it's more of a geographic deployment. They've announced similar things in China, U.S. They have got lots of dispersed production in Europe. It will not be an uncomplicated supply chain for them to manage, by the way, as you look at it from managing manufacturing operations; it will be tough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one follow-on, if I may -- I think everybody else did -- when you look at your suppliers, everything from raw material down to your Tier 1s, Tier 2s on the legacy programs, I mean, how is the supply chain doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the legacy programs it's doing fine, not that it doesn't labor from time to time. I think the team quite frankly is doing an excellent job on the legacy programs. We've -- we go through periods where certain raw materials are scarce, other periods where quality problems are found. But I would categorize them as being well managed and less difficult than you probably imagine. Most of our supply chain issues have been centered around the 787 development, and those are well chronicled. So I'm not trying to paint a picture that we are not managing it every day; we are. But we have had no major disruptions in our production, and with our fingers crossed we think we can keep that record going.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, you've already noted earlier in the call the prevailing weakness in the broad economy and Boeing's very impressive backlog here. You've said many times, and you alluded to this earlier, that you've resisted temptation to over-ramp at BCA. So with that said, what kind of backlog erosion could Boeing tolerate before 2009 and let's say 2010 production plans would be impacted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer your question by way of citing another stressful time, and that would be the recession 2000 and then closely followed by 911. I think when you look what happened there, roughly 6 or 7% of our orders ended up being cancelled, and that was a very tough situation. There were a number of reschedules, pushouts; the -- and a number that -- the majority didn't change. But we managed to work through with our customers who were facing difficult headwinds, to say the least, at that time. And a lot of those orders were in U.S.-based carriers then. And as you heard me earlier describe, that is in contrast where we are today where the vast majority of our orders, 80% plus, are with international carriers backed by XM financing.</p>
          <p>So we are in a stronger backlog position today if you use -- and all you can do, all you can use is data here because you can't predict the future. So if you had exactly the same situation happen to you as happened to you in 2001, same kind of pressures although differently constructed, you could end up with something like that. And I think the -- given that we have constraints on most of our product lines right now, we can't get people airplanes right now. And as you say we are sort of a bias to be cautious on the rate increases, even though we are increasing, but the -- you add that all up, we have shown an ability to manage it in the past and when we've gotten whacked. We're in a pretty conservative position going in, in the sense we have more orders than we have production. And so, could there be some impact? Yes. Would it be a major thing? Probably not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me make sure I understand you, because I think you just said that if you had a 6 to 7% cancellation deferral environment, we would see a similar trend that we saw following 911. Is that what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm just saying &#x2013; no. Because there were other factors that impacted our financial performance. I was only dealing with the question of volume, and I was simply pointing out that at that time we had more than 6% deferrals, okay? 6% cancellations is what I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we tend to assume that kind of cancellation rate in our -- as we put together our business plans and our financial promises.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because people are going to look to the ramp-down from the '01 production rate of over 500 to the 240 or so two years later. And I want to clarify that that is not what you're talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you are right. I mean, that is not what I'm trying to portray, and I can see why I confused you. What I am trying to say is that 6% orders loss, we're in a much more -- and a lot of that ramp-down was a result of push-outs -- but we're in a much stronger position today in that we're insulated from economic conditions with most of our orders outside the United States, XM backed financing. So you would see a lot less deferrals in my opinion this time around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, do you think given the diversification of the backlog and the strength of it, six-plus years of production, that if there were cancellations or deferrals, other customers would be more willing to slip forward?</p>

          <p>This has to do a little bit more with the deliveries on 787 kind of in the out years. Some of the customers who have airplanes that are way at the end of the delivery line here are kind of expressing a little bit of concern that the delays will kind of cascade down through the chain. Do you have any sense yet of how far down the airplanes may be delayed by the slower ramp-up? Is there a scenario that all 900 of them could be delivered later than people had thought?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Lynn, this is Jim. We don't believe that the slide will impact all 900. Having said that, we are still working through exactly what the impact will be. As you know, I think we have told you what's going to happen in '09 and that the ramp will be slower after that and full rate production in 2012. But we are seeing if that could be pulled in. We don't know. And we're seeing what we can do to ramp up beyond that, after that, which would &#x2013; both of those could significantly improve the situation. And when we have thought through that, we'll be able to be more precise with everybody. But we don't see a scenario where all 900 would be delivered late.</p>

          <p>Hi. You said that earlier, Jim, that EADS, if they were to end up winning the tanker contracts, would face a complicated supply chain. And I just wondered, given your own experiences with the 787, what have you learned in terms of supply chain issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have learned a lot and have the scars to prove it. I guess would be my summary on the '87. I mean I think having real-time visibility of your partner's inventory as well as their WIP as they are assembling things. So a global understanding of how things are coming together down through Tier &#x2013; down to all the way down to Tier 3 and 4 would have helped us a lot. So IT visibility like we had on the engineering side. And so there's some learning there for us. We are already doing it differently. And whether Airbus chooses to learn from that or not is something that &#x2013; but nonetheless, they will be confronted with similar challenges, and I think they know it will not be easy.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think our strategy will be the same. We believe that global leverage is important both from a cost and risk mitigation standpoint. But I &#x2013; we might draw some lines in different places now that we understand our own capabilities better, understand the capabilities of our partners. I think we've all learned, and I think it will be more of an adjustment to the strategy than a change in strategy.</p>

She characterized a change to the 747-8 program that the wing, the changes to the wing was effectively a new wing and put a price tag on it, a total price tag, I think, of 747-8 development of somewhere between 3 and $4 billion. So is the characterization of a more or less a whole new wing accurate, and what about that price tag?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Dominic, I couldn't hear you clearly. I think you're asking about the wing and its impact on development cost for the -8?</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The wing was an issue we had to wrestle through. There was some redesign that had to happen there. Took us longer than we thought. But I think we are largely through it. We feel comfortable with it, and it did explain a lot of the nonrecurring pressure that we had, particularly last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it &#x2013; is that increasing the cost to about the levels Heidi cited of 3 to $4 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I don't think we talk about that publicly. It obviously costs more than we thought it was going in. But we remain very comfortable that this will be a profitable program, and the business case remains strong.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our next question comes from Mike Mecham of Aviation Week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Couple of weeks ago Steve Udvar-Hazy talked about some weight issues in the 787. Extending that into the -10, which I know has no particular program yet, but there is implications there as to how you might set the company up to compete with the A350, the larger A350s that would creep into your 777 programs as competitors. Is there any thinking about a development effort on 777 to position against the A350, or are you confident with what you got if we let a 300 ER?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a good question. Obviously the A350-1000, if as it comes together it comes together as Airbus has characterized it will in terms of its performance, would put some pressure on our longer-range 777 fleet. And we would have to answer the question what we do would do about it. So it's very much of a live issue. I think the driver is what will the real performance of the A350-1000 be. And since that probably won't be introduced until '16ish &#x2013; I'm guessing here, but I think that is right; it is introduced after the 800 and 900 &#x2013; we have plenty of time to make the decision on what kind of modification might be needed if the performance does threaten the bottom of our &#x2013; the long-range part of our 777 fleet. But we &#x2013; given the order rates that we continue to have on 777s, I don't think the marketplace is overly worried about it yet, but it will be an issue we have to address.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're doing so well on the 737. Is it possible you might address this issue before you address an issue on the replacement 737?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; yes, it's possible, and it's also possible we could be &#x2013; there could be some overlap as we address both. But the &#x2013; we are asking the questions independently, obviously, because there are two different &#x2013; very different market segments. But yes, you could paint a scenario where some work on the 777 would be done before the majority of work on the next-generation '37, but we don't know that yet either.</p>

          <p>Operator, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question comes from Susanna Ray of Bloomberg. Your line is open, ma'am. Please check your mute button.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry about that; can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can hear you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. You mention companywide productivity gains in your release, and I am just wondering if you could give some examples. And then also, since your plane deliveries look like they will be flat next year if you strip out the 787s, I'm wondering if that means you have already achieved all of the productivity gains that helped you boost deliveries last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The productivity gains are pretty much across the board in our production programs. If you looked at both on IDS and on commercial airplanes, you look at the 737, the 777. Or if you look at the F-18, the F-15, C-17, you would see good year-over-year productivity on all of our major product lines. It is an article of faith each year that we will make progress there. So I think it's an across-the-board story. And your other question -- I couldn't quite hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just was wondering, you know, it looks like your commercial plane deliveries would be flat next year if you strip out the 787s. And so I'm wondering if that means you have already achieved all the productivity gains to give you boosted deliveries last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely not. And I think the example I would cite there is our largest facility, our Everett facility -- James mentioned it earlier. There are productivity efforts that are just gaining maturity up there on the 777 in particular and on the 747 that will produce significant productivity for us even at rate. And there is still productivity improvements year-over-year planned for Renton as well. So like I say it is an article of faith; we never get there.</p>
