          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to GM 2009 Preliminary Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. At that time, we will be taking questions from the analysts. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Monday, November 16, 2009</p>
          <p>And now I would like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Investor Relations and Global Communications. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us as we review our preliminary Q3 managerial financial results. I would also like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements and risk factors on page one. As always, the content of our call will be governed by this language. I would also like to highlight that GM is broadcasting this call live via the Internet and the financial press will be listening as well.</p>
          <p>This morning, Fritz Henderson, GM President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of Q3, as well as a glimpse into the fourth quarter. Ray Young, Executive Vice President and CFO, will review our preliminary managerial results for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>After the presentation portion of the call, about 30 minutes will be set aside for questions from security analysts. We'd also like to mention we have other executives available to assist in answering your questions.</p>
          <p>With us today are Walter Borst, Vice President and Treasurer; Nick Cyprus, Vice President, Corporate Controller, and Chief Accounting Officer; Joe DaMour, Executive Director of Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis; and Mike DiGiovanni, Executive Director of Global Market and Industry Analysis.</p>
          <p>If you could just flip to slide two, GM Company is a private company. We're a voluntary filer with the SEC and per agreement with the SEC, we'll be filing under an 8-K unaudited condensed consolidated managerial results for the period July 10 through September 30 and it will include information related to old GM.</p>
          <p>Consolidated managerial financial results that we will discuss do not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. For example, assets and liabilities will be valued at the historical cost basis; fixed asset impairment testing and benefit plan re-measurements have not been performed; the results do not reflect the application of fresh-start accounting and other adjustments and they will change significantly when these adjustments are applied to comply with GAAP. And we'll continue to analyze time periods in which revenues and expenses were recorded along with the allocation of certain assets and liabilities.</p>
          <p>GM is a new entity and financial statements are not comparable to those of old GM. In 2010, we will file Forms 10-Q and 10-K, including GAAP compliant financials for the periods September 30, 2009, as well as December 31, 2009.</p>
          <p>Slide three, moreover there's some changes in the presentation that we will discuss today. The discussion today will focus on two separate periods, the first being July 1 through July 9. That's old GM, and July 10 through September 30, that's new GM. Moreover, former Europe, Latin America/Africa/Middle East, and AP segments have combined into the GMIO segment.</p>
          <p>And due to lack of significant influence over GMAC, we've changed our accounting treatment for investment to the cost method from the prior equity method. Our common equity ownership in GMAC is 24.5%, 9.9 of that is held directly and 14.6 is held in an independent trust</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Fritz Henderson.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy. Good morning. Chart 4, just some highlights or some observations from the &#x2013; I'm going to refer to it as the quarter, although when I refer to the quarter, I'm referring to the July 10 through September 30 period, as I find myself incapable of consistently saying that every single time. So indulge me when I talk about the quarter.</p>
          <p>But as I look at it, some encouraging signs in terms of vehicle launches. We've seen in the U.S., for example, Camaro &amp; Equinox in Chevrolet, Cadillac SRX, Buick LaCrosse, and GMC Terrain all being very well received by consumers. We're been pleased with how those vehicles are performing.</p>
          <p>Outside of the U.S., the Holden Cruze, which really follows the launch of the Cruze, for example, in China, it continues to perform very well as it launches into various markets internationally. The Daewoo Matiz Creative, the Chevrolet Agile, the Opel Astra won the Golden Steering Wheel Award. We've been, I think, encouraged by our launch activities, and I mean it's extremely important in terms of rebuilding brands and driving the topline.</p>
          <p>We are well on our way to fewer brands, dealers and nameplates in terms of the rationalization of the business. Cost structure; we have significantly improved our cost structure. We have a competitive wage structure in place here, for example, in the U.S. and in Canada. About a 19% reduction in total U.S. employment from year-end '08 through September 30 and we have further to go during the fourth quarter. These are actions that are already planned and programmed that would take place by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet, which we'll talk about today, is significantly healthier with much lower leverage and a stronger liquidity position. The Delphi bankruptcy has been resolved, with the transaction closing in the fourth quarter, and Delphi emerging from bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>We have a new Board of Directors, and leaner executive team, who are operating the business with about one-third less executives from year-end '08 to year-end '09. As part of that, put in place a new operating structure, which we did that August 1, and we pretty much didn't miss a beat.</p>
          <p>And then finally, work continues on accelerating the change in GM's culture, which if you look at it in terms of forward priorities, &#x2013; and I'll come back to it at the end &#x2013; driving the topline performance, driving revenue, driving our market performance, making sure we're focused around cars, and then finally improving GM's culture, remained the key priorities for us as we look into not only the fourth quarter, but 2010.</p>
          <p>Page 5, just an overview of results. Global share in the third quarter, 11.9: in the U.S., 19.5; China, 13.5; but the U.S. was basically flat versus the first half of '09, and China was up 0.1. We were up 0.3 globally versus the first half of '09. Our dealer inventories generally around the globe are in very good shape. This chart shows you where they were in the U.S. at the end of September, at 424,000 units, which is down 158,000 from June 30.</p>
          <p>The preliminary managerial results are shown in the table. Net revenue, $26.5 billion. EBIT before items was the $0.3 billion loss. We had net interest of $0.2 billion, special items this quarter, which were largely dealer and some attrition-related restructure, were 0.5 billion. So our pre-tax loss was $1 billion. After tax managerial loss was 1.2. We did generate cash in this third quarter before items of 3.3 billion. Ray will touch on that as to what were the drivers of that when he goes through his materials. EBITDA before special items was 1.5 billion, as shown in the memo item. And then finally cash, which included about 17.4 billion in escrow, amounted to $42.6 billion at September 30.</p>
          <p>Page 6, our sales results. We have broken them out globally in North America and internationally. Globally, revenues in the third quarter, and here the revenue numbers include the full 90 days actually, because both revenues and volumes, they are reasonably comparable. So we have shown that. Whereas profitability, cash flow, and whatnot will be done for the stub period, but $28 billion, up 4.9 billion from the second quarter, for GM globally. Industry SAAR rate in the third quarter, as you can see, was significantly higher in the third quarter, in part driven by a number of different scrappage programs, including here in the U.S. Our share, you can see.</p>
          <p>The far right column is the viability plan that we set forth for ourself for the third quarter that we developed at the time of the bankruptcy filing and pretty much whether &#x2013; whichever line item you're looking at, we've been encouraged by being ahead of the bankruptcy plan. Production volumes in &#x2013; globally are well less than deliveries in part because deliveries reflect our non-consolidated joint ventures, and a substantial part, because we've also reduced inventory not only in North America, but across the globe.</p>
          <p>North American revenues, you can see the impact in the third quarter, 15.5 billion, up from 11.4 in the second quarter. Industry SAAR at 11.7 in the U.S., again, driven by the Clunkers program. You can see our share relative to not only where it was in the first and second quarter, but also versus the viability plan, and you can see here as well the volumes substantially less than deliveries.</p>
          <p>Internationally, revenues at 12.9 billion. When we developed the plan, we had no real idea what was going to happen to our International businesses when we went in &#x2013; when we did the filing and pretty much they've been unaffected by the bankruptcy filing. Market share at 9.9% in line with the second quarter and well above what we thought it might have been. And here you can also see production volumes below the level of deliveries.</p>
          <p>Page 7 is our U.S. market performance, both total share as well as retail share across the months. You can see what's happened here in September and October. September, at 20.6, was a very strong fleet month for us. October at 20.8 was a very strong retail month for us. And so it was &#x2013; as we look at the situation, while we're certainly not satisfied with where we are, we've been able to I think begin to establish some stability at least in terms of share.</p>
          <p>What we've shown below also is the core brand share, which is basically Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC. And you can see both in terms of total share as well as retail share that we're making good progress in terms of having the core brands basically pick up the slack from the brands that we're phasing out or winding down.</p>
          <p>On Page 8, some statistics on launch performance; Camaro, Equinox, LaCrosse, and the Cadillac SRX. And what we've shown here in the table is the share of segment, the average transaction price &#x2013; the average transaction price versus the segment in the 36-month residual value.</p>
          <p>Camaro, which was launched in 2009, continues to be just a very solid performer. Average transaction price particularly has been something we've been very encouraged by at 34,800. And Camaro's positioning in terms of the segment, we were very, very encouraged by the Camaro's performance in that segment, post its launch and its quick ascension, if you will, to a good strong leadership position in the segment.</p>
          <p>Equinox, a very important launch for the Chevrolet channel and for the Chevrolet brand, about 7.6% of the segment, up from its predecessor vehicle and you can see, a substantial increase in the average transaction price versus the &#x2013; not only in absolute, but relative to the industry segment average. And then finally a significant uptick in residual values.</p>
          <p>LaCrosse, a similar story, with perhaps the most relevant and important metric being the $9,400 increase in the average transaction price relative to its predecessor vehicle. And then, finally the SRX, which has been the most recently launched of this group. And you can as well improvement in our relative share performance in the segment, higher average transaction price. And in this case, a full 14-point increase in residual value. So these are &#x2013; this is the launch information from U.S. We've got good experience in a number of other markets as well, but I want to just focus on these for this morning.</p>
          <p>Page 9 is our U.S. dealer inventory, where it's come from since December of '08. We bottomed out in August. Our inventory at the end of October was 444,000 and we today focused probably more on the age of that inventory, making sure we get the inventory properly balanced. We feel like, at this level the aggregate level of inventory is fine. We could &#x2013; these numbers can obviously bounce around in any given month, but certainly, we feel like we've gotten the aggregate level of inventory down in a range where it should be. Now, it's a question of making sure we get it in the right spot and in the right vehicles.</p>
          <p>Page 10 was derived from JD Power PIN data and looks at average transaction prices at retail as well as average retail incentives. When we look at the data, the third quarter of '09 at 26,996 was lower, driven principally by the U.S. CARS Program, which increased the sales rate, but also drove a significantly higher mix of smaller or lower price vehicles. Our average retail incentive, which peaked in the fourth quarter of '08 at 5,443 has come down through the year into the first quarter at 4,589, second quarter at 3,641, and leveled out down slightly in the third quarter at 3,561. The focus here is on inventory management and when we do that, you can see &#x2013; we've seen in the data, we can favorably impact the level of retail incentives.</p>
          <p>Page 11 is a summary of China, Brazil, India, Russia and what our share is in aggregate. And then down below you can see what the share is by market. What continues to be remarkable is the growth of China. This is a SAAR calculation in that month and you can see, certainly in the last four months in China July, August, September, October, the China market running at about a 16 million unit SAAR, driven in part by strong economic growth and strong, and also driven by substantial stimulus into the China market and the China auto market.</p>
          <p>The Brazil market has remained at a relatively robust level. The 3.3 SAAR in the month of October as the country began to scale back tax incentives that were in place was an encouraging number. India at 2.2 to 2.4 has hung in there reasonably well. The market that has the greatest challenge I think in terms of emerging markets is Russia, while this chart goes back to January where you see a decline from 2.2 to 1.4. Last year the Russia market, I think for the year was 3.2. So Russia has probably been the single &#x2013; have been in the market, emerging markets had the single largest impact associated with the global recession.</p>
          <p>Europe, page 12, shows not only where the industry SAAR rate has been, but also where our share has been. And we break it down below between Opel and Vauxhall and Chevrolet. We had strong performance, for example, in September associated with the phase-out of the scrappage program in Germany in the month of September. And as we basically prepare ourself for launch of the Astra as we go into the fourth quarter, it's a very important product not only in terms of volume and profitability, but certainly share as well.</p>
          <p>I guess the last point here on Chevrolet; Chevrolet share has been roughly flat for the year. It's bounced around some across the months, but Chevrolet has been a fairly important brand for us, for example, in Russia. The decline of the Russian market has had a significant effect on Chevrolet. On the other hand, we've been able to pick that up to some degree in other markets across Europe.</p>
          <p>Page 13 is a quick summary of our both, factory as well as dealer inventories in Europe. We do maintain factory inventories in part in transit and in part, for example, some countries like the UK, we've historically maintained stocking compounds. And so here what we have done is, we've grouped both factory as well as dealer inventories Opel, Vauxhall, Chevrolet, and Saab in Europe and we have been encouraged by the decline in inventory from 429,000 at the end of '08 to 299,000 at the end of October. We feel like our inventory position in Europe as well is an excellent shape as we go into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Final point on page 14, Opel, on November 4, the Board of Directors did make the decision to retain Opel. It was considered and deemed to be in our long-term interest and the least costly solution in terms of financing required associated with the restructuring of the business. The decision was based on, first, our own improving business conditions and, second &#x2013; to a secondary degree, the complexity and potential uncertainty associated with the sale. But I would say that it was more driven by the former in terms of the importance of Opel to GM not only in terms of our global business, but the role Opel plays in GM's global operations, particularly in terms of product development and technology.</p>
          <p>The next steps going forward include working cooperatively and diligently on restructure with all stakeholders, including employees and government, discussing financing from European government. Once we have, I think, line of sight and clarity, which is, I think, it's something that's measured &#x2013; I measure in weeks as opposed to months. This will not take a very long time in order to finalize the plan. What does require some time is the consultation process that we need to go through with employees and with governments.</p>
          <p>I guess the last point on this is that we certainly have the capability to support our European business and our international businesses more broadly, but we do expect to be able to not only come forth with our plan in Europe, but to seek support as well for financing, once those plans are finalized</p>
          <p>The Opel bridge loan, which comes due at the end of November. The bridge loan &#x2013; the total amount was &#x20AC;1.5 billion. We never drew the full amount. At one point the peak draw was 1.2. We had already made a payment down to &#x20AC;900 million as of September 30. We've repaid a &#x20AC;0.5 billion of that as of November 30. We expect that the remaining 400 million to be repaid by the end of November.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Ray. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Fritz. Good morning, everyone. Chart number 16 is our descriptions of preliminary managerial results. And before I go through, I just want to kind of highlight, if you recall prior analyst presentations, a certain format that we present in terms of how we walk managerial earnings.</p>
          <p>Going forward, this will be our format whereby we will walk our segments to an EBIT before special items and then deduct net interest and then special items to arrive at EBT, and EBT will always be after special items, and then deduct taxes to arrive at basically a net income or loss. We're referring to this as managerial net income and loss, because these, as Randy has indicated, are non-GAAP financials at this stage.</p>
          <p>In this chart, we highlight old GM laying out first quarter, second quarter as well as the first nine days July and then new General Motors from July 10 to September 30. So looking at new General Motors first, you can see looking at the different segments, North America a loss of $651 million on an EBIT basis before special items. IO, a profit of 238 million. The corp sector, positive 152 million. That's primarily due to mark-to-market gains we've had in the some of our hedges there. So a loss in terms of EBIT before special items of negative 261. If you notice, we do memo EBITDA. EBITDA was positive 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Our interest &#x2013; net interest, about negative 250. You can see, when you compare versus prior periods, a considerable reduction due to the fact that our debt balances are a lot lower. And we'll go through that when I walk through the debt in the balance sheet with you.</p>
          <p>Special items for this period was about $505 million and that's primarily related to restructuring costs, primarily relate to the dealer network restructuring. But we also had some restructuring costs related to capacity as well. So EBT, after special items, $1 billion loss. We did have some cash tax provisions of $135 million for some of our overseas subsidiaries. And so therefore our managerial net loss of $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Just want to go back a little bit to the prior chart or the prior period. You'll notice from July 1 to July 9, the thing that stands out is special item of $79.7 billion. You note in the asterisk that we did have our reorganization gain at 80.7 billion, which I'll go through in the next chart.</p>
          <p>We had not discussed second quarter earnings with you before. We did kind of layout the second quarter numbers of old General Motors for your benefit. Again, these are un-audited, but you can see on the second quarter basis, the EBIT was loss of $6.3 billion and a net managerial loss of negative $14.5 billion.</p>
          <p>As Randy indicated, comparisons are not comparable at this point in time between new GM and old GM, you have to be cautious about the comparisons. But from the managerial basis, we do look at these trends and these trends do suggest that we're making progress in terms of our financial results.</p>
          <p>Chart number 17 just highlights the special items for this period. The restructuring and special attrition programs, negative 452, again primarily related to the dealer restructurings as well as some severance provisions for both in North America and international operations. We had a provision for Delphi. And then Saab related is really just a reversal of some warranty reserves that we had provided for and so that makes up the $505 million to special charges in this period.</p>
          <p>If you look at the July 1 to July 9 period, again, you see that the reorganization gains, the $80.7 billion. This is primarily related to the fact that for the financing that was provided to us in the prior periods by the government. There's conversion of the DIP facility by the U.S. and Canadian governments into equity. There's also a conversion of the prior debt, prior to the DIP facility converting back into equity. And in addition, some of the &#x2013; or the unsecured debt that we basically left behind in the 363 sale with the Motors Liquidation, those are the primary drivers of the gain that was recorded in this particular period.</p>
          <p>Just again, second quarter &#x2013; again, we didn't talk about second quarter before, but as you can see in the second quarter, there were some significant provisions related to restructuring. We also recognized the acceleration of the discount on the amortization of DIP facility of $1.6 billion there. And then we did have some reorganization losses as well, some provisions that we took in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Go to chart number 18. This is a comparison or basically or just laying out the data of our peer July 10 through September 30, which I outlined to you already. With the third quarter of '08 under old General Motors as well as the Viability Plan that we filed with the bankruptcy courts. Again, I caution you that comparisons not are directly possible, but I guess we look more towards the trend lines or the trend &#x2013; what the trends do suggest.</p>
          <p>In the Viability Plan clearly, North America, we were forecasting a more significant loss, a $2.1 billion loss. A lot of it was driven by the fact that when we filed with the bankruptcy court, our plans, we weren't certain regarding what the pricing environment would be in both North America and around the world as we emerged from bankruptcy. And we weren't sure about the volumes in terms of when we emerge. So that was a primary driver of why we had a loss in our Viability Plan.</p>
          <p>In IO, same thing in terms of our own volumes, but the other thing, we weren't optimistic in terms of how the SAAR rates would be in the third quarter of 2009. And as it turned out the SAAR rates, as Fritz has indicated for certain countries like China, turned out to be a lot stronger than we have thought. And in the Corp sector, we thought we're going to have a lot more expenses associated as we emerged from the restructuring.</p>
          <p>And if you look at EBITDA, again, this is a non-GAAP measure, but again, the Viability Plan, we thought would be an EBITDA loss of $1.3 billion. Just note, we're at 1.5 billion. Again, I caution not directly comparable, but again, looking at trends, it appears that we're making some progress here.</p>
          <p>Chart number 19, just a closer look in terms of North America results. Again, we referenced third quarter '08, we referenced the Viability Plan, and then we referenced both July 1 to July 9 and July 10 to September 30. Just, if you see the revenue side, for new General Motors, 15.2 billion in this period for the third quarter. And then you can see our EBIT loss is $651 million.</p>
          <p>One thing to note, just our production levels, as Fritz indicated, we took down dealer stocks dramatically into third quarter. As you'll note, our North American production in the third quarter of '09, 531,000 units versus third quarter of '08, 915,000 units. So a dramatic reduction in terms of production as we basically get our dealer stock levels in order here.</p>
          <p>Turn to chart number 20, a little more detail on GM International operations. You can see our revenue for GMIO, $11.8 billion. Again, I just remind people that we do not consolidate our China operations. Our China operations are basically handled on an equity basis. So this &#x2013; the revenue excludes the China operations.</p>
          <p>You can see equity income of 217 million. That's where we recognize our share of the equity income of our joint ventures including our Chinese joint ventures. EBIT in this period, $238 million for an EBIT margin of 2%. And then just notice EBITDA of 745, and then we also memoed for your benefit, again, we're basically reporting IO as one segment, but just for your benefit, we've memoed what EBIT was in our prior there sub-regions.</p>
          <p>So, Europe, we had a loss of $437 million on the EBIT before special item basis. The former LAAM, a profit of $245 million and the former Asia Pacific, a profit of $429 million on an EBIT basis. You can see the numbers, I won't go through them, but you can see what the Viability Plan assumptions were and then also just reference what third quarter '08 was.</p>
          <p>Go to chart number 21, we laid out in the press release as well, what our structural cost numbers were from July 10 to September 30, $9.1 billion. We also laid out what it was from January 1 to July 9, $22 billion, and then also for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2008. Again, I caution you in terms of adding up the two numbers to arrive at nine months 2009.</p>
          <p>But, again, the purpose of this is to show like what we think from a trend perspective what's happening in terms of our structural costs. What's happening right now is we are seeing cost reductions occurring due to the salary head count reductions as well as hourly head count reductions.</p>
          <p>In the 8-K, you'll be able to see the numbers in terms of our hedge. For example, worldwide employment at the end of '08 was 243,000 people, at the end of September '09, 209,000 people. So, basically, 34,000 fewer people, a 14% reduction. And you'll see our U.S. employment level also come down dramatically in the nine-month period from 91,000 that's combined hourly and salary to 75,000. And then in the month of October, there were further reductions made particularly in the salary head count level.</p>
          <p>We're seeing engineering savings occur in '09 as well. A lot of it's due to the fact that for many of the discontinued brands and discontinued nameplates, we basically just stopped performing any engineering work on those. We've got volume-related savings as well as media spending. Again, on the media side, we really hunkered down in '09, but also we stopped advertising a lot of our discontinued brands and nameplates. So again, from our perspective, we believe that the trend does suggest that we're making progress in terms of our structural costs.</p>
          <p>Chart 22, lays out our reported debt balance, and so let me just spend a few moments kind of walking you through this chart. We lay out, first of all, in the far left-hand, the old General Motors debt balance just prior to the 363 sale. So on July 9, a debt balance of $94.7 billion.</p>
          <p>We basically equitize about $49.5 billion of bad debt into equity and then we also left behind in Motors Liquidation about $26.8 billion of unsecured bonds. And then we also left some debt with old GM. This is primarily to help &#x2013; to fund &#x2013; finance that operation. So that arrives at $17.2 billion in debt balance as of July 10. And you can see the debt balance of September 30 was approximately the same, about $17 billion. The debt flows between July 10 and September 30 were fairly marginal.</p>
          <p>So, when you take a look at the composition of the $17 billion, you're going to see that the U.S. Treasury, we owe $6.7 billion. EDC is really the Canadian government debt. It was CAD$1.5 billion, at current exchange rates as of September 30, about US 1.4 billion We have a supplier financing program, about $300 million of debt in that facility. And in the Adam Opel Bridge Loan and with &#x20AC;900 million outstanding at end of September are US $1.3 billion. So government financings are about $9.7 billion at the end of September.</p>
          <p>There is also some North America debt, related to financings in Canada, Mexico, and some in United States, about $1.5 billion. And in GM international operation debt, excluding government financing and primarily in that, Brazil, and some other countries, about $4.8 billion. And there were some capital leases and other, $1 billion. And so that's the composition of the $17 billion. I do point &#x2013; refer you to footnote, that the debt as of September 30 does not include the $9 billion preferred stock, nor the $2.5 billion of UAW VEBA notes or the $0.7 billion of CAW note.</p>
          <p>Chart 23, in terms of total liabilities and this is again &#x2013; the walk is actually fairly similar to the prior walk in terms of debt walk, but we do kind of show how our reported liability balances are changing. On July 9, $214.2 billion and then you duck the amount of debt that we equitize or left back at Motors Liquidation, 77.5 billion. There were some other liabilities that we either equitized, such as the interest on the government debt or we left behind the old GM. And some of that includes some of these accrued liabilities relate to product liability, asbestos, and environmental claims.</p>
          <p>So about $3.5 billion reductions there to arrive at our liability balance of 133.2 billion on July 10. Then from July 10 to September 30, we did have an increase in payables as we start ramping up production. Some adjustments to the pension and OPEB and then some other minor adjustments to arrive at $135.6 billion in terms of our reported liabilities.</p>
          <p>Again, I caution you that the fresh-start accounting has not been performed on this liability balance. So there is a lot of changes that will occur to this balance as we go through fresh-start accounting. You notice the footnote there. Many of the changes that have occurred to our employee benefit programs, we have not reflected in this particular debt balance.</p>
          <p>For example, our UAW OPEB obligation, that is the VEBA. It doesn't become effective until December 31 of this year. And so therefore, that liability, approximately $18 billion, is still in this particular number.</p>
          <p>The CAW healthcare obligations, again, that's still in this number right now, until we actually get the healthcare trust established. There were some agreements with the UAW, in which we removed the pension pass-through to fund health care in our pension plan. That will result also in a reduction in terms of the liabilities when we go through fresh-start, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, there will be a series of adjustments made to this particular liability balance that will occur after we go through fresh-start accounting, but at least on the non-GAAP financials that you'll see &#x2013; you will see a liability balance of 135.6 billion, which does represent a significant reduction versus the balance as of July 9.</p>
          <p>Chart 24, just a liquidity walk. We just kind of lay out our unrestricted cash balance and then our escrowed cash balance. So on July 9, prior to the 363 sale, we had unrestricted cash of 19.2 billion and then also escrowed cash of $18.4 billion. And then when we move to July 10, the escrow balance went down by about $1.2 billion and that's due to the fact that some of the escrow funds we left in Motors Liquidation in order to help Motors Liquidation finance basically the emergence of motors &#x2013; the wind-down of Motors Liquidation.</p>
          <p>So we had made some estimations in terms of what the wind-down cost would be of that operation. So on July 10, basically 19.1 billion of unrestricted cash and 17.3 billion of escrowed cash, and then on September 30, the number goes to 17.4. And that's primarily due to the fact that there was about CAD$1 billion also of escrowed cash, which based upon exchange rates, basically rounds up to 17.4 by September 30.</p>
          <p>You'll also note, in the box above, that on the 17.4 billion of escrowed cash, we actually have some of these funds already earmarked. For example and I'll go through a description on how the escrow arrangements would work, but basically $8.1 billion of that amount is earmarked for the repayment of the U.S. Treasury and the Canadian government debt.</p>
          <p>We did settle with Delphi, actually, after the end of the third quarter, and so the $2.8 billion in outflows relate to the Delphi settlement, that already has gone out from our escrow balances, but as of September 30, it was still earmarked. And then the Canadian Health Care Trust, when it gets established, the CAD$1 billion would be released from the Canadian escrow account at that time.</p>
          <p>So you can see that after we have satisfied the U.S. Canadian debt obligations Delphi, as well as the Canadian Health Care Trust, there would still be remaining $5.6 billion in funds in the escrow that would be made available to us only after we paid down the U.S. Treasury debt.</p>
          <p>Just a footnote also for &#x2013; you can see, our debt balances do not include the UAW VEBA note or the CAW note. That will go on to a reported debt balances when we actually set up &#x2013; when the VEBA is actually in effect. Again, we don't have the $9 billion preferred stock recorded as reported debt. That will be in &#x2013; that's in the mezzanine line of the balance sheet. The other thing to note is, in our press release, we did note that European cash balances at the end of September amounted to approximately $2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Chart 25, managerial cash flow and again, this is our traditional walk in terms of getting to managerial cash flows and then to net cash flow. So let's again focus on the new GM column. From July 10 to September 30, earnings before tax, but &#x2013; and this is after restructuring, as laid out on page 16, amounted to $1 billion loss. We added back depreciation amortization this period of $1.8 billion, and then we deducted capital spending of $0.6 billion. Now, this is a fairly low number for a quarter.</p>
          <p>If you take a look at the period from July 1 to July 9, there was actually $600 million of capital spending in the first nine days. And so there's a timing related issue here in terms of our CapEx. When you take a look at '09, we generally were thinking we're going to be spending about $6 billion in total capital spending. So you can see the run rate of 600 is very low. You add back the first nine days of 1.2 billion, getting closer to our run rate of $6 billion for the calendar year. You can see a big number in terms of the change in working capital, $8.2 billion. And just a couple comments here.</p>
          <p>First of all, you'll notice, from July 1 to July 9 period, a negative outflow of $2.7 billion. That's primarily related to the fact that our supplier payments, we &#x2013; for direct suppliers or direct material, we generally pay at the beginning of every month under our payment terms called MNS2. So there was about three &#x2013; a little over $3 billion of supplier payments that went out in the first week of July. So, therefore, there's a timing issue here.</p>
          <p>The second factor is, as you know, we run a negative working capital model, whereby we receive cash when we ship the vehicles from our factories, and pay our suppliers on average, 47 days later. So as we ramped up production in the third quarter, we clearly generated positive working capital from that, and that's something, which Fritz will outline, we will not repeat in the fourth quarter. So that's part of the reason why we show a fairly favorable $8.2 billion in working capital in the July 10 of September 30 period.</p>
          <p>Again, while these periods are not directly comparable &#x2013; one could add the first nine days to the next period to give an order of magnitude as to what the number will look like after you adjusted it for the supplier payment timing difference.</p>
          <p>In terms of pension and OPEB, a negative $3.9 billion there. We did, in the third quarter, make a contribution to the Canadian pension plans, both the hourly plan and the salary plan. The contribution was CAD$4 billion, or about US$3.8. So that's the bulk of that particular outflow. This was really a one-time event in terms of helping to top up the Canadian pension plans. We don't expect that to repeat itself.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the crude expenses and other, negative $1.2 billion. Two major drivers there. As you know, our earnings before tax was after restructuring. So we backed off the restructuring charges here for the purposes of this analysis to arrive at managerial operating cash flow of $0.5 billion there. And also we had some derivatives, some mark-to-market gains, which are non-cash in nature in the period. And so we reverse that out as well. So, that gets us to a managerial operating cash flow of $3.3 billion, and we did have some cash restructuring charges of $900 million.</p>
          <p>And here in terms of the cash cost, primarily related to operations restructuring, severance, et cetera, as well as some payments relate to the dealer restructuring as well. We did have $200 million of Delphi related support payments. So, therefore, special cash charges of 1.1 billion to arrive at managerial operating cash flows after special charges of 2.2.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of non-operating related, we did have $4 billion coming in from the Canadian government in this period. With respect to, again, the 363 sale process, the Canadian government in terms of the mechanics, did fund those the day after the 363 sale and that's the reason why the $4 billion entered into this particular period here. And so, therefore, non-operating related flow was about 4 billion to arrive at a net changing cash and cash related of $6.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Again, when you take a look at old GM, meaning again, you can see that in this period, the managerial operating cash flow before special items was 3.6 billion negative. Again, I caution you in terms of adding up the two numbers, but again directionally, as I indicated, we did have some working capital impacts related to supplier payments that occurred really in the first nine days of July. So that's the primary reason why you had the negative managerial operating cash flow there.</p>
          <p>And we also did reference for you Viability Plan in terms of what we filed with the bankruptcy court in terms of what we thought the cash flows were, negative 4.2 billion. Again, this is the entire third quarter, negative 4.2 billion on the managerial operating cash before special item basis. And negative 8.7 billion on a cash flow after special items basis.</p>
          <p>Just note &#x2013; I mean, there clearly are some timing issues here. When you take a look at the Viability Plan versus what we've actually registered, there's clearly some timing issues here in terms of the cash flows. For example, the Delphi related payments, we actually thought in the Viability Plan that we would actually make those payments in the third quarter. That's the reason why you see a negative $3 billion in the Viability Plan column. In fact, those payments are going to be made in the fourth quarter. So there's a series of timing issues between the Viability Plan and in terms of our actual cash flows, but setting aside the timing issues, we did see some fundamental improvements in terms of our underlying business as well.</p>
          <p>Chart number 26, just walk a little bit &#x2013; talk a little about the escrow account arrangements. The $16.4 billion from the DIP facility was deposited into a U.S. escrow on &#x2013; really that was on July 9, we deposited it. We did receive approval from the U.S. Treasury to draw 2.8 billion to fund the Delphi related payments associated with the Delphi bankruptcy emergence. Under the terms of the arrangement, escrow is set to expire on June 2010, and any funds remaining in the escrow would be used to repay the U.S. Treasury loan.</p>
          <p>We could ask the U.S. Treasury for a one-year extension, but this is all subject to the U.S. Treasury agreement. After we've paid the U.S. Treasury loan, any remaining funds would be distributed to General Motors. Again, just for background, this escrow was setup for several reasons. A, to finance certain contingencies that we thought would materialize when we emerge from bankruptcy. If you'll recall, at that time when we were emerging from bankruptcy, the state of the suppliers was still fairly fragile, and we were actually very concerned that when we started ramping up production in North America, whether the suppliers themselves would be able to finance the working capital associated with the startup. So we built in some contingents there.</p>
          <p>We're also concerned with respect to our dealers' ability to wholesale finance their vehicles, given what was happening at GMAC, and given what was happening generally within the banking industries. So we built in some contingencies relate to wholesale financing. We're also very concerned about our residual values when we emerge from bankruptcy. So we built in some contingencies in terms of residual support payments to GMAC under the risk-sharing arrangements. And lastly, frankly, we were concerned about how our sales would recover after we emerge from bankruptcy. So we had some estimations in terms of the potential impact in terms of our wholesales as we emerge. So we built in these contingencies as part of our Viability Plan.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, the escrow arrangement was set up so that when we needed the cash, that we will approach the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Treasury would basically meter out the cash to us as we required the cash in order to finance the restructuring of our business.</p>
          <p>Now, as a result of our &#x2013; what appears to be a healthier position in terms of our cash balances &#x2013; and again, our contingencies did not materialize to the extent we had thought, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to start repaying our loans, $1 billion to the U.S. Treasury, $192 million to the Canadian government and using funds from escrow starting in December of this year until GM completes an IPO.</p>
          <p>We felt it was important for us to start the process of repaying taxpayer funds and also reduce the negative carry on these loans. These loans carry an interest rate of 7% per annum. The balance of the terms on the escrow remains unchanged versus our prior agreement with the U.S. Treasury, which includes that in June 2010, which is the expiry date of the escrow, to the extent that there are funds in escrow, we would use that to repay the U.S. Treasury loans, or we could ask for a financial one-year extension at that time if we felt that it was prudent, but that would only be based upon agreement with the U.S. Treasury.</p>
          <p>The last element of the escrow is that we do have $1 billion remaining in the Canadian escrow in order to help fund to help Canadian Health Care Trust when that is basically set up in Canada.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Fritz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Page 28, just wrapping up, gives you an outlook for industry SAARs in the fourth quarter of '09 as well as for the calendar year. You can see we do anticipate the U.S. being down from the third quarter, but nevertheless at a 10.7 rate, and it was 10.8 in the month of October. We feel like it's a reasonable estimate and a reasonable exit rate for an improvement as we go into next year. You see, internationally, we would anticipate some falloff as well. And Germany, for example, down below, if you look at the fourth quarter outlook versus where we were in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So when you stack it up, it's 63.3 for the calendar year. It would be &#x2013; no matter how you look at it, it was a tough year in the global automotive business with lots of pressure everywhere, and China growing to potentially 13 million units in terms of the SAAR rate for the year.</p>
          <p>Page 29, just some fourth quarter perspectives in terms of performance. In terms of the market, as I said, moderating global markets and end of various vehicle tax incentives, and I think &#x2013; but as we look at it, we certainly anticipate a &#x2013; I'll call it an unfavorable relative to the third quarter, but in terms of our market performance and production, we feel like we're in a better position. Our products that are being launched are showing real strength. We have a balanced inventory position not only in the U.S., but more broadly. While our pricing would be flat to down &#x2013; when I say that, we did have a number of favorable adjustments in the third quarter for leasing residuals, for example, that we just assume don't recur. But nonetheless we feel with the inventory position where it is, that our pricing is able to hold up reasonably well, but will be down in terms of the financials, simply because of the favorable leasing adjustments we had in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Cost drivers, while again, our position is &#x2013; our structural cost level is in line with our expectations going into the bankruptcy as well as the Viability Plan, we do anticipate higher media and engineering in CapEx in the fourth quarter, certainly versus the third quarter, as we ramp up our marketing sales plans and basically restart the engineering factory.</p>
          <p>Finally, in terms of net cash flow, fourth quarter versus the third quarter, we had the favorable third quarter effect of working capital, which wouldn't necessarily repeat itself &#x2013; which wouldn't repeat itself. The supplier payment terms would go to net 47 days. That will have a one-time effect in the fourth quarter of about $2 billion. It doesn't have an effect on an average basis, but it does have an effect in terms of the balance sheet. There will be a one-time effect from going to net 47 from this MNS 2.</p>
          <p>Delphi, 2.8 billion, continued restructuring cost of about a billion cash payments, and then finally the repayment of various government loans, including Germany as well as beginning with the U.S. and Canada. So we would expect liquidity to decline from the 42.6 billion in a pretty significant way as we go into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 30, in terms of looking at the 2010, shows some of our industry forecasts for the year. The U.S. market at 11 to 12 million unit, we're basically developing our plans around 11.5 as the midpoint of the range. Looking outside of North America, Brazil will be in line with 2009. China be in line again with 2009, but we have a fairly wide range around the China market at 12 to 13.8. Everything else is relatively tightly clustered. Germany, we anticipate to be down relatively significantly from what has been a very successful scrappage program.</p>
          <p>So to pull together and summarize the third quarter, we reported a 1.2 billion managerial loss and there's significant work to do. We don't &#x2013; are not at all satisfied with being in a loss position. We know what the components are. EBIT at 261 loss. Again, don't like being in the loss position. I think, we've certainly seen the results of our actions in the cost side, but nonetheless significantly more work to do.</p>
          <p>Positive managerial operating cash flow was favorably impacted as I said, by working capital as well as the lower level of CapEx. The third quarter, though, deliveries and share were ahead of the Viability Plan, and I think, having some stability in some of these key markets is important in terms of setting the foundation.</p>
          <p>The first step in the turnaround is to stop bleeding, stop shrinking, as we set the foundation going into 2010. We have had strong structural cost performance. We expect that to continue. Although, as I said, we would expect to have higher media and higher engineering spend simply to run our business. But those are investments in our brands and our products. The rest of the business is fairly tight in terms of structural cost performance.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet has been significantly de-levered. Ray talked about it, not only the tangible effects on the balance sheet, but as we do fresh-start accounting and pull through the re-measurement for the various benefit plan changes. While we would put the debt and the preferred on the books, what we will take off the books are the various liabilities that are associated with those benefit plans. So you'll have &#x2013; not only have the balance sheet that's significantly de-levered to date, we would anticipate additional deleveraging as we apply fresh-start accounting, but obviously, we need to go through the valuation of assets and liabilities when that's done.</p>
          <p>Then finally, stronger cash balances, and with the 42.6 billion and even with outlook in the fourth quarter and the outlook into 2010, we felt it was appropriate. It was the right thing to do and we were committed to beginning the process of paying back the U.S. Treasury and the EDC, 1.2 billion beginning in December, we felt this was the right thing to do to get started on the process of paying back the taxpayer.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter, as I said, we do expect to have lower cash balances, but on the other hand, we expect them, when we're completed to still be in a very &#x2013; in a healthy position and in a position where we can support reinvestment in our business and being successful going forward.</p>
          <p>So page 32, what are the key focus areas in the simplest terms possible? First, driving profitable topline market and revenue performance. This is where increasingly more and more of our day is spent. This is the most important thing we can do. While dealing with a tough market, driving profitable topline market and revenue performance is the key initiative and the key for emphasis for the leadership team.</p>
          <p>The European restructuring is timely, topical and right in front of us and extremely important that we get that done. Continued execution of the North American operating plan. We feel very confident in our ability to execute that North America operating plan. We just need to finish it &#x2013; is the way we put it. A lot of work has been done through the third quarter, but there are still parts of it that we want to finish up.</p>
          <p>And then lastly and extremely important is the reinvention of GM's culture in terms of creating an environment of excellence, creating an environment of accountability beginning with me and then moving down. And then finally, a culture that really focuses around products and customers and allows us to win in the future.</p>
          <p>So thanks very much. At this point, we're ready to take questions. Randy?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll be taking questions from the analysts. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Fritz and team.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions. Can you reconcile the 9.1 billion of new GM structural costs, which annualizes to about 40 billion with the Evercore projection of 2010 pro forma of 30.4? And maybe obviously that was done without Opel. Give us a sense of kind of the puts and takes with Opel as well as what you've learned about the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're right. I mean, the Evercore projections assume the consolidation of Opel. When we take a look at our numbers on a year-to-date basis, we believe we're running ahead of doing better than our Viability Plan estimates, and I expect that &#x2013; that would carry over into New Year.</p>
          <p>Fritz did outline that one of the things that we are making an adjustment in the fourth quarter is the fact that we will probably spend a little bit more money on the media side as well as on the engineering side. So we'll have to factor that into our business plans going forward.</p>
          <p>But the major item is Opel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So where is North America in terms of breakeven &#x2013; in terms of structural costs, run rate, and where will it be post the VEBA offload?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we're going to provide further information in terms of the North America breakeven levels after we go through the process of fresh-start accounting. As you know, we talked about this 10 to 10.5 million unit EBIT breakeven for North America, but that's before fresh-start accounting. So we're going to go through a revaluation of our assets and liability. There will be depreciation adjustments, goodwill adjustments, goodwill amortization. So after we go through the budget process, we'll provide some additional information in terms of the level of structural costs after fresh-start and where the breakeven levels would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Opel is adding about 8 to 10 billion of structural costs, A, is that correct? And, B, what level of required operating cash does it add to sort of the minimum cash balance? You used to talk about 10 to 14 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we talked about 11 to 14 before, Brian, but that also assumed that we had a revolver in place. We don't have a revolver in place right now. So naturally, our minimum operating cash requirements would be significantly higher than that. And then we also have to bake into the number what we think some of the forward contingencies would be for us. And so I'm not ready to broadcast what a minimum cash balance would be, but we would have to factor in the fact that we don't have a revolver yet. And then secondly, we have to build in any forward contingencies.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But what did Opel add in just in terms of basic operating minimum cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Opel is about 9 billion of structural costs, which needs to come down obviously as part of the restructuring in terms of minimum operating cash. It's about 1.5 billion to 2 billion U.S.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you very much for all information guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the cash balance here, I mean, is there any other big restructuring cash charges that are going to come beyond the fourth quarter that might eat away this balance, or are we largely through the big chunks of cash restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We still are going to have some either wind-down costs in terms of cash costs as we move through next year. We're still going to have severance costs associated with hourly employees. As you know, a lot of people are in the sub-program right now. That would then move into the TSP program. And so we're going to have cash charges associated with that.</p>
          <p>From an accounting perspective, we'll try to get all this behind us this year in terms of the accruals, but a cash cost would continue. And then, when you look at international operations, we will have cash costs over in Europe as we go through the European restructuring this year and next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, when we look at the capacity utilization in North America in the quarter, it was only 53.3%, but you guys only printed a $1.2 billion loss. That's a pretty amazing number and it would indicate that your breakeven is in the mid 60% cap utilization range. I know it's illustrative at this point, it's not &#x2013; these aren't GAAP numbers, but I mean is that a correct interpretation? Is there something else going on in the quarter where there was something very beneficial on pricing or something going on in SPO that throws this off? Because, I mean, it looks like the breakeven has gotten down to the mid 60% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say a couple things. One, our breakeven has come down significantly. Second, we did have favorable lease residual adjustments in the 3Q, which would have significantly improved our net pricing, which as I said, I mean they were good. Our residuals improved. We just assume, in the future, they don't reoccur. But that did have a pretty significant favorable effect, but our breakeven point has fallen pretty significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fritz, but the cap utilization that we used to think about was sort of 80% plus would get you close to breakeven. That was sort of the historical norm. I mean, is it somewhere this low in the 60 to 70% range? Has there been that much headway made? Is it roughly that magnitude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just, again, I just caution everyone regarding the fact that we want to go through the fresh-start accounting in order to make sure that we've got the appropriate level of depreciation amortization into these numbers going forward. So let's &#x2013; I won't make any conclusions yet. I mean, directionally, we know that we are reducing the level of structural costs in this organization just based upon the drivers, like head count, like number of plants et cetera, et cetera. But I'd just be cautious in terms of trying to pin down capacity utilization rates for breakeven at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then next, just on the retail market share, looks like you had a big increase in October, 18.5, versus September of 15.7, where it had been running for a few months prior. Is that all because of new model launches or was there anything going on in the pricing strategy or in the relationship with the dealers that help drive that big notch up in the retail market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple things. One, our launch products and two, with trucks. We had &#x2013; our truck performance in September, was actually well below what we historically run at and we picked back up in October to what &#x2013; to something which would be closer to what we normally &#x2013; Nick was saying we were over 40% pickup share in the month of October, which is where we typically run. So it was more of trucks picking back up to where they would traditionally be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that was really product driven?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, product driven, but also we had &#x2013; we did launch truck month and we were competing against other companies that had incentives. But we basically got more competitive in the month and that improved our truck penetration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just lastly, Fritz, when you look at the potential for an IPO, and timing is obviously still up in the air would guess, at this point, but is it more important to demonstrate sustainable profitability before you IPO the company and take the government out of its investment? Or do you think that it's all sort of one and the same, and the IPO process will help generate some capital to move everything forward in the process of rationalizing, recovering, and restructuring the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll make three comments. First, sustainable, the key is to generate sustainable results, without any doubt at all. So, that is the most important thing in terms of looking at this. It's business results trend, sustainability, and proving out quarter-over-quarter and then year-over-year where we are. But I think the most &#x2013; you put your finger on it, that's the most important thing.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that we need to be ready, which means we need to do all the things necessary to be ready in the second half of the year; because third, all of our shareholders actually would like us to go public. And one of the things that we're very cognizant of is that in the event, shares are distributed to creditors of Motors Liquidation. They could very well want to start selling their shares. And so being able to establish some kind of orderly market would have value to us. So, but I do think of all of those factors, sustainable operating performance is by far the most important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The third quarter volume in China was very strong, but it looks like your equity income there was somewhere in the 200 million range. Is that a representative profit level for that business for you? Was there anything in the quarter that made it unusually weak or strong relative to the volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say that's probably indicative of &#x2013; based upon that volume level where our equity earnings would be for the China operations. Again, there is &#x2013; I mean, they have their own sales amounts, accruals, they have their own timing issues in terms of expenses. But in just looking at where we are right now that's not a bad indication for that level of volume.</p>
          <p>As Fritz indicated, we do expect in the fourth quarter, the volumes &#x2013; the industry volumes in China to come down as the tax incentives diminish in China. So you have to be sensitive in terms of the volatility of China. I mean, we've been pleasantly surprised in terms of the volatility, favorable this year thus far, again, but a lot of it's going to be a function of how the consumers react to these tax incentive programs and how they phase out as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So to the extent that you're calling for volumes in 2010 to be roughly equal with the 13 million rate, is it fair to kind of annualize that 200 million to get an idea of where you might be in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Based upon &#x2013; I think they had a pretty nice quarter in the third quarter. So I wouldn't go annualizing that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I think about the two components of our business, Shanghai GM and Shanghai GM-Wuling, Shanghai GM-Wuling has just been on fire in terms of volumes. But obviously, the profit per vehicle is much lower, given the lower price. Shanghai GM has benefited immensely from vehicle launches in 2009. While I certainly think that those vehicles will continue to do well in '10, I think we'll have more competitive pressure at that point. But I think this has been a year that's been very, very good for our China business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Are there &#x2013; what are you expecting in terms of the additional payments to dealers for the wind-down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think total payment for dealers total, I mean, the number that I have in mind is about $600 million, 600 to $700 million. The number we've talked about publicly that would be associated with the wind-downs. That wouldn't include incentive costs associated with selling down inventories of let's say Pontiac or Saturn. But I think in terms of the total wind-down costs, it's in that range. We had provided that information in our testimony, for example. And I think the timing of it, a part of it is paid this year, and a reasonably large part of it will be paid next year.  Actually, one-quarter is paid up-front, and then three-quarters is paid at the conclusion of the wind-down period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's the status, Fritz, of the various areas of congressional pushback, closing some of these dealers? Is this a done deal or is there a risk that some dealers will stay in business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Here, I mean, there's no risk. I mean, we've been in dialogue with senior representatives in the Congress, with their staffs. We've been in dialog with the dealer groups actually, in an effort to find a non-legislative solution. We have been not only committed to doing that, we have also put forth a number of proposals, not all of which have been accepted, but a number of which have been viewed as constructive by the dealer groups to try to bring resolution to this matter. And our objective to bring this matter to closure in a non-legislative way. But I wouldn't say that's completed yet, it's not a done deal yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a last one, can you give us a feel for how things are tracking here so far in the month of November in terms of your sales and market share in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>November feels a lot like October, actually. Nicky, I think you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd say, as of today, we're on target with our projections for the month, in terms of where General Motors is going to come in, in terms of where the industry is going to come in. I think, as Fritz said, it does feel a lot like October. The industry appears to be strengthening at this little bit of a higher level. I wouldn't say it's great, but it's like it was in October where the SAAR got up on its own to a much better level. That's what we're seeing in November.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Fritz, Ray.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rod.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Hi, Rod.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Been reading about 3 to &#x20AC;4 billion of financing needs for Opel. Could you just talk a little bit more about what the prospective cash flow implications are likely to be of keeping that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so it's about &#x20AC;3 billion, and could that move around plus or minus 10%? Yes, it could, but it's about &#x20AC;3 billion. That would be over, let's say, 2009, 2010 timeframe. And so some part of it we've already experienced and that's a combination of cash burn from the business, and then the restructuring costs associated with restructuring the business. But that's the number &#x2013; that's certainly what we think is what's necessary in order to get this done. Again, some part of it would be in 2009, a reasonable part in front of us in 2010, and that's still what we think is the right absolute amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And can you explain just a little bit more on this variance in North America? You expected a $2.1 billion loss, and it was 650 million. How big was the lease residual adjustment, and are your structural costs converging on the 24 billion that you've been talking about before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a couple things on North America. I think clearly, the pricing environment is turning out better than our initial expectations. Part of it is lease residuals, but also part of it is we haven't had to put on as many incentives as we thought we would have to when we emerge from bankruptcy. So I think that's one positive factor. The second factor is our structural costs are running better than our expectations. So that's also contributed towards our favorable results here in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it better than the 24 billion that you've spoken about previously or can you just elaborate a little bit on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, I'd just be very cautious talking about the structural cost number, because when we go through fresh start, that number is going to change. And so I'm just very, very sensible trying to quote any structural cost targets at this juncture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And did you say that there was a material lease &#x2013; residual adjustment in this figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's favorable leasing residual adjustments. It was something you do in the ordinary course of business, because our residuals have improved during the quarter. We obviously have been reflecting those negatively in the third and the fourth quarter and the first quarter last year, then we had some favorable in the second and the third quarter. I would call these, Rod, in the category of the ordinary course. But it was favorable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you just remind us, in the non &#x2013; as part of the balance sheet, you guys, list, it looks like, restricted cash and marketable securities in non-current assets of 2.327 billion. What is that related to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just primary cash collateral requirements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But that's part of your cash position, right? That's separately from the 42 billion that you talked about before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's separate from the 42 points fix. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And your pension funded status and expense, if you could just give us those figures for the end of September?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally, we don't disclose it. I think, clearly, it's improved with the improvements in terms of the returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at this point, what Ray already talked about fresh start accounting, our problem is we need to re-measure all of our plan.s</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so as this point, we are &#x2013; I'll call it &#x2013; I mean, what we've seen is good returns in the pension fund. But we're flying without a compass in terms of trying to tell you what the under-funded liability is until we go through all the re-measurements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. At just lastly when you take it all in including this Opel change, are you still, from your perspective on plan with your target of getting the cash flow breakeven next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'd say &#x2013; hold that question until we actually have a chance to go through the 2010 plan. I mean, when we developed it, that was on an EBIT basis actually. And we've been encouraged by some of the results. The good news is on cash flow it's not really affected by fresh-start accounting. So it's a pretty pure number. But, I would say hold the question until we get a chance to update you on not only the calendar year, but also the 2010 and '11 plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things we're analyzing, as you know the Viability Plan assumed Opel was deconsolidated, and so now we're basically revising our plan to assume consolidation of our European operations. So that's an issue where we just need to kind of work through right now.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the supplier side. I think you mentioned in your comments, Ray, on the cash flow side, that you had an improvement from fewer suppliers needing assistance. Can you dimension that a little bit for us in terms of its impact on North American results as well? There was, obviously, an article in the [Wall Street ] Journal this morning highlighting that a big part of the up-side expectation was from that. I'm just wondering if you guys agreed with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, when we emerged from &#x2013; through the 363 sale, we weren't sure regarding whether a lot of suppliers here in North America would be able to support the production ramp-up of both General Motors and Chrysler. As you know, we run a negative working capital model at General Motors. On the supplier side, they actually have to finance the working capital up front before the production. So we were very sensitive of that particular issue, and hence in our viability plan, we have built in some contingency funding support in order to support the ramp up. Fortunately, this support we have not had to basically use much of the support, and that's part of the reason why we're seeing some positive variances in terms of our liquidity position. We closely monitored supplier situation here.</p>
          <p>Part of the reason why we are moving toward this net 47-day payment terms &#x2013; and again just as for background, we're going to pay our suppliers weekly as opposed to once a month at the beginning of the following month. This is going to smooth out the cash-flow profile for our supply base as well as smooth out the cash flow profile for us. We believe this is beneficial for both of them and us, because they will not have to actually access as much working capital financing from their financial institutions. And so we're trying to work constructively with the supply base in order to find out ways in order to try to help them, even through these particularly challenging times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about just in the operating profit or the EBIT variance versus the plan? Was that a material impact? Just, I guess, lower product costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was actually &#x2013; it was mainly on the cash flow part of the plan, as opposed to the earnings side of the plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, it would be fair to say we provided for contingency funding. We weren't &#x2013; I mean, we weren't as clear in terms of what the P&amp;L effect was. We weren't sure, so we provided for contingency funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And actually, also on structural costs, can you just tell us a little bit more about why engineering is expected to step up? I think in your phrasing, you said something to the extent of basically re-launching on engineering or something to that extent. And I'm just wondering, was engineering unusually low for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was. Engineering was unusually low in the quarter and actually was unusually low for the calendar year '09 relative to an absolute percentage of sales no matter how you look at it. Part of it was our cap spending was relatively low, but I would think as we look out into the fourth quarter and into 2010, engineering would come back to what would be a more normalized level for us. But it was very, very low, certainly in the third quarter, and below any sort of historical measure in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was that because some of the product development activities were on hold while you were restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean it's &#x2013; our launch activities, it's interesting. The delays in the launches that we had &#x2013; that we planned &#x2013; and I'll call it the '08 first half of '09 period, those vehicles are largely launching now, actually. And so I think part of it was simply, as we went into cash conservation mode and we're dealing with the bankruptcy, we just throttled back expenses for a short period of time. And I wouldn't say, it had a &#x2013; I mean, as I look out at it, it had some effect on us obviously, but the impact, the largest impact that we've had in terms of the program delays were vehicles that would have launched in late '08, early '09 that we're launching now or into 2010.</p>
          <p>So I think it was just the nature of dealing with the uncertainties of the environment and the bankruptcy rather than &#x2013; there's always some effect, but, to be honest as I look out at it, the impact in terms of program timing is fairly modest going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And I guess just one last one. Your market share in Europe having slid from about 9.4, I guess, midway through the year, to 8.3, I mean, how much of an effect do you think the uncertainty of the ownership of Opel has played there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's been some effect of that, but also there's some effect, for example &#x2013; our strongest market in Europe is the UK, and so we tend to &#x2013; there's usually a seasonal factor in the UK in March and September, which drives our share up. I also think to some degree it's &#x2013; we're getting ready to launch our new Astro. Astro, actually launching it now which is extremely important as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year. But I would say there's been some effect, but I think probably at least the equal effect has been, I'll call it the market mix as well as getting ready for the launch of the Astro</p>

          <p>Hey.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Real quick, looking at, you guys exited cash, with cash, with about 19 billion, and I guess the incremental proceeds from the DIP were around 40 billion. What are the major negatives during the quarter? I guess the secured debt of about six billion, but is there anything else I'm missing to kind of get you to that quarter-end cash number? There's major negative outflows during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just looking at the walk here. We actually paid down our secured debt facility in the second quarter, and so that was done before we emerged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing that you're probably wondering, when you compare versus our plan. Our plan had assumed that we would actually pay down the secured revolver in the third quarter, and that's part of one of the major variances in terms of our the Viability Plan versus our current third quarter estimates of cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that's a timing issue there, right? I already talked about Delphi, the Delphi payments, that they're to occur in the fourth quarter, versus the third quarter. In the third quarter, we assumed a Viability Plan. And there's also other timing issues, whereby, for example, contributions to the Canadian Health Care Trust, we thought under the Viability Plan that would occur in the third quarter. That's going to occur more likely next year. So when you look at the timing issues, there's about $13 billion worth of timing issues between the Viability Plan and our actual third quarter flows. And so that price explains a lot of what you see in terms of the difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then outside of structural costs, it seems like there's a lot of cost savings you guys could reap from reducing dealers. I think you guys came out in May with an estimate, I think it was like $961,000 savings per dealer. It was some &#x2013; it's a Bloomberg story that popped up. I don't know what document that came out of it. Is that a kind of good way to compartmentalize what we could see in additional dealer savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a couple of things. First, as we wind down, we talked about there's two components in savings we envisage from the dealer. Rationalization, the brand rationalization process, actually, two parts, brands and dealers. One is the I'll call contribution cost side of the business, where if you look at, we've spent &#x2013; this is '08 dollar, obviously you need to adjust the volume. There was about $2 billion a year associated with costs that we bear &#x2013; we provide support to the dealers, which don't necessarily get to the customer, which was a function of lack of profitability in our dealer network. And so there was a cost of having a over-dealered and an unprofitable dealer network, and it found its way into our P&amp;L through higher subsidies, costs that we bore, that over time we can move away from. As we look at it, we feel that was a reasonable estimate and we're starting to get some of that benefit in terms of our net pricing.</p>
          <p>Then the second was a fixed cost part of it, which was training, and right off the top of my head, I think the number was about $400 million a year of costs that we incurred with GM, because the deal was actually incurred costs, too &#x2013; but we at GM. And I think at this point, I don't have a better estimate than that, but I think the actual, I'll call it, right-sizing of our dealer network, rationalization of our brand, we feel like we're on track to not only wind up with the right-size network, but also reap those benefits over time.</p>
          <p>And the last point is &#x2013; maybe the most important point is we feel &#x2013; we're encouraged by the progress of our core brand, particularly Chevrolet, but also Buick, GMC, and Cadillac picking up the pace. There were a lot of questions that I received, and frankly, within the company. We weren't exactly sure how it was going to work. We were confident we could do it. But it's nice to see our core brands really picking up the pace, and not having a huge pressure overhang on our share in terms of winding down, particularly, Pontiac and Saturn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And then just generally, how was the ramping up of old GM going, and then specifically when do you expect bondholders will get equity distributions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's proceeding. I mean <mark type="inaudible" />, they are working hard in terms of trying to dispose of these assets there. In terms of timing, need to be determined in terms of when the wind up will finally occur. I don't want to speculate at this particular time. And they're diligently working away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as Fritz said <mark type="inaudible" /> you can't speculate. Well, you guys, I guess you don't know, but I like that quite last time Fritz and I talked. I will try one more question before I give up the line. What you guys expect the total claims from old GM going to be, I mean, we know that unsecured claims were about 27, but how do we &#x2013; how can we compartmentalize like what else is going to be come in there? I know the three to five billion has been used in the market, is that a generally good proxy?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Eric, this is one where I wish I had Al here. We're not really involved in that process. So I mean, I would be ill informed.

          <p>And your last question comes from the line Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Could you give some color on your OPEB obligations, post the UAW and Canadian VEBA? Is there going to be a material obligation, or is that obligation on that currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me talk about it. And then I can't answer your question in terms of providing the quantification because we need to go through re-measurement. But, if you think about OPEB more broadly, it is addressed. I think about the UAW, basically, we don't have any ongoing to obligations post 1-1. We delivered the note. We delivered the preferred and they have the shares. So I mean, importantly the UAW obligation is, at that point, defeased really. The IUE, and the steelworkers and a number of the other unions, we've negotiated agreements with them, which basically provide similar treatment to our salaried workforce.</p>
          <p>Our salary workforce capped, and not only capped pre-65, but post-65. Were out of the business. And then, finally, on life insurance, we've also implemented a number of changes, which will result in a fixed amount of OPEB and a substantially lower amount of OPEB. All that has got to get put through the system, but I think we believe we have addressed OPEB in the U.S. I think we've addressed OPEB in Canada in a permanent way.</p>
          <p>And in terms of quantifying it, as Ray talked about when he went to the deck, we haven't put the note in the preferred on the books yet, because we still have the OPEB on the books. So we need to go through the processes when we finish press start of basically removing the OPEB obligations and putting the debt and the preferred back on the books. When we have that, we'll obviously be happy to share that with you. We just haven't done that yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean from the North America side, we should still see both of these &#x2013; salary OPEB will still be there, and there will be life insurance, and then there is no change to the international OPEB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, international is Canada. We don't really have material OPEB outside of North America. We do have material pension outside of North America . For example, Germany, UK &#x2013; Germany is actually the biggest one, but we don't anticipate any changes in those liabilities going forward. They're still with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question, you seem to highlight the numbers for new GM and sort of exclude the first 10 days of old GM, but since the old GM numbers are taking up special items, at least when you look at EBIT perspective, I mean shouldn't we not just be looking at the combined number for those first 10 days as sort of a metric of how you're doing, or is that not the correct way to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. they're not comparable and I would be remiss if I didn't remind you that they're not comparable. I mean, I think you can make your own judgment. We've supplied the data. But in some cases, for example, when we go through fresh-start accounting, those numbers are going to fundamentally change. So, I mean, I can't give you any advice in that regard. But Ray talked about for example cash payments and supplier payment. It is relevant to mention that as you look at, for example, cash flow in the quarter. But I wouldn't &#x2013; it wouldn't be fair to provide you with advice and suggest you add those two cases, because in a number of cases, they're not comparable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you actually just mentioned cash flow. I think you said that working capital should be a negative in Q4. Why should that be? I mean, this quarter, part of the benefit was the production increase and you're guiding through a production increase again in &#x2013; quarter-over-quarter at least in Q4. Is there some &#x2013; why wouldn't we see another working capital benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually, as we look at it, I think that what we won't &#x2013; we won't have the same extent of the buildup of 8.2 billion. We're also going to have this $2 billion one-time adjustment from going to net 47 from MNS2, which will go the other way. It's a one-time item. Those would be the two factors I would point to. But I wouldn't say that we will have a working capital burn per se. I do think we're going to have this two billion effect, which we're going to deal with, but what we won't necessarily have is the 8.2 billion buildup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one last one, when you look at the structural cost, at least the rate of it for the new GM versus what you had year-to-date, it actually doesn't seem to be a huge decrease. Only looks like $1 billion if you were to annualize the run rate. I mean, has there not been &#x2013; I mean, what has structurally changed pre and post bankruptcy when you look at new and old GM, what sort of &#x2013; in terms of head count, what are the main factors that change it or is it really not much change on the structural front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Collin, what numbers are you referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm looking at the 9 billion this quarter and then <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; I guess on your press release.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, if you look at chart 21.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, these don't have fresh-star accounting, but if you look at it relative to the '08 period, I mean, it's a pretty significant decline, which does reflect the reductions in manpower, both salaried and hourly, engineering, capacity reductions in the plants. We're well on track to achieving our goals on structural costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I was trying to get at is, I'm looking at the run rate of the 22 versus the 9.1. And I think if you were to put it on a data basis &#x2013; maybe that's not fair, but they seem fairly similar. So were there any additional actions since you filed for bankruptcy that would have taken the cost you were running at or the changes you had done before bankruptcy even further below is that 9-1, is there more opportunity there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we would see further reductions as we get into 2010 as we finalize our actions. But I think, my take away from this is that we were &#x2013; we have been achieving the goals. We will execute the rest of our operating plan and hit our structural cost numbers, again. Ray is right. We need to apply fresh-start accounting, which will apply amortization expense to it, but I'll call it pre fresh-start accounting. We feel like we're on path to achieve our structural cost goals. It's always hard with this nine-day period. But if you divide 22 by two, you get 11; and it's &#x2013; and obviously, you've got an 80-day period, which is 9-1. So I mean, I do think we're on the right glide path.</p>
