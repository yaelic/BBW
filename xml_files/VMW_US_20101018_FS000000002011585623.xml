      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and welcome to VMware's third quarter 2010 earnings call. We will have prepared remarks from Tod Neilsen, our COO, and Mark Peek, our CFO. Paul Maritz, our CEO, is still out of the country following VMworld Europe in Copenhagen last week, but he is on the phone and will join Tod and Mark for the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements, such as those with the words will, believes, expects, continues, and similar phrases that denote future expectation or intent regarding our financial outlook, product offerings, customer demand, and other matters. These statements are based on the environment as we currently see it and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.</p>
          <p>In addition, during today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of VMware's performance, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures exclude the effect on our GAAP results of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, the net effect of amortization and capitalization of software, and acquisition-related items. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP measures, in the press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.</p>
          <p>The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 30 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Our fourth quarter quiet period begins at the close of business December 16, 2010. Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be in reference to our results for the comparable period of 2009.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand it over to Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone.</p>
          <p>Driven by a strong product portfolio and great field execution, we once again set new records in revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, and trailing 12-month free cash flows. Business was strong across geographies, transaction types, and products. We saw continued momentum of vSphere as customers adopt the vSphere platform as a strategic investment that delivers substantial cost savings, improved efficiency, and business agility.</p>
          <p>Our customers also are looking to VMware to help make cloud computing a reality. VMware is enabling the delivery of IT as a service use our evolutionary approach based on the vSphere platform. It is clear that virtualization is the platform for the cloud, and vSphere is the cornerstone enabling customers to leverage their existing IT investment and greatly simplifying their datacenters.</p>
          <p>In July, we successfully launched vSphere 4.1. In September, we released View 4.5. Customer feedback and early adoption has been very positive on both products. We're also making solid progress in our desktop business. Desktop license bookings exceeded 10% of total license bookings in the U.S. during the third quarter and year-to-date.</p>
          <p>In Q3, we acquired Integrien, a leader in real-time application and infrastructure performance and analytics software. We acquired TriCipher, a leader in secure access management and enterprise identity federation for cloud-hosted SaaS applications. While these acquisition will not add significant short-term revenue, they accelerate the expansion of our platform as we continue to build out the stack for this next era of computing.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash. Strong operating performance and capital efficiency led to trailing 12-month free cash flow growth of 39%, to $1.1 billion, or $2.51 per share. So all told, we had a great September quarter. On behalf of our long-term shareholders and management team, thanks to all of the people of VMware, our partners, and our customers.</p>
          <p>Now I'll take a few minutes to walk you through the details. Revenues for the third quarter were $714 million, up 46% from a year ago, or 47% measured on a constant currency basis. Licensed revenues were $343 million, an increase of 43% from the third quarter of a year ago. Demand was strong across our global regions and customer segments. And on the product side, the growing interest in our desktop solutions led to record quarterly desktop license revenues.</p>
          <p>With the release of vSphere 4.1, we changed our packaging to move certain features including vMotion, to Essentials Plus, one of our SMB-focused vSphere offerings. This resulted in a shift within our SMB SKUs from Essentials, with a list price of 495, to Essentials Plus, with a list price of 3,495. We also saw strong demand for our Enterprise packages. As a result of making greater functionality available to smaller customers, our overall ASPs per unit increased during the quarter. Average ASPs also benefited as a result of dogged discipline around discounting.</p>
          <p>U.S. revenues increased 47% from a year ago, to $362 million, representing slightly more than half of total revenue. In the Americas, the U.S. federal business was very strong, as the government continues on its virtualization journey in an effort to contain and manage both capital and operating costs while maintaining high confidence in security and reliability. Demand in Latin America, especially within Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, continued to be robust, with third quarter bookings up over 100% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>International revenues grew 44%, to $352 million, driven by strong demand across geographies. In Europe, despite the ongoing macroeconomic concerns, demand remains strong, especially in the UK and Germany. We also made significant progress in Eastern Europe and Russia.</p>
          <p>We once again saw strong demand across the Asia Pacific region, including China, Japan, and Australia. Total bookings for the region increased more than 50% year-over-year. We have also experienced increased interest in enterprise license agreements from our Asia Pacific customers. Enterprise license volumes are up triple digits year-to-date in China and Japan compared to the same period in 2009.</p>
          <p>Globally, enterprise license agreements were approximately 20% of total third quarter bookings. We continue to progress well with ELA renewals. Customers renewed their contracts at a higher dollar value than the original agreements, and on average, with a maintenance term of three years.</p>
          <p>Software maintenance and support revenue was $314 million, an increase of 48% from last year. In Q3, back maintenance was down slightly from a year ago. This was expected, as the program has now been operating six quarters, and we have done a good job getting customers current who had lapsed on their maintenance agreements. We expect back maintenance for Q4 to be lower compared to the same period of 2009. Customers continue to buy on average more than 24 months of support and maintenance with each new license purchased, illustrating their strong commitment to VMware as a core element of their datacenter architecture and longer-term IT strategy.</p>
          <p>Professional services revenue was $57 million, an increase of 55% from last year. The year-over-year increase was largely due to incremental services revenue from our M&amp;A activity, and customer training related to vSphere deployments.</p>
          <p>Although we're pleased with our financial results and operational progress during the first three quarters of 2010, the year-over-year comparables we now face are more difficult. There are three things I want to call out as you consider our fourth quarter guidance. First, in Q4 2009, we had a very successful promotion on Enterprise Plus upgrades, which drove over $100 million of upgrade bookings. Second, we continue to be concerned about the macroeconomic environment, particularly in Europe, as well as the impact of currency volatility on customer purchasing patterns. Finally, we're still uncertain as to the longer-term impact of our Q3 product repackaging design, and we're not convinced that the increase in ASPs we saw in Q3 is a trend or a mix shift that we'll see again in Q4.</p>
          <p>With this backdrop, we expect fourth quarter revenues to be within a range of $790 and $810 million, or year-over-year growth of between 30% and 33%. Revenue from our 2010 M&amp;A activity to date represents low single-digit percentage of our guidance. The results for the first three quarters, together with our Q4 guidance, imply a 2010 growth rate of 39% to 40% for total revenues.</p>
          <p>I'll now provide some details on our operating expenses. Unless otherwise noted, all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis, which are reconciled in the press release tables and posted on our IR website.</p>
          <p>Total operating expenses, including cost of services and cost of license, increased 5% sequentially to $510 million, driven largely by increased head count. During the quarter, we added approximately 500 people, with about 100 people coming from Integrien and TriCipher. We ended the quarter with approximately 8,700 employees.</p>
          <p>Third quarter R&amp;D expenses were flat, at $136 million, or 19% of revenues, as compared with 20.2% in the second quarter of 2010. Although the total number of employees in R&amp;D increased during the quarter, an intense focus on management of contractors and seasonally lower benefit costs such as FICA drove flat operating expenses for the group.</p>
          <p>Sales and marketing expenses were $230 million, or 32.3% of revenues, compared with 31.9% in the prior quarter. The increase was largely due to additional head count, continued geographic investments, and marketing events such as VMworld during the quarter.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expenses were $57 million, or 8% of revenue, compared to 7.6% of revenue in the second quarter. The sequential increase was largely due to an increase in bad debt expense, and funding of our charitable foundation during the quarter. G&amp;A head count was essentially flat.</p>
          <p>Our operating profit, measured on a non-GAAP basis, increased 9% sequentially, to $204 million, or 28.6% of revenue. This beat our forecast range due primarily to operating leverage from our revenue performance.</p>
          <p>The net impact of FX during Q3 was a negative 38 basis points to our non-GAAP operating margin.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.39, on 427 million diluted shares. The share repurchase program did not have an exact on EPS during the quarter. Fully-diluted EPS did benefit by a penny as a result of a decrease in our tax rate.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be 20%, and for the full year 2010, at 21%. This is down from our prior guidance of 22% due to the mix of operating income between the U.S. and international.</p>
          <p>Taking into account our adjustments to GAAP operating income that Mike disclosed at the start of the call, we expect the fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margins to be within a range of 29% to 30%. We expect our GAAP operating margin to be approximately 15 to 16 percentage points lower than our non-GAAP operating margin.</p>
          <p>Now on to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash of $2.9 billion, up more than $100 million compared to the prior quarter. During the third quarter, we used approximately $300 million in aggregate for M&amp;A activity, capital spending, and our share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter of 2010, we announced authorization to repurchase up to $400 million of our Class A common stock through 2011. The objective of the VMware repurchase program is to partially offset the dilution from employee stock issuance. In the third quarter, we repurchased $141 million of our Class A stock, and through the first three quarters of 2010, we repurchased a total of $286 million.</p>
          <p>Total deferred revenues were $1.5 billion, up 52% from the same period last year, and a 2% sequential increase. Over 90% of our deferred revenue is recognized with the passage of time or the delivery of professional services.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating cash flows, which exclude adjustments for capitalization of software development costs and excess tax benefits from stock compensation, were $268 million for the quarter, and $1.17 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flows for the quarter were $237 million, and $1.05 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow per diluted share was $0.56 for the quarter. Free cash flow per diluted share for the trailing 12 months was $2.51.</p>
          <p>As we've mentioned, free cash flow per share can be volatile in the short term, so we believe looking at it over the trailing 12 months is a better indicator of progress. We're paying attention &#x2013; increasing attention to the metric as a measure of our financial progress in the business, as it balances operating results, cash management, cash efficiency, and share dilution.</p>
          <p>The fully-diluted share count increased to 427 million shares for the third quarter, driven by the impacts of a higher share price. We expect our fourth quarter 2010 diluted weighted average share count to be approximately 430 million shares, and for the full year, we expect the diluted share count to be approximately 425 million shares.</p>
          <p>Before I hand it off to Tod, I want to share with you how we are looking at the business for next year. 2011 will be a much more difficult comparable than 2010, and we expect server shipments to grow more slowly in 2011 relative to 2010. For the first quarter of 2011, we're currently planning for total revenues to be down sequentially from Q4, or just under 25% growth year-over-year. This is consistent with cycles commonly seen in enterprise software. The non-GAAP operating margin in the first quarter of 2011 is also expected to decline sequentially.</p>
          <p>We'll talk more about 2011 in January, however as we go through our 2011 planning cycle, it will be a year of significant investment, with little, if any, operating margin expansion. So we'll have a tough revenue comparable from 2010, an inherently limited visibility at this time, I believe we can deliver 20% growth in 2011. I will provide more information in January after we report our Q4 results and have completed our 2011 go-to-market plans.</p>
          <p>To summarize, we're very pleased with our execution and solid performance. We continue to manage our resources prudently while making the key investments necessary to maximize our long-term growth and free cash flow per share.</p>
          <p>Let me turn it over to Tod.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with our strong third quarter performance driven by product momentum, cost control, and seamless execution across all regions and product segments. As Mark mentioned, revenue grew 46%, to $714 million. Operating margins came in at 28.6%, despite the closing of two new acquisitions and the further integration and additional investments for acquisitions we made in the first half of the year. And for the third quarter in a row, ELA renewal rates were high, and the total dollar value of renewed ELAs exceeded the value of the original agreements.</p>
          <p>Demand for our vSphere products remains strong. Enterprise and Enterprise Plus unit and dollar sales were once again very strong. Coupled with the Essentials Plus performance, we saw a sequential increase in our blended ASPs. Our go-to-market investments in key international markets are paying off, as we continue to see momentum in Japan, China, U.S. federal, Russia, and Latin America, among others. In particular, we experienced triple-digit year-over-year orders growth in Russia, a market we are committed to serving, as we believe there is a significant long-term potential which we are just beginning to tap.</p>
          <p>Regarding the desktop market opportunity, our ability to turn customer interest and evaluations into design wins and purchases is improving, as our desktop business posted record quarterly license revenue. In the third quarter, we closed a seven-figure desktop ELA with 6,000 seats with one of the largest automotive parts suppliers in the world. This particular customer has been a very satisfied vSphere customer, and is now leveraging their expertise and installed base of vSphere to enable their desktops. As we've mentioned before, we are still at the early stages of the desktop market opportunity. These are good signs that VMware is well positioned to capture our fair share of the VDI market over the coming years, and we are bullish on the desktop opportunity.</p>
          <p>We also made significant announcements at VMworld 2010, where over 17,000 attendees, including partners and customers, gathered in San Francisco to share best practices and technologies enabling cloud computing. Last week, in Copenhagen, Denmark, over 6,000 attendees came to experience VMworld Europe. At both events, we presented a vision for IT as a service and the emergence of a new IT stack that drives innovation across three core areas, including infrastructure, application platforms, and end-user computing. The reaction to our vision was very positive. With over 23,000 people attending VMworld globally, the momentum we take forward is strong.</p>
          <p>At the infrastructure level, we announced a new product called VMware vCloud Director, a new solution focused on helping customers build private clouds for both delivering and consuming IT services. We are receiving positive response from customers, including Sabre Holdings which is using vCloud Director to transform how they deliver IT services to the business. Sabre is calling vCloud Director a game-change. We announced a set of new products called VMware vShield, our security offerings for virtual and cloud environments that deliver better security than traditional physical offerings at a fraction of the cost.</p>
          <p>We now have the solutions to enable our customers and service provider partners to deploy and operate, with standard infrastructure, a hybrid cloud environment. A hybrid cloud is the union of a private cloud with services from the public cloud. We believe the hybrid cloud model will deliver the best economics and most agility for customers over the coming years.</p>
          <p>For developers, we launched VMware vFabric, the first cloud application platform that leverages the Spring framework along with a suite of technologies, some of which we acquired over the last few quarters. The result is an application platform, tuned for VMware virtualized environments, as well as cloud scale, but engineered with openness as a foundation component to allow our customers to have the ability to select whatever technologies they prefer.</p>
          <p>On the end-user front, we announced general availability of View 4.5, the first enterprise-class solution that delivers rich virtual desktop experiences, online or offline. As I mentioned briefly earlier, View 4.5 is a solid step forward, and customers are reacting positively to the improved security, lower operating cost, and simplified desktop administration and management. We believe desktop virtualization and VDI is an important step in a broader, user-centric approach to personal computing. But VDI is just the first step. VMware's vision is to ensure secure access to applications and data from any device, where and when the user needs it. We previewed an effort called Project Horizon at VMworld to illustrate a view into how we see this market evolving.</p>
          <p>On the M&amp;A front, we closed the acquisitions with Integrien and TriCipher during the quarter, and I want to welcome the nearly 100 employees from these companies to VMware. During 2010, we have closed seven M&amp;A transactions and successfully integrated over 600 employees from these acquisitions.</p>
          <p>In summary, we are pleased with our overall execution in the third quarter, and believe we are strengthening our position as the central vendor enabling the next generation of computing. We expect a good finish to 2010, and are excited about the prospects of 2011 and beyond. I'd like to thank our customers, VMware employees, and our incredible ecosystem of partners for their continued support and commitment.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn the call over for questions. Paul, Mark, and I are available to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer section <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Heather Bellini of ISI Group. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could discuss the ELA renewal opportunity that's in front of you in the fourth quarter of this year, and contrast that with the level up for renewal in the third quarter that just ended?</p>
          <p>And also if you could compare it to the fourth quarter of last year, since that seems to be something people are pretty fixated on? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Heather. Yeah, ELA renewals overall have been progressing and tracking very well, and we expect the volumes to continue to increase. Certainly Q4, the volumes that are available for renewal are more significant than they were in the most recently completed quarter, and we have them built into our pipeline as we look forward to guidance.</p>
          <p>Compared to Q4 of 2009, we didn't have that much ELA renewal volume in the pipeline at the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started the ELA effort in earnest in the 2007 timeframe, and typically, the ELAs have a three-year term to them, so it's &#x2013; this year and that we're starting to see them come up for renewal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and the reason why I ask is just because a lot of people are fixated on the change in deferreds this quarter and looking at your bookings number, and I think some people look at that, and I guess maybe if you could share with us how you felt you did in bookings versus your plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, the quarters were &#x2013; Q3 and Q2 were sequentially pretty close to each other, and we, compared to plan, we had a very solid quarter. We beat our expectations on the revenue side. As I mentioned, our discounting was held well in check, and so we weren't stretching at the end of the quarter to get deals closed and have a real strong pipeline headed into the fourth quarter, which is why we were able to take up our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Israel Hernandez of Barclays. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to dig down a little deeper on some of your comments around Europe. I think last quarter, there was some patchy softness. And this quarter you didn't give us any growth rates but you did so for some of the other geographies. So could you maybe speak to what you're seeing in Europe and what still gives you some of that caution in the &#x2013; that you gave in your prepared remarks? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll start off on that. The &#x2013; we juts got back from Europe last week, and saw in Q3 solid performance, where we hit our plans and our expectations. We called out Germany and the UK on the call as far as doing well, and we're just cautious about what the macro environment looks like there. But we're very pleased with some of the emerging markets like Russia as well, and our business is doing quite well there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you see any shift in any larger deals closing in &#x2013; during the quarter? Or with respect to your pipeline? Bill, are you seeing any changes there among your large deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are starting to do more of ELAs. Historically the European business for us has been more of a transaction, a channel business. And as the team is getting in place, we are doing more ELAs or larger deals than we've done historically. But I'm trying to think right now if there was any this quarter that stood out and I can't think of one off the top of my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Mark, just to follow up with Heather's question, you said bookings were about &#x2013; well, you actually said revenue was &#x2013; came at according to plan. But bookings were actually down about 5% sequentially, versus up about 15% last year. And keep in mind, we realize that last year coming out of a recession, and so that obviously had an impact. But the prior two years in this quarter, it was flattish. I think it was maybe flat to down a percent. Just given with the momentum you've shown, it just &#x2013; I think that's what she was getting at, that's what people are sort of focused on. And given that you're signing more ELAs in international markets, as Tod just said, both in Europe, and I think you said in prepared remarks in Asia Pac. I'm just &#x2013; I just &#x2013; if you can comment on that, if we're &#x2013; the bookings being down 5%. I think that's why your stock's weak tonight, after the close. If you can just give a little more color on that, that might be helpful.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John. Yeah, it &#x2013; we were actually pleased with the quarter from a bookings perspective across the board. We hit our plans in each of the geographies. And again, we had a real strong focus on our discounting from a &#x2013; particularly from an ELA perspective, yet we still had about 20% of our total bookings in enterprise license agreements. And so we carry a strong pipeline into the fourth quarter, and we're overall pleased with the quarter.</p>

          <p>No. It was actually very consistent from where it's been over the last several quarters. So about &#x2013; it's over 24 months in total per license, and ELAs were approximately three years.</p>

          <p>Hi, everybody. I wanted to ask you, you &#x2013; it sounded like you had spent a lot more time on this call on VDI than you have before. Just wanted to get a little more granularity on that. I mean, is it safe to say that you saw some meaningful acceleration in that business in the third quarter, and is that kind of the start of an inflection here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we certainly saw positive momentum on the desktop opportunity and strong results. As we've said repeatedly that this is an emerging market opportunity, and whether -- or when it's going to tip, we're not sure, but we're encouraged with the sales results, and we can feel the momentum, with View 4.5 coming out and our offline support seeing strong customer interest, and we're bullish on that desktop opportunity.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the deferred questions that people have been asking about, was there any dynamics in terms of the percentage of that deferred balance that comes from license revenue from Q2 to Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there wasn't really much change to it at all. It continues to be less than 10% of overall deferreds, and there really wasn't a significant change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I just had one big picture one, if I could squeeze it in. And I know you kind of fairly routinely survey your customers about kind of how penetrated they are by virtualization. I'm just curious if there's anything new kind of over the last three months in terms of some of your inquiries or work with your customers about where you think we are in the penetration cycle?</p>
          <p>And kind of related to that, what's the latest release of vSphere has done in terms of opening up your addressable market for kind of what can be virtualized, as a percentage of people's total environments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's been no change within the quarter for sure with respect to the percent virtualized. As we said in the past, in 2010, the average has been about 25% or so of virtualized in general is where customers are. The thing we're finding with vSphere 4.1, even 4.0 for that matter, is how we've pushed some of the capacity constraints and performance issues so that tier one applications are definitely being virtualized for those customers that are in the 40, 50, 60% virtualized approach. So we still have a lot of runway and opportunity ahead of us there and we're encouraged that vSphere is enabling it.</p>
          <p>One study we did in March of this year &#x2013;  in actually in March of 2007, we asked customers what their target percent virtualized was, and in 2007, they said, gosh, if we could be 50% virtualized, that would be great. We asked that same question again this year, and the results came back and said they want to be 90% virtualized as far as their target. So as they get more experience with it and build up their expertise and see the value, they want to, you know, continue to move along the journey.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Mark, you mentioned ELAs are renewing at a higher dollar volume than the original contract. Can you give us a sense of kind of where the average deals are coming in? Are they coming in 10%, 20%, 30% higher? Some other software companies have given us metrics to give us sense of where this number's coming in.</p>
          <p>And then if you could also address your operating margin comment. You mentioned little to any margin expansion for 2011. And I guess, from just , perspective, what changes in your expense structure for 2011 that will cause this? You saw meaningful margin improvement this year so far, so why wouldn't that continue through for 2011? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First comment, just on the size of &#x2013; relative size of ELA renewals. I'm going to keep it at this point, just at they're increasing at more than 100%. It still is pretty early in the cycle. We've just gone really through the end &#x2013; Qs 1, 2, and 3. Q4 is where the volume begins to pick up a little bit more, and so I think it's just a little bit premature on our part to start to call the number out. And there's been some volatility in each quarter, but each quarter has been more than the original license amount.</p>
          <p>With respect to margins, it's early in our planning cycle, and we continue to believe there's an awful lot of opportunity ahead of us, and we don't want to constrain our future revenue growth and some of the product opportunities and market opportunities we have by focusing too much on margin expansion at this point. And so, I just wanted to signal that it's early. We'll talk more about margins and revenue in January, but at this point, we see a lot of investment on our plate. It'll largely come through products and engineering as well as continued market expansion in the field.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more detail on the 2011 sort of initial bar of 20% growth, and talk to us a bit about sort of any color around license versus the maintenance component?</p>
          <p>And then help us think about new product contribution there, versus sort of product that you can generate from the traditional sale of capacity around vSphere that's driven most of the company's growth thus far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Certainly in 2011, we anticipate greater contribution from the non-vSphere products, desktop management, really across the board. It's very early for us in our planning cycle and frankly, we're really just finishing up wrapping up a successful Q3, looking forward to the fourth quarter in which there's an awful lot of work and an awful lot of seasonality to be done. So I just wanted to put down the 20% bar as &#x2013; as you guys are thinking ahead to your models, certainly as a bar that I think is achievable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just relative to maintenance. I know as we looked into &#x2013; over the last few quarters, you've had recapture of back maintenance, and should we expect that you have a tougher comp on the maintenance and that we actually see maintenance grow a little bit slower than that 20%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>: Not necessarily. I mean, the deferred revenue from maintenance should give us a bit of a tailwind. We'll continue to work the lapsed maintenance contracts and maintenance agreements. We expect that to be down in the fourth quarter, a year-over-year basis, by a bit, because the program has been in place for some time.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much. To get into the deferred revenues a little bit. It looks like you're realized as a percentage of bookings are fine, unchanged, but could there be something going on in the broader server market? Can you talk about the massive catch-up spending that people have put in place over the past three quarters? And to what &#x2013; where are we in the cycle of the catch-up spending of servers? Which in some sense are correlated to &#x2013; or your license terms are correlated to the server growth. Can you talk to the market dynamics there? And also, secondly and finally, the per-VM pricing is encouraging to see, some of your products being priced that way. How realistically &#x2013; again that new pricing model, help your revenue growth in fiscal '11? Thanks, that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just &#x2013; yeah, on the overall dynamics of server shipments versus license revenue, we're certainly out &#x2013; from a license revenue growth perspective, outpacing server shipment growth at this point.  And it's going to be &#x2013; although directionally, server shipments are very important to our longer-term growth, there is going to be some lumpiness, and we expect to outpace it over time, either from the sale of enterprise license agreements, or from refresh of boxes that that were sold in previous quarters.</p>
          <p>Longer term &#x2013; as we look ahead to 2011, the forecasts are that server shipments will go down, and so we're building that into our plans and then to the early look at 2011 revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the other things, to just to add &#x2013; to address the per VM, but then also, on the server shipments, is that we announced at VMworld that we hit a tipping point in Q3, that more virtual machines are being deployed or shipped, or virtual workloads, than physical servers. And so, I believe it was IDC that came out with that study. And so, going forward, expect that acceleration to continue.</p>
          <p>On the per-VM pricing, we did roll out that out in '03. We've seen positive customer response to it, and as we continue to execute with our management products, we expect that will be a good way to bring additional revenue to our mix.  As you know, right now, the management products are still getting started, and have a lower penetration than we would like, and so as we improve in that business, the per-VM pricing should certainly help us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much, and good afternoon, and I guess this question is for Tod. We've seen a survey or two that indicates that, as customers start to reach 30 to 40% of physical servers virtualized, that there can be some customer pause due to, in part, management complexity. And clearly, VMware is continuing to grow at a very healthy rate; you're building on your management tool kit, as you just referenced. But I was curious if you're seeing that at all anecdotally within your customer base, and if so, how you approach that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so right about the 30% virtualized point, customers realize that they're doing much more than just installing software, that they're actually transforming the way they run their business and approach ITs. And so in the triangle of people, process, and technology, at about 30% virtualized, they need to make sure they've got the right processes in place, and change management, and people. And so we've got some professional services offerings that VMware conducts, as well as our ecosystem of partners, that can go in and help customers get through that, and then get to the other side.</p>
          <p>When I meet with customers, it's rare for me to find a customer that &#x2013; or meet with a customer that's only 40% virtualized, because 40 is simply a milestone on the way to 100. But at 30%, it's not uncommon for me to see them all the time, and we help them address these core issues.</p>
          <p>Lastly on this, from a sales perspective, we've actually helped provide our sales force with some tools, mapping wherever a customer is on the journey. So if they're 10% or if they're 30% or if they're 50% virtualized, the salesperson can go in, ask the appropriate questions, be aware of what potential stumbling blocks or issues they may have, and help the customer get over those to continue on down the path.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Tod, that's helpful, but just a quick follow-up for Mark. Naturally this is the first full quarter with a year-over-year FX effect, and I know you broke out the margin component. Just curious, in terms of the top line effect, if that was meaningful at all?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Good afternoon. You mentioned in your prepared comments that some of the ASP improvement you saw in the third quarter may not necessarily continue. I guess I was wondering, was there anything specific to the third quarter that you thought was sort of unique, if you will, that may not continue, and what underpins the guidance in the fourth quarter with respect to ASPs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, Adam. During the third quarter, we were actually a little bit surprised at how well Essentials Plus performed relative to Essentials, and there's a fairly significant gap in ASPs between the two products. We attribute that to the fact that vMotion was moved down to Essentials Plus. We're assuming that we'll lose some of that ASP as we built our guidance, because we don't know what the fourth quarter will hold, and in fact, we'd like to see a little bit more mix shift into Essentials.</p>

And in 2011, it won't be surprising if we continue to do acquisitions to accelerate our opportunity in the space. At VMworld, I came up with a phrase, our acquisition strategy is really one of organic accelerants, in that we buy &#x2013; have been buying smaller companies that we've bring in. We then add resource to and further accelerate our opportunity in the market. I don't envision us doing anything big or substantial but would follow the same sort of path that we have done this year, as far as acquisitions for next year.</p>

          <p>We haven't really &#x2013; we haven't broken out, but just &#x2013; from an install base perspective, we had &#x2013; in Q4 of last year, we ran a promotion, since Enterprise Plus was really a new SKU for us as a result of the vSphere release, and we were very successful in that promotion, had over $100 million of bookings related specifically just to the Enterprise Plus upgrade. And so our &#x2013; as our customers sort of move on the virtualization journey, they're migrating towards Enterprise Plus for those that have acquired it. We've also had strength in overall bookings for the quarter in Enterprise Plus, relative to Enterprise, but we're not breaking out specifically the numbers for each SKU.</p>

          <p>Hey, Mark. Michael Turits. A question for you. Last quarter, you mentioned one of the potential headwinds for revenue growth, or license growth in 2011, being the amount of licenses that had been inventoried in ELAs. So I'm wondering what you think the impact will be as those ELAs start to anniversary as we get through the beginning of 2011?</p>
          <p>And also, if there's any potential impact as we go to bigger multicore processors, if that's hurting license, given that we're not on a per-VM license model there yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's &#x2013; as we look ahead to vSphere license growth &#x2013; and sometimes the disconnect that you see between server shipments and processor shipments and license growth is the fact that enterprise agreements are in part a buy-forward, yet a commitment by our customers to the vSphere platform. We work very closely with our customers, and &#x2013; to make sure that they have the tools and the intellectual property to continue to deploy the number of licenses and they purchase. And so we monitor it carefully, and as we're seeing from the renewals of the enterprise license agreements, so far, it really hasn't been a significant concern. Certainly, the more powerful processors, you need sort of fewer licenses to do more virtual machines, but we're &#x2013; but customers also finding ways to consume those virtual machines, and as Tod mentioned, today we have more VMs being deployed than actual servers.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I'd add is we track very carefully, not only the consumption, or the usage and deployments of vSphere, but also the features they're deploying, and in our ELAs, we're seeing strong adoption of our fault tolerance capability and high availability and some of our more advanced features, and move well beyond just a hypervisor that showed us the robustness of their usage, and that also consumes CPU and core and continue that virtuous cycle.</p>
