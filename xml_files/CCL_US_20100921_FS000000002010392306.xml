          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder this conference is being recorded Tuesday, September 21, 2010. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Frank, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. This is Howard Frank in Miami. David Bernstein, our Senior VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer is with me here in Miami as is Beth Roberts, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Micky Arison is in Genoa, Italy at our Costa Cruise offices with Pier Luigi Foschi. He is also on the call, but he is in Italy and he and I will coordinate on the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Before I talk about the outlook I'm going to turn it over to David who will give you some color on the third quarter and the cost outlook for the fourth quarter. David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Howard. I will begin the call by reading the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which may cause the actual results or achievements of Carnival to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For further information, please see Carnival's earnings press release and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter, our EPS was $1.62. The third quarter came in above the midpoint of our June guidance by $0.17 per share. The improvement was driven by a number of things. First, net revenue yields in local currency came in up 6.2%. This was slightly better than the 5 to 6% forecasted in June guidance, and was worth about $0.03 per share. As Micky indicated in the press release, despite ongoing economic concerns, cruise ticket prices remain strong close to sailing, rewarding guests that booked early.</p>
          <p>Secondly, net cruise costs without fuel and in local currency came in down 2.4%. This was significantly better than our June guidance of up 1 to 2%, and was worth $0.08 per share. $0.02 of the 0.08 relates to the one-time legal settlement. The other $0.06 was broad-based. It was spread across most areas of ship operating expense, as well as SG&amp;A. Our operating companies once again did an outstanding job controlling costs.</p>
          <p>Third, our results benefited $0.04 from lower fuel prices and a weaker dollar and lastly, several small items were worth about $0.02 per share.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the third quarter operating results versus the prior year. Our capacity increased 6.2% for the third quarter of 2010, with the majority of the increase once again going to our European brands. Our European brands grew 8%, while our North American brands grew 3.7%. Our net revenue yields also increased 6.2% in the third quarter, and this was driven by our North American brands who were up 14.3% with increases across all itineraries. I'm happy to report that our North American brands recaptured more than half the yield they lost in the third quarter last year from the impact of the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>Our European brands experienced flat, local currency net ticket yields which were in line with our expectations. We were pleased with this performance, given the uncertain economic environment, their 8% capacity increase, and the fact that the European brands held up so well last year, giving them a more difficult prior year comparison.</p>
          <p>For net on board revenue yields we experienced a 1.3% increase in local currency, which was in line with our expectations. The increase in net on board revenue yields occurred on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
          <p>In summary, we were very encouraged by the strong performance of our North American brands' net ticket yields, the solid performance of our European brands on increased capacity, and our overall improved on-board revenue yields.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency were down 2.4% versus the prior year. If you exclude the charge for the British pension plan, which was included in our guidance, and the one-time legal settlement, which was not in our guidance, our costs were down 4%, which was consistent with the first and second quarters. The decline was driven by economies of scale, benefits of cost reduction programs, and a low inflationary environment.</p>
          <p>Fuel prices this quarter were up 17% versus last year, costing us $57 million. And while the stronger dollar translates into lower costs, overall the stronger dollar translated into $72 million of lower earnings. So, despite a fuel and currency negative impact of $0.16, our EPS improved $0.29 this quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to our 2010 outlook, I will skip the net revenue yields, as Howard will discuss that shortly. For the full year, net cruise costs per available lower berth day, excluding fuel and in local currency, are projected to be down 4%. The decline is driven by the ongoing cost reductions, which is widespread across all categories of costs, economies of scale, and once again, the low inflationary environment.</p>
          <p>Based off of the current spot prices for fuel, fuel prices for the full year are projected to be $486 per metric ton for 2010, versus $363 per metric ton in '09, costing us an additional $410 million, or $0.51 per share. So, in the end, fuel is driving our costs up, and therefore, in current dollars and including fuel, our costs are expected to be up 1% for the year.</p>
          <p>At this point, I will turn the call back to Howard.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Let me talk about the yield outlook. I'll first cover our recent booking patterns during the last 13 weeks. That's the period since our last earnings call. These would be for bookings for cruises covering the next three quarters, the fourth quarter that we're currently in of 2010, and the first and second quarters of 2011.</p>
          <p>Across the fleet, bookings during the 13-week period, this past 13-week period, have been strong, running 8% ahead on a year-over-year basis. Ticket prices, excluding prices for winter Caribbean cruises are running higher year-over-year, winter Caribbean pricing is lower, largely as a result of significant increases in industry Caribbean capacity, which in the first quarter is approximately 15% higher, and our fleet capacity in the Caribbean winter is up 10% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter of 2010, close-in pricing has been strong, especially for North American brand bookings. As a result, pricing has held up quite well and fourth quarter local currency yields continue to strengthen versus last year at the same time.</p>
          <p>Turning to the booking patterns by major markets, for North American brand cruises during the next nine months, the booking momentum for the last 13 weeks has been strong. As I previously mentioned, with the exception of Caribbean itineraries, pricing for North American brand bookings during this 13-week period is significantly higher than a year ago; however, even if we include the lower price Caribbean cruises, the cost of continued stronger pricing and other itineraries, overall pricings on bookings for North American brands for the last 13 weeks is in line with last year's pricing.</p>
          <p>The impact of the lower Caribbean pricing will be felt more significantly in the first quarter when our Caribbean capacity is greatest, and to a lesser extent, in the second quarter when Caribbean capacity is reduced. Our more recent bookings over the last six weeks covering the next three quarters is even more encouraging, showing solid overall pricing improvement for North American brands.</p>
          <p>For our Europe brands, booking volumes for the last 13 weeks have been very strong on a year-over-year basis for cruises during the next three quarters with slightly higher local currency pricing. And booking volumes during the last six weeks for Europe brands have also shown significant improvement on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>The encouraging European brand booking momentum reconfirms our view that the less penetrated cruise markets in Europe will continue to grow profitably, despite the slow growth economies that currently exist throughout continental Europe and the U.K.</p>
          <p>Given the current booking and pricing momentum, taken together with the price increases from business already on our books, we are currently forecasting that fleet-wide local currency revenue yields in the first half of 2011 will be higher on a year-over-year basis. And this factors in the lower Caribbean pricing. European yields will be stronger than North American yields in the first quarter, also as the result of the lower Caribbean prices. I will have further pricing color on the individual quarters later on in my report.</p>
          <p>In terms of fleet expansion for 2011, we have four ships scheduled for delivery, the Aida Sol, in March &#x2013; at the end of March of 2011, the Carnival Magic, at the end of April, 2011, the Seabourn Quest in late May and the Costa Favolosa in late June.</p>
          <p>Our capacity increase in 2011 is estimated to be 5.4% for the full year. Breaking that down by quarters, it would be 6.7% in Q1, 4.9% in Q2, 5% in Q3, and 5.1% in Q4. With the delivery of the four ships in 2011, our European brand capacity will be close to 40% of our overall fleet capacity, which is a target we set out after the completion of our merger with P&amp;O Princess in 2003.</p>
          <p>Although early, we are encouraged with recent booking patterns and feel confident that we will have a solid financial performance in 2011, even in this slow growth global economic environment. With estimated CapEx of $2.5 billion in 2011, we are forecasting that we will &#x2013; that 2011 will be the first year for driving significant free cash flow in our business, and as cash flow increases, and our CapEx slows in future years, free cash flow is expected to further increase.</p>
          <p>As to 2010 earnings guidance, for the full year 2010, as we've indicated, the midpoint of our earnings guidance is now $2.50 per share, which is $0.30 higher than the midpoint guidance of $2.20 a share we established back in December of 2009 at the start of the year. The major factors causing the earnings increase in 2010, looking at it with some perspective right now, are higher ticket yields of approximately $0.23 a year, higher onboard yields of $0.05 a share, lower costs of $0.21 a share, and positive one-off items of $0.08 a share. Fuel and currency, on the other hand, affected earnings negatively by $0.27 a share. And this all nets out to a plus $0.30 over our original guidance.</p>
          <p>Let me digress a second and take a moment to make a comment. The achievement of our improved 2010 financial results during these difficult economic times is particularly gratifying, and a tribute to our strong management teams throughout the world and their agility in responding to local economic conditions in their markets. The strategy of having strong national brands supported by separate management teams in each of our major markets around the world provide us with a major competitive advantage in those markets, including the ability to maximize our profits, especially during these difficult and challenging economic times.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn to each of the quarters, and give you a little bit more color. The fourth quarter of 2010, the quarter that we're currently in, our capacity is up 5.8%. 1.4% in North America, 10.7% in Europe on a fleet-wide basis. With very little inventory left to sell in the quarter, occupancies are in line with a year ago with local currency pricing running nicely higher.</p>
          <p>North American brands in the fourth quarter are 50% in the Caribbean, up from 45% last year, with all the other itineraries individually below 10%. Occupancies for North American brands in the fourth quarter are slightly ahead year-over-year with pricing also nicely higher.</p>
          <p>Late fourth quarter bookings for North American brands continue to be strong and yields have shown gradual improvement week-on-week. By the time the quarter closes, we expect North American brand revenue yields to increase in the 3 to 4% yield on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>For European brands, they are 72% in Europe itineraries, down slightly from 78% last year for the fourth quarter, with all other itineraries individually under 10%. European local currency pricing is also higher year-over-year with occupancies at approximately the same levels. We are currently forecasting an increase in European brand local revenue yields in the fourth quarter by approximately 2%, which is a very positive result considering the 11% increase in capacity for the Europe brands during the quarter.</p>
          <p>From an overall standpoint as indicated in the press release, we are forecasting fourth quarter fleet-wide revenue yields to increase in the range of 2.5 to 3.5% on a local currency basis and lower by 1 to 2% on a current dollar basis as a result of the strengthening dollar during this period on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Costs excluding fuel are expected to be down 1 to 2% on a local currency basis and on a current dollar basis, lower by 5 to 6%.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be in the 0.32 to $0.36 range. This includes the impact of unfavorable currency and fuel costs of $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter, and this &#x2013; and also, compares to the $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the first quarter of 2011, fleet-wide capacity for the quarter, as I indicated, is up 6.7%, 4.2% for North American brands, 11.3% for Europe brands. On a fleet-wide basis, first quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher on a year-over-year basis with occupancies running slightly behind a pattern similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>For North American brands, they are 66% in the Caribbean, up from 62% in the prior year and 11% in the Mexican Rivera, which is about the same as the prior year with the balance in various other itineraries. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, winter Caribbean pricing is lower than a year ago on lower occupancies. Mexican Rivera pricing is nicely higher from the lower levels we experienced a year ago on higher occupancies and pricing across all other itineraries is higher on slightly lower occupancies. Taking all itineraries together, including the Caribbean, pricing is currently in line with last year.</p>
          <p>Looking at our European brands in the first quarter they're 25% in Europe itineraries 23% in the Caribbean, down from 29% the prior year and 18% in South America, which is about the same as in prior year, with the balance in various other itineraries.</p>
          <p>Local currency pricing across all European itineraries is higher year-over-year on slightly higher overall occupancies. We are very pleased with the booking patterns and pricing in Europe to this point, which is being achieved despite the 11.3% increase in European capacity in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>From an overall standpoint in Q1, based on what we're seeing in North America and Europe on a local currency basis, we are estimating that fleet-wide revenue yields for the first quarter of 2011 will be higher, in the 2% range, driven largely by strong forecasted increases in European brand pricing, net of a small decline in North American pricing, largely the result of the lower pricing environment in Q1 and the very competitive Caribbean winter market. Current dollar pricing at today's exchange rate is forecast to be slightly down year-over-year. This is in Q1.</p>
          <p>Turning to Q2, fleet-wide capacity as I indicated, earlier is up 4.9% in the second quarter, 2.5% for North America, 8.5% for our European companies. Let me emphasize that second quarter booking data is still in the early stages of development and being provided to give you a picture of how the quarter is shaping up at the present time. On a fleet-wide basis, second quarter 2011 local currency pricing is higher on a year-over year basis with occupancies in line with the previous year. For North American brands, they are 55% in the Caribbean, about the same as last year, but 11% lower than in the first quarter of 2011. The balance in various other itineraries all individually under 10%.</p>
          <p>Currently pricing for North American brands in the second quarter is higher than a year ago with occupancies currently in line with last year. Similar to the first quarter, Caribbean pricing is lower in the second quarter, but improved from the first quarter. And pricing across all other North American brands' itineraries is higher year-over-year.</p>
          <p>For European brands they are 61% in Europe itineraries, up from 57% a year ago with the balance in various other itineraries.</p>
          <p>Similar to the first quarter, local currency pricing for European brand cruises is running nicely higher year-over-year. Occupancies are slightly down from the prior year levels which given the 8.5% capacity increase in Europe &#x2013; for Europe brands is quite acceptable, especially given the higher pricing currently being achieved.</p>
          <p>While the booking picture for the second quarter of 2011 is still in its early stages of development, it is progressing quite well, and assuming no significant changes in current booking patterns, we currently are forecasting that fleet-wide local currency revenue yields in the second quarter of 2011 will be higher for both North American and European brands.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator, I will turn it back to &#x2013; for questions from those listening in. I would ask that everybody limit their questions to two questions, if they would, and I'll turn it back to you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Rick Lyall from John W. Bristol. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Nice results. Two questions, first, can you comment at all on where the returns stand in the U.S. versus Europe? The U.S. brands came back very strongly this quarter, so on a year-to-date basis, how do they stack up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, overall, Rick, I mean, we don't give the details by the different brands or the different segments. But as we've said before, the European brands have got better yields and better returns than the North American brands and as a result of the North American brands coming back that gap has closed a little bit. But Europe's still higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. Second question, fuel efficiency looks &#x2013; continues to look strong. How much more room do you have there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we improved another couple of points in the third quarter, and I think as Micky has said before, we're working on hundreds of different items and those things have not been rolled out on all 97 ships. So, there's still opportunities and we do expect 1 to 3% fuel consumption efficiencies per year over the next couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just comment Rick that as the size of new builds &#x2013; new ships that are delivered are larger than the overall size &#x2013; average size of the fleet ships, you will get a natural improved metric from a fuel standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but you have &#x2013; you still have same-store efficiency improvements on the existing fleet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do. And -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We absolutely do. It's a combination of those two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva, from Infinity Research. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Excellent results. Excellent job, obviously across the board. A couple of questions in terms of the outlook. Maybe, Howard you can help me. Looking at Q1 2010 core yields on local currency basis were down about 2%. So, do you expect in 2011 that we'll make up those 2%, but nothing more than that? Or are you just being conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's fair, Assia. I think that's how we see it right now, yes. I mean, I think we are &#x2013; I think without the Caribbean &#x2013; heavy Caribbean capacity, I think we wouldn't have this situation, but I think we're absorbing a lot of Caribbean capacity this winter as all the ships come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing that you do have to keep in mind when you look at the first quarter of 2010 is 2010 did not &#x2013; I'm sorry, 2009, it did not on &#x2013; well, let me rephrase that. On a year-over-year basis, when you take the two years together, '9 and '10, each quarter was down about 7 to 8%. So, we're in a situation where we're looking at multiple year changes, and we don't expect the variances between the quarters in '11 to be as wide as what you saw in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So on a cumulative basis, Q1 2011 is about five points off the pre-downturn levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things we tried to point out in the past is that again, as we build the European presence, the seasonality of the business increases as well. And so first quarter, just by the very nature of the way the business is growing is going to be more challenging making it up in the third.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. All of this is very helpful and is it also fair to say that with increased capacity in the Caribbean, with a more hesitant consumer relative to other upturns meaning that right now we are experiencing a slow recovery, it is more of a challenge for you to forecast Q1 today than it was during previous downturns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think right now, I think we've got pretty good data on Q1. We are well booked in Q1. We still have a ways to go. It's not like the fourth quarter. So, I think we're &#x2013; and we're feeling &#x2013; clearly we're feeling the impact of slower economies both in North America and Europe, and this is the result of it all, but I think if things are stable at these levels I think that's where we think we'll end up for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Whether it's a downturn or not, I think over the course of the last two, three years, despite the wild changes in the economy and the global nature of our business, we've &#x2013; we forecasted yields pretty well. I mean, we haven't missed them by very much, and they've been basically rounding errors over the &#x2013; like I said, over the last couple of years despite the crisis.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and congratulations also. A couple &#x2013; two questions here. Obviously, the industry as a whole, including yourselves appears to be doing better in Europe than some of the land-based tour operators, given some comments in the summer related to those &#x2013; out of some of those. Other than the penetration, are there other reasons that you feel that the industry is doing better, just in Europe relative to those land-based operators?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have &#x2013; I think it's a deeper question than this call really allows. I mean, the whole question of their model and the all-inclusive tour operating model in Europe, I think is under question and clearly, with our low penetration and our value relationship, in effect we're taking share, but we're still a very small share of a very big market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And overall, Micky, just an estimate based on the addressable market, what the industry share is of the broad vacation market, this is a piece, a follow-up to that question</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, country-by-country, it's quite different. I mean, the U.K.'s penetration has &#x2013; is the highest. I think Germany is next, and Italy is after that, but still less than half the penetration in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question would be, Howard, just a little bit of clarification. For the first and second quarters, if I heard you correctly, you said that over the last six weeks the booking trends and pricing that you have seen in both the Caribbean and in Europe have improved significantly. Is that correct, what I heard, based on your preamble?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we experienced during that 13-week period was that from the early spring period of the early spring, May and June, I think bookings were &#x2013; we saw some softness in the booking pattern. Then in July, August and September, we started to see this improvement. So, as we look at the last six weeks, the pattern for the six weeks is much better than the pattern for the overall 13-week period which includes the six weeks. So, I think that's right, yeah. That's what I was trying to say, that there was a period and I think other businesses experienced the same thing, especially in North America where other businesses experienced some softness in the spring and then the consumer confidence perhaps came back and the markets got better and our business picked up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you're seeing more of that relative strength tilted a little bit towards Europe, just given what you're seeing in the Caribbean for primarily the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, we've seen strength on both sides of the Atlantic, both in North America and Europe in the last six weeks.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As you look at the four new ships that you have coming on in 2011, I wonder if you could just give us a little more information about the revenue premiums you expect for those ships and what drives them, as well as the cost savings profile relative to fuel and operating cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it really often depends on the brand, but typically new ships will give us &#x2013; will have a halo, and will get a lot of demand and typically, we will get higher pricing on a new ship versus the ships in the rest of the fleet. I mean, that's always the case. From a cost standpoint, I don't think &#x2013; I mean, most of the ships that are being delivered are part of a series of ships that we've ordered. So, the cost metrics should be similar to those same sized ships that we have in the fleet, of that size.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just in terms of your yield guidance for Q1, if I can just go back and look at the two-year yield change, two years ago, your Q1 yields fell 2%. It was &#x2013; sorry, 5% two years ago. Last year, they were down 2% and Q1 '11, you are saying up 2. So, as Beth said, sort of down 5% from the peak. Is it fair for to us extrapolate that to a full year, and say that in '09, your yields fell 10% and then if you want to get back to that minus 5% sort of peak-trough figure, then given this year you're up 2.5%, that would imply 2011 should be up 2.5% on a full-year basis or is that rather simplified by the fact that Q1 is going to be somewhat weaker than usual given the seasonality you mentioned, Micky?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll ask -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Q1 is &#x2013; Micky indicated earlier, demand, that is probably the one quarter where I think demand is more of a challenge than the other quarters. I don't think you can extrapolate Q1 to the rest of the year, though. I think that demand patterns differ greatly, as they did during this past year, and you can see where yield improved significantly in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Actually in the fourth quarter, they are not all that bad either. So, I don't &#x2013; I think we'll be in a position on the next call to &#x2013; and have a better sense as we go through budget reviews in the next four to six weeks, where we'll have a better sense as to how all the brands see their full 2011 year, but right now, it would be too early to comment on that. But we certainly don't think you can extrapolate the 2%, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the dynamics, I said this before, but one of the dynamics is you've got this huge capacity shift. I mean, one of our competitors basically for the summer season has as much Med capacity as the average of MSC and Costa, which is a European brand and all of that turns right around and comes back to the Caribbean. And so you get this huge uptick in capacity that, as they have built up, and as all the brands have built up more and more and more European capacity, a significant amount of that comes back to the Caribbean in the fall, and it's just very difficult to absorb, and so the first quarter becomes tougher and tougher.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the flip side of that is the better third quarter. So, it just makes the analysis that you said very difficult because I don't know what the total capacity increase is in the Caribbean for the first quarter industry-wide, Beth, do you have that number? But it's a big number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>15%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's up 15% year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>15% capacity increase year-over-year, that &#x2013; but when you compare the first quarter capacity to the third quarter capacity, it's probably 100%, I'm guessing -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. Just the second question is just on the dividend, if we can. I mean, you talked about CapEx being $1 billion lower, certainly on my numbers, you could afford to go back to the $1.60 annual dividend, as soon as next year. Is that premature to think about it in that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jamie, I think as we've said before, the dividend decision is something that we review with the board every quarter and that it's a board decision, and we don't want to preempt the board, and we'll be discussing with them as we go forward, but you're right, as Howard indicated, with CapEx going down and with our cash flow from operations, there should hopefully be over $1 billion of free cash flow next year.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everybody. Just a quick question on the cost side of things. You seemed to come in &#x2013; if you just go a little bit more detail as to why you beat your June guidance by quite so much. I mean, you were looking for 1 to 2% up, excluding oil, and you actually declined 2.4, if you could give us some more granularity on that, that would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, you know, Ian, it's a wide range of items that are included &#x2013; that result in this. There are things that we've been doing and I'll just try to give you some examples. Howard talked about our operating companies around the world, and while we have a global presence and a global sourcing purchasing group, the advantage that we have from the local operating companies is we are well aware of different issues, different products, and so many times we will switch our sourcing so that perhaps the European brands might be sourcing certain products from North America or vice versa, and that allows us to gain significantly better pricing.</p>
          <p>We continue to lever down pricing with the volumes we have by renegotiating deals and capturing savings from there. We've captured savings from reducing specifications. We developed a bridge simulator in Europe, which not only improved the training and reduced training costs of our maritime crew and officers, but also lowered our insurance costs as well. So, those are just a sample of a few items, but there are many others. There's no one particular item that made up the whole difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think suffice it to say, Ian, that our cost guidance that David developed is based on what he gets from the operating companies and to some degree, I &#x2013; we suspect and it's been going on now for a couple of years, they will always err on the conservative side when it comes to costs. They don't want to surprise us with any negative variances. So, there is an element of conservatism usually in the cost outlook.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Great. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about in terms of new ship orders, there's a lot of talk about how the yards are under so much pressure now that ship build pricing can't go much lower. Are you tempted to pick up your ordering activity a little bit to take advantage of prices like this that you might not see again?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Robin, we don't make new building decisions based on sales with the shipyard, it's not like used cars. They're long-term strategic decisions. We look at it brand specifically, and as of right now, we have nothing hot right now. I think we're probably done for '13, and of course, we're always looking, discussing, looking at the future, but there's nothing imminent, despite what is a very aggressive pricing situation right now, other than, of course, the Aida deal that we just recently did.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>So even now wouldn't be early, 2014 is only three and a half years out. I mean, that's kind of &#x2013; three to five years is normal timing for new ships delivery. So, I would say that I don't expect to be doing anything between now and the end of the year, but who knows.

          <p>And based on confidentiality agreements with the yards, and so on, we don't disclose anything beyond that. I would say that our recent all-in costs are probably in the range of 20, 25% lower than they were at the peak for us, which was not the peak of &#x2013; we never constructed at the peak. We rejected at the peak. So, it's 20 to 25% lower than our peak. Does that make sense?</p>

          <p>Thanks. This is Jeff Hans actually on behalf of Greg. I think last quarter you guys had noted that some of your North American luxury brands were seeing a bit of volatility during May. And I just wanted to get a sense of whether the trends at those brands have stabilized over the past few months, or has that volatility been persistent?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the North American premium brands have picked up nicely. Their businesses &#x2013; from the comments that were made back at the last call, so we've been very encouraged by North American brand premium &#x2013; the premium brand bookings, as well as the contemporary brands. I mean, overall, the picture has just improved broadly. I think what &#x2013; I think that their business is largely a function &#x2013; it's less of the economic cycles and more a function of the wealth factor. And I think when they are feeling more comfortable when their psychology for spending money comes back, I mean, they'll go ahead and book their vacations and we see that happening right now.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then could you provide just some color on some of the on board spend categories, what you're seeing there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. As I said, in the quarter, the on board spend was up 1.3%. Essentially, all the categories except for casino and shore excursion were either flat or up. Casino we've talked about a lot, the head winds we have there, because of the proliferation of casinos in North America.</p>
          <p>As far as shore excursions are concerned, we &#x2013; shore excursions in the third quarter were impacted by some charters we had, as well as the fact that we had moved itineraries. So, while we make decisions like we had taken some ships out of Alaska and moved them elsewhere, moved other ships and changed itineraries we make decisions-based off of the total profitability and then there are some items that might suffer as a result. And so we did see some lower shore excursions.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered, but I was wondering &#x2013; you've talked in the past about divesting some of your older ships. I was wondering if you have anything on the horizon for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have sold the Artemis that will be delivered in spring 2011 to a German tour operator. Howard were you going to say something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The secondhand ship market is a bit of a challenge these days, but we do have &#x2013; I mean, if the opportunity comes along for certain of our smaller, older ships, we would certainly consider selling them off. The economies of scale of those ships just don't work, as well as the larger ships. But we don't see anything &#x2013; to be honest with you, we don't see anything imminent right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as you look at increased capacity in the Caribbean, does it make sense to move any of those ships to more of the emerging markets, to kind of deepen the penetration in South America or some of the newer European markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, those itineraries &#x2013; go ahead, Micky.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the problem is when you look at winter deployment, if you move a ship it's really on the margin. I mean, for example, Costa this year is bringing one less ship to the Caribbean than they brought last year. I think Princess is bringing one less ship. So, we can move ships, but the options in the winter are quite limited, especially for the North American brands, and so one &#x2013; yes, we do that, and I believe our 2012 deployment will have a little bit less as a percentage of capacity in the Caribbean, but it's only on the margin that you can really do it.</p>

          <p>On the Caribbean pricing, are you seeing that impact a particular brand more than others or are you just seeing kind of proportionally across all of the brands that you have in the Caribbean in the first quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then separately, David, obviously, you guys have done an excellent job year in year out on the net cruise cost on the elements you can control. I know you typically say that you expect that to grow in line with inflation, but as you look into 2011, do you think there's another opportunity to keep that flat to down, ex-fuel and constant currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I've been saying for a number of years now that we would grow &#x2013; that we would be flat to half of inflation and I've been wrong for the last three years. Micky always reminds me of that. So &#x2013; but it is a little early to talk about 2011. We'll give you some good guidance on that come December.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since inflation last quarter was zero, I think half of inflation is perfectly okay.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. First one for me was just &#x2013; I don't know if Beth has the numbers at hand, but in terms of how the Caribbean capacity shapes for the balance of the quarter into next year, just so we can understand how that looks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have it for our capacity growth in 2011. I do not have it for the industry. And I will give it for the total company, which includes both North America and our European brands. The Caribbean is up 7% in the first quarter, 10% for our North American brands. The second quarter is call is flat, the third quarter is down 8%, and the fourth quarter is down 11%. And as we go throughout the year, the Caribbean is about 50% of our total capacity in the first quarter, stepping down to 36% in the second and 22% in the third and finishing the year at 27% in the fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in essence it's that shape of things that at the moment leave you guys relatively relaxed about this being a specific Q1 issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's fair, yeah. I think &#x2013; I'm not sure I would characterize anything as &#x2013; us as ever being relaxed, but I do think that we feel that this is going to be &#x2013; the first quarter will be the most challenging quarter and assuming demand holds up the way it has and bookings are sustained the way they are coming in right now, we feel pretty good about the rest of the year, yes.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of David Leibowitz from Horizon Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning. Two questions unrelated. First, when the new Panama Canal opens, what changes will that mean for you in terms of itineraries and perhaps shifting capacity outside of the Caribbean when it comes from Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the only thing it adds is a bit of flexibility to our post-Panamax ships. Obviously, if we have post-Panamax ships that become Panamax it gives us a little bit greater flexibility, but I wouldn't say it's a huge indicator. I mean, the only one that really has post-Panamax ships positioned on the West Coast is Princess with a few and Carnival Cruise Lines with one. So, theoretically they can move back and forth. So, on the margin, again, it just gives you some more flexibility, but I wouldn't consider it a huge factor for us, compared to the factor it will be for the cargo industry, which will be quite big.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, normally we talk about progress being made in China. I did not hear anything at all said about the Asian market today. Could you update us?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>I mean, I'll be happy to do that. Pier, would you like to do that or you want me to take the first &#x2013; make the first comment and then you can jump in after?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think generally we offer to take first comment to you, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I think overall, I think we're satisfied with our China program. We had two ships in China this past season, and they did well, albeit not at prices that we would have liked, but the prices were okay. And the results were good and we probably almost doubled, I think, our sourcing of Chinese passengers during 2010.</p>
          <p>For 2011, Costa's taken the decision to &#x2013; at least for this period of 2011, to downsize from two ships to one ship, and with the strategy of trying to get higher prices in 2011, in anticipation of upsizing to a much larger ship in 2012 to get to establish the higher price points in the market. We think it's something that is very achievable.</p>
          <p>We're still very positive about China, and we've taken &#x2013; but it has been in large degree an experiment and we're &#x2013; we continue to move different ships in and out to see what works. The product is extremely well accepted by the Chinese market. There are periods when the Chinese and their families will go on holidays and there are periods when it doesn't. So, it's always a challenge to find out how to utilize &#x2013; how to source business to those ships during periods outside of the period when the Chinese will go on cruises.</p>
          <p>And I think Costa has been very successful in doing that. So, the strategy is to stay in China and to continue to build it, but we'll go &#x2013; we will take a little bit of a blip downward in 2011 and then come back with a larger ship in 2012, with the view that it will then be a profitable business with us, with that larger ship. It will be only a modestly &#x2013; actually, we should get operating profit in 2011, even with the one ship, one smaller ship in 2012, we should get to profitability in China.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we had a &#x2013; look, we had a stronger Alaska on lower capacity. So, clearly taking capacity out gave us the ability to have good yield improvement this summer in Alaska, I think. And with the head tax greatly reduced going into Alaska, 2011, I think we are very encouraged that 2011 will be a good Alaska season. Very early indications from those brands that are operating &#x2013; that operate in Alaska are &#x2013; and it's very early &#x2013; are quite positive. But it's still early to talk about the summer of 2011. But overall, it was a much improved Alaska season with the reduced capacity, but obviously if it continues to strengthen we'll add more capacity over time.</p>

          <p>The Alaska season is just wrapping up now and I think that because of what's happened in recent years and the change in the law, we're going to do a very careful postmortem of the season and try to make sure that the political leaders in Alaska understand how it went and we'll be doing that over the next couple of months and maybe can give you a little bit more the next &#x2013; on the next call when we really have a full understanding of exactly what happened. I think it's very important to have as much transparency as possible with the political leadership in Alaska so they understand what's going on and the impact of the legislative changes they've been making.</p>
