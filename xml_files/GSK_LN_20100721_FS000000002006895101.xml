          <p>Thanks for joining us for this afternoon's Q2 update. I'm not going to say very much at all before Julian comes up just to take you through the numbers and I'll come back and talk a little bit about strategy of where we are as a company. Just a couple of minor kind of updates on the kind of information we're providing you. I'm sure you've already noticed but hopefully you have seen that we've given you an extra level of detail on the emerging markets business in the release, so you can see now down to the profit level what's going on in the emerging markets. We know a lot of you are interested in that and very happy to give you that.</p>
          <p>You also may have noticed that we've been less forthcoming on the consumer breakdown. And we've come to that conclusion because we had identified and we started to pick up a sense that some of our more pure play consumer competitors who don't necessarily go to this level of detail were using our disclosures against us, so were using those as ways of trying to predict what we were doing or not doing, so I just wanted to put into context those couple of points. We're all for transparency but not if it costs us competitiveness. And I think probably you and the shareholders would agree with that, so that's why you're seeing a little bit less on the consumer side, very happy to show you what we're doing on the pharma side and that's what I've done on the emerging markets. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Julian, who will take you through the numbers for Q2.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. Our focus, as I always do, on the results, excluding restructuring costs, and also talk about growth of constant exchange rates, with the exception of cash flow. As you can see, it was a flat turnover quarter compared to the previous year, although at the first half we grew 7%. If you strip out flu pandemic and Relenza, which clearly does distort comparative performance, in the quarter we declined by 2%, in the first half we grew by 1%, and as I progress through the slides I'll cover the factors that drive that. If you look at operating profit, clearly a significant reduction year on year in the quarter. But that's driven by the 1.57 billion legal charge and also by the much lower level of asset sale profits, which is why other operating income is down.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow very robust, 42% up H1 this year versus H1 last year, so continuing good performance there. This chart basically provides you with an analysis of turnover overall. If you look at the U.S., the U.S. is down 13% and that's driven by a number of factors. It's driven by the generic competition Valtrex, clearly the patent went off, we've got generic competition, that accelerated in the second quarter. It's also driven by the timing of vaccine tenders and a faster erosion of the decline of Avandia, so those are the factors &#x2013; some of the factors driving that U.S. decline.</p>
          <p>If you move on and look at emerging markets in Asia-Pacific and Japan, there you see good growth, 17% and 9% respectively. If you look further up the chart you can see consumer healthcare grew by 3%. That's about 1% above the overall market growth and I'll come back to consumer later.</p>
          <p>This chart is very much a chart I've shown you in previous times, it's very consistent. If you look, you see that we're continuing to be adversely impacted by product &#x2013; by basically generic competition. That's primarily Valtrex &#x2013; not only Valtrex, but that's the main driver &#x2013; and Avandia, as I said before, continues to erode overall growth. You can see flu pandemic and Relenza sales doubled and you can see that the core, which is pretty much excluding all of those, grew by 3% in the quarter and by 7% in the first half. And acquisitions net of divestments, in this table the impact's about 90 million, so it has an overall effect of just over 1.5%.</p>
          <p>If you look at the core, what I'm now going to do is look at the various product analysis, and if you look at that there's a whole host of things distorting Advair in the quarter, not least of which was wholesalers stocking patents in the U.S. I'm going to focus my comments on the first half. If you look at first half Advair sales growth, you've got 1% growth in the U.S., which interestingly is pretty much exactly in line with scrips and nicks movement, so that 1% is almost a direct read-across. 5% growth in Europe, 20% growth in emerging markets and 16% growth in the rest of the world, so that's the Advair story.</p>
          <p>If you look at vaccines, again you've got that decline in the second quarter. You've got that small growth in the first half. And again, within our vaccines business sadly you have volatility, I mean, it's just the nature of the business. Tenders &#x2013; government tenders have a big impact on when sales falls as does suppliers' shortages. When supplies go out of stock then you get distortions in the overall market. So the H1 view is a much better view than the quarterly view. Within those overall numbers you have Syncria delivering about &#xA3;83 million worth of sales in the first half, which is a good performance, and you see we continue to deliver good growth with products like Lovaza and Avodart. And finally, within all others at the bottom what's driving that, and that's primarily the benefit from acquisitions net of divestments, not wholly, but simplistically that pretty much explains that.</p>
          <p>Next chart summarizes consumer healthcare. You'll recall that last year in quarter two within Europe we launched alli, and that create, because we launched it in numerous countries in Europe, that created a fairly significant stockpile. In quarter two last year that created a large sales number. The comparative clearly drags us down this year; you can't stock twice. And that impact is about 3% on our total consumer healthcare business and about 7% on both our European healthcare business and our OTC segment, just to give you an indication of the impact.</p>
          <p>Our international business continued to perform strongly across all the category areas. Within the U.S. business, oral care was strong but OTC was weak, and that explains the flat performance there. In our categories, clearly, strong performance from oral care and nutritionals. OTC suffering again primarily because of the alli comparative effect year-on-year.</p>
          <p>This is a chart which we produce regularly. I mean, two things fundamentally driving this reduction our dependence on white tablets. The first is the strategy, the diversification strategy, things like buying Stiefel clearly help enormously. The second is sadly the reflection of patents expiring, which have been expiring on white tablets, and that has been reducing the sales. So those two things taken together is what drives that overall reduction from 31% to 26%.</p>
          <p>This is the chart that shows the first half margins on the second column. On the third column it shows our guidance for the year. You can see cost of sales at 24.7% is about 1.3 below the guidance. Last year 25% cost of goods, the guidance this year 26, so a 1% increase. At the first half we're 0.5% higher so 0.5%, not 1, but too early yet to change that overall guidance so we're sticking with 26% for the full year. SG&amp;A slightly higher than the 29%. I expect SG&amp;A costs to come down in the second half and for the 29% to be delivered. And R&amp;D, a very common picture, we're often when we see an increase in spend in the second half compared to the first half. So I'm still expecting around about 14% for the full year.</p>
          <p>So those, at this point in time the guidance remains. This chart explains SG&amp;A. The story continues to be the same. We continue to basically save money in the developed markets, so we've made significant reductions to our U.S. head count, we continue to make reductions in R&amp;D; for example, the Verona site was closed in the second quarter and a number of other sites which we've announced. So, again, streamlining, reducing those sites but at the same time reinvesting those in developing markets, in markets that we want to grow. We clearly had a call. We could have saved the money, let it drop through. We believe the right answer was to put that money back and grow the top line. That was our strategy, stays our strategy, I think it's the right strategy.</p>
          <p>You can see the effect of Stiefel, you can see exchange gains and losses. Last year you may recall that we had about 106 million of exchange losses. This year we have  about 24 of gains, they live in the SG&amp;A line, they do distort it, I do pull it out for you for that reason, but clearly you can see the benefit this time. And other reflects a whole host of things, but including clearly the benefit from flu pandemic sales creating a higher denominator.</p>
          <p>This was a quarter which was distorted, so all I've done in this chart is strip out for you the impact of legal, the impact of other operating income. So what you can see, it's those two factors that take the decline in operating profit at 80%, and if you go back to the trading profit before legal level you can see a decline of 5. Not necessary most quarters, I think it is quite helpful to you this quarter.</p>
          <p>And this chart tracks you down from operating profit to EPS. If you look at that box on the &#x2013; this rectangular box, bottom left-hand corner, you can see that the EPS before legal was at 29.3p. You can see the impact of the legal charge, you can see the reported EPS at 2.6p. I think the tax is complicated. It's almost impossible to stand here and explain a 63% tax rate. It is, whether you like it or not, a mathematical equation, 25% on your profits, only 14% tax relief on a very significant legal charge. Mathematically it brings down the profit hugely and gives you that sort of 63% charge. I think more helpfully to you the guidance for the year now is about 30.5% for the tax rate for the full year. And that tax rate reflects some benefit off the 28% I gave you as my guidance for the year, but clearly the adverse impact of much higher &#x2013; much, much higher legal charges than we ever anticipated but at that lower tax relief rate. So it's a combination of those two. Net-net-net, I expect 30.5% to be the corporation tax rate for GSK for this full year.</p>
          <p>Exchange, we've benefited by 7% at the quarter, 4% at the half year. Much like you, every time I look at my results I use that simple formula I gave and it really frustrates me when my simple formula doesn't work because I find it's a great guide to make sure we've got the right number. What you see there are all the factors driving the overall exchange position. Interestingly, Australia and Canada seem to feature for the first and probably the last time in this sort of analysis. But we had very significant movements on those currencies this year compared to last year, plus, too, the denominator was slightly lower. Those two things together make them basically give quite a significant impact.</p>
          <p>But anyway, that's there for your information. I think the simple guide we give you on dollar-euro-yen works most of the time, sometimes it doesn't, this is such a time. This is the results before restructuring. The left-hand column, results excluding restructuring. The restructuring in the middle, the 590 million, a significant proportion of that 590 million is the R&amp;D closures and it's the U.S. rationalization. There are other things in there, other rationalizations elsewhere, but those are the two key prime drivers. If you look at where we are to date, we spend about 3.2 billion out of the 4.8 that we announced, and the 4.8 is the 4.5 billion of restructuring, 300 million relating to acquisitions, 1.2 to go. I like &#x2013; 1.6, sorry &#x2013; 1.6  to go, and I expect that to be phased really evenly between the rest of this year and 2011 with maybe a very small amount in 2012. And overall you can see the results net of restructuring.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, the legal charges did not impact cash flow, I mean, they wouldn't do, and they &#x2013; we took the charge in the quarter, the payment of those legal charges will happen in subsequent quarters. If you look at the cash flow there you see the impact of those legal charges in the total operating profit line. That's what brings that operating profit down. If you look four lines down you see the elimination of that noncash impact in increase and other net liabilities. If you take the two together, you get the sense which is that legal charge hasn't had an impact yet. It will do in ensuing quarters. We now have &#xA3;3.5 billion of balance sheet provisions for legal claims that we duly expect to settle at some point in the future. So in ensuing quarters you will see cash outflows as those basic settlements are finally signed as we make the payments related to them. So that will happen.</p>
          <p>Bottom line, very strong free cash flow performance supported by good working capital performance, so a significant increase, 40% up on the previous year. The next slide shows what do we do with it, we spent just over half of it on dividends to our shareholders, we spent 10% of it on acquisitions and the balance went to reduce overall net debt, which finished the period at 8.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, underlying growth for the six months was 1%. We've made significant progress in settling historic cases, historic legal cases. The way I look at it as a shareholder, although it's a significant charge to do so and much higher than I ever expected, nonetheless it takes a huge amount of risk, which is very hard to quantify, out of this business. I think that's a very positive sign for the company, puts a lot of it behind us, not all, but a lot of it behind us. Free cash flow continues to be strong. It enables this business not just to pay a very good dividend but also to invest behind the future growth. And the Q2 dividend up 7% to 15p reflects that strong free cash flow performance. So thank you very much, I'll pass it over to Andrew.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Julian. So I think you get a sense of the numbers. What I thought I would do is just reflect a little bit on where we are from a strategic point of view and just bring out some of the changing shapes of the business that we're moving forward on. It's just about two years since I stood up for the first time and talked to you about the strategy of the company and I think it's a reasonable moment just to reflect on how that's really played out. In many regards, everything we anticipated about this sector has played out very much as we thought it would, so increasing pricing pressure, increasing generitization, more demand for differentiated products, all of those pressures that we anticipated have really come through and I think in many regards we feel probably more confident around the strategy that we're deploying at the company now than we even did two years ago. There's been absolutely nothing happened in the last two years which has kind of been a surprise from the direction of travel that we anticipated the environment would go in.</p>
          <p>Of course, some things go more quickly than you expect, so nobody really predicted deficit reduction programs in Europe and therefore not necessarily a new wave of pressure on European pricing. Those are degrees of movement rather than directional shifts. In terms of our strategy, obviously hopefully you have all got this as engrained as I have in terms of the three things we're focused on as a business. We truly believe that getting to a sustainable sales growth is the key value driver for the business. The best way for us to do that is to ensure that our core pharma business really gets where it needs to be, which is to provide differentiated medicines efficiently to the marketplace, get those priced properly to get good penetration into the market. We see the need to surround that with a diversified group of companies and then we want to take cost out of the business as we simplify our organization.</p>
          <p>So if I think about the way I think about this business is really a little bit along the following lines. We're doing a huge amount, I'm going to show you a little bit of progress in terms of what we can do to improve our core pharmaceutical business and that speaks to everything to do with the core. We need R&amp;D to be more effective and more efficient. We need manufacturing to be more efficient and we need the commercial model to be more efficient. All of those things have been focus areas for the last couple of years and remain focus areas for us in terms of how we drive greater effectiveness and efficiency in our core pharma business.</p>
          <p>But that core pharma business remains potentially a hugely exciting part of our organization. If you think about where the optionality is on big upside, it's in pharma. When you strike it right, there's a great return. The problem is as an industry we haven't been striking it right properly and the hurdle for the definition of right has gone up, so what would have achieved great returns 10 or 15 years ago, even if they could be discovered today, may not achieve the same returns. Hurdles have gone up, but if you can jump those hurdles the potential upside optionality on success in pharma remains one of the great opportunities that we should strive to achieve. That's why we see that as the core of the company.</p>
          <p>Now the focus of the company then is how do we improve our probability of that option upside in terms of the way in which we do R&amp;D, where we look, our focus and discipline about driving for differentiation, how we can make that efficient through reducing costs of R&amp;D, how we can then develop those products effectively through the manufacturing network and take out redundant capacity and cost in manufacturing and then, of course, how do you commercialize what is likely to be a different shape portfolio. You've heard me talk many times that we don't want to be dependent on the belief that we can invent a blockbuster when there's no certainty whether we can or we can't or when it might happen.</p>
          <p>The consequence of that is you must accept you're going to have a broader portfolio. The consequence of that is you need a different commercial model which has to be much more customized, much more fit for purpose and ultimately much more efficient. That's the focus of the work going on inside the core. Around the core, you know that we've been investing in these businesses, these other businesses, whether they're geographic by nature, and this is always a slightly tricky thing to talk about because, of course, there's overlaps between geography and product groups or business groups.  But what you see going on in this ring of businesses, these are the businesses which we believe we've got a basis of competitiveness, we think we can win in these marketplaces, and we've been allocating capital aggressively over the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>So the two big driving philosophies or disciplines around this structure of the company are to make sure that we are rational in how we allocate capital and fundamentally in the core get R&amp;D to be more efficient and effective. And that's essentially what we're striving to build over the last couple of years. If you look at what that looks like now in terms of quantum, what you see on this slide is a couple of different ways of looking at the data. So if you look at the four businesses at the bottom &#x2013;  dermatology, respiratory, consumer, vaccines &#x2013; those are four of the business groups, the vertical business groups where we've been allocating capital either through acquisition or through organic investment. And what you see there, they now account for 57% of the turnover of the company.</p>
          <p>So there you've got businesses which all have very distinctly different profiles for the classic traditional pharma market. They're all businesses where we believe we have significant degrees of competitiveness and we believe that that network of businesses have very different risk profiles to the classic core pharma business. The 29% of the cross simply looks at it a different way. Okay, let's think about geographic diversification. What you see there is 29% of the business is in our emerging markets &#x2013; Eastern European, Japanese or Asia Pac business areas, i.e., not Western Europe, not North America. And so you see on both dimensions that we continue to allocate resources to push those &#x2013; the opportunities up in these other areas while maintaining the option for a significant upside in pharma, right? It's an important thing over the medium term that I get across.</p>
          <p>Now, I just want to pull out one thing on dermatology. So we bought Stiefel last year and I think it's always quite good to be held to account. I'm going to talk a little bit more about some other deals in a few minutes. Stiefel was a relatively big transaction for us. In the first half our prescription dermatology business did about &#xA3;530 million of sales, we did about another 150 or so in the consumer dermatology business. As you know, we're committed to opening up dermatology as a fourth platform of our consumer business, that's under way as we speak, but nonetheless about 530 million of sales in the first half in the derm piece, in the Rx derm piece and about 100 or so &#x2013; 150 or so in the Cx piece.</p>
          <p>That business, as you can see, grown 5% and, for your information, it's running at an operating margin inclusive of amortization of around 42, 43%, so good operating margin and we're running about 10% ahead of our synergy targets for the acquisition of Stiefel. I think I just want to give you a sense that when we made these acquisitions we're very serious about making sure we drive value out of them when they get brought into the company. We think that's the right strategic investment for us to make, it's opening up opportunities for us both in terms of our western market, a diversified type of product line, it's opening up new opportunities in our emerging markets, it's allowing us to take new products to Japan and it's also allowing us to open up a fuller platform of consumer. That's why we bought Stiefel and I think you're seeing some real progress in terms of its performance.</p>
          <p>Now I thought it's also worth just talking a little bit about what's going on than in the more &#x2013; other areas of the core pharma model. And I wanted to cover off just a few things particularly maybe with reference to the U.S. because the U.S. is probably our biggest challenging marketplace over the last couple of years. We've seen tremendous impact from generitization and it's important that we get our U.S. business fit for the future. You've heard me talk about that before. I think we're in a phase now where the emergence of what the new U.S. business is going to look like is beginning to become apparent, and it's beginning to become apparent on a number of dimensions.</p>
          <p>First of all, it's smaller than it used to be. So in the last two years we've taken about 25% of the sales force out. We now have a sales force of around 5500 people in the U.S. If you went back four or five years, even bigger reduction obviously, but in the last couple of years significant further reduction in sales force. So size is small. We spend about a third less today than we did two years ago on DTC advertising, as an example. And within our overall advertising environment, we spend relatively less now than we did before on TV, we spend more than we did before on digital. So a lot of changes going on in terms of those classic dimensions of mix.</p>
          <p>If you look within our sales forces in the U.S., we no longer have the big duplicated primary care sales force. We now have a structure where each representative has sole accountability for their customer relationship and, in fact, we have very few big primary care sales forces. What we've moved toward is a much greater portfolio of specialized sales forces, I think sales forces which are much more emphasized with specific customer groups or specific product groups.</p>
          <p>What's then critical is are we staying in step with where the customers are going. And the U.S. customer base is changing very dramatically and healthcare reform is simply putting more and more pressure behind this change phenomenon. One of the biggest dynamics of that is the aggregation of customers. So you're seeing customers brought together into integrated decision-making environments, one way or the other. Tremendous number of physicians selling out their practices to hospitals. They still trade as physicians but they're essentially buying protection from the hospital in the environment of the payer world that they live in. They no longer want to compete on their own.</p>
          <p>That requires a big change. I'll give you an example. University of Virginia in the U.S., 18 months ago we had 50 representatives calling on the U.S. at the University of Virginia medical system, so 50 representatives every day going into that institution to promote our products. Today we have one who then can act as essentially an air traffic control system to bring in up to five more. So we've gone from 50 to one with an option of five specialist supports to come in and help work that practice &#x2013; that institution. That's the kind of change that you need to start to see.</p>
          <p>Now it's very analogous to the leading edge of the European marketplace. So if you look at the leading edge of the U.K. market, it looks very similar to where the leading edge of the U.S. market is moving in terms of customers.</p>
          <p>Now, some of this is voluntary. Some of this, the customers are demanding this kind of response. So if we go to somewhere like the Maryland Medical System, three or four months ago the Maryland Medical System sent a letter to all vendors, whether you sold drugs, latex gloves, Coke, anything that you sold into that medical system, all vendors received the same letter and that letter basically said we expect you as the vendor to have only one point of contact with this institution. We will no longer accept multiple people selling your products into our organization. Of all the vendors who they wrote to, only one company of all vendors was able to respond in a way which was acceptable to that institutions and that was GSK, and that's because GSK's been working on how to develop this kind of approach and when the customers demanded it we were able to step up and actually continue the relationship with that institution.</p>
          <p>Those are the sorts of things you have to start to manage in the U.S. marketplace. It's similar if you move, for example, into a vaccine environment where the vaccine physicians are again becoming consolidated and, again, becoming extremely demanding of how they are serviced. So one of the major areas we've been innovating on over the last 18 months is to create a capability to help the physicians navigate the reimbursement complexities of the vaccine marketplace in the U.S. Just one example of how you can add real value to these customers.</p>
          <p>So what we're seeing in the U.S. is big changes in scale, much greater degrees of focused accountability in our organization; we believe that's going to drive much better performances. But then much more alignment with where the customer groups are going, and the customer groups are aggregating, they're becoming more demanding and we need to make sure we address that. And that's exactly the kind of shape you're starting to see in the U,S. What you will see in the future is a greater and greater demand for comparative effectiveness and that speaks to making sure that trials and new medicines which are being developed are being developed with that question in mind. Many of you are very familiar with NICE in the U.K. We'll see what the U.S. institution &#x2013; institutional response to this question is ultimately going to be. No question at all people are going to want to know what the comparative effectiveness performance of drugs are. It's therefore important that you build those into your trial plans; exactly what we're doing.</p>
          <p>Pricing, across the world, more difficult in the U.S. because of the various overlaying pieces of legislation which restrict pricing freedom, but outside of the U.S. in particular we're seeing more and more engagement around flexible pricing, contingent pricing, payment for performance in terms of the medicines. That is a trend you're going to see I think more of in the future. Probably applied to the more controversial drugs rather than all drugs, but nonetheless you're going to see a continued activity around that type of thing. I think we will start to see some of this in the U.S. a little more, but things like Medicaid Best Price are big inhibitors on innovation of pricing in the U.S. and so it may take a little bit longer to come along.</p>
          <p>So a lot of change going on in the business and I think particularly for the U.S. we're at the point where the period of very intense change, and you can only imagine how much change happens when you see the degree of product portfolio rotation I'm about to show you combined with the degree of business model change I've just described, it's been a tremendous period of transformation in the U.S. over the last couple of years. That's now beginning to emerge and I think we'll start to see the benefits of that play through over the next couple of years, both in terms of portfolio and skill set capability in the U.S.</p>
          <p>To wrap all of that up a little bit, I just thought I'd show you where we're moving resources in the business because this gives you a real sense, and Julian made I think a very important point, we could have simply taken costs out and delivered it to the bottom line. We didn't. We made the decision that we should reduce costs in our developed markets and in areas of the business where we believe we could drive greater efficiencies, and just for the sake of today I've called these investment divisions and efficiency divisions. What you can see here is what we've been doing in terms of head count and in terms of our overall SG&amp;A in terms of reallocating resources through the company.</p>
          <p>So you can see that in the emerging markets very significant increase in head count, just around 10,000, and then in terms of taking heads out of our more established or the support organizations of the business, around 13,700 heads coming out. You can also see a big shift in SG&amp;A allocation to the investment markets compared to those which we believe we can extract resources from. That's been the reallocation of resources and capital that we've been following.</p>
          <p>There is obviously more to come on this. So the R&amp;D centers we've announced that we would close. We've closed Verona, we haven't yet closed Harlow; that will happen in the second half. Tunbridge will happen in the second half, Zagreb will happen in the second half. So you will see continued reductions in activity in R&amp;D as we go forward in the rest of this year and you'll also see continued reductions in manufacturing as we continue to tighten up our manufacturing network across the world.</p>
          <p>That gives you, I think, a good sense of the scale of shift just in a two-year period. Now I also thought you might be interested, because we've also been spending quite a bit on acquisitions, certainly compared to our historic trend. As you know, up until 2008 there wasn't really all that much activity in this field. We've done a lot more. This is lifted directly from a board paper that was reviewed by the GSK board last month and essentially what it is is a summary of an audit we've undertaken of all of the transactions which the company engaged in over a period between '06 and '09. I think there were 55 projects altogether covered by this. On the left you can see where the value was so you can see that most of the value was obviously in acquisitions in JVs. Clearly Stiefel would be the biggest part of that. And then you see CapEx, R&amp;D and licensing, so these would be the externalization of R&amp;D. And then at the top the very late stage marketed product licensing deals, they're pretty unusual and don't account for very much.</p>
          <p>On the right is the assessment of whether these deals performed. Now not surprisingly, because this was up &#x2013; the analysis was done up to everything including anything we transacted the day before, a proportion of these were a little bit early to be definitive about. Nonetheless, what you can see is that the vast majority, over 95%, were on track. Now, what does on track mean? It means it's meeting or exceeding our financial metrics. So that means that when we go back, we look at all of these transactions, it means we're meeting or exceeding them. What are our financial metrics? Well, the most challenging of course is return on invested capital. For the western-type businesses we look for about 8%. If you were buying a business in Pakistan we're looking for 20%. On all of our CapEx, all of our acquisitions &#x2013; sorry, all of our other acquisitions, if you look at internal rate of return, we're looking to be around 14%. And so pretty decent targets.</p>
          <p>And you can see that overall good performance. In terms of those which are underdelivering or terminated, they're all R&amp;D early stage partnerships. So the &#x2013; so which is not that surprising. So the areas where we have failures is where we've gone into a technology or a licensing partnership with an R&amp;D company and it just doesn't work out. Even then you can see it's a relatively small number. So that gives you a sense of where we're allocating our acquisition capital.</p>
          <p>If I go to R&amp;D, just to give you a little bit of a feel for the metrics of R&amp;D. A lot of change. And the key here is how do we make &#x2013; there's a very tricky operational needle to thread here. There's a world of difference between making a business lean and mean or thin and miserable. And that is kind of the balance. If it's all about cuts you end up with nothing at the end. You just create a downward cycle. And in a &#x2013; particularly in a field like R&amp;D where creativity is an important dimension, you do not want to fall into that trap. So getting through reduction in scale and driving efficiency while somehow maintaining creativity and productivity is a very tricky needle to thread. I think that's working. And I really believe over the last couple of years we've made real traction on this. So, again, you can see here just a few headline numbers, big reduction in head count. Big reduction in amount of space consumed, so labs, platforms, infrastructure. So meter squared is a good metric for infrastructure. So the more meter squared we can take out, the more fixed costs we're taking out of the business, the more you'll variablize your R&amp;D budget. That number probably will be 20% by the end of the year by the time the residual sites I talked about get taken out.</p>
          <p>You can see the big reduction in our complexity. So 30 CROs down to just a couple. It's a good example of how you can just drive complexity out of your organization. Of course that has a big benefit. We said we'd deliver a biopharm pipeline. Now a huge increase in activity in biopharm. More importantly 20% -- 19% of our clinical pipeline is now for biopharmaceuticals. So biopharm, as we said two years ago, we'd get from a standing start to something serious. We now have that. We have 20% of the programs are in biopharms, we have two approvals and we have five Phase III aspects in biopharm.</p>
          <p>And we've also shifted resources to the late-stage. So we spend less relatively early. I know there's this huge debate about externalization of R&amp;D. We're externalizing much more at the early phase, so we want to be very open, very diverse, very -- very accessible to invention early. And then we're really focused on deploying our resources at the late-stage. We're spending relatively less than we used to on believing that we are going to invent everything. We want to be open and then opportunistic to drive forward those opportunities. That's why you see such a lot of resources in the late-stage. It also reflects the fact that the late-stage pipeline is of course big and has stayed big over the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>If you look, then, at how we spend overall R&amp;D, so those numbers I just gave you were for pharma R&amp;D, which is clearly the piece we started with and we needed to work on. If you look at how we've allocated resources then you can see that pharma R&amp;D is receiving less of the pie of total investment in GSK than it ever has. And what we've done is increase the amount that we're spending in the other areas of the business. So we're increasing the amount significantly in vaccine R&amp;D, you can see we've increased the amount in consumer, we've created the biopharma R&amp;D, and pharma as a proportion has started to shrink. And, again, what you're seeing is R&amp;D at GSK is a world of difference from where it was two years ago. The pharma piece is smaller, it's more straightforward, it's got huge emphasis on trying to be open and creative and innovative at the front end. It's got much more accountability in it. And then it's got a focus on delivering the advanced platform of the back with enough resources to bring those products through with differentiated claims. That's pharma.</p>
          <p>The consequence of that being a smaller number has freed up resources for us to significantly open up our consumer vaccine and other research areas. And in fact just this week we decided to increase again our dermatology research activities, as we see further opportunities coming in from Stiefel which were not being funded by the previous owners.</p>
          <p>So it's that kind of reallocation of R&amp;D budget which is a real opportunity for us. Now, to the point of is it lean and mean or is it just thin and miserable, I think the evidence is that it's lean and mean. So when you go into this organization, of course we've been through a period of change, but if you go into this organization now and you talk to the teams, you get a real sense of energy. And I know some of you have spent some time visiting various of our facilities, any of you are welcome any time to come and visit with any of our discovery units or any of the MDL teams to get a feel for yourself about what it feels like inside GSK R&amp;D. But it has dramatically changed. This is a different type of R&amp;D organization. And it's delivering. We've got five assets here going into Phase III, it's a long time since we've put five into Phase III in one quarter.</p>
          <p>You can see here we've got two melanoma molecules. As many of you know, melanoma is one of the most intractable tumor types. It turns out melanoma drugs are just like London buses -- you don't get one forever and then two show up in one quarter. And you can see, whether it's Prosensa, the muscular Duchenne medicine, Zoster vaccine or the Integrase, some interesting and potentially very differentiating medicines coming through. This continues to hold the pipeline around that 30 Phase III assets, which means again, as we've taken medicines out into approval, we're able to replenish that pipeline going forward and, if anything, I would argue that the quality of the medicines going into this pipeline are ratcheting up all the time.</p>
          <p>So when I look at how many first-in-classes we have, how many points of key differentiation we have, every time we review the pipeline it looks better and better. And that's because that's what we're tasking R&amp;D to deliver and we're terminating the drugs which we believe we can't deliver a differentiated profile. The only way we get the upside optionality on the core is to have differentiated medicines like this coming through.</p>
          <p>Now I just wanted to touch a little bit, then, on, as I wrap up, just some of the other change in the business. This is on the less-positive side, this is where we spent the last few years saying goodbye to a whole bunch of products. This is just U.S. sales, &#xA3;4.2 billion in 2006 driven by this portfolio of products. Of course if we'd gone back a few years, you could have added Augmentin to this, and you all know we've had a sustained period of generitization in the U.S. Of those 4.2 billion, we lost most. It's down to 800 million this year in the first &#x2013; sorry, for -2009. These numbers exclude Avandia and Valtrex, and so that immediately gives you that sense of how much the U.S. has been affected, right. And that's why we've made so much effort to change.</p>
          <p>What we've also done in the U.S. is launched all of these products, all right. You've 17 or 18 new products being launched. We all know that none of these are individually going to solve all the problems, but the reality is that gradually as they build up they all contribute to creating a much more diversified growth platform in pharma. This headwind on the left is clearly being now replaced by a growing tailwind. It's growing because we're adding more and more products every year to the right, and as they go through their early phases they're beginning to pick up momentum. And you can see in the quarter, again, particularly if you adjust for Rotarix, which obviously is a very unusual kind of one-off period for the quarter, we saw those new products launched in the last three years grow by another 23%. This is a substantial block of business, around &#xA3;343 million of business growing 23% in the quarter, all driven by all of these different individual products.</p>
          <p>It's fascinating as well to look at the performance of some of these drugs in the U.S., which we would all say are more specialty than mass market compared to those products which from other companies were intended to be blockbuster, rescue-the-company products. Because what's going on in the U.S. market is all of the new products are going through much slower offtakes as the effect of regulatory conservatism, post-market surveillance and payer pressure begins to bite in the U.S. So all products are in a sense seeing slower takeoff curves than we've seen in the past. I mean if you look year-on-year you see that phenomena. The curves are being suppressed for each generation, one after the other.</p>
          <p>So in reality, the performance of a lot of these drugs is holding its own very well against products which many other companies have been anticipated to do much, much better relative to their total. This is a big change. And it's, I think, the sign of an end of an era in the company. As we work our way through the final vestiges of the portfolio that built the company, you're going to see the effect of these products flow through. The point of the model is to keep feeding that as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Now during that period, and if I call out -- you know, let's just describe what I've just discussed as the patent cliff as GSK coming to an end, during that period this shows you what the performance of the company was. So this is the -- this is basically the numbers are the CER and the bars are the absolute reported numbers, so you can see the effect of currency jumping up and down from time to time. But during the period when we've lost all of that product to generics, you can see that we've been able to, on the whole, even at CER grow our turnover, certainly in currency grow our turnover. At EPS you can see we've grown our EPS. You can see the free cash flow generation, you can see the growing dividend, and then you can see the very significant increase in return to shareholders that we've been pushing forward as a company over that period.</p>
          <p>And that's been in the period when we've been losing &#xA3;4.2 billion of U.S. sales, probably an average gross margin of 85, 87% and Avandia and Valtrex, and that is what we're going to have to deliver. If we can do that during the headwinds, you can see why we're confident about the future in terms of what we can do as the tailwinds start to dominate.</p>
          <p>So as a business, you can see the structure of what we've been building over the last couple of years. I hope what you can see from what I've just described is some pretty clear evidence of the traction we've been able to get around this strategy in the company and pretty clear evidence that the two big philosophical commitments we made, which was to really fix R&amp;D and to really be disciplined about how we allocate capital to drive growth, are driving the decisions we're making in this company. And as a consequence, what you end up with is a business which has those sorts of characteristics. That's what we're doing at GSK. I think after two years, as I said at the beginning, we feel the strategy is absolutely appropriate for the environment we're in. I'm delighted we started doing the things we did when we did because I think it puts us in a relatively better and more confident position for the next period in this industry's change.</p>
          <p>There's no question this industry's going through a massive, massive transformation. It's only just begun for many companies. I think where we feel is that GSK has put many of the building blocks in place to be very well positioned even through a pretty tough period this industry will face in the next 10 years. With that, I'm going to stop and open it up to questions, ask Julian to come back and join me on the stage.</p>
          <p>So can I ask for a first question? Yes, please. There's a mic just coming up. We can probably hear you, though.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" />. Just a couple of quick financial questions, please. The first one on cost of goods, your press release said that there were factors specific to the quarter, and I was just wondering if you could run those by us and also quantify the impact roughly on &#x2013; in terms of BPs on the cost line? And then finally also on taxes, just wanted to clarify your best guess for the run rate of an underlying tax rate, so in a quarter, a year when you don't have any significant legal charges, would that still be around, the 28% level, or is there a reason to believe that's coming down, because even the underlying tax rate was quite low in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of cost of goods, the one-offs are very much around the inventory provisions we make and then sometimes release because product then becomes more probable a success, so we invariably have these pluses and minuses in the cost of goods area which distort comparisons from one quarter to the next. Overall in the year I don't think they're going to be material. In terms of tax, I think 28, you'll always have one-offs and maybe favorable, maybe adverse, but putting those to one side I think in a sort of normalized year 28% is still a good rate. I think the 13.5% for this year is simply a reflection of that big legal charge.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. There's a chap in the back, yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, it's Mark Purcell from Barclays Capital. A few questions. Firstly, we've estimated that the U.S., and as they stand European reforms, will impact GSK earnings in 2011 by about 6 and 2%, respectively. Is this inline broadly with your view? Secondly, which GSK products are most exposed to CMS and European government reimbursement audits? Thirdly, on the 572, the integrase inhibitor, are you planning to do head-to-head trials versus acentris? Four, from the MAC and the BRAF inhibitors, are you going after just patients with mutations in this disease or are you going after a broader population with a combination approach? You have a unique opportunity there. I'm just wondering whether you're going to take advantage of that in melanoma as well as other tumors. And then lastly, the market's focused on negative surprises for some time now, so for a company of GSK's scale, before you get into 2011-12 and the pipeline, the use flow which could deliver the three core options you discussed, where could the positive surprises come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OK, thanks for that. I didn't write all those down so we might have to come back to a few of them. In terms of pricing, my expectations, the European pricing &#x2013; you know, I still think it's a bit early to say at the moment whether or not European price impact over the next 18 months is going to be much different to what we normally see of about 3%. I don't &#x2013; if we see a lot more governments start to act then maybe &#x2013; then, yes, it's going to be more than 3. I don't currently expect that, actually. So we're seeing countries like France and the U.K. actually not particularly vibrate on this issue, so I think the European number probably is somewhere in that 2-3% territory, at least today. We'll see what happens.</p>
          <p>U.S. is probably in the 5-ish territory. But what we've made clear is &#x2013; I view pricing as you have to deal with it. And in terms of how we perform, we have to &#x2013; we have to find ways to offset that within the business, which is why when healthcare reform was passed we didn't come out and make a big deal about, oh, here's a big adjustment to what you should be thinking about GSK. I think we have to recognize that the negative price pressure is likely to be the order of the day for a while and therefore we need to be figuring out ways to deal with it.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to get into the Phase III designs of the drugs for all sorts of good reasons. I think today was simply announcing that we've made the decisions to move them forward. The detail of both designs, as you may expect, are &#x2013; continue to be finalized in terms of exactly what we do and we'll talk about those as we get there. So that probably knocks three or four of the questions. There was two more? What were the other two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One was positive surprises before the pipeline delivers. And the other one was if there are any GSK products that are particularly exposed to CMS and European government reimbursement audits.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Things like national coverage assessment with a situation like Provenge in the United States, Germany are looking at all in-marketed products starting in 2011 to potentially change reimbursement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't see any particular exposures on that kind of thing, so no. In terms of positive surprises, first of all I don't &#x2013; I don't really &#x2013; I don't view them as surprises but I think we're going to deliver sustainable strong growth in those group of diversified companies, so I think that's very positive. And I do think &#x2013; I think one of the things I'd ask you to start to think about is as the balance of this business evolves, this is as much about can we keep consumer going at 6 and 7 as it is having one new big drug pop out of pharma, right. The language subtly changes. Absolutely, pharma remains an upside option, but actually what makes or breaks this company is does consumer stay at 6 and 7, does vaccines stay in teens, does emerging markets stay in the teens. Those are going to be the big underpinnings of performance, and then there's going to be the upside option of, if the Syncria data is great, boom. If darapladib is great, double boom. I mean you've got some real opportunities there.</p>
          <p>And that's &#x2013; I think that's the way I would ask you to think about the company going forward. I think increasingly, and I know it's a bit frustrating from a model perspective, but increasingly we're not going to be a company where you can necessarily be looking for single molecular catalysts, because actually if you look at the strategy, the strategy is we expect to bring portfolios of products forward and we expect to do that within a portfolio of businesses. So kind of by definition you're going to be -- we're going to be a little less the big catalyst. Okay, thanks for the question. Andrew? I've got paper now so you can ask a 14-part question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's just two. So Andrew Baum, Morgan Stanley. A couple of questions. Could you just talk us through the decision to settle not just Avandia but also Paxil and Locentra? And I'm sure partly it's timing but partly there seems to be a change in strategic intent, and obviously Dan Troy came on board recently and had the pleasure of working with BP. But could you just outline why you made the decision and how it impacts your business both from reputational but also your balance sheet and what it facilities you doing? And obviously I'm thinking about leverage and where that leverage may be applied, so that's one question. And my second question is, next generation flu you highlighted has had some issues. You're running an an app control, if I remember properly, it wasn't just an <mark type="inaudible" /> trial. Could you just provide a little bit more clarity and how you're going to resolve this and why you're going to continue to allocate capital to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so in terms of the legal decision, so really from when I took over and then when I hired Dan, I've always had the view that some of these things we could try &#x2013; we should try and move forward. Some of this stuff's been around for 10 years, not all but some. And so for a while we've been of the view that we ought to try and get resolution of these cases. And then there's been other things which have come up and, of course, they offer the opportunity. One of the things which we need &#x2013; you all I'm sure recognize is that when you look at any kind of legal exposure you have a real range of potential outcomes. You can win or you can lose very badly or you can end up somewhere in the middle. And so what you have to do is really assess, you know, from a strictly kind of investor perspective, really got to assess where do you think the reasonable outcome would be given the portfolio of possible outcomes that could occur, particularly when you think about the U.S. environment where jury-based trials aren't the easiest environments for big companies to get complicated messages understood or necessarily supported. So that's the context in which you work.</p>
          <p>Both Dan and I had the strong view that we could get to eventually some kind of settlement on these sorts of cases and we've been working that way. Now, as you've seen, and I know it's frustrating to you and I wish we could do it a different way, we just can't, as you've seen, though, there's an acceleration in legal provisioning over the last couple of quarters into what then became this final kind of big, big kind of provision that you saw. And that really reflected the beginnings of our successes to start getting visibility on an end game, and what we decided to do and I suppose was a strategic decision, we said, look, if we can do it in one class let's go everywhere, let's really try and move this as an overhang away from the company. So really that was the strategy.</p>
          <p>It ramped up over the last 12 months. And then it really, you know, I suppose by chance as much as anything else, a whole series of different issues all started to move towards finality in the last three months, which is why we got clarity in this quarter about what it would really take to get these big things resolved. And as a consequence we got the vast majority of what has been overhanging the company &#x2013; not necessarily in terms of volume, because we have lots of cases, but in terms of potential financial liability to the company, the vast majority we've dealt with. Now, we still have the Colorado sales and marketing investigation. We've been very clear that one has still sat there and we're working through how to deal with that. But excluding that, all of the big ones that we're aware of that we were really concerned about we've really brought into the end game through this process. And Julian and I were looking at it the other day, I think if you look at all of the legal provisioning the company has made over the last --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Four-and-a-half years, about two-thirds of it all is associated with these cases. So this portfolio has been what's driven two-thirds of our whole legal agenda for the company. So our view was, if we can find what we think is a reasonable &#x2013; and of course, with the numbers we're talking about, you have to take a very deep breath before you conclude it's reasonable &#x2013; but if you can conclude that these are reasonable balance points to get these things resolved, then we take away from the company a very major overhang or cloud which, of course, influences the degrees of freedom we feel we have for allocation of capital in other things, because if you always sat there thinking we might have an unquantifiable big number which we're going to have to resolve at some moment, you're always reticent. I'm not saying it stopped us doing anything in the last couple of years, but you can imagine a scenario where it might. You can imagine a scenario where that becomes sufficiently concerning to inhibit our freedom to maneuver. We wanted to take that off, and we felt, to be honest, that this was the right moment and we had the right &#x2013; we got to a place where we thought this was the right balance for the investor.</p>
          <p>In terms of flu next generation, we're still analyzing the trial. So the trial &#x2013; so the work we've been doing on flu next generation is a trivalent flu. And it's &#x2013; so the trial, we're not happy that we've got the right product but there are some &#x2013; so &#x2013; but it's not a failed trial in the sense of it has &#x2013; I think it's going to give us the information we need to get the product right. So we've &#x2013; there's no doubt at all that the prototype vaccine that we put into this trial is not going to see the light of day, but I think we see what we need to do to get the next version to the market. So it's a &#x2013; I'd describe this as, yes, it's a failure but not of the program, more of the prototype. And the trial itself looks like it's giving us some quite important information to be able to get the next one tuned correctly, and we'll talk about that I would have thought probably at the year-end. I would anticipate by February we'll have clarity on being able to tell you what that looks like, so a bit of a setback but not end of the program by any stretch.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Alexandra Hauber from JPMorgan. Obviously, quite impressive moving five products into Phase III. The question is, how come that it's five all at the time? Did you go to your development team and say, look, I'm going to give my two-year review and I need you to deliver something &#x2013; deliver more product of value thing? Or did you have a recent sort of assessment of what's in the early pipeline or is it just the serendipity of R&amp;D, basically what I would like to hear &#x2013; what I would ideally like to hear is actually you saying that early R&amp;D has now reached the stage where we can see the products come more regularly rather than -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think the short &#x2013; I'm going to tell you something which you can believe me or not. We actually looked at whether we should announce seven and we decided to delay two, right? Because we didn't want to overreach on anything, OK? So this is absolutely a fair and square, these assets naturally came at this point, it so happened to be in this quarter. Can we deliver five every quarter? Absolutely not. Nobody's promising you we can do five every quarter. Can we deliver &#x2013; are we more confident now than we have been for a long time that we can deliver a sustainable flow of assets year on year? Yeah, I think we are and I think you'll see as we go through the balance of this year, assuming a couple of things go okay, you'll see more go forward into Phase III.</p>
          <p>And there's no question &#x2013; now, a lot of this, of course, isn't directly a consequence of what we started in the DPU just two years ago because, obviously, it takes much longer for this to work through, but this is all reflective of the change in behavior in this company. So the integrase actually is a direct consequence of hiring Zehong, redirecting our HIV &#x2013; HIV DPU and really focusing on how to find the drug from the previous failed programs. That's no question about that. Prosensa is all about our commitment to go out and externalize and bring assets in. Zoster is a classic, straight from the core of the vaccine organization targeting how we think we can differentiate from the existing market, a product with an agitent exhaustive vaccine. It's a very interesting program.</p>
          <p>And then the two melanomas, that's all about what we did by integrating our full development with our discovery group in oncology, and Paole Pelitti really, and Perry Nisen are the two senior scientists in that area really going back in and aggressively dragging drugs out of the very early discovery phase. So they are all a bit different. I'm not going to say they're there because of one thing we did. But they're there because -- they're all there because of the way we're changing the way R&amp;D works. And you're going to see more of this come through as we go forward. So I think it's indicative of an improvement. It's not giving you the exact number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I just have to ask that follow-up question because you've also been very good in getting -- doing more with the same level of resources. And you have shown us some of the tools how you got there, but you're now already down from the 30 to the two CROs, so the question is -- the question which we've been asking for years, how much longer can you stay with a relatively flattish kind of R&amp;D budget or if that is all becoming &#x2013; if the early part is all becoming more productive, is there much more to go you can do on productivity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can do more because you start to make different choices. So when this all began, everybody -- so for the first -- if you went back 10 years, I remember being in a room where people said, well, it's impossible to do anything else without another &#xA3;200 million. There is no oxygen in the R&amp;D budget. Fast forward six or seven years, people say, okay, we can start to do procurement savings. We fast forward to now and people will say actually let's make really tough resource allocation decisions. We really think we can win in, I don't know, patent recognition primary discovery. We think that's a major breakthrough area, okay? But you know what, we just don't think we can win in CNS drug development, so let's make a difficult discovery and close down the whole of CNS drug development. That generated huge amounts of savings for the company, right?</p>
          <p>So closing Verona and Harlow, taking out that whole vertical stream of activity, and that just reflects a different way of thinking about how to save money and how to make choices. And that's what you're going to see in R&amp;D. You're going to see us be -- this notion of rational allocation of capital is not a buzz phrase. It's a really focused culture we're trying to drive into the business, and I think that's what drives it. Now, of course at some point there isn't any more to go but we're not there yet and we're continuing to see further reductions in our pharma R&amp;D. And I showed you that pie chart deliberately because, you know, when you say, you know, you've been able to hold your pharma budget pretty flat, you're right, but actually we've been dropping our pharma R&amp;D budget significantly and using the reductions to fund all the other areas where we've been growing, like vaccines, like consumer and others. So I think there's still scope for further efficiency but it's going to be more around tricky choices, more difficult choices, and I think the company's ready to do that and we've demonstrated that.</p>
          <p>Yeah, by the way we also -- at the same board meeting we talked about the acquisitions, we also reviewed all the DPUs. So exactly the same analysis to say let's look at all those discovery operations, all of the partnerships with all the external companies and where do they stand in terms of exceeding expectations, meeting, in trouble, off track? And again, by applying this kind of discipline, we quickly can start to go in and turn off the things which aren't working for us, and again that isn't a characteristic that you'd see in R&amp;D of 10 years ago. R&amp;D of 10 years ago you'd drift on for decades before somebody would stop something. And it's those sorts of shifts that you're starting to see and it makes -- that releases a lot of resources. Yeah, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Nick Turner from Mirabaud. If you look at the sort of patent of cells development in the respiratory franchise in the U.S, negative cells development of Advair and Serevent in the second quarter, do you think any component of that's due to the changed FDA guidance on lobby use in asthma and if so do you think that's also reflected in the whole service stocking patents? And I just wondered whether you might be able to comment whether &#x2013; if that was the case, whether you could foresee negative developments in Advair and Serevent sales through the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Serevent and Advair are two very different animals in this context so for sure I'd expect to see continued reduction in Serevent sales, no question at all, and no question that monotherapy larvae, whether it's Serevent or Fomateral, I think those for asthma clearly you'd expect that to go to zero, and clearly there's not that much use of these drugs in monotherapy in COPD. So I think for Serevent that's clear. And it's a very marginal financial product for us in any case.</p>
          <p>As far as Advair is concerned, wholesaler descent is completely irrelevant. I think it's just one of those, it's got nothing to do with this, it's just one of those things that flows through quarter to quarter. I wouldn't worry about that at all. It's not related. There's no question there's been an overhang over this sector and actually this quarter's been a very &#x2013; it's a very unusual quarter for us because we've had all these one-offs, many of them short like Rotarix, things like that, but we've also had some very important clarifications of big overhangs. Legal is one example where a lot of stuff has been hanging over us for a long time is gone. Advair label is another. We've been waiting for 18 months for clarity on what the Advair label would or wouldn't be. And that's now there.</p>
          <p>And I think that that uncertainty has no doubt contributed to a slowness in this marketplace. Not least, both us and Astra, for example have been off there with DTC, just as one example, because nobody knew what the positioning should be or where the FDA was going to come out. So you've got that overhang for sure. I think now you've got clarity. I think this will, you know, this is an important label change. It's one that we're working with the FDA about how we now promote in line with their label change, but I think it's now a basis on which we can go forward. And I think that that's actually good news for the company. I've combine that with the other good news during the first half around the setbacks of a lot of the putative generics have been running into in the Advair field. So if I look at Advair as a total, I think some of the big kind of uncertainties have receded or become clarified and I think we go forward from here.</p>
          <p>Yeah, Mike. And then I know Kevin &#x2013; oh, sorry, Kevin had the mic and we'll come back to you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, it's Michael Leacock from RBS. Andrew, clearly you've made great strides in derisking the business certainly over the last few years. I just wondered what's left on that derisking agenda?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. Well, I suppose it's more of the same. At the end of my letter in the results you would have seen the last sentence talked about, I can't remember what it said, something like more business transformation or something like that. And the point I'm trying to make there is it's not over. It's not that we've got some new shoe to drop &#x2013; ah-ha, here's this brand-new idea that we haven't told you about. It's just this is &#x2013; I think we're now in a mode of we really feel &#x2013; for R&amp;D I really feel like we've broken the back of what we need to do but now we've got to just grind through this constantly on all fronts. The same &#x2013; I'm increasingly sure we're there in the U.S., that we've started to really see the shape of what we think the U.S. needs to look like in the future, now we've got to push through on it. I'm very comfortable with our tight, diversified group of businesses. I'm not going to go running off buying any consumer company just because it happens to be in play. I'm going to stay focused on how do we invest behind diversified businesses like consumer where we've got strong science linkages and expert endorsement woven back into the core business.</p>
          <p>But what we need to do is keep finding ways to fuel that, putting more resources in. Can we do more in consumer R&amp;D for example, right? We do 80 innovations a year. We launch 80 new product forms a year into the global market into about 500 geo -- so we have about 500 unique launches in the consumer business. Can we make it 120 innovations, can we make it 1000? That's the &#x2013; that's what I'd like to see us do is drive down each of these lines, whether it's R&amp;D, consumer, vaccines, emerging markets, and just keep driving that forward. And not -- that to me is how we derisk it. I don't think &#x2013; maybe there is and there's smarter people in the world who can think of it, but I think we've got a great plan, just got to just drive down each of these lines and deliver the end game.</p>
          <p>Kevin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kevin Lawson from Citi. Two questions. When do you think U.S. consumer is going to start growing again and at what sort of run rate and you've got new management there, you've got management change in the whole area. I know it's not the biggest driver of the business but you've talked about it a lot in recent quarters, so it would be interesting to give us some sense of when that might tick up into the positive territory.</p>
          <p>And secondly, you also talked a little bit about emerging markets, which was last year's theme rather than this year's theme I think. But if you look at your numbers in the half year and strip out the H1N1 and Relenza, I think you're running at something like 15% in the emerging markets. Is that a run rate that you think is sustainable and on a long-term basis clearly you can give us a breakdown by product and we can think about that. So run rates in consumer, run rates in the emerging markets and finally the certainty that you have of cash flow, if you like, because you now know you're not going to be, we hope, surprising us with additional legal provisions. Does that make you more confident that you can find &#x2013; do more deals? We haven't seen many from you of a sizeable nature because the growth rates are there but you can imagine that an acquisition could drive quite significant change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great questions, Kevin. In terms of the U.S. consumer, the drag on U.S. consumer is alli and Nicorette smoking cessation. Sensodyne is going fantastic, and I think there's no question the U.S. consumer market is a pretty dull place at the moment in terms of purchasing, a lot of downtrading gone on over the last couple of years to owned label. We have seen an improvement there and new management in the U.S. under Roger is I think getting to grips with that business. There's been a huge amount of change in that business. I am optimistic about it, but we need to kind of get on to a level playing feel with the alli and the NiQuitin comparables.</p>
          <p>In terms of emerging markets, actually there was one vaccine shipment in emerging markets which has come three days earlier, would have added 4 percentage points to the growth rate of emerging markets. I have no concerns about emerging markets. And we just pray to this bizarre quarter we're reporting in the world we all live in where we all get terribly excited strategically because something moved on a Monday instead of a Friday and I just don't think we should worry about and I'm not. So I think emerging markets, I feel very relaxed about it.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash flow, I want to make a couple of clarifying points because I don't want anybody to miss. First of all, Julian made the absolute, just because we put it on the chart the cash hasn't gone out of the building yet, so there will be outflows of cash to settle these things and my expectation is that as we run through the balance of this year and during next year you will see that, so even at the end of this year if you see a lot of provision not utilized, it doesn't mean we somehow avoided the payment. These things take 6 to 18 months to actually go through the final payment. So don't miss that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on legal again I'll reiterate, we've discharged the vast bulk of it. But there's still the Colorado case, I just again want to make sure that you understand that. Having said all of that, we continue to look at M&amp;A obviously in terms of the bolt-on acquisitions that we've looked at. We did two during the quarter. We'll have another one to announce very soon, so we're very active but we're very active within our disciplined framework. I mean, you know, we're just not going to pay -- I'm not paying 37 times earnings for an Indian company, I'm just not. And we're just not going to get drawn into those sorts of things. There is always another target and I would rather wait for that opportunity and we will deal with it.</p>
          <p>We're not going to get drawn into the bidding frenzies. We're going to walk away from opportunities that go out of our price range and where we don't think we can drive value for our shareholders. And if that means we get a bit of lumpiness and we do three or four and then we don't do any, fair enough. But I'd much rather we could look at our shareholders in the face and say we bought smart, we really believe we can deliver value and I would much rather standing in front of my board in 2012 showing a slide like the one I just showed you than the opposite. And I think that's where we're at. I don't think we want to get drawn off that kind of disciplined approach.</p>

          <p>Carrie Holdfort, Credit Suisse. Couple of questions, please. Firstly, on legal charges obviously we've seen the big charge this quarter. I'm wondering if you're willing to make any comments on what's an appropriate annual charge for SG&amp;A going forwards. Historically that's been around the 400 million mark. Is it appropriate for us to assume that's significantly smaller now going forward? And then secondly, a bigger picture strategic question, we've talked a bit about the cost savings through R&amp;D and the reinvestments that have been made to date. What are your views on margin expansion for the near and the longer term? I wonder if you're able to give us a bit more guidance on if and when we can expect to start to see the group margin expand as a result of these cost savings coming through.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Many quarters ago I told you that I couldn't predict legal charges going forward and I think the quarters that have followed proved the wisdom of those words. I really don't think, for reasons that are obvious, you can predict the legal charges going forward. I think it just reinforces the point Andrew made. When you look back over the last four-and-a-half years and all that legal charge that we have taken, which is very significant, and you then say, well, if I look at the matters in the announcement we made last week about it being resolved or we've agreed in principle to resolve them, they represent two-thirds. So I think that's going to help you in your determination, much as it helps me in mine, but I have to add the caveat which I started with &#x2013; you really can't predict how some of these legal charges are going to pan out. And as Andrew said, there is still the Colorado one out there, so you can't predict them but I think the history and resolution of them &#x2013; I think the real key point for shareholders and for you is the fact that we've taken so much of it off the table in terms of resolution does actually put the business in a far better position going forward. That's the only sort of pointer I can give you there.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the margin's concerned, I'm very loath to predict that the margins are going to grow. I just &#x2013; so, yes, we can &#x2013; so first of all, as you've seen, we're in the business of driving efficiencies in our established markets to invest in growth, first piece. Even absent that, there's no question that we're in a dull economic environment macro, and you know I'm &#x2013; call me a pessimist, I just don't think we're going to see that massively transform in the next three or four years, and there's no doubt at all we're in a price pressure pharma market environment. And so I just feel like to sit here and say, oh, now we're going to increase margins, I just don't think it's credible. I think that there's a &#x2013; I think there's a, you know, we &#x2013; we clearly are in the business of maintaining our margins in the short run as we've described. Obviously that's what we'd love to do. I just don't think it's right to say we're going to be able to build on this 34%, which is a pretty decent margin anyway, we're going to build on this 34% &#x2013; remember 34% is a pooled business incorporating consumer division doing 20 or 19, so you've got &#x2013; that really is a pretty, I think, healthy margin.</p>
          <p>I don't think it would be sensible for us to be predicting we're going to move that forward and I wouldn't encourage you to be thinking that way. Equally, I would say we are not in the business of letting this margin erode, all right? We're going to be disciplined around it. What might erode the margin is if we saw some acquisitions which were operating at lower than 34%. You know, obviously if we saw a business we feel we could do brilliantly with at 24 we'd buy it, right? So we're not going to be a slave to that margin but we're not going to let it fall apart just through neglect and we're not going to promise you that it's going to suddenly miraculously go up in what I think is going to be a pretty tough pricing world for the next few years. I don't think I can be any more straight than that, to be honest. Any more questions? No? Well, if not, thank you very much. Very kind of you all to come out today. And we'll see you, I guess, at the year-end in February, thanks a lot.</p>
