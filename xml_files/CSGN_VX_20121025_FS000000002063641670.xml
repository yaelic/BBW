          <p>Good morning. This is the conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Credit Suisse Group's Third Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is recorded. You will have the opportunity to ask questions directly after the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Dougan, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse Group. Please go ahead, Mr. Dougan.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining us for the third quarter earnings call. I'm joined on the call by our CFO, David Mathers. Before I begin, I just ask you to take note of the customary cautionary statement on slide 2. And then just getting into the results, I guess there are three key points that I would like to cover this morning.</p>
          <p>First of all, we reported solid third quarter results while maintaining strong momentum with our clients. Second, we further strengthened our capital base through the actions announced in July and we're on track to achieve a look-through Swiss core capital ratio of around 9.3% by the end of 2012, subject to the timing on closings of the sales of Asset Management businesses.</p>
          <p>And third, we continue to successfully execute on the strategic measures that we articulated last year. We're announcing further measures to improve costs, capital efficiency and leverage. These actions will continue our progress to reach a 10% look-through capital ratio by mid-2013 and to approach 12% by the end of 2013 before capital distributions. Once we exceed the 10% level, we have committed to make additional cash distributions to shareholders from capital generation.</p>
          <p>Let me now spend a little bit more time providing some detail on each of those points.</p>
          <p>First of all we did achieve solid stable earnings in the third quarter while at the same time improving the efficiency of our operations and maintaining strong momentum with our clients. Our underlying pre-tax income of CHF 1.2 billion improved from CHF 1.1 billion in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our reported net income of CHF 254 million included a pre-tax charge of CHF 1 billion relating to the tightening of credit spreads on our own debt. Despite an operating environment characterized by muted client activity amid political and economic uncertainties, our results were strong. Our performance in these challenging markets underscores the strength of our business model and the significant progress we've achieved in executing our strategy.</p>
          <p>Investment Banking delivered strong and more consistent results reflecting the progress that we've made to realign our business to better meet the demands of a changed regulatory and market environment by substantially reducing risks and expenses.</p>
          <p>Fixed income has demonstrated substantially improved operating performance reflecting the success we have had in transforming the franchise. The restructuring of the business over the past year through a significant reduction of risk-weighted assets, inventory levels and costs has resulted in the more balanced business mix with lower volatility and improved returns on capital.</p>
          <p>Equity sales and trading revenues declined from the second quarter reflecting muted client activity. However, we continued to capitalize on our market-leading positions in this business. Notably our prime services franchise was ranked number two globally with a 13.7% market share.</p>
          <p>In addition we achieved the strongest quarter of the year in underwriting and advisory results driven by pickup in global debt issuance, strong advisory revenues and market share momentum. For the first nine months of 2012, our rankings increased to number three in global high yield and number three in global completed M&amp;A and that's versus number five and number six, respectively, for the full year 2011.</p>
          <p>In Private Banking, we achieved solid profitability reflecting strategic revenue initiatives and measures to improve cost efficiency, but margins were impacted by the subdued environment, increases in regulatory-related costs and material increases in assets under management.</p>
          <p>We reported net asset inflows of CHF 5.2 billion consisting of strong gross inflows in international booking centers partly offset by outflows from Western European mature markets. For the first time since 2007, assets under management in Private Banking exceeded CHF 1 trillion during the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, we reported higher underlying pre-tax income driven by investment-related gains and reduced expenses offset by lower performance fees.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, the group has generated an underlying return on equity of 10% in what we consider to be a volatile environment with low levels of client activity and including a 2% drag from residual losses in our wind-down businesses in the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we're confident that the full implementation of the strategic, capital and cost savings measures that we've announced will enable us to meet our previously stated 15% through the cycle return on equity.</p>
          <p>Second, we further improved our capital position. The implementation of the capital actions which we announced in July is well underway. To date, we've achieved CHF 12.8 billion of the CHF 15.3 billion target. We expect to deliver an additional CHF 2.4 billion in capital by year-end through a combination of strategic divestments, additional real estate sales resulting from the Clariden Leu merger, retained earnings and lower deductions.</p>
          <p>As it relates to strategic divestments in Asset Management, in addition to the sales of select private equity businesses previously announced in July, we have decided to pursue the sale of our ETF business. However, we remain committed to the Asset Management business going forward. We have no further plans for the divestment of other businesses and we'll focus on capital efficient strategies within our business.</p>
          <p>The successful implementation of these capital measures has substantially enhanced our capital position. At the end of the third quarter, our look-through Swiss core capital ratio stood at 8.2% and we expect our end 2012 ratio to be around 9.3%, subject to the timing on closings of the sales of Asset Management businesses.</p>
          <p>We're confident that we will reach a 10% look-through capital ratio by mid-2013, well ahead of the Swiss 2018 year-end requirement, and we'll approach 12% by the end of 2013 before capital distributions. Once we exceed the 10% level, we have committed to make additional cash distributions to shareholders from capital generation.</p>
          <p>And third, we continue to execute on the strategic measures we announced last year and we have a strong track record of delivering on the target that we've set. Today, we've announced further measures on costs, risk-weighted assets and leverage to further improve efficiency and to ensure that we deliver superior returns in the industry.</p>
          <p>To date, we've made meaningful progress on our cost reduction efforts. We significantly cut costs and improved efficiencies across the bank while we continue to identify future cost savings measures throughout our businesses. We delivered on our target of CHF 2 billion of expense reductions 18 months early, and we now expect to exceed our previously announced year-end 2013 expense reduction target. We expect to realize a full CHF 3 billion in cost savings during fiscal 2013, not just by the end of the year as previously articulated.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've identified a further CHF 1 billion in cost savings, half of which will be achieved during each of 2014 and 2015. In total, we are targeting CHF 4 billion in expense reductions by the end of 2015. We are extremely confident that we'll be able to achieve this target. The resulting significantly reduced cost base will provide us with operating flexibility and ensure the resilience of our business model going forward.</p>
          <p>Next, on capital efficiency. We continue to show discipline on risk-weighted assets in the quarter. Current group-wide Basel III risk-weighted assets now stand close to our 2013 (sic) [2012] end target of CHF 300 billion. We're targeting an additional 12% reduction in risk-weighted assets in the Investment Bank bringing the number to $180 billion by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>And finally, balance sheet leverage. Today, we announced measures to reduce total gross balance sheet assets to below CHF 900 billion by the end of 2013, which represents a targeted reduction of approximately CHF 130 billion or 13%. This balance sheet reduction will improve our simple gross leverage ratio from 3.8% at the end of the third quarter to 4.9% pro forma for the reductions, while having a limited impact on our revenues.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to have very strong liquidity with an industry-leading Basel III net stable funding ratio well ahead of requirements. Our estimated net stable funding ratio was in excess of 100% at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have successfully executed on our strategic measures and have a strong track record of delivering on the targets we've set. The additional targets announced today to further improve cost, capital efficiency and leverage will continue and accelerate our progress to reach a 10% look-through Swiss core capital ratio in 2013.</p>
          <p>We expect the consistent earnings capacity of our business model to generate substantial levels of excess capital and therefore, we are committed to distributing additional cash to shareholders once we exceed this 10% look-through capital ratio. We're confident we can achieve this 10% target by mid-2013 and can approach 12% by the end of 2013 before capital distributions.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to David.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to start the presentation on slide 7 with an overview of the financial results.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we achieved underlying revenues of CHF 6.3 billion, pre-tax income of CHF 1.2 billion and net income of CHF 891 million. Diluted earnings per share were CHF 0.57, the pre-tax income margin 19%, and the post-tax return on equity 10%.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the numbers for first 9 months, pre-tax income is up 13% to CHF 3.8 billion compared to the same period last year. Also delivering, though, a 19% pre-tax income margin and a 10% ROE.</p>
          <p>At the reported level, third quarter pre-tax income was CHF 254 million. Now in slide 33 of the slide deck, we include the normal reconciliation to our underlying results, but the main drivers of the CHF 1 billion of fair value and debt losses relating to the substantial narrowing of our credit spreads, which we've seen in the third quarter. As well as, just to be clear, CHF 382 million of gains from the sale of real estate as part of the capital plan that are actually booked in the Corporate Center.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to slide 8. Private Banking's third quarter pre-tax income was CHF 689 million and the pre-tax income margin was 27%. The revenues are broadly stable compared to the last quarter. If you exclude the second quarter gain that we had from the sale of a non-core business from within Clariden Leu, so as you can see on the slide, was about CHF 41 million.</p>
          <p>I'd also note was the absence of the semi-annual performance fees that we book in the second quarter and the fourth quarter in both the Private Bank and Asset Management and particularly, the <mark type="ph" /> specialty private (11:38) bank, the Hedging-Griffo business in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Compensation and benefits were lower reflecting initial benefits from efficiency initiatives but other operating expenses increased due to higher regulatory and legal costs. Assets under management were 12% higher year-on-year and that meant that our assets under management exceeded CHF 1 trillion for the first time since 2007.</p>
          <p>If we turn to slide 9 to look at the Wealth Management revenues in some more detail, starting on net interest income, the bottom segment in the columns on the slide. Net interest income was slightly lower quarter-on-quarter, due to the continuing impact of low current interest rates, albeit this was partly offset by higher loan and deposit volumes than the Private Bank. Recurring fees and commissions also declined driven by the absence of semi-annual performance fees that I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Further, as we said before, clients' portfolios continue to be biased towards more risk-averse fixed income interest and cash which yield lower fees for us. And I think notwithstanding the recent improved tone in the Eurozone situation, client confidence remains at low levels, and that's reflected in the continued subdued transaction revenues.</p>
          <p>And as you can see, this combination of the subdued environment, a very conservative risk mix and relatively stable net interest income relative to higher assets under management in the quarter reduced the gross margin from 113 to 107 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 please. Net new asset inflows continued particularly in Asia Pacific and other emerging markets. But there were outflows in Western Europe particularly off the Swiss platform, as well as muted inflows in the Americas and Switzerland. I'd note that that is not uncommon in Switzerland to have such muted inflows in the third and fourth quarters from a seasonal point of view.</p>
          <p>Slide 11. What I'd like to show here is how a number of different factors are affecting the performance of Wealth Management so far in 2012. On the one hand, we've achieved net benefits in terms of lower costs and certain fee increases of CHF 210 million so far this year.  As a target, you may recall we set for 2012 of CHF 300 million.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we have seen around CHF 300 million of revenues decline. So, overall, the pre-tax income reflects the fall in transaction revenues, the adverse mix in terms of client assets, and to a lesser extent, some increase in the regulatory costs we face.</p>
          <p>This then offsets the gains we've seen so far from the future PB initiatives. But we're on track to achieve the further CHF 90 million of benefits from this program to reach our target of CHF 300 million, as well as taking further measures to ensure progress towards the CHF 800 million on the future PB that we announced before.</p>
          <p>Slide 12. In Corporate and Institutional Clients, pre-tax income was broadly stable at CHF 206 million in the fourth quarter (sic) [third quarter] with a continued strong pre-tax margin of 43%. Credit provisions remained at a low level in the third quarter with the loan portfolio quality remaining strong.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Investment Banking now on slide 13 please. As you can see, third quarter revenues are higher than in the second quarter and also higher for the first nine months of the year compared to the nine month &#x2013; the same period last year. We've seen stronger and more consistent results from fixed income this year. We've seen a resilient performance in equities and underwriting advisory. And all this was achieved with a lower cost base and less capital, which significantly benefits, of course, the divisional return on equity.</p>
          <p>I'd also point out that the third quarter results are after CHF 136 million of certain litigation provisions as well as the wind-down losses of CHF 100 million relating to the said wind-down portfolio that we talked to you about before.</p>
          <p>So let's turn now to slide 14. What you can see here is the substantial improvement that we've seen in our Fixed Income business in 2000 &#x2013; so far in 2012. I think you may recall a year ago that there was a lot of concern about the future of the fixed income industry, and whether you can make an appropriate return in this new regulatory environment.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this graph, we've achieved a substantial improvement in operating performance with higher revenues quarter-on-quarter as well as year-to-date compared to the first nine months of last year. What's more, this result has been achieved while simultaneously reducing expenses and with more than 40% lower risk-weighted assets within our Fixed Income business. So the business is now improving, substantially improved returns, both in absolute terms and compared to last year.</p>
          <p>If we talk about the trends in more detail, first we've seen strong and substantially improved results in securitized products, where we've delivered a well-balanced contribution from our non-agency, government guarantees and asset finance businesses, both in the third quarter and in the nine months.</p>
          <p>Second, we've had a robust performance in credit, primarily due to strong client flows and issuance across both leverage finance and in investment grade.</p>
          <p>And third, you may recall when we announced our second quarter results, we talked about a very strong performance in our emerging markets business in fixed income in the second quarter, in fact, I believe it was a record level for that business. We've seen a continued good performance in emerging markets in the third quarter with strong results from our Latin American operations.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 please. In the Equities business, where we have a very good franchise with consistently high market shares, the third quarter was definitely challenging. The strongest business in the quarter and, in fact, so far this year, has been the Prime Service business. And it's clear we've continued to gain market share in this area. You may have seen there was a recent number two ranking for our business, putting us at 13.7% of the global hedge fund market. And there's no doubt that this business has performed well about &#x2013; against what's generally been a somewhat mediocre market environment.</p>
          <p>Clearly, there's been a more difficult environment for our Cash Equity businesses in most markets globally. This is an area where we have some of our highest market shares and remains one of our best-positioned businesses. Notwithstanding the pickup in equity markets from a value point of view we've seen this year, volumes remained depressed and there was a low level of primary activity, which as you know can stress our secondary trading. Notwithstanding this, we've maintained our strong market shares in this business and this remains a solidly profitable area for Credit Suisse.</p>
          <p>In equity derivatives, our numbers have lagged somewhat as we've continue to take a very conservative approach to risk position and volatility management in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 16 please. Looking at our underwriting and advisory businesses, this was the strongest quarter we've seen so far this year, primarily driven by a strong performance in debt underwriting across both leverage finance and investment bank &#x2013; and investment grade. You can see that revenues were up more than CHF 100 million compared to the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in this business, as I mentioned before, equity underwriting continues to suffer from a very lackluster IPO calendar. And in M&amp;A, while our share continues to be strong, you can see on the graph we were third for completed M&amp;A for the first nine months of the year. Our revenues were up quarter-on-quarter but volumes are still subdued compared to what we might have expect to see at this point in the cycle.</p>
          <p>So, then just to summarize for the Investment Bank, what slide 17 lays out is the incremental impact on Investment Bank's year-to-date normalized return from cost improvements and RWA reductions compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the impact of the efficiency improvements and lower risk-weighted asset usage on more or less flat revenues provided a significant lift through our Basel III return, which improved from 3% to 11%. Furthermore, if we exclude the remaining wind-down portfolio, we would've achieved a 16% Basel III return. Just to be clear, this book is substantially smaller than it was a year ago when we had CHF 54 billion of risk-weighted assets in this position. As you may recall when we talked about it back in 2011, that's now down to CHF 14 billion now.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Asset Management, slide 18. Asset Management's year-on-year performance has been distorted by a number of one-off factors, including a significant private equity realization last year and in the current year, the Aberdeen sale as well as you note the CHF 38 million write-down which was on AMF.</p>
          <p>Leaving those stats to the side, what we've seen is some pressure on performance fees in line with the Private Banking business trends, fee-based revenues have dropped by about 10%, but against that you can also see that we've reduced costs by about CHF 70 million showing the continued progress we've made in terms of reducing costs in general cost Asset Management, both particularly in terms of consolidating platforms in this business.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 then shows the quarter-on-quarter PTI performance where we've seen higher investment gains, an increased contribution from the sale of our Aberdeen position offset by AMF write-down in the third quarter compared to what we took in the second quarter. And in the absence of semi-annual performance fees in the third quarter, then being broadly offset by lower compensation expenses.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 then. So last November, we announced that we intended to reduce our expenses by CHF 2 billion, which as you know, we actually met in the first half of the year, somewhat earlier than we'd planned. You recall, back on July 18, when we announced our capital rates, we increased this target to a run rate of CHF 3 billion by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>What we're looking at over the past quarter is our longer-term plan for the next few years across the businesses and particularly how we &#x2013; our strategy and operations for the underlying infrastructure of the bank.</p>
          <p>I think of the results this way, we feel very confident that we will exceed our target of CHF 3 billion cost &#x2013; CHF 3 billion of cost reductions, not just by the end of 2013 but actually in the fiscal year as a whole. Furthermore, what we're aiming to achieve is not just a sequence of one-off cost reductions, but a longer term program so that &#x2013; to actually drive continuing and ongoing efficiency improvements.</p>
          <p>I don't think we've necessarily come to the end of what we plan to do here, but I do feel confident to tell you that we'd expect to achieve another CHF 0.5 billion of these savings in 2014 and a further CHF 0.5 billion in 2015. So just put that in context, that means we're looking to achieve CHF 3 billion of cost savings in fiscal 2013, CHF 3.5 billion in fiscal 2014 and rising to CHF 4 billion in 2015.</p>
          <p>So what's driving these savings? So first in the Investment Bank, which you know has produced the bulk of the savings so far, about CHF 1.4 billion of the CHF 2 billion in the direct cost base plus the additional savings from allocate infrastructure associated with the Investment Bank. Obviously, this reduced run rate is both improving returns to our shareholders and dramatically improving the operating leverage of the business.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, within the Investment Bank's direct cost base, we think we can reduce costs by about another CHF 700 million. This is likely to come from synergies in our equities business and from continued to rationalize other business and overlaps across fixed income, underwriting and advisory.</p>
          <p>In Private Banking, we've seen the early benefits from Clariden Leu merger and going forward, we will seek to rationalize front office support further and downsize our affluent client coverage model. In Asset Management, we expect to see further benefits from the consolidation of our platforms as well as increasing the use of offshoring.</p>
          <p>The largest single component savings, though, will come from our shared service infrastructure that supports the entire bank. So far, we've achieved CHF 300 million of savings from this. But we're setting a target here of a further CHF 1.1 billion over the 2013 to 2015 period. We're already well-advanced integrating the operations and assessment functions across the bank, and we now have a single operations function for the entire group. We expect to see further savings from the integration of technology with the operations functions as we run these areas end to end in future. We're removing some of the duplicate management process and expenses across these areas. I think to be clear, we're also continuing to develop our offshoring strategy and looking to achieve a better balance of onshore, offshore and outsourced services across the business.</p>
          <p>Okay, so let's just turn to slide 21. I think one of the comments that we've heard over the last year is a lot are confused about run rate definition, actual against annualized and the period in which savings are actually based on. So I think we just wanted to put up a slide in which we could show what the actual reductions and what's included and excluded from these targets going forward, such as variable comp and obviously FX moves, which given that a large component of our expenses are in dollars, tends to distort the trends every year.</p>
          <p>So just to be clear, we show here our underlying operating expenses excluding variable comp and assuming constant FX rates. So we start then at CHF 20.5 billion of expenses for the first six months for 2011. By the first 9 months this year, on the same basis, we're down to CHF 18.5 billion.</p>
          <p>On the right of the chart, what's implied is we expect to reduce costs by a further CHF 1 billion in 2013 and CHF 0.5 billion in each of 2014 and 2015. So in other words, on the basis we've set before, we're setting a cost target of CHF 16.5 billion for 2015.</p>
          <p>In terms of expenses relating to this, we think we'll probably take around CHF 240 million of realignment costs in the fourth quarter and probably another CHF 1 billion between 2013, 2014 and 2015. That's in total over those three years.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 22. So, slide 22 shows the group's Basel III RWA numbers both so far this year and into 2012 and 2013. Our estimated Basel III risk-weighted assets were CHF 307 billion at the end of the third quarter, close to the target of around CHF 300 billion for the end of this year.</p>
          <p>We expect to reduce our RWA then further in 2013 by about CHF 20 billion to around CHF 280 billion. And this will be achieved with a further 10% decline or reduction in the Investment Bank's current B3 levels to $180 billion by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>So I just wanted to give everybody an update on the progress we've made on the various capital measures we announced back on July 18. I think most of this should be clear and we've obviously made an announcement around the APPA and capital transactions during the quarter. But what you can see here is we have achieved about CHF 12.8 billion of the CHF 15.3 billion that we mentioned back in July as our target.</p>
          <p>So as I said, this should be familiar. If we just look at slide 6 and 7 then, you should be aware that we've seen about CHF 0.3 billion primarily related to the redemptions of certain hedge fund assets within the Asset Management division. We've also achieved real estate sales for a capital benefit of CHF 382 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of the things we &#x2013; let me turn to slide 24 please. But in terms of things we still intend to accomplish against that capital plan targets, firstly, we continue to target CHF 900 million of capital benefit from steep divestments within Asset Management, and that includes the disposal of a number of alternative investments in line with focus in the business towards more liquid strategies.</p>
          <p>In addition, as Brady mentioned, we're continuing negotiations to divest our ETF business, but other than what we previously announced, we have no plans for other businesses within Asset Management.</p>
          <p>Now we remain confident that the bulk of these disposals will be announced by the year-end, but I would caution, in line with what we said in July 18, that it's quite possible that the announcement and the completion of some of these sales may slip into the first quarter of next year. That said, three months into the marketing process for these businesses and assets, we do feel highly confident we'll reach the target once the progress is fully complete.</p>
          <p>Second, given that we've exceeded the expected disposals process on real estate sales so far, we revised our future capital benefits and we think we'll make another CHF 0.4 billion from the sales that we still have to make.</p>
          <p>And then of course, the bottom is the normal impact. We assume in our calculations relating to the analysts' consensus earnings estimates, change in equity and of course, lower ratio regulatory reductions from the increase in common equity.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 25. So what we're showing here is our normal progression for the Swiss core capital ratio. You can see at the end of the third quarter, this ratio improved to 8.2% due to the capital measures we've completed so far.</p>
          <p>On a pro forma basis, we'd expect it to be around 9.3% by the end of the year, but there are a number uncertainties here, including the assumption of when we actually receive the benefit from the cap of the asset disposals. But nonetheless, we should be comfortably on track to achieve the 10% target by the middle of next year.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to the end of 2013 with completion of these disposals as well as the CHF 20 billion reduction in RWAs, we think this ratio would drive up and approach 12%, but obviously that's before decisions are made around capital and distribution and dividend distribution to shareholders as Brady mentioned. But it's also worth noting that even just factoring in the reduction in the Investment Bank's RWA to the target of $180 billion, a loan would lift this target ratio to around 10%.</p>
          <p>Just on then for slide 26, this is the updated version of what we showed back in July. So, we include here on the left-hand side the same simulation for our B2.5 ratios and just for the benefit of our BCN holders or our high stake CoCos, the relevant ratio for that is 14.7%, and you may recall that compares to the BCN trade level of 7%.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand chart, as you can see, are the same numbers we gave before. So, the estimate on pro forma basis of around 9.3% for the look-through Swiss core capital ratio at the end of the year, but then approaching 12% by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>So let me turn to the balance sheet, slide 27. Over the last five years, we've reduced the balance sheet from CHF 1.4 trillion to just over CHF 1 trillion in the third quarter of 2012. These reductions have been entirely by the Investment Bank. And in dollar terms, Investment Bank balance sheet usage is about 24% smaller than it was in 2007.</p>
          <p>Now looking forward, our intention is to reduce the group balance sheet to less than CHF 900 billion by the end of 2013. And to achieve this, we have conducted a thorough review of the allocation of our balance sheet relative to our major investment banking clients, the return on assets in each business, particularly a number of balance sheet tendencies and lower ROA areas. But we've also looked at some areas across treasury where we could be more efficient in our balance sheet usage.</p>
          <p>Slide 28. Clearly this will have a significant positive impact on our leverage ratio. The capital measures we announced in July will &#x2013; already greatly improved this ratio to around 3.8% before the conversion of mandatory to convertible next March.</p>
          <p>What we show in the right-hand column is a steady state leverage ratio projection of around 5% once we're at the CHF 280 billion risk-weighted asset target, which you know is what we said now. 10% CET1, which again is also our target, and a CHF 900 billion balance sheet. You can see it's around 5% on that basis and that's also a ratio which, given what we've said already today, is something we should achieve by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>So let me then just conclude then with some comments around our funding and our liquidity position. They remain strong at the end of the third quarter and net stable funding ratio, as Brady mentioned, is around 100%. And I'd note that our funding in CDS spreads remain amongst the lowest compared to the third quarter and what's more, have narrowed very substantially in the third quarter although that, of course, has contributed to the over CHF 1 billion of fair value end debt number that we've mentioned already and a total about CHF 2.6 billion for the whole year. We continue have a highly unencumbered balance sheet with very limited use to cover bonds. And just to be clear on that point, only about 14% of our Swiss mortgage book is so utilized.</p>
          <p>So, on that note, I'd like to conclude the presentation, and I'd like to pass back to Brady, please.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Derek De Vries from Bank of America. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks. I got three areas I want to ask questions about. The first is the cost in the Wealth Management business. I noticed the head count's up about 300 in the Private Bank. And I guess some of that's school hires, but maybe if you could comment on that and whether that drove the cost.</p>
          <p>And then related to that, you showed a slide on the nine-month and you show CHF 53 million of incremental regulatory costs in Wealth Management. I'm just wondering how much of that was in Q3? Or maybe the better the way to ask it, is there an exceptional amount of regulatory costs in Q3? So, that's the first area.</p>
          <p>The second, can you talk about the new risk-weighted asset guidance &#x2013; or I guess you gave new risk-weighted asset guidance for 2013. It's about CHF 10 billion to CHF 20 billion I guess, below where people were forecasting. And I'm just wondering sort of what's going to drive that? Is that sort of genuine legacy assets running off faster or businesses that you're exiting or is it risk-weighted asset model optimization? Sort of what's the driver of the delta on risk-weighted asset guidance?</p>
          <p>And then the last question, you said and you talked about the meaningful capital return and once you reach the 10% level, which is encouraging, but I guess my question is for 2012, paid out in 2013, you're probably not going to be there on your guidance. So does that change the 30% payout ratio that I guess we've been expecting? Or what's the thought for this year in terms of capital return? Those are my questions. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Derek. Thanks very much for those questions. I don't know, maybe we could take them in a slightly different order? I mean, I think on the RWA side and, David, obviously you can contribute if you want, as you say, we do &#x2013; obviously, the key is that we are planning to continue to drive additional capital efficiency in the business. I would say it's a little bit of each of the areas that you mentioned. I mean certainly, continued reduction on the legacy side is an important aspect of contributing to that goal.</p>
          <p>But we also will continue to look at just optimizing other parts of our businesses across a number of different businesses. I mean, we've obviously brought it down quite a lot over the last year, year and a half so there's been a substantial reduction. So at this point, we're more into optimizing the business model, which means probably bringing down RWA in &#x2013; across a number of different businesses but on a more selective basis I'd say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think &#x2013; clearly, I mean, to the take point, at the moment, obviously with the Basel III slippage in EU, CRD IV and clearly in the States as well, the &#x2013; we will be one of the first banks to actually switching to Basel III in the 1 of January so, obviously we're going through the final preparation for that switch over in terms of the models and the numbers. But I think clearly, what we felt is that we were close enough to that and we could probably give you some guidance in terms of where we'd expect the number to go as we actually cross through into 2013 and where we get to the end.</p>
          <p>But as Brady mentioned, the majority of that will actually come from a sort of final optimization of the Investment Banking businesses. We know we still feel obviously, we've got about CHF 14 billion of risk-weighted assets, for example, still in the fit wind-down and it's come down from CHF 54 billion to CHF 14 billion a year ago, so a long way. But obviously, our goal is to actually eliminate that and we would hope to make a substantial further progress towards that in 2013.</p>
          <p>But equally as we've gone through the business planning for next year, there's still some areas where we think we can actually optimize our RWAs by actually reducing positions. So, those are the two things sort of driving that. Shall I...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...wrong word from Bloomberg. No, I think it will be the absolute position reduction. As in fairness, if you look at what we've done over last year, that's what it has been within the Investment Bank frankly. I think &#x2013; I don't think we've &#x2013; it was a Basel III change but I don't think we've had much optimized to actually optimize in a regulatory sense, Derek. So, it should be....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You should think of this really as position reduction next year. I think a year ago, obviously, we did talk about similar reductions and I think we've managed them very well. Fixed income revenues are up despite that. So I think we're pretty confident.</p>
          <p>But I think we're getting towards the end of this process but we did feel as we actually go through the Basel III calibration, finally at the end of this year, we could probably give some idea of where we'd expect the Basel III risk-weighted assets to be at the end of 2013. And we thought it was useful and appropriate to actually do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the cost side in Wealth Management, I mean we, as you say, we certainly have made some progress on that. Obviously, that also is part of the continuing program there. I think, as you know, we talked about CHF 800 million of improvements in pre-tax in Private Banking over the course of the next couple years and of that, somewhere around half of that is in cost reductions.</p>
          <p>The specific question you asked about the head count, we did have &#x2013; there is a quarterly element in the sense that in the third quarter, we did have campus hires and apprentices come into the business so that, as you say, overall, we were up 300 but we were actually up about 425 in campus hires. And actually down about 120 through efficiency measures.</p>
          <p>So overall, I think we're obviously going to continue to drive the efficiency on the Private Banking side and that, obviously, that may have implications for head count going forward.</p>
          <p>Your question on the regulatory cost, in general, obviously, the regulatory costs in the business have been higher this year. They include preparation for FATCA. They include preparation for MiFID II, and also the implementation of the withholding tax agreement in anticipation of the potential passage of the German treaty.</p>
          <p>So I think in the third quarter, costs were slightly higher, particularly from the IT preparations for the withholding tax agreement implementation in &#x2013; with the potential that it comes through, we obviously have to be ready if it does come through, so slightly higher but I think, in general, obviously this is just a burden on the business going forward.</p>
          <p>And I guess lastly, on the capital issue, I don't know, David, you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I mean I think I wasn't quite sure when you said &#x2013; your question in terms of progress against target, I mean I think as we've said, with the additional RWA reduction just by itself, without any earnings potential or anything else, we'd be at almost around the 10% mark anyway once we actually drop down to $180 billion on the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>And as I said, subject to the timing of the asset disposals of final Basel III calibration, we expect to be around 9.3% at the end of the year. I think we also included our simulation through to the end of 2013, so that would put us approaching the 12% level on the Swiss core capital level.</p>
          <p>So I think that's obviously comfortably ahead of the 10% target we're actually working to. And I think as Brady mentioned, clearly that will obviously give discretion to the Board in terms of making cash distributions to the shareholders in respect to the 2013 year once we get to the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, yeah, sorry. I guess my question was very specifically for this year, right, so I, clearly I get your capital generative business model and you're going to throw out a lot of cash, and you've clearly signaled an intent to return it. But I guess for this year, I don't think you're going to be at the 10% and therefore, does it imply a change in the previous guidance for the 30% payout ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear Derek, what we actually said on July the 18 as part of the capital measures was that we'd &#x2013; I mean clearly, ultimately, it's the decision of the Board, but the discussion &#x2013; the recommendation discussion we've had with the Board is that in respect to 2012, we would actually pay our scrip dividend. That's what we did actually announce for this year.</p>

          <p>It's in line. It's part of the capital plan, actually Derek. So, no, there shouldn't be any changes there in terms of expectations.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Derek, one supplementary point and I think it's to the benefit of everyone, actually. Brady actually mentioned the graduate and technical apprentice hires within the Private Bank, which, as he said, is 105 apprentices. It's about 320 campus hires. You should be aware that for the group overall, there was about 800 graduates and then another 100 apprentices. So, those would be the group addition from the seasonal add in terms of the graduate recruitment and apprenticeship programs for the year, just to complete that analysis.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Huw van Steenis from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everyone. Two questions. First, really thinking about capital return, I was interested by the subtle change in wording on page 31 about your targets being before capital distributions. I know it's very early but thinking about the 2013 dividend, do you think it's possible to get back to 100% cash dividend next year and what are the sort of factors which may go into that thinking?</p>
          <p>And then number two, reflecting the news of cost-cutting program, does that change when you expect you might hit the 15% ROE KPI and maybe if you could give us sense about which year you think it's &#x2013; which you hope to achieve that target? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I pass to Brady? So I take the cash point and then the ROE...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...then I mean. So, Huw, I think we said, as I said, confirmed, it's our intention that we would issue a scrip dividend for 2012, which would then be the scrip that's actually payable in spring of 2013 post the AGM. I think we've also kind of said elsewhere, I think reasonably consistently, that once we actually achieve that 10% target, we'd move away from such dilutive measures. So our intention really would be the year after to recommend to the Board and then to the AGM that we'd go to a cash dividend for the 2013 year, which, to be clear, would then be payable in the spring of 2014. So, that's &#x2013; I don't think &#x2013; and that's pretty consistent with what we said before. I don't think we'd shift from that position actually, Huw.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, no, I'm sorry. I truly appreciate that. I was just thinking that if there was a scenario which, once paying the dividend, you slipped back below 10%, would it still be a full cash dividend? Sorry, that was the sort of more what I was pointing to in the subtle change of wording.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, obviously, we'd hope when we're approaching 12% that that shouldn't be an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, but ultimately, that will be a question for the Board. I think, candidly, I think, whilst the scrip is appropriate in certain circumstances, once you actually achieve that ratio is we'd like to move away from that. But that is a question for the Board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Huw, your question on ROE, you're just saying what's just kind of more detail around the target, when we might achieve it, what the dynamics are around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I guess what we would point to is an operating ROE of 10% for the first nine months of this year and actually, as we pointed out, that's been depressed by 2% from our legacy businesses, so we would've had a 12% return so far this year, just on an operating business for our &#x2013; operating basis for our ongoing businesses. So, I think our view is I think, as David mentioned, it hasn't been a great environment so far this year. I mean there, obviously, there have been points in time where it's been a reasonable but it hasn't been, I'd say, in general, it hasn't been a great environment.</p>
          <p>So I think we look at it and say, we'd be at a 12% return without our sort of the legacy drag. Obviously, we have continuing programs to reduce cost. We also have continuing programs to reduce capital usage in the businesses. So I think that &#x2013; and I also think that we've got &#x2013; I mean we feel like the business model is actually operating really well, even in these volatile markets. We feel like it's doing what we'd like it to do. We feel like we've &#x2013; and again, we think this a real advantage. We're way up the curve in terms of figuring out how to run the business on a Basel III compliant basis.</p>
          <p>So our view is that we ought to be able to continue to improve those returns over time as we continue to optimize the business and obviously, we're not going to put a stake in the ground in terms of which quarter or which year we're going to get there, but I do think that in the not too distant future, we should be able to achieve those targets, assuming we have any kind of reasonable markets. I think that ought to be possible. If you just work through the cost reductions and the capital reductions, I think you'll see that it actually moves this up obviously approaching that number.</p>

          <p>Sure, Kian. Yeah, sorry, it's David here. So slide 21. No, what we wanted to give you here was the actual variable compensation accrual that we make in each period for the &#x2013; what we actually pay out. And clearly, what the recipient gets is obviously the CV or the cash accrual plus the deferral.</p>
          <p>Now what we wanted to give you here was an ex-VC number, so you get away from any fluctuations around the bonus accrual and that &#x2013; so it's an ex-VC. The deferred compensation actually comes through and it's included in those cost targets so the CHF 18.5 billion, CHF 17.5 billion down to CHF 16.5 billion. And that was why I made that slight caveat. There was two caveats here really. One is that it's dependent on FX because &#x2013; so we were seeing constant FX in this. And two, it's assuming a relatively constant bonus accrual because if we suddenly decreased the bonus accrual, and then over the following period clearly, the actual total expenses would drop, because you'd have less deferral being amortized to the P&amp;L. Clearly if you increase, you have opposite effect.</p>
          <p>So we wanted to be clear. This was the ex-VC number on those assumptions. I mean, I think we thought it was worthwhile, because you had a number of questions over the last six months as to what do these cost savings really mean in terms your ex-VC and then we actually want to say explicitly what our targets were on that basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually would be &#x2013; like to look at it the other way around because, first of all, your deferred comp is going to decline anyway so in terms of your real cost declines, I would say, you have 500 million to CHF 400 million of decline and deferred anyway per year which including your cost savings. At the same time, you're increasing your variable compensation for a year where you're actually not performing that well. Your IB comp year-to-date, clean, is quite high. It's running &#x2013; it's around 46, 47. Your total cost to income is 81.</p>
          <p>Now, what I'm trying to understand is assuming there's no revenue change in the environment, what is your real cost absolute number that you're targeting, because clearly, this is influenced by deferred, which is helping you. But you're increasing deferred at a variable by CHF 300 million in a year where most banks are actually reducing variable. So...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kian, I think it may be the format of the presentation which is confusing a little bit there. The variable compensation of CHF 1.3 billion is what we actually accrued in nine months whereas the number you see on the six month is actually on &#x2013; CHF 1.012 billion is the six months. So, the CHF 1.3 billion is for three quarters versus the CHF 1.012 billion is actually for two quarters. So we've not increased the variable compensation as a consequence of that. In fact, you can see the numbers in the account but the variable compensation is down about 4% in accounting terms, the group, and down about 6% overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you include the variable, if you look at absolute cost, no big revenue change. What would be your cost number target for 2014 and 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will depend on, clearly, on what we choose to accrue in terms of bonuses. I'm... <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:03)</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But assuming no &#x2013; assuming no revenue change, because I think that's a number we're interested in. The CHF 16.5 billion doesn't mean anything to us. So, really assuming no revenue growth considering your cost income in the IB is 81 for 9 months, what is your absolute cost number? CHF 16.5 billion, plus the variable assuming no revenue growth?</p>

          <p>Sorry, I may defer to Brady here. I'm not sure that we're necessary, at this point, we're going to be giving a forecast for our bonus accrual two years out from where we are today. What we're giving here is a forecast for where we expect our other costs to actually be at that point but I think inevitably, the variable compensation accrual will obviously depend clearly on our performance and it must also depend on external factors in terms of our competitive numbers. Brady, do you want to add anything?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So I think we've &#x2013; I think, Kian, hopefully, we've given you some guidance here in terms of our ex-VC costs. I think probably hand over to you, really, I guess in terms of what assumptions you want to make about the variable compensation environment we'll face over the next three years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question is on page 38, slide 38. You give a fixed income breakdown which is very helpful. Even if I just saw the 16% in the 9 months, you make roughly $6 billion off revenues, 31% is macro. That's about $1.5 billion. $1.5 billion for 9 months is roughly, just to give you an example, that's half of what Citi made in one quarter, in the third quarter you make in macro. How do you explain that? I mean how do you actually make money in a business where you make $1.5 billion, whereas other players will make this year around $5 billion in the same business probably even more than that? I mean I just don't see that your cost income can be below 100 in that business. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess &#x2013; Kian, I guess as you know, our focus is on return on capital in these businesses. And I guess that's one of the things that we continue to struggle with. We think that's the critical issue is driving high returns on capital in these businesses. So, the fact is having transitioned to Basel III, we've had to exit a number of parts of the business. We've had to be efficient around the capital that we put in the business and actually that does have an impact on the absolute level of revenues that we make.</p>
          <p>I think the most important thing that we point to is if you look at &#x2013; to point you to a different slide, look at the slide which outlines the return on capital in the Investment Banking business, where you can see the ongoing Investment Banking business in the nine months earned a 16% return on equity. That's actually what we think is most important is that you can see we're making very high returns on capital in the business in the Basel III format and frankly, if you believe that's the way the rest of the industry has to go, we've already gotten there and frankly, that probably &#x2013; I think that's been the most key question, the biggest concern that people have.</p>
          <p>Now, in some of our businesses, we clearly have very high market shares, very significant market shares and are really leaders in things like our structured products business, our credit business, our emerging markets business. The rates business as we've talked about is a business that we're actually growing, where we're actually making progress in. It is a profitable business. And, but again, with the amount of capital, the expense base against it is such that it supports that level of return in order to make &#x2013; or a level of revenues in order to make returns.</p>
          <p>But it's a business that is focused on generating high returns and rather than looking at absolute revenue levels, we're looking at trying to drive returns in the business which, I think, is where the whole industry is going to have to get to.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Kian, I think a couple of points I'd add to it. I mean I think clearly, the business model we're actually adopting, fixed income, is inherently different from that of the Citigroup, which I think you mentioned, some global bank, with a completely different mix of customers and products to actually service.</p>
          <p>I think we've made it pretty clear, both over the last year and particularly in the last three months, that we're very much focused on actually achieving good returns in a number of fixed income businesses. I don't think we really are that convinced by those kind of flow month to bulge bracket type argument in this change regulatory world, where you're going to have to have much greater constraints, much lower risk-weighted asset usage.</p>
          <p>And what we have basically is a collection of businesses, which, as Brady said, are clearly making pretty acceptable returns and radically better than a year ago. Now that probably is a different strategy than some would pursue but I think in this environment, I think it's a strategy which is actually pretty appropriate today and perhaps, you might say we're being unambitious. I think, frankly, we're being realistic about what we can actually achieve.</p>
          <p>And as Brady said, to achieve an 11% ROE in the Investment Bank in the first 9 months, 16% after the $667 million drag from the FIB wind-down, I don't think it's a bad improvement and a testament to the strategy and particularly compared to where we come to over the last year, Kian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a fair comment, I think on the &#x2013; clearly, the ROE is important and I see that and it makes a lot of sense. But clearly, when the question backs, if we have any update more between standardized and internal risk-weighted assets? And I was wondering if you have any more information to share from the last conference call, if there's been any progress on your side to look into this issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. I mean I think the whole industry is obviously watching the Basel review of model standardization and market risk across the industry. So I think once we actually &#x2013; as we see that develop, I think we'll probably have to give you more guidance as that comes through. Although frankly, given that both the EU and U.S. have kind of delayed that Basel III implementation, it does feels slightly confusing at the moment, but I think we'll obviously wait and see what the Basel Committee comes up in terms of the harmonization of model parameters and inputs once they actually get through it. But it's, as I &#x2013; my point really is that's somewhat being confused by the fact that in a large part of the world, are not in fact implementing Basel III on the 1 of January.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, hi. Good morning. So just on fixed income, I wanted to come back to the securitized products business, which seemed to suffer quite a lot last year, doing much better this year. But how you see the future of that on a kind of a three to five year lead? Clearly there is an element of search for yield and support from QE3 and so on and without necessarily a high level of generation of new securitized product, how you look at the future of that business?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Wealth Management outlook, I just wanted to ask you about the cross border outflows. How much we've seen so far cumulatively, and what the go-to level that you see in terms of the outflows once we're kind of over and done with on this issue? And also on the deposit margin pressures, we've clearly seen a fair amount over the last years. But how much further this would go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Okay, thanks. I mean on first one the securitized product business question. I mean we feel like we have an excellent business in that area. We think it's performed extremely well. It's a business that actually we see the improved performance from the fact that we're running the business differently. So, obviously QE3 and some of the yield elements do make it an attractive segment that we frankly don't think &#x2013; we're running very light inventories in that area as you know. So, we don't think frankly there was a lot of sort of rising with the tide. We think we've got actually a very good business that's basically been remodeled to be a very high returning business under Basel III.</p>
          <p>I think in general our view is that the future for that business is actually pretty bright. I mean obviously a lot of it is U.S. There's a lot &#x2013; there's a high percentage of U.S. content with the housing market sort of bottoming, improving from here. We think that gives, obviously, improving fundamentals and probably will give rise to additional volumes in that business as well.</p>
          <p>So, I think frankly, we're a leader in that business. We've actually got a great franchise there. And we think that the sort of macro influences on the business will probably be positive over time. And frankly, as and when others have to adapt Basel III to this business, this is probably one of the businesses that's most impacted by Basel III as I think probably, as many banks look at it, they may have difficulty in figuring out how to make the business model work under Basel III and they may well just exit, which will probably &#x2013; which, if that happened, obviously, that would have a positive impact on margins in that business. So we're pretty bullish about that business actually, medium term.</p>
          <p>On the Wealth Management outlook, and you talked about the cross border outflows. We have talked about the fact that the mature, particularly, European market net new asset flows have been &#x2013; have really been outflows, and I'm mean we've talked about it this quarter, but it's been that way actually for some time. I mean we've been seeing outflows in that business pretty consistently over some time. So I think year-to-date, we basically have seen about CHF 8 billion of outflows into the &#x2013; on the European, sort of Western European sort of mature markets region.</p>
          <p>So, it's been a continuing outflow. I mean I guess it's hard to say exactly how that will develop from here. I think our view is that we're getting closer hopefully, to an environment where we'll have agreements in place between Switzerland and other countries that will help to regularize the way that cross border business is done.</p>
          <p>We also do feel that since we have had fairly consistent outflow for a number &#x2013; for a long period of time, that it's obviously moving to a more stable state. And frankly, that fact that we've had as strong a net new asset inflow on an overall basis over the past three or four years and we've probably had more inflows than any other Private Bank, I think, is encouraging that, obviously, those outflows have been offset by inflows from emerging markets into the offshore platforms as well as the performance of our onshore platforms. So we feel pretty good about that.</p>
          <p>So I think it will probably continue but our belief is it will reduce over time and overall our &#x2013; the state of the business is healthy with good inflows over time.</p>
          <p>The last question on deposits. Do you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In term of deposits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we obviously have seen a decline in our net interest income in respect to the future low interest rates. I think, so far, as you can see, we've been relatively successful in actually protecting our overall net interest income by increasing the absolute amount of deposit volumes but also our lending. And part of that is associated with the ultra-high-net-worth business, which does tend to include more lending around it and for which I think we have basically seen some pricing power in terms of what we actually do.</p>
          <p>I think if we look forward, I don't think we've come to the end of that process, because I think you still have a flow through as various contracts actually drop through in terms of the interest rate you're actually going to receive. But nonetheless, as we continue to develop the ultra-high-net-worth business in particular, as well as our lending product, that should actually be reasonably successful in terms of offsetting it. But to be absolutely clear, it is definitely a balance. If we didn't have this roll-off from lower interest rates then clearly our net interest income would actually be going up.</p>
          <p>As you can see, it was &#x2013; it is actually up for the nine-month period but down quarter-on-quarter. But it definitely a drag in terms of the gross margin because as we grow the &#x2013; as we actually improve our assets under management, you're then being faced with expansion in lending but offset in terms of the actual interest rates the &#x2013; our net interest income from our overall deposits, we actually keep. So, I think a bit further to go, I'm afraid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. And can I just ask one more just on the LCR? If we did see a forbearance from the Basel Committee on the liquidity coverage ratio and you guys are meeting these very high standards that exist today, would you imagine that you'd be able to reduce your liquidity buffers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, as I think you may know, the Swiss regime actually, it's brought in a version of the LCR. Actually, I think it was back in 2010. So we've actually maintained liquidity buffers to actually meet that for the last couple of years. And they're not dissimilar in terms of how they actually work between the Basel rule and the Swiss rule. So I guess if the Basel Committee were to change their approach on this, then that would be probably something we would have a discussion with our regulators about.</p>
          <p>But as to whether we would see any benefit from that, I think unclear, given that the Swiss rule technically predates now the sort of Basel III implementation by a couple of years and there's precedent around it in terms of that. But it's certainly a discussion we could have I guess, but I'm not entirely optimistic.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Main two areas, the first was on the leverage ratio and the decision to reduce the assets by CHF 130 billion, I just wanted to ask, I think you said that wouldn't have a significant revenue impact. Could you walk us through why that would be? And if that's the case, then why haven't you potentially considered it previously?</p>
          <p>And then just in terms of how you were defining the capital, won't the leverage ratio under Basel III look at Basel III Core Tier 1 over time? I know it takes time to come in but won't it be looking more like CHF 33 billion, CHF 31 billion depending on the hybrid so it will be close to CHF 30 billion? I just wondered if you could comment on that.</p>
          <p>And then the secondary was just the gross margin in the Private Bank. I mean 107 [basis points] is obviously a low point. I mean what are you thinking that you can do to improve that? I know there's some seasonal factors as well. I mean how much of that is, do you think is seasonal? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So press it &#x2013; if I talk to the first couple of points. Well, I think you can see on slide 27, we have generally reduced the balance sheet over time. And that has become actually more than 100% from the Investment Bank because we've actually, as I mentioned before, increased our lending activity with ultra-high-net-worths at the Private Bank, if you look at the numbers. I didn't show them here but I think they are actually in our financial reporting.</p>
          <p>So it's not something we've not looked at before. It is probably fair to say though that a lot of our emphasis over the last year or so has been implementing the risk-weighting asset reductions ahead of the Basel III process that we actually talked about a year ago. And that's been where a lot of our emphasis has actually been.</p>
          <p>Now, I think therefore, I think myself, the finance team, treasury and also the team in the Investment Bank have only been looking somewhat closely over the last year or so in terms of what is &#x2013; what would a more optimized balance sheet look like for the Investment Bank. I mean I think you can see the repo disclosure in terms of our funding and capital position, so you can see that we have a relatively large repo business here in fixed income. It's not in the treasury section of this deck, but I mean I can tell you that the Prime Service business uses about CHF 210 million of balance sheet as well, which are all relatively large balance sheet users.</p>
          <p>I think, to be candid, what's become clear as we've actually gone through and looked not just at the return on equity &#x2013; sorry, the return on assets by business line but the return on assets by client, is that we could be rather more aligned between our more profitable major clients and their use of balance sheet. And there is actually a substantial scope to actually optimize that as we go forward, really essentially, therefore, duplicating what we've actually done within risk-weighted assets in terms of aligning that to our client usage as well.</p>
          <p>So I think there is significant potential there and we are going to do it. We're actually going to follow that. I wouldn't say, though, that it &#x2013; clearly this is just exclusively a repo and a Prime Service issue. I mean I think we would also be looking at essentially other balance sheet positions across the Investment Bank and we would expect to see quite substantial reductions coming from that from some very low return on asset positions that are actually there. So there is scope there.</p>
          <p>When we talk about this CHF 900 billion target, I think you should see this, this is where we've got to in this process, but not necessarily an end of the journey. So that puts it a little bit in context.</p>
          <p>And that's probably not a bad segue then to your second point really which is around the Basel III leverage ratio. I mean I think part of the problem, of course, is there's so many different leverage ratios. I mean, you may recall that there's also the Swiss 2008 leverage ratio around 5.2, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But as you say, over the course of the next few years, I guess the whole industry will transition through to the Basel III leverage ratio or variants of it. You may be aware that there's something called the Swiss SIFI or TBTF leverage ratio, which is a variance of Basel III, which has the same numerator, i.e., the asset, but it has a different denominator because it also includes CoCos. And then it's actually calibrated to a high level.</p>
          <p>But rather than going into that in detail, I think to be clear, the Basel III &#x2013; the big difference obviously in the Basel III leverage ratio is, as you say, the denominator is actually some variant of CET1 and it's a CET1 based denominator and the numerator in both the balance sheet you see here plus off-balance sheet and guarantees. And I think you may recall that the &#x2013; I think the Basel III leverage ratio was due to start required exposure I think from 2015 onwards when it enters the calibration phase. So, it's still several years out in terms of that, although the Swiss regime actually does include components of this more soon.</p>
          <p>So I think my point there is you're correct, but what we will also be doing in addition to looking to the absolute balance sheet you see here, the on-balance sheet assets, but also be looking to incorporating the off-balance sheet assets and guarantees which every bank has, essentially, as we actually go into that new phase. So that will also be a further target for this actually, Fiona.</p>
          <p>I'm not giving that target today. I think it's a little bit premature but we did want to basically give you an update on where we were in terms of our thinking of it as the on-balance sheet and the progress we're going to make there. But I think this is probably something you can expect just to talk more about over coming quarters actually.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the question was on the gross margin development. I mean, I think obviously, as you said, there clearly are some seasonal impacts and some of the timing on some of performance fees, et cetera. We've identified there's at least a couple of basis points in the second quarter that wasn't in the third quarter just from seasonal, pure seasonal impact, so probably some of that we would see, hopefully, come back in the fourth quarter, and &#x2013; but there are also some more what I would call cyclical effects that are impacting the business, obviously, interest rates, the low level of transactions, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, I think a lot of the cyclical effects, again, we believe that, over time, those we'll work back, we'll get to them. Someday we may have higher interest rates. Hopefully, we will get to more transactional volume.</p>
          <p>And also in the meantime, obviously, we're very focused on the net margin, because that's obviously what's most important to the bottom line. We are focused on the net margin. Some of the success in the ultra-high net-worth side has also probably impacted the gross margin and the ultra-high net-worth is a bit dilutive to the gross margin, but it is actually accretive to the net margin and so, overall, that's a sector that we're continuing to grow in.</p>
          <p>So, I think there are clearly some just quarterly volatility impacts but also, as you say, we're still &#x2013; we still are in a challenging environment for this business and I do think that when we get to &#x2013; when and if we get to conditions that are more normalized, we obviously will see higher gross margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I have two further questions please. The first one was on the Wealth Management net new money. To what extent is this still a dilutive impact from outflows from the Clariden Leu integration? And when might those finally roll off?</p>
          <p>And then the second question was just to ask Kian's question around variable compensation in the Investment Bank from another way. How should we think about how you manage that going forward? Do you have a particular target in mind for compensation cost to income ratio? And what number might that be? Or are you working more toward, say, an ROE target for the Investment Bank, out of which that ratio falls out? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the net new asset question, the Clariden Leu integration has actually been pretty much completed, and we think it's actually in &#x2013; it's in pretty good shape. So in the third quarter, we did not see any material impact in the Private Bank from outflows from the Clariden acquisition. So we think that's actually stabilized at this point. There are some seasonal impacts in the third quarter, particularly in Switzerland. Third quarter tends to be seasonally a bit of a more difficult quarter. You have &#x2013; you do have some outflows there, but we did have strong inflows in APAC, Eastern Europe and the Middle East as you know. But the Clariden Leu thing has basically pretty much settled down and I think is not an issue in terms of continuing outflows.</p>
          <p>David, do you want address the variable comp issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think, clearly the bottom line question is the ROE target, as you said, and that's primary at work towards. That said, I think clearly when we look at the comp accruals for the Investment Bank, we do very much look at an economic contribution basis, post-capital charge. And I think that's appropriate, because I think we do want to give our employees an incentive to align their RWA usage to what we see a need to achieve as group and as a bank.</p>
          <p>So I mean I personally think the pressure on comp is probably downwards across the industry. We'll see how that goes in the balance of this year in terms of that. I don't think I could give you an &#x2013; I mean I wouldn't want to give you an absolute comp to revenue target because that's not how we think about it. We do think it more on a comp to variable comp to economic contribution basis. But I think clearly, as we look towards how we make sure we hit our 15% ROE target, then the variable comp accrual is a very important part of that mathematics.</p>

          <p>And the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the Philipp Zieschang from UBS. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions if I may. What's your outlook in terms of risk-weighted assets but also total assets beyond 2013? You discussed that you would like to grow the rates business and should we expect actually, given that you capture several opportunities given your early strategic positioning for Basel III, should we expect group risk-weighted assets to grow from the CHF 280 billion beyond 2013 and also probably total assets to pick up again.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the 2013 and 12% Swiss Core Tier 1 ratio guidance of 12%, have you &#x2013; how have you worked in that CHF 1 billion additional realignment cost you're expecting for the period of 2013 to 2015?</p>
          <p>And finally, just coming back to that risk-weighted asset reduction near term of the CHF 20 billion, could you just give us a sense of what's the total asset reduction related to it? I understand that your balance sheet reduction is so far guided in low risk, risk-weighted asset areas or buckets but what's the associated balance sheet reduction coming with the CHF 20 billion? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think with regard to the risk-weighted assets and total assets beyond 2013, I think our &#x2013; we think that this is a sustainable level of risk-weighted assets and in order to run the business and run it on the basis of, and hopefully meeting, our 15% target return for the Investment Bank and for the group as a whole. So I don't think that we anticipate that there would be some ramp up, Philipp, in the RWA in out years, although, obviously, we will look to be dynamic about how we allocate the capital between businesses. But I think at an aggregate level, our expectation is that we would kind of probably keep it at similar levels.</p>
          <p>In terms of your last question since it's RWA related as well, the CHF 20 billion of risk-weighted asset reduction, obviously, as you say, it will have varying different, nominal balance sheet impacts if that's your question. I do &#x2013; the legacy for instance where we have about, I guess we have CHF 12 billion of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CHF 14 billion of RWA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CHF 14 billion of RWA, probably with a notional balance sheet that &#x2013; related to that is probably about twice that, roughly...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CHF 23 billion. So, you could see if we reduced &#x2013; of the &#x2013; if we managed to, which I don't think we will, but just hypothetically, if we managed to reduce all CHF 14 billion of the legacy RWA, that would come &#x2013; that would have an associated CHF 23 billion nominal balance sheet reduction with it. But it will be a mixture, because it's obviously not going be all legacy. In fact, you'd have to do more anyway to get to the CHF 20 billion reduction. So, there'll be, as you say, there'll be varying different sort of probably ratios between RWA and the nominal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you raised a further question then about the 12%, or approaching 12%, view basically for the Swiss core capital ratio at 2013. And the interaction with the CHF 1 billion of likely realignment costs over 2013, 2014, and 2015. I think point one essentially is you clearly would not expect all of that CHF 1 billion to be taken in 2013. I mean I think probably around half would be around likely, so that would be about CHF 500 million. If you look at that relative to the capital base, then you're probably thinking that's probably going to be something like sort of 10 to 20 basis point cost in terms of the capital ratio.</p>
          <p>If you actually do the calculation, your own calculation <mark type="ph" /> putting around this concession (01:22:23) you probably may get to a slightly higher number than 12%. That's why we said approaching 12%. So, we did in fact haircut that to allow for factors such as this and in the actual process, so that &#x2013; if that's helpful in terms of that.</p>
          <p>I would say generally, to the balance sheet point, just to reinforce what we said before, our efforts around balance sheet is clearly some work that we've been looking at particularly in the last year, and we will be extending that further over the course of next year or so and that will also include the off-balance sheet financing guarantees that I mentioned before. And I would clearly expect that to be coming down significantly as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we just come back to the medium-term risk-weighted asset growth point? I guess probably some consensus or investors would expect your Investment Banking revenues to grow, say, 5% per annum from 2013, 2014 onwards?</p>
          <p>So and if we follow your comment in terms of keeping risk-weighted assets stable and basically, the Investment Bank is the only area which really consumes additional capital, where would that efficiency come from? So why shouldn't it be reasonable to assume, say, 4%, 5% risk-weighted asset growth in the IB per annum given your growth ambitions in certain areas and given that you claim to have the run business very efficiently so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first most obvious thing is the wind-down businesses. I mean, that's obviously been &#x2013; that's been a 5% drag on the IB return on equity and obviously if that goes away, that in of itself is a fair uptick in revenues but &#x2013; go ahead, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean to be explicit on Brady's point, in order to hit the $180 billion RWA target, we are in that projection actually, assuming only about half of the wind-down business is actually used up in 2013. Now, clearly, we'd like to do better than that, but that's what we've assumed prudently.</p>
          <p>I think the second question is a little bit more conceptual and strategic and it really depends how does the rest of the industry actually evolve. Clearly, I think the market and banks have generally moved towards accepting the Basel III transition is coming, even though the regulatory timetable has actually slipped a bit. But what that's doing, of course, is actually changing the nature of our industry because, I think, the whole industry is moving towards more Basel III light type capital approaches. So I think that kind of convergence clearly is very helpful because it supports business practices which do not require the commitment of large amounts of capital.</p>
          <p>I guess, Philipp, if you saw the rest of the world basically abandoning Basel III, then I think that would cause a lot of stress at that point, and I think I would definitely concede that would be an important breakpoint in terms of the analysis.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if you see more convergence, then I think you move away from some of the more Basel III risk intensive businesses or practices we've seen in prior years</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean obviously, the linkage between RWA growth and revenue growth is &#x2013; I mean under the new model, under our model, it obviously &#x2013; it's not directly correlated. I mean, 9 months last year to 9 months this year, we reduced RWA 43%, and we increased our revenues pretty substantially in the fixed income business.</p>
          <p>So obviously I think our view is that we can continue to find ways to optimize and grow the business, even with discipline on the risk-weighted asset side, but that's obviously, that's the trick, that's the key to be able to do &#x2013; to operate successfully in the new environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think, there's also sort of certain, gritty basic reality here which is I think we have reduced the Investment Banking level with the target in that. Clearly, we do want to see growth in the Private Banking and that includes RWA around lending and that's fine.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions you'll be pleased to know. The first one is on Wealth Management. Obviously, you've been discussing the muted returns you're suffering because of the difficult markets. But given how far these have come down and not just for you but for the industry, can you perhaps comment on your targets, because you have some pretty ambitious targets and I wonder where the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:26:39) is thinking about the fact that getting up from where you are now, particularly the gross margin of 130 is going to be pretty difficult even in better markets. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is really around the leverage ratio following up on Fiona's question. I'm just wondering what the motivation is for you now focusing on this important metric. I, obviously, welcome it as I'm sure everybody else does. But I'm trying to get how much of this is good corporate governance but also perhaps talk about regulatory pressures that are building on you and the industry in terms of this important measure. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think with regard to the gross margin and our targets, I mean we've &#x2013; obviously, the gross margin's developed from sort of high points of the 130 sort of level as you say down to what I'd say is more of 110 type level. I think some of that has been structural. Some of that has been more cyclical. I think we do still believe that if the cyclical aspects of the business move back towards a more favorable environment, i.e., some higher interest rates, some higher transaction levels and obviously, it doesn't have to go back to where it was in the mid-2000s, but just some improvement in those levels.</p>
          <p>I think as we've said, we still believe that to have gross margin numbers around in the 120 area, whatever, is certainly very possible. And obviously, also there is a lot we can do about this. We increase our gross margins by increasing the amount of business we do with clients, the more cross-sell we can do, the higher margin we can create for the bank and obviously provide value-added services for the client.</p>
          <p>So, we can do a lot within that as well and we are focused on that. But it is, as you say, certainly what I would call the cyclical headwinds right now are pretty tough, but I think that those will turn at some point and obviously, at that point I think, we will get a movement in the gross margin back more towards where it was before.</p>
          <p>I think on the leverage ratio, and maybe David could comment as well, I mean I think it's just &#x2013; I mean you see it. I think it's a reality of market focus, regulatory focus, et cetera. I mean we obviously feel like we have an extremely high quality balance sheet. The asset side of our balance sheet, we think is probably the highest quality in the industry and therefore, we think that leverage should be less of a concern but I think both from a regulatory focus point of view as well as the market focus point of view, it's our view that obviously it will continue to be something that people do look at.</p>
          <p>And so we feel like we've obviously tackled a lot of the &#x2013; what we think are a lot of the toughest elements of transitioning to the new regime in terms of capital, et cetera, and we really have re-engineered the business. And I mean I think, to us, the most illustrative slide to that is the fixed income business going from &#x2013; or the Investment Banking business going from a 3% return in the 9months last year to 16% this year excluding the non-ongoing business. We think that represents a lot of progress on a lot of difficult issues that the industry is going to have to deal with.</p>
          <p>But frankly, running the business on a lower leverage basis is probably the right thing to do given the direction things are going but &#x2013; David, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean I just want &#x2013; a couple of supplementary points. I mean, we did actually on page 43 in the appendix. We didn't go through it in the main deck, again, we talked a little about leverage, included the adjusted assets basis, which I think a number of U.S. firms actually do as well. So that gives a measure, I think, of how much the kind of repo actually contributes to that and you can see it drops to about 17 times of that, 14 times within these changes or about 5.9% and 7.3%. So I think probably underlines various points about the actual low risk in the implicit balance sheet.</p>
          <p>That said, as I said I think before, I think one, whilst as not being specific, I think we can see the, I think, the direction of discussions around overall leverage ratio, which I think we all read. And I think, therefore, it is something we thought we should focus on.</p>
          <p>I think also probably as I said, I think in an answer to an earlier question, a lot of the work that we have done over last year, over the last two years has been very much focused actually on reducing the RWAs, the very intensive position within the Investment Bank and aligning the model against that. I think we feel it's probably appropriate now as we shift forward. Yes, we are going to take another $25 billion of risk-weighted assets out of the Investment Bank. But we are shifting I think to thinking what we can do to actually reduce our absolute balance sheet and particularly focus on low ROA assets in the balance sheet, because I think it seems appropriate and I think it affects the trend, and I think it's something which probably our shareholders I think will appreciate.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Swiss, Cantor, and retail banks are not using the IRB approach have higher capital requirements for Swiss mortgages and they are increasingly lobbying against this. Maybe you can provide us with an update on this and your view on this situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think that it's something that probably actually a risk officer could answer better. But I mean, yes, clearly there has been a debate in Switzerland around standing biz model approaches for mortgages. And at some discussion about how minimum capital requirements actually applying against that.</p>
          <p>I think you're aware it's been an ongoing debate here in Switzerland, there have been proposals. Although I think most recently, I think, and this obviously also relates to the sort of post-cyclical add-on, which would require for Swiss assets in that context. But I think actually, what I've seen most recently and my Swiss colleagues probably could correct me is that I think most &#x2013; some of those proposals have actually been dropped. I think mainly because I think the SNB is probably less concerned about the real estate situation here in Switzerland. So I think it's probably become less of an issue in the last couple of months than maybe it was six months ago when there were some discussions around it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I think there is &#x2013; there are issues around an unlevel playing field. Obviously, there are global issues around that. There's certainly issues around that here in Switzerland as well and I mean, obviously, we advocate for &#x2013; we'd like to get to a level playing field and we think that's probably the right thing for the financial system and so over time, that's obviously our hope is that we do get to a more level playing field.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. There's only one small question left. On your CHF 130 billion reduction of balance sheet, I presume that affects the prime brokerage business somewhat disproportionately. Can you sort of take us through how you think about maintaining the recent improvement to your positioning within prime brokerage, despite the impact from potentially lower balances to be providing to clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it doesn't affect disproportionately, to be candid, and that was one reason why we put in the pro forma reduction on adjusted asset basis on page 43, which is half the story in terms of repo. I do think that there's about CHF 32 billion we actually include in that. I think it's certainly clear that when we look at the repo business, we do see a variance, as I've said, between our main clients and how we actually allocate balance sheet and therefore, I think potential for us to actually align our balance sheet usage much more closely to those major clients.</p>
          <p>I think that is also true to the Prime Service business to a much lesser extent. So I think we will reduce the balance sheet in Prime Services but to a lesser extent. I'm not sure &#x2013; I don't think that it will impair the overall performance and profitability of our Prime Service business to any material degree, because I think what we've seen is, is many of our best clients are not that intensive balance sheet users and if anything, they could actually benefit from this approach. So I don't you're going to see anything in that. It's obviously a very good business for us and one which we continue to outperform in. But no, I don't think you're going to see any errors there.</p>
          <p>We will be looking really across the rest of the Investment Bank in terms of balance sheet usage and as I said, certainly the &#x2013; that what we've done already and identified a number of significantly low ROA users which we will obviously be eliminating.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a couple of questions on slide 39 in terms of the &#x2013; related to your CHF 20 billion reduction in RWAs. First of all, in the wind-down business, I think you said legacy assets lost CHF 136 million in the quarter and I was just trying to understand, given the move in yields we've had on both treasuries and mortgage assets, why you're still getting significant losses on the reduction there?</p>
          <p>And with regard to those wind-down assets, are those largely held to maturity accounted or fair value accounted now? That's the first part. I've got a couple of others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, why don't I &#x2013; sorry, it's David here. The CHF 136 billion you actually mentioned was actually in respect of certain significant litigation provisions primarily in respect of mortgage exposure, so not the FIB wind-down. The FIB wind-down number was actually CHF 100 million...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:36:29)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CHF 100 million basically or actually minus CHF 103 million to be exact in the third quarter. That was composed of about CHF 61 million of negative revenue and the balance, I guess CHF 42 million essentially was the actually expenses involved in actually running and maintaining that portfolio. Just to be clear then, to complete that picture for the year-to-date, we've had negative revenues on the FIB wind-down portfolio of just under $500 million and a negative PTI of $667 million which was on one of the slides. So about $500 million and then about $160-odd million of expenses to actually run that in terms of the numbers.</p>
          <p>I guess your next question is why have you seen those markdowns? Apparently I think the truth is that given we've actually reduced the RWA in the FIB wind-down the position size is from 54 to 14, if we are down to a collection of assets which don't really have much correlation to the overall macro environment and residual European CMBS positions, some residual power trades, they're not really correlated to those markets. So we have not seen any particular benefit of any materiality from the, I guess, the improvement to a slightly more favorable rate environment in terms of that. And they're very specific positions. And that just reflects the fact we're towards the end of the book we're actually working from. The majority of those are in fact fair value mark actually to be &#x2013; just to be clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And so given that the RWAs didn't change in the quarter, how much did you actually sell to &#x2013; how much was the sort of the notional sale to generate the CHF 61 million loss, revenue loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of it will be marked substantially, most of it marks, not as opposed to sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just marks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, mark. I mean I think obviously, we've made a lot of progress. Earlier in the year we made less in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I, in an answer to a previous question, the target really for the next 15 months is to basically reduce that by about half. The target is to get rid all of it, let's be honest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But our projection is about half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then the CHF 20 billion as a whole obviously, you said about half of the wind-down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's going to happen with the &#x2013; related to an earlier question on the securitized products, you said that's one of the toughest under the Basel III regime. I was just wondering how much of &#x2013; how much is that going to &#x2013; of the CHF 20 billion is going to be out of that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because that's quite a large amount of your fixed income risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I'm going to show you &#x2013; necessarily give a specific target by target on page 39. And you can see that securitized products have come down from $73 billion to about $37 billion. I think there's probably a few billion that will contribute toward that CHF 25 billion, but I'm not sure I'd expect to see a radical change given that we've halved the amount of risk-weighted assets in that business already. So, I think we'll be looking elsewhere across the portfolio with, as I said, the single larger FIB wind-down and then it will be more small chops in other areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And including just for &#x2013; I mean clearly by this for the record, this is obviously just on page 39, the fixed income...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...RWA. I would &#x2013; this is &#x2013; the CHF 25 billion will not come entirely from the fixed income RWA. It will also come from some of our corporate lending books in the Investment Bank and we'll also revise some of our exposure in the equities portfolio as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you've seen an increase in RWA for CCP, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you move to Basel III, so given that we're sort of in the last stages of mitigation here, where would you rank the securitized products in terms of ROE on a sort of normalized basis? Out of those products that you're listing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's been &#x2013; I mean I think, we've &#x2013; and before it's been a relatively successful business for us for a number of years, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And will it be your most profitable business by ROE or your second best?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's not. I mean, it certainly more than covers its cost of capital on any basis even on a full Basel III basis as we show here in terms of that. It certainly more than covers those costs, but clearly, we can find very high ROE businesses in balance sheet-light business in &#x2013; sorry in RWA-light businesses. But it's certainly more than covered its cost of capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just quickly, just another issue on the &#x2013; so I was confused on the numbers on the mortgage litigation. On &#x2013; can you say what the outstanding claims are on the mortgage rep and warranty and what reserve there is there? I know it will come out in the other report but I don't know if you can say now what that is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hang on a minute. I &#x2013; yeah, it's the split reporting, so you'll see it in the second phase. I don't have the number to hand actually but &#x2013; so you'll see, you'll probably get it in about a week or so's time I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's just we've seen a bit of a rise in the U.S. numbers from the third party.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you will see a small increase. For us to see that, that's what, probably what you'd expect given the news flow over the last few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Lim from Esp&#xED;rito Santo. Please ask you question.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just coming back to the Basel III leverage ratio, I was just wondering if you could tell us what the off-balance sheet assets and guarantees are. And then just provide a bit more color about the nature of these off-balance sheet assets. And perhaps to what extent they could be wound down, over what time period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've given that number. I mean I think &#x2013; I'm not sure any bank has actually given their Basel III leverage ratio as yet. But I mean it is &#x2013; as a bank, we've not generally been &#x2013; we don't generally issue much in the way of guarantees so it's nice. But there are obviously a number of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:42:09) SPVs which are not consolidated which will be affected by that. It's quite a wide range of assets actually.</p>
          <p>As I said, I think this is something we'll probably be coming back to in subsequent quarters as we move towards the Basel III leverage ratio issue. But I don't think everyone to have to disclose at the moment. I think, as I said, the emphasis of the work we've been doing around balance sheet has being very much actually on the on-balance sheet component and we've now been shifting more as we go through the first phase of that. So actually, what we need to do to reduce the off-balance sheet, it's nothing extraordinary but, I think, it's something that we want to do some more work around.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I &#x2013; not as yet, no. I mean I think &#x2013; I don't think any bank has given their B3 number yet, but it's something, as I said, we'll come back to you on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Dougan. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks very much, everybody, appreciate all the questions. I think just in summary, I think we have continued to prove the strength of our business model. We had good, solid and consistent third quarter results and I think we've continued to maintain good momentum with our clients in an environment which continues to be somewhat challenging.</p>
          <p>So we believe we have shown successful implementation of the capital actions that we announced in July. We've substantially enhanced the capital position and we are, as we said, confident that we'll achieve a look-through Swiss core capital ratio of around 9.3% by year-end, again, subject to timing in terms of the closings of the sales in Asset Management.</p>
          <p>But to date, we have successfully delivered on all of our announced strategic and cost cutting targets and through the incremental targets announced today, we'll continue to improve costs, capital efficiency and leverage. I think with these actions, we are confident we'll receive a 10 &#x2013; we'll actually reach the 10% look-through capital ratio in 2013. And as we've said, we'll then be in a position to make additional cash distribution to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So, in short, we're convinced that the stable, high quality earnings streams to our business, combined with the execution of our strategic capital and cost-saving measures, will continue to create a very strong and competitive global platform to serve our clients, gain further market share and deliver superior returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you all very much.</p>
