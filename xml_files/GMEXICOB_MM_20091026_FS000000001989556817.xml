        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Grupo M&#xE9;xico's Third Quarter Earnings conference call. I am joined in this conference by Enrique Nava, CFO of Ferromex-Ferrosur; Genaro Guerrero, CFO of Southern Copper; Jorge Pulido, our Head of Investor Relations; and other executives of the company.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call, I will briefly comment on the environment of this quarter and the main issues impacting the company's profitability. Then, I will comment on our mining division's most relevant results, to then pass on the call to Enrique, who will add to the financial results of the transportation division, to finally give you a quick update on Asarco.</p>
          <p>During this quarter, the LME copper average price was $2.66 per pound, 24% lower than the same quarter in 2008 but 25% higher quarter-over-quarter. For the third quarter in a row, most commodities continued this price recovery trend which started at the beginning of the year. Including increases in average prices of 59% in moly, 19% in zinc and 7% in silver &#x2013; this is on a quarter-over-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Although we saw more differentiated performance across metals and other commodities more in line with each specific fundamental story. Copper's appreciation continued strong until the end of July on the back of strong Chinese buying but then leveled off and spent most of August and September trading between 2.70 and 2.95. We believe this was the result of cyclical reduced Chinese buying and somewhat dormant U.S. and Europe demand.</p>
          <p>The positive news was that copper held in range through these seasonally low periods and is now in solid shape to continue its upward trend. Although probably at the more modest pace. China's consumption will pick up later in the year we estimate, and we estimate that U.S. and Europe restocking will begin early next year.</p>
          <p>With respect to moly, we saw its price skyrocket during the beginning of third quarter from 10.60 to $18, only to see that just down significantly at the finish of the quarter at 13.50. This unusual spike and correction was probably originated by speculative catch-up to the application seen in other metals at that time. And a very sharp correction &#x2013; as things gravitated, there were more product-specific fundamentals.</p>
          <p>In addition to price increases, we are proud to report that Southern Copper's mined, melted and refined copper increased 1.3%, 8.3% and 5.6%, respectively. Also, Southern Copper increased its molybdenum production by 14.3%.</p>
          <p>Our mining division continues to reduce its cash cost below our budget, passing from $0.51 per pound of copper in the second quarter '09 to $0.274 in this quarter. This improvement is the result of the mentioned increased productivity and operating efficiencies, but also we have the benefit of increases of prices in our by-products. Even as copper price improves, the company will continue our effort and reduce costs, improve productivity, and maintain consumption and expense discipline with the objective of strengthening our position as one of the world's leading low-cost producers.</p>
          <p>In our transportation division, despite adverse economic conditions, Ferromex increased cargo transportation with various of its key customers. Unit trains carrying iron ore increased 9% in the first nine months. Also, peso revenues increased 25% and 21% for Crown Imports and Comisi&#xF3;n Federal de Electricidad, respectively.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we saw an important pickup in the automotive segments due to a restart in the plants of Chrysler and General Motors. The investment of $90 million in this division was mainly allocated to improving track, railroad conditions, and safety assistance.</p>
          <p>Now turning real quick to the financial highlights of Grupo. In the <mark type="inaudible" /> market environment, we are happy to report that in the third quarter our total consolidated revenue was a little south of 1.4 billion, a decrease of 20% year-over-year but 32% higher than the second quarter '09. The year's accumulated net sales reached 3.3 billion compared to 5.2 billion, a decrease of 37% year-over-year. This reduction is mainly attributable to lower metal prices and a drop of revenues in dollar terms in the railroad business, which Enrique will explain in more details.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales for the third quarter was 694 million, a decrease of 18% year-over-year and 19% higher in the second quarter '09. Cost of sales in the first nine months of 2009 was 1.8 billion, a decrease of 21% year-over-year. Accumulated cost reduction of 465 million is mainly explained by lower prices in several of our key inputs. Fuel cost decreased 23%; Electricity, 40%; and spare parts and maintenance decreased 14%. EBITDA in the third quarter was 688 million with an EBITDA margin of 49%. This figure represents a decrease of 21% year-over-year. However, it is a significant improvement of 55% over the second quarter '09.</p>
          <p>The year's accumulated EBITDA reached 1.4 billion, compared to 2.8 billion in 2008. Net income in the third quarter was 286 million, a decrease of 60% year-over-year but an increase of 20% quarter-over-quarter. Net income for the first nine months of 2009 was 543 million, a decrease of 57% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter '09, the total capital expenditures amounted 139 million, of which 118 was spent in the mining division and 21 in the transportation division. The mining investments were mainly related to the construction of our T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a SX/EW projects in Peru that will produce 120,000 tons of copper per year by 2011. We also carried on with the capacity expansion of our Toquepala mine.</p>
          <p>In the transportation division, investments were made for the modification and replacements of various tracks and to improve operating safety, as I mentioned. The total consolidated debt at the end of September was a little south of 1.7 billion, with a cash balance of 1.7 billion, which results in a negative net debt of 40 million.</p>
          <p>Grupo M&#xE9;xico maintains a low debt level and healthy, long-term debt amortization schedule. The first significant amortization is 200 million, due in 2015. Between 2009 and 2014, average debt amortization will be $83 million per year. This of course excludes the financing that we will have to put in place for the reacquisition of Ferrosur. This cash position will support our operation on needs and our capital expenditures program.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends &#x2013; on August 19, we paid our second quarter stock dividend of one share per every 75 biddable Mexico shares outstanding. It was roughly equivalent to 150 million. For the third quarter '09, the company Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend payment of 17 peso cents per share outstanding. That will be paid in cash on November 25 at current share prices represents approximately 100 million.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the main development of Southern Copper and will try to keep it brief as Southern Copper had its conference call Friday. In the third quarter, Southern Copper's net sales were nearly 1.2 billion compared to 1.4 billion for the third quarter '08 and 825 million for the second quarter '09. Cost of sales was 530 million, a reduction of 18% year-over-year but 26% higher quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>EBITDA was 592 million with a negative margin of 51%. Net income was 312 million for the quarter, 79% higher quarter-over-quarter. Southern Copper's operations have been performing soundly, as I briefly commented, and all units have a yearly production budget. This quarter copper production was 120,000 metric tons, 1% higher than the third quarter '08.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that all Southern Copper operating units have increased their production as I said. Both La Caridad and our underground copper production increased 4%. Approving operations of Arequipa increased copper production by 9%. Mine production increased 14%. Sink mine production and refine sink production increased 4%. And with this I conclude the outline of Southern Copper and Grupo.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call to Enrique Nava, who will discuss the financial highlights of our transportation division. Enrique?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. I will now comment on the main results of the third quarter '09 of the transportation division, represented by the subsidiary interest to the Infraestructura y Transportes M&#xE9;xico, ITM, whose main subsidiaries are Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, GFM, owner of Ferromex and Ferrocarril.</p>
          <p>Low volumes transported during the third quarter of this year measure in net tons-kilometer amounted to 10.04 billion and compares to 10.72 billion of the third quarter of 2008. This a year-over-year decrease of 6% as a result of DSO bound in the industrial activity Mexico and reduced international trade with the United States.</p>
          <p>Low volumes for the first nine months reached 28.89 billion, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. For a whole year of 2009, we continuously made low volumes of 38.14 billion net ton-kilometers, which will represent our 5.1 decrease over last year's figure.</p>
          <p>Third quarter 2009, net sales amounted to 238 million &#x2013; a 20% annual decrease. Net sales for the first nine months reached 668 million, a 19% annual decrease, mainly due to lower load volumes and the impact of the Mexico peso depreciation on sales denominated in pesos. However, net sales increased 2% over second quarter '09.</p>
          <p>The cost of sales was 159 million in the third quarter, a 19% decrease on yearly basis. The cost of sales for the first nine months reached 449 million, a 14% annual reduction including a reduction due to exchange variance for 133 million favorable. Main increases in cost were labor due to salary increase of about 5 million, diesel increase due to a 28% increase in the price per liter, net of an improvement in the ratio of diesel use per ton-kilometer for a net of 26 million.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of the above, operating income was 48 million in third quarter '09, a 27% decrease year-over-year, representing an operating margin of 20%. EBITDA during the third quarter of 2009 was nearly 66 million, a 29% decrease year-over-year and was equivalent to 28% of net sales. EBITDA for the first nine months reached a 193 million, a 31% decrease year-over-year and was equivalent to 29% of net sales.</p>
          <p>The net income during the third quarter of 2009 reached 28 million compared with 41 million, 31% lower year-over-year. Net income for the first nine months reached 88 million, 32% lower than a year ago. Total capital expenditures for the first nine months amounted to 77 million compared with nearly 116 million, a fall of 34% year-over-year as no new locomotives had been required during 2009.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, CAPEX spending has been mainly for the rehabilitation of raised tracks, enlargement and new sidings and the acquisition of railroad machinery, which have improved operating safety and produced savings in the sale consumption.</p>
          <p>For the year 2009, we continue to estimate capital expenditures of around 100 million, 43% lower than the 2008 figure.</p>
          <p>Ferromex, talking about CAPEX, Ferromex decided to install a new dispatch centre in Torre&#xF3;n to centralize frame control and dispatch processes in the northern area with an investment of about 32 million pesos. Ferromex has started with 12 regional dispatch centers and now it has only two, one in Guadalajara and the other one in Torre&#xF3;n for all of the northern area.</p>
          <p>Due to the strategic location as a receiving and distribution center for freight, leasing the border points, ports, and the central region of the country, the facilities of Torre&#xF3;n terminal are fundamental to the operations of Ferromex.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly discuss the results of our other important subsidiary, Ferrosur, which currently does not consolidate into ITM.</p>
          <p>In third quarter 2009, Ferrosur's total revenues were nearly 58 million, a decrease of 17% on annual basis. This decrease is mainly attributable to the negative impact of the peso currency devaluation in peso-denominated sales, despite the fact that load volumes transported were 4% lower in this period, measured in net tons-kilometer for a total of 1.73 billion.</p>
          <p>The cost of sales was 40 million in the third quarter, a 15% decrease on yearly basis. The cost of sales for the nine months reached 150 million, a reduction of 12%.</p>
          <p>Ferrosur's operating income was 10 million in the third quarter '09, an increase of 15% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>EBITDA during the third quarter of 2009 was 14 million, an 18% decrease year-over-year and was equivalent to 25% of net sales. EBITDA for the first nine months reached 44 million, an 18% decrease year-over-year and was equivalent to 27% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Net income during the third quarter '09 was 5 million, a 4% decrease year-over-year. Total capital expenditures for the first nine months amounted to nearly 30 million compared with 18 million, a drop of 28% year-over-year. For 2009, we estimate capital expenditures to be 22.6 million, representing an 18% annual decrease.</p>
          <p>As you are aware of, on January 30, 2009, the Comisi&#xF3;n Federal de Competencia, that is the Federal Competition Bureau, issued its resolution to GMexico, ITM, and some of its subsidiaries, stating that these companies were responsible of monopolistic practices and imposed fines related to the concentration of Ferrosur amounting to about 19 million. On June 9, 2009, the Commission confirmed its resolution and the fines imposed. We believe this ruling to be unlawful, so we are challenging it before the courts.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call to Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Enrique. To conclude, I'll give you an update on the Asarco situation. As all of you probably know, on August 31, Judge Schmidt of the bankruptcy court recommended the approval of the reorg plan of our subsidiary, America's Mining Corporation. He found our plant was superior to the ones submitted by Sterlite. The case has now been remitted to the district court Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville for his final decision.</p>
          <p>On confirming the plan, control of Asarco will return to AMC and AMC will simultaneously be released from any liability or contingency. It's also remitting the release of the guarantees that we have posted. Judge Hanen held a hearing on October 19 to hear the objections of the union, Asarco and State of Arizona. Judge Hanen expressed that his decision will independent of any negotiation between the union and AMC.</p>
          <p>Grupo M&#xE9;xico is confident that the recommendation of judgment issued through two consecutive decisions will be confirmed as it appears too low and was issued after exhaustive review on the facts and evidences presented.</p>
          <p>The judge is expected to issue his decision before December 1. Our offer consists of a cash contribution from AMC of 2.2 billion of which 1.3 &#x2013; between 1.3 and 1.5 &#x2013; came from the bank financing and Grupo M&#xE9;xico will contribute the remainder in cash.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the plan will use an estimated 1.4 billion in cash from Asarco of the cash in hand under Asarco level, plus the issue of the one-year note for 280 million. Also, 161 million in Asarco tax obligations will be forgiven and tax refund will be granted for &#x2013; at the benefit of creditors &#x2013; that was for $60 million.</p>
          <p>For all these reasons, we are optimistic and feel strongly about our possibilities of recovering Asarco and eliminating the contingency related to the Southern Copper stock trend.</p>
          <p>With the recovery of Asarco, Grupo M&#xE9;xico will incorporate approximately 200,000 tons to its annual copper production to become the world leader in reserves and one of the world's largest copper producers.</p>
          <p>With this, we conclude our remarks for this quarter and we'll like to open the forum for questions and answers. Operator, you like to open the forum, please?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question come from the line of Felipe Hirai with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions related to Asarco. The first one, Daniel if you could, just quantify to us what could be the worst outcome if the Judge Hanen decides to grant Asarco &#x2013; to refuse your reorganization plan and to chose Sterlite or Asarco's reorganization plan, what could happen to the fraud and compliance liabilities? So this is my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Felipe. Well, first it's very important to know it's very confusing because there are two judges interactive here. Judge Schmidt, as you said, who is the judge that was in charge of the bankruptcy case, he two time has conformed that our plan is the most favorable and a better plan, Felipe. So we feel that it'll be very, very unlikely that Judge Hanen will, after a couple of decisions that worked out in our favor to turn it against. But, in the remote case that that happens the case will go back to Judge Schmidt for reanalyzing, Felipe. Now that will happen if Judge Hanen decides not &#x2013; thinks differently than what Judge Schmidt believes and has stated in a couple of occasions in the recommendation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the other hand, what if you &#x2013; if your reorganization plan gets chosen could you just explain to us how you're going to receive these tax benefits of $800 million and also how could be this litigation against Sterlite for this $2.6 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely, Felipe. Well, the $800 million is just an estimate out there, depends on the final numbers once we make the final payment to creditors and to the liquidation costs et cetera. But that is a rough number that you can have in mind and this happens because Asarco at the end is a subsidiary and the current leaders of America's Mining Corporation. And Asarco will be tailing our creditors for the liabilities it has and that's adaptable. That creates net operating losses, which can be carried back and forward. That is the rationale.</p>
          <p>Regarding the lawsuit against Sterlite, we have commented and made press releases about the possibility that we could file a lawsuit against Sterlite for the breach of acid purchase agreement of $2.6 billion that they executed with Asarco. So that is the logic there. And we had a team of lawyers analyzing the likelihood and the possible outcomes, we believe that that might be a course of action the company will take once a successful one had recalled Asarco out of chapter 11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Felipe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning Daniel, Jorge Beristain. Just again following up on the question of a worst-case scenario coming out of Hanen's court. I think you also made some fairly pointed statements to the effect of actually even calling in the union representatives to hear their version of events. And could there be some possible outcome where it's a split decision in which he perhaps upholds some of the monetary penalties and ultimately does return this back to Schmidt's court for further determinations, because it seems on the face of his initial statements that he is definitely looking at this case in much more detail and not simply signing off on Schmidt's earlier recommendation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Jorge. Well, first of all, it's important to remember just one fact but it's very important to bear in mind when we talk about worst-case scenarios. Sterlite filed an amended plan where they said the worst-case scenario will be to have a claim against Grupo for $900 million. You remember that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That put an important cap on the liabilities that we are currently discussing or estimating. Judge Schmidt has lot of flexibility. He is the judge which issued the decision in August 2007 and '08, I apologize. But we feel that given the arguments the case presented and the findings of fact are the important differentiation, I'll say, between our plan and being the equity holders, that is that he will sign off if you will, as you just put it. He will confirm the recommendation of Judge Schmidt. What he could, he could do a lot of things, I guess, but typically he will go back to the Judge Schmidt, if he doesn't agree with the findings of patent law.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And in terms of the capping on Sterlite's claim which was Davil and Teardatt but that was not contingent upon them &#x2013; their plan being ruled for the Asarco restructuring. So, in another words, regardless of if they win or lose, that 900 million in now a cap, you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So to speak, yes. If we win there is no liability at all, as you know. If we will lose would they put a cap on their plan and that --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If they put a cap on their plan, I would assume subject to them winning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. If we win, there's no cap, there's no need for a cap because there would not be any liabilities, whatsoever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm saying subject to Sterlite's plan being recommended, it seemed to me like their willingness to cap your potential liability was subject to their plan being approved as their plan may not be approved. So if their plan is approved, in a way if Hanen rejects Schmidt's findings, is there some possible outcome where this sort of removes the former cap, if you will. I guess not, I guess you're saying either way it's a cap.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is exactly what we're saying and, yes, absolutely, there is contingent -- you're right, it's contingent of them winning. That is an important cap. Once they file on this plan, there is an important cap for us. You're right.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the other question is on your dividend policy. We noticed that you reactivated a cash dividend at the Grupo M&#xE9;xico level this quarter. And again, you're not quite fully paying out the effective dividends that you received from Southern Copper. And would there be any potential change in dividend policy at Grupo M&#xE9;xico in the event that your plan was confirmed by Hanen, you do take over Asarco, you're going to have a lot of new holding company level debt at Grupo M&#xE9;xico. Would this change perhaps your dividend policy, where you may want to retain more and more of Southern Copper's dividend as a way to fund that interest service?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your question. To the benefit of everybody, we do not have a dividend policy as you most of you know and neither at Grupo M&#xE9;xico nor at Southern Copper. Well, we've tried, or both boards have tried, to duly maintain a dividend track record rather than a dividend policy. And I think that that has been achieved. If you're referring to a pass-through to all the shareholders at Grupo M&#xE9;xico level &#x2013; this was an important pass-through. The beginning of Southern Copper was 123 million that Grupo M&#xE9;xico will receive and they're paying out 100 million in cash again. You're right. So after several quarters paying out dividends in shares, we are back with, the board has decided to go back to dividend in cash.</p>
          <p>Absolutely, we are going to have an important amount of that but it's important depending on the copper prices and the cash flows we generate. We would anticipate, or would believe, that the dividend policy should be maintained or dividend track record, I should say, maintained, Jorge.</p>
          <p>Also, as you know, there are projects at the Grupo level that we have been exploring. We've commented on the Manzanillo project for example, we've commented on several infrastructure projects that the cash might be needed there. I don't know if that that answers your question.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to ask about FACO. Have you pursued any further conversations or negotiations with the union?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge we -- I'm sorry, Carlos. Como estas? Well, I guess the company has entered into several negotiations, discussions, not only with the union, but with all the parties interested here that is a continuing process that this case has required. Whether there is something that we can report now at this moment, the answer would be no, Carlos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, there is an open dialogue with the union, right? Because, correct me if I am wrong, but if you were to reach an agreement with the union and hence the union supporting your plan, that would be very complicated for Judge Hanen to not support your plan, am I correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, he says he will look at it independently, that's what he said on 19 October. However, also for the benefit of everyone, I'm sure you know, but we have extended the collective bargaining agreement for the union one more year, and that was in the same spirit to show good faith and to show that we are here to patch things up and start from the -- with the right foot. And then, we obviously depend on the employees of Asarco to run the company smoothly. So, I guess that's what I can tell at this point, Carlos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then, you mentioned the CAPEX for Ferromex, could you confirm the number, because I didn't get it clearly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are still planning &#x2013; hi, Carlos, this is Enrique Nava &#x2013; we are still planning 100 million for the whole of 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Enrique. And then my final question is on the mining division. I understand the guidance for 2009 sales, copper sales is about 500,000 tons. What about the production? Do you have a number and estimated production number for the year? And really what I am after is trying to understand how much volumes would you sell that are not produced or that is not mined copper and hence we need to factor in the purchase of concentrate into our numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me pass on, you're right on the guidance. Let me pass on this question to Genaro Guerrero who is here with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Well, about the production for the year, our guidance would be 480,000 tons of copper and a part of the 500,000 tons of copper that we are giving you as a guidance for 2009, 20,000 of those volumes is copper that we are purchasing from third parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So and basically that's the difference you have reported already from January to September. So in the fourth quarter, your production or your sales should be pretty much in line with your production, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. That is correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Genaro.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Alex Terentiew with Scotia Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you for taking my call. Couple of questions for you on Asarco and my apologies for going back to Asarco again here, but there's a few unresolved things. The first question is with the $800 million tax benefit that you may get. Can you elaborate a bit on &#x2013; if you do get Asarco back, when would you get that money?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Alex. Well, first of all, you can carry it back and you can carry it forward. As you know America's Mining <mark type="inaudible" />. Asarco LLC is a <mark type="inaudible" /> entity tax wise. So American AMC is the party responsible for paying the taxes of Asarco. So we are going to take back that for two years that we have net operating losses that we can offset and then take that forward. How do you amortize, if you will, these losses? It is a fact of asking for refunds actually, compensating and mashing up some of the taxes that we have not paid yet, mainly because this huge net operating loss was going to be produced once we pay to the creditors and second with income in the years going forward. That is the answer. And this could go all way to $1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And my next question is again with that $900 million liability cap somebody was mentioning earlier with regards to Sterlite. The way I understood that was that if Grupo M&#xE9;xico cedes going for Asarco and in that case basically Sterlite would be only party remaining. This would be prior to Judge Hanen's final ruling. In that case, Sterlite is willing to limit Grupo M&#xE9;xico's liability to 900 million. But, if Grupo M&#xE9;xico does not then &#x2013; and in such a case the judge rewards Sterlite with Asarco &#x2013; I am just a bit confused as to why Sterlite would still limit your liabilities to 900 million. I'm not sure or maybe I'm not understanding it correctly, but I would think that in such a case, if they didn't have an agreement with Grupo M&#xE9;xico ahead for time, why they would not go after the maximum amount that they could?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Alex. Thank you again. Yes, I am glad that you asked this to clarify. First thing to have very clear is that if our plan is confirmed there are no liability of 900 million, nor any other liability for Grupo M&#xE9;xico.</p>
          <p>Second, that was the way that Sterlite, and this is presented in amendment to their plan, once they had heard the consideration of the court, given benefit or given the reason or -- I guess I should say given more weight to the equity holders. I mean, if we are the equity holders and we are paying 100 cents, a dollar, if you will, give and take, to creditors, we should not be deprived of the right to retain the company. So this is the way they presented an enhancement to the plan in order to tell the judge that they were &#x2013; there was an important windfall for a third party purchaser and this is the way they enhance their plan in order to convince I guess the court that they could have a better plan and that the equity holders will be also treated fairly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In such a case sense, say that Asarco does go to Sterlite, would you retain the 260 million in Southern Copper &#x2013; so what would happen to those shares then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it needs to be resent to the Bank of Dakota as I just said for further analysis and I doubt I'm allowed to speculate at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what is important to take out of this conference call is that we feel very strongly about being confirmed before December 1. And that is the case &#x2013; that is what we're working on. That is all the work we've been putting now in terms of transition, et cetera. And I guess it's not just wishful thinking, if you will, we've already have two confirmations from the Judge Schmidt in our favor.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of quick questions. In the previous conference call, you said that you were estimating something around $1.7 billion in EBITDA 2009. This figure is still in your budget or you are seeing something different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Rodrigo. Yes, there was guidance we had at the beginning of the year and we probably confirmed that -- or mentioned that as well in the last conference call as you just pointed out. I mean fortunately as you can see from our report, prices have been much higher than we anticipated. Cost has been lower and also having to do with the by-product credit. So we anticipate it could be around $2 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And regarding Ferromex also you were expecting something around 240 and 250 million of EBITDA for this year. Is this still difficult?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Rodrigo, the number still holds 90, a little bit higher than that, 255 more or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And regarding volumes sales in Ferromex, you're still waiting on a reduction of 5.1%</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding Tanen, I wonder why are you expecting final decision or headed back before this, the year-end, I mean what change or what do you feel about this issue that gives you the idea that you can have it back before the year-end or -- I don't know, more color on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me go through it real quick on that, Rodrigo. I didn't get into that details because we have the conference call Friday and we had the General Counsel of Southern Copper here explaining the situation. But I'll just mention that we've been experiencing some delays of this High Court, which is a three-panel judge court. One of the judges is <mark type="inaudible" /> with the case. That judge unfortunately retired and we have a new judge. It is something &#x2013; someone new to that position or someone new to that court, and they are examining the court.</p>
          <p>There is an important backlog of cases they have at that court. And as well, we feel very strongly that the decision of the labor board and the Ministry of Labor that certifies the administration of labor that the damages amounted to force majeure and because of that, the labor, the collective labor relations have been terminated as well as the individual labor relations. We feel that that's going to be confirmed. Unfortunately, we have been taking delays from the courts and the judicial system in Mexico. We have picked out a session to definitely be issued this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And let's suppose that you get Asarco back in around December. Could be it possible that you consolidate the financial results for Asarco in the first quarter of the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We'll be consolidated only for that month in your example. Currently we would all consolidate Asarco probably after the emergence of Chapter 11, we will consolidate Asarco, and it is depending on when. We will cover Asarco and we'll consolidate it from then on. If it's just till December, we'll just consolidate December and that is just one month, but that is the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, okay. Now my doubt there was if one month is enough for you to consolidate the results for the first quarter of 2010 and your answer is, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And my last one. Some weeks ago you held a <mark type="inaudible" /> referendum among the people that are living near T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project and the answer was pretty much, no. Could you give us more color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're referring to the water issues at T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a, correct?</p>

          <p>Let me pass the call to &#x2013; Hermaro Ramero</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We made a statement during our conference call, last Friday, but, I can refresh a little bit what is happening there. Of course, there's people in very close surrounding the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a project area, there are concerns about the uses of the water that we have, of the resources of water that we have for the project. We have been explaining them what is the situation and we have been talking and discussing these issues with the authorities. I would say that that is very valid the concerns, but we are not seeing any problem in that respect. We have had a lot of analysis and lot of evaluation in conjunction with our policies and we are not expecting to have an issue in order to go ahead with a project in that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one more if we will. Regarding the dividend and geometrical declare, I want to know the rationale of this because certainly you will need any money that you have if you get Asarco back. Why did you change the policy between stock dividend and now all cash dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well, first of all, yes, absolutely we think we can have that. We have knocked back, last year we acquired &#x2013; we had a lot of shares, Grupo M&#xE9;xico shares, in the stock options crossed, that they were in excess of what we were anticipating to assigned to employees in our stock options plans. So we decided to give in dividends those shares back to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now those shares are at the right level, we believe, <mark type="inaudible" /> reports for the employees and then that is the ratio not giving away any shares, we have not &#x2013; we also, we don't have any shares in our treasury at this moment. So that is the rationale. The rationale for the dividends is, as I pointed out, is having a track record of dividends at both levels and the Board every quarter sits down analyze the CAPEX, the cash flows and the size of the dividend.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I just have two questions. First one is regarding transport. I know it's bit early yet, but do you have any projections on the possible increases in transport now that <mark type="inaudible" /> of Commission F&#xE9;d&#xE9;rale <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>And the second one would be going back to Cananea, I don't know if you have any estimate or any projections on once the decision is made by the judge, how much time will it take to reopen Cananea? And those are the two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the &#x2013; your question on transportation, Armando. That is specific element that we do not foresee a benefit or great benefit, because, from what we understand Comisi&#xF3;n Federal de Electricidad produces some of the electricity that Lucy <mark type="inaudible" /> distributes. So it will not change the volumes of Comisi&#xF3;n Federal de Electricidad drastically, unless in the future they make some changes and decides and that may help us, they decide on producing more inside that we serve.</p>
          <p>We do believe that we will be ready for &#x2013; to take advantage over a more steady economy in the year 2010. We have the horsepower in place and the installations ready for an improvement in the volumes but it will come as it has been the case nowadays with stronger automotive that they have no longer having those stoppages in their different plants in Mexico and other areas that we are looking for new volumes. Armando can you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will take the Cananea one. We expect the decision as I just pointed out. Once decision is issued in our favor and we believe that at that point the labor relations have been declared finally, in the final instance terminated. Therefore we should be able to go back to the mine and hire new employees or have some of the old employees that will like to come back to the mine and start working.</p>
          <p>That of course, the timing is very hard to know I mean to estimate now because as you know there are issues of more of the legal that need to be resolved among the people but we've been working with a lot of our teams to really convey the proper message to the people in Cananea. I think currently nobody is winning. Everybody is losing time, money, their town, the municipal government, the state government. So it is a matter of having all the parties work towards the same goal once the decision is issued.</p>

          <p>Well, Cananea has had a very irregular production in the years mainly because of the labor issues Cananea has countered. And the capacity is 180,000 tons and it is fair to say 170 could produce in a full year that is a fair assumption.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question regarding budgets or guidance for 2010. We're already almost at the end of October and I was wondering if there's any estimation of EBITDA under the current condition that is assuming zero from Cananea and zero from Asarco, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Claudia. We are closing the year, as you just pointed out, we are closing our budgets. We are closing our work for next year. We haven't given any guidance yet, but we are finalizing our committees on what prices and what assumptions to take. However, we do feel very strongly about copper fundamentals and we also believe that we are in track for an economic recovery, and as I pointed out, for example, our mortgage industry started increasing in volumes again, I'm referring to the transportation division there. So we think we have a positive outlook for 2010, still not ready to give you the guidance for next year &#x2013; definitely give it in the next conference call, Claudia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it possible at least to have an idea of what kind of copper prices you expect, at least?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe it will be about $3, that's what we were discussing in our budget, there is nothing official yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About $3, okay. And regarding Cananea, and here I'm just thinking out loud, seeing as how it has been widely acclaimed but still kind of complicated to the <mark type="inaudible" /> for a second considering that the union is, well, quite aggressive, I'm thinking that perhaps the government is not going to want to have a lot more ways, or a lot more noise with yet another union, so how much support do you see right now from the Ferrosur regarding the issues with miners' union. I know that's a tough question, I'm sorry to ask, I'm just curious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I'll just tell you. I mean we have a good relation, it doesn't change as well in a state government and there is a new Governor in the State of Sonora, as you know. There is a new Municipal President in the Municipality work on their miners and everybody knows about the <mark type="inaudible" /> decision. I think here we're different, we are facing different issues and very different issues than the issues that happened at the <mark type="inaudible" /> center &#x2013; I cannot comment on those, it's just governmental decision. And I think here we do have arrest warrants against Mr. G&#xF3;mez Urrutia. And I think once the decision is issued, the government at both levels and the company will work to resolving and reinstating the peace and work atmosphere for the Cananea mine. I think it is an important asset for the whole country, and it ought to be proved, generate taxes, generates jobs. So it's a matter of join a business once and for all.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line Bernado Trejo with Balmex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you tell us about the possible effect that you may have with the proportion of payment about the taxes for 2010? And do you have a possible amount?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, I mean, the discussions still on the very -- in the appropriate governmental legislative bodies. Definitely the consolidation issue is an issue that will impact all of the Mexican groups that consolidate. In Mexico, we have two groups in our consolidation. We have the mining group and then we have the Grupo M&#xE9;xico and transportation division group. From a consolidation tax basis and definitely we don't agree and like the fact that this is retroactive and goes to losses that were not fully compensated in the past. I mean we think its change of law, and the callers of the governmental bodies have said that's not retroactive. We believe, call it or not retroactive, it's going to decisions we took in the past, good of the print and rules of the game. And just of numbers, we've not disclosed that publicly and I hope you appreciate that we cannot disclose that now. And still, once the law is issued finally, we'll be happy to disclose them now. But now there would be too much speculation. Genaro?</p>
