        <plist>
          <p>It's very interesting then why you are all on one side, but anyway, so somebody is looking for more space. I don't know. It depends on from where you are looking for but anyway. So good morning to everybody, many thanks for being here as usual in London for the presentation of the results. And with my team, we'll go through the Fourth Quarter Results and the Year End Results, and clearly, we are more than happy to answer to all your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Starting from the usual executive summary, some view on the 2009 results, we think that we're positioning ourself in the right way for taking the opportunities of the growth in the economy we should expect will come in the end of 2010 beginning 2011.</p>
          <p>What we have done in 2009? First of all, we have continued our asset optimization. Total assets went down by 11.2% year-on-year with quite a robust balance sheet structure at the year end, you will see the number later on.</p>
          <p>Leverage is significantly decreasing, went down to 24.4 times, is five times lesser than what we had one year before, considering the capital increase, as you know, has been accomplished in February this year pro forma which should be at 22.1%.</p>
          <p>We have a very solid capital. Core Tier 1 is 7.62 before the capital increase, which means 104 basis points higher than the previous year considering the capital increase included should be at 8.47. As you know for the Italian regulator, we had the most strict rules all over Europe in terms of how the capital is calculated.</p>
          <p>We had a strong cost control and the structure has been streamlined. Cost went down year-on-year by 8.2%. I think it is even more impressive if we do say 1.3 billion, because it's a huge amount of money. The total &#x2013; the full time equivalent went down by 9,300 people, you will see the split, Western Europe and Central Eastern Europe. Net profit is 1.7 billion and we're back to a cash dividend of $0.03 per share. Considering also the shares have been issued for the capital increase.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter is a solid quarter moving in the right direction 6.4 billion in terms of revenues with net interest stabilizing and a good growth on the fee side. There is not the usual hike in terms of cost in the fourth quarter. We are down by 7% quarter-on-quarter. Provisions are slightly down in comparison to the previous quarter, we are at 2.68 billion is 4.4% less. The cost of risk is 146 bps in this quarter, while it was 150 bps in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The Core Tier 1 gross of dividend accrual 21 bps not considering the dividend. So having paid the dividend is still 7 bps accrual, also in the fourth quarter. The net profit for the quarter has been 371 million.</p>
          <p>Now I will go through the different lines of the profit and loss on the balance sheet, so that we will have more details on this summary. Starting from the asset side, as I said we went down quite significantly year-on-year, we are at 929 billion in terms of total assets, where the hedging instruments are 75 billion. This is the gross number on the liability side that we have <mark type="inaudible" /> eventually there should be a significant mapping.</p>
          <p>The asset excluding the hedging instrument is 854 billion with a significant reduction as well year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Customer loan on total assets are close to 61%, is quite a significant number if you compare ourselves with the other European banks, so it gives you a view on the structure of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The trading assets are 14.4%, so going down significantly during the year. As I said before, the leverage ratio is 22.1 pro forma, which is quite important asset base, also in the perspective of an eventual new regulation, as you know this is a topic under discussion &#x2013; the discussion is still very, very open. I think it's important to note that in any case we are very well positioned also in this perspective.</p>
          <p>Also on the other key indicator, I think that there has been quite a good improvement as the net interbank is 29 billion at the year end, it's minus 70.5% year-on-year, which is also an important element. But what is also very important is the fact that loan on direct funding is 95%. So we are well positioned as well in terms of structure of loan to direct funding.</p>
          <p>We've a structural liquidity ratio which is maintained within very strict limits. This is a very important element because as you know, there has been a lot of discussion on the eventual carry trade made by banks and the eventual mismatching of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We have an internal rule to be at 0.90 for maturities above one year. At year-end, we were at 0.99. So it means that assets with one year maturity are funded with liabilities with the same maturity for 99%. If you consider that, clearly, the liability side is composed by side deposit partially. And on the asset side, we have also participation.</p>
          <p>You can imagine the fact that we have no mismatching in the balance sheet. And this is quite important also in the perspective of an increase of interest rates because in the case of an increase of interest rates, we have a quite positive impact on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Moving to the capital, I've already said that the core Tier 1 pro forma is 8.47. That position ourself we think in a very strong position for capturing market share with good customers as soon as the market will start to grow again in terms of lending activity.</p>
          <p>Also on the risk weighted asset side, we continue to go down. It's also very important to say that market risk weighted assets are nine billion at the year end. So this is an important element since it's an area in which there are again significant discussion on how to increase the capital absorption related to trading assets.</p>
          <p>And I think that this is another important element for our future. In 2010, we do expect to see a growth in terms of risk weighted asset.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses, we went down from &#x20AC;16.7 billion to &#x20AC;15.3 billion. It is quite a huge reduction, more or less of the same percentage for other expenses and staff expenses. You see 8.2% less year-on-year of the total cost; 8.1% is the other expenses; 8.3% for staff expenses.</p>
          <p>Clearly in other expenses, we have some growth related, for instance, to the fact that we have sold real estate assets with renting afterwards which in terms of a capital generation is incredibly positive, so the cost of capital incredibly reduced by such kind of deals.</p>
          <p>But as you can imagine we have the rent and the <mark type="inaudible" /> on the rent. So clearly, this gives you a view on the fact that in reality, other expenses are even better than the one we are seeing if you shouldn't consider this element.</p>
          <p>The cost/income ratio went down to 55.6%, which is 6.5% less than the previous year, again thanks to the combination of slightly higher revenues and significantly lower cost.</p>
          <p>In terms of staff reduction, we have a staff reduction which is balanced in Western Europe and in Central Eastern Europe. In Western Europe, all the areas contributed to this reduction. The highest reduction have been realized in CIB with 6.5% less year-on-year, as we promised you during the previous year presentation and asset management, minus 9.4%.</p>
          <p>In Central Eastern Europe where clearly the per capita costs are significantly lower than in Western Europe, one half of the reductions are coming from Ukraine and Kazakhstan where we have realized a huge restructuring and positive restructuring and one-fourth from post merger integration in Poland. So we have a good contribution from the different banks in the area.</p>
          <p>These were the year end results. Now shall we move to the fourth quarter results, which you can see in this page. Clearly, we had quite a good cost control both year-on-year, but also quarter-on-quarter, and this is a reverse trend vis-&#xE0;-vis what we have seen in all our history. Usually, in the fourth quarter there is a pickup on the cost side.</p>
          <p>Provisions on loans are slightly lower than the one we had in the third quarter; clearly, significantly higher year-on-year, but this is related to the overall market condition. I would like to stress one element and this affects the operating profit when we see year-on-year is up by 20.3%. I think that this is a very good number because clearly is the signal on the fact that there has been a good reaction both on the revenue side and on the cost control side.</p>
          <p>The net profit, as we said is at 1.7 billion, again mainly affected by the higher net write-downs on loans that are pretty significant. Also the other non operating items in 2009 are lower than the one we had in 2008. So that we have a combination of these two factors.</p>
          <p>When we go to the different elements of the &#x2013; in terms of operating trends, here we want to show you what is the ratio in terms of net interest and commissions on total assets. I think it's something very important because it gives you a view on the stable, less volatile revenue generation capability, has been quite stable during the year in the range of 2.6%.</p>
          <p>So we think that is quite a good indicator on the fact that we have an underlying capability in terms of revenue generation which is strong. And the operating expenses are stable on total assets, slightly growing, but there are no hike in the fourth quarter. The net write-downs are going slightly down. Clearly, still significantly high, but this is related to the overall market conditions.</p>
          <p>If we go line-by-line you can see what is the number for net interest income, that is relatively stabilized that you will see in the next chart. In the fourth quarter, we have some elements of one-off in the corporate center. But the net interest margin is stabilizing. Clearly, we are, as I said before, impacted by the lowering of interest rates. Now, clearly we are at the bottom of market rates. For us it's very important, the one month and three months of Euribor, which is generating the markdown we have on deposits. And as you know we have quite a significant volumes of site deposits made in Italy.</p>
          <p>Positive signals from net commission, plus 9.5% quarter-on-quarter and also when we compare the fourth quarter of this year with the fourth quarter of last year, the numbers are good.</p>
          <p>Trading income went down and back when we compare our self with our competitors, we performed better than our competitors in relative terms on the market side. Then there are also corporate center, but we will answer later on that eventual question.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we had some positive impact in the corporate center, for instance, on our own shares. You remember that we disposed shares with an option attached to that that in the fourth quarter is not there anymore. So &#x2013; but in general terms, we are quite satisfied with the results we had across the &#x2013; in this area as well.</p>
          <p>So going to net interest, as I said, there has been a decrease in the fourth quarter of the Euribor, but now is stable so &#x2013; which is an important element. Our view is that, the official rates will not go up during the year, but the Euribor during the year will start to go up. This is the New Year mainly in the second half of the year because we think, but this is something that you have to consider by yourself is &#x2013; what is the potential impact of the draining of liquidity by the central banks. Our view that during the second half there will be some draining liquidity and the consequence, the market rates will start to go up and this clearly should have a positive impact for us.</p>
          <p>We have a lower cost of wholesale funding that clearly drew a positive impact on the contribution of the corporate center to the net interest margin that we had some positive one-off as I said before.</p>
          <p>I do confirm what we said in the previous presentation during the quarterly results presentation that an eventual increase of the market rates, will have a positive impact on our interest margin contribution, 100 bps of parallel shift of the interest rates, it means more or less 500 million of higher revenues for us. This is a very important because other European banks that will have a worse effect in the case of interest rates growth.</p>
          <p>Talking of commissions, commissions clearly for us are an important element. We are seeing a positive growth on the commission from investment services, as you can see the fourth quarter '09 is the best quarter since the last quarter of the previous year.</p>
          <p>On the other net commission, we have seen also quite a good improvement the fourth quarter of last year with the sum of the two is slightly lower, so at the end we are seeing a positive trend in this area which has been stabilized.</p>
          <p>When we go to operating expenses, I don't want to spend much more time on that. In the fourth quarter, we had a positive reduction both in terms of operating expenses and in terms of full time equivalent which is again a positive element for us.</p>
          <p>Write-down on loans, clearly asset quality is clearly a key topic, a key area. For us &#x2013; we know perfectly that this is a key focus for you, but even more for us. What we are seeing in general terms? First of all, a small reduction of the cost of risk, which is a very important element for us in line with our expectations. The group cost of risk went down from 154 to 146.</p>
          <p>We have a reduction in retail after peaking. We have a small growth in corporate investment banking due to a prudential approach in classification and coverage, mainly related to the Italian corporate business. In CEE, we are seeing a decrease with a positive trend in Poland and lower one-off effect in Kazakhstan.</p>
          <p>As you remember we had a one-off in &#x2013; we had 150 million in &#x2013; sorry 250 million in the third quarter in Kazakhstan. We have 146 million of higher coverage ratio of cost of risk in Kazakhstan in the first quarter. So as we said during the third quarter presentation we are going down in terms of cost of risk also in Kazakhstan.</p>
          <p>Total gross impaired loans, we continue to be incredibly strict in terms of classification, so we went up by 7.7% quarter-on-quarter only in the other gross impaired loans, where you can see we went up about 20%, our restructured, past-due and the watch list, while on the gross non-performing loan we are stable quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>But in my opinion what is even more important is the two following charts. One the coverage is stable, one word on the third quarter, why are we seeing 62.7, 61.9%, because we decided to cancel the interest in Poland. We decided to cancel the overdue interest. The overdue interest are always covered by 100%. In local accounting standard the Poland was already aligned to the group, this was not the case in the consolidated numbers.</p>
          <p>So, we have cancelled all of the interest which were covered by 100% as we do in all the other countries. This is important. So the base is exactly the same. Clearly, if you can say something which is covered by 100%, you are lowering on the weighted average of the coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>So as you can see the coverage ratio is pretty stable. When we go to the other impaired loans, we have some small decrease, but we have to say that on doubtful we have &#x2013; sorry in restructure, not in doubtful, we have a single position which is fully hedged, fully &#x2013; not hedged, covered with collateral, so fully collateralized; is a position of 800 million we have moved to restructured. And being fully collateralized there are no provisions from that.</p>
          <p>So clearly the coverage ratio without this provision should be if I remember correctly slightly higher that 30% in restructured. So is something very important because unless we have some number which is not comparable we continue to have a genetic reserve over 3 billion, which is relatively high is 5.4% more of coverage on impaired and 9.4 more on NPL only. So and in terms of coverage on doubtful loan, we are best-in-class if you compare our self with others, we are really good. I think that all these elements are very important.</p>
          <p>But is also important the trend because if we consider, we analyzed cost of risk per quarter, as you can see we have reached, the peak in the second quarter of 2009, but also when we consider the impaired loans additions, which is as a delta of gross impaired loans on total gross loan in the quarter, you can see that we had a growth during the year up to the second quarter then we started to go down.</p>
          <p>We think that this is a very important signal in terms of future trend. So this is clearly a very high level and we are perfectly aware of that. But we think that the trend is also very relevant in order to foresee our future.</p>
          <p>If we move to what we have from operating profit to go down to the consolidated net income, we have a provision for risk charges mainly related to legal procedures. We have some restructuring cost that we had to release because we have not used them. We have been able to reduce the staff without using them better, which is quite an important element.</p>
          <p>This gives also you &#x2013; a view to you on the conservativeness we usually have. Clearly, if you can not to use what we provision for redundancies, is always better. Net write-downs we already spoke of them &#x2013; of that we have net income from investments mainly as a sale of Omicron real estate units for 177 million, the tax rate has been low in this quarter, is not the running tax rate as we always said then we have monitories and PPA and we go down to the 371 million.</p>
          <p>And the capital ratios are the one we discussed before. We are close to 13% in terms of total capital ratio; is very important to say the fact that the hybrid capital we have is incredibly low. This is very, very important since as you know one of the key discussion undergoing on Basel III is a matter of quality of the capital. And talking of quality of capital is what will be the amount &#x2013; the potential possible amount and which kind of hybrid could be considered in the Tier 1 ratio. This is something, if I remember correctly today we have 9% of hybrid capital on core Tier 1. As you remember in Italy, there is a limit of 20% while in other countries the limit is 50% or even 100%. So clearly, an eventual impact on us in this area is really negligible. So this is something very, very important because the quality of our capital is already good in our view.</p>
          <p>Having said so, final chart then we move to question and answer. In 2009, we have done some action. We have significantly strengthened our capital base. We have improved the balance sheet structure. We have maintained very strict liquidity rules. We have reduced our full-time equivalent as well as the other administrative expenses, so we had a good structural cost control. We are working on fine tuning restructuring in order to be closer to the customer and the growth potential is in our opinion preserved so that the balance sheet repositioning has been achieved.</p>
          <p>The flexibility and ability to pursue growth opportunities is there, we have a lower cost base and we will continue to be focused on cost efficiency.</p>
          <p>Re-segmentation project is quite important for us, and we are moving forward on that. Finally we are benefiting from the leadership in Central and Eastern Europe. We are sensible to rising interest rates, sensible in the positive way, and we have room to increase our commission income.</p>
          <p>So many thanks for your attention, and as I said before with my deputies, the CFO and the CRO, we are more than happy to answer to your questions. Thanks a lot.</p>
          <p>If, as usual you can say &#x2013; because we know you but maybe the other &#x2013; I am sure that they know you as well but if you can say who you are and so it's -</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. It's Alessandro Roccati from Macquarie FPK. Three quick questions. The first one is for Mr. Guha. We haven't seen any kitchen sinking for the first time in many years in the fourth quarter. Just wondering what are strange in terms of risk management procedures, internal modeling and what really you are &#x2013; what new procedures are you implementing in your Group?</p>
          <p>The cost of risk also in Italy in the fourth quarter was 90 basis points in the retail business which is more or less in line what I'm expecting from the other banks and this is coming down from 145 basis points in the second quarter. So it is a significant improvement. Just wondering whether you can comment on this and whether you see this improvement as sustainable.</p>
          <p>The second question is for Ms. Natale, just wondering whether you can comment on your liquidity policy. I understand you have lot of liquidity available, how this is impacting net interest income, and where do you see net interest income in the retail domestic division going forward.</p>
          <p>And finally the third question is for Mr. Ermotti, on the CIB division. We've seen weak FICC revenues decreasing from 900 million in the third quarter to 400 million in the final course of the year. That's pretty much in line with what we've seen for the other banks. I'm just wondering whether you can give us an outlook for the FICC revenues for 2010 and given that the contribution of FICC revenues is roughly 80% of the total capital market revenues. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. The answer to the first question is in terms of &#x2013; it was interesting analogy in terms of the kitchen sink. No, it has never been the policy to have a kitchen sink approach, but the approach has always been to have a prudential and pragmatic approach to what we need to do with respect to our own portfolios. So if you look at Q4, you should never look one particular quarter in isolation, because from a risk perspective that is &#x2013; a quarter is not particularly interesting, nor important. You have to look at it through the cycle which is how we look at it.</p>
          <p>In essence, if you look at the gross numbers they are fairly stable. But what you do see is that the level of recovery is a lot higher. So therefore the net impact is lower. But the important takeaway point that I would like to leave with you is that the pace of deterioration that you had seen picking up at the beginning of second quarter and really peaking in August thereabout, the pace is definitely slowing down. So it has not stabilized yet, but is definitely slowing down. So you do see the actual fall-through effect.</p>
          <p>The point related to that which is important to know is that in any of these, these are large portfolios. So effectively the lag effect will carry through; the lag effect is effectively between the way the model works related to the performing portfolio and the non-performing. The macro economic deterioration has a major <mark type="inaudible" /> expect that to get through for a while and bottoming out. But, no, nothing dramatic there.</p>
          <p>The second part of it is have we changed anything with respect to the methodologies and are we driving? No, you cannot. Prudentially or else or otherwise you cannot. It's &#x2013; it's just the two factors that I just mentioned which have a material impact on how you provide for it.</p>
          <p>Retail, of course, I think part of the deterioration was detected earlier in the process and there were several measures that we took in terms of aggressive recovery, but also restructuring the individual clients before it went wrong when they were already performing, began to bear fruit. And so I think what you are seeing is a stabilization of that trend and then I think that it will follow through. So I think that in itself is what you are seeing in terms of the managerial actions following through on to the client base. And then there are pockets within that, of course, that we have to pay attention to. But I think overall we are fine.</p>

          <p>About liquidity, as you have seen in the presentation, if we look at the two KPIs, loan on direct funding and structural liquidity ratio, we are well above &#x2013; let's say, we are in a good shape looking at the loan to deposit fund &#x2013; funding and we are well above our internal limits at the level of 0.99. So we are in a good shape and we will feel comfortable with this level of liquidity. Still waiting for the new rules coming from Basel III and still waiting from UCB action to be taken shortly in the next auction.</p>
          <p>However, in June, we will see the market and we will have a better understanding also in terms of the level of the &#x2013; the optimal level liquidity we would like to take.</p>
          <p>In term of NII, so understand that you &#x2013; I think that it's useful to give you three figures in order to understand the dynamics of the last quarter. And there has been a one-off contribution as mentioned which amounts to approximately 60 million, while the dynamics of our cost of funding on secured and unsecured had contributed in a significant way to the improvement of our NII. And looking forward for sure the Retail Division due to the natural deposit taking where they still suffered in this market situation where the rates are still low. And we will see going forward the developments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As of FIC activities I think that as you rightly point out there is a structural industry trend. I do think that those levels we've seeing in fourth quarter are the new levels of profitability in general without any major changing in the money markets. And the attitude of clients to be more active, our clients' activity has been slowing down a lot. So overall I do think that it's difficult to make outlooks for the year, but for sure the Q2, Q3 '09 environment is not there any longer and it's not likely to be there going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Domenico Vinci from Goldman Sachs. Just three questions, one  you've got 150 billion of assets over the last year 5th of March, is this the last quarter we're seeing asset going down or you think there is more to come? On the net interest income, there is an indication you can give to us what would be the contribution from hedging and most importantly, where &#x2013; until when your hedges are in place going through 2010 and then still on NII, you highlight the potential impact from rising rates, are you concerned there could be a negative impact on NII due to higher structural costs on wholesale funding. You have if I remember well roughly 100 billion of debt maturing 2010-2011 plus 25 billion of interbank, so what do you expect the potential input for UniCredit NII? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of assets going down, for sure we did a lot of efforts in reducing and risky assets. We think &#x2013; we see that UCG now is robust; the leverage is at the right level, so we don't think that we will see significant changes, material changes going forward. You were asking about the hedging replicating portfolio, we &#x2013; what I can tell you that, we have in our NII, we will have a dynamic such that 40 million delta will be recorded quarter-by-quarter due to the movement of the rates unless we take the decision to rollout our position. We have to say that in the current tax environment, tax rate sorry, environment is very difficult to take a decision and to rollout the position. Therefore we are not planning to act in this direction for the time being.</p>
          <p>And if I am not wrong the last question was related to our cost of funding. We are changing in a typical way the mix of our cost of funding with the changes in the market and we are moving towards a more secured curve. Therefore the cost of funding in 2010 will be for sure lower compared to the cost of funding we experienced in 2009.</p>
          <p>And these will give us benefit in term of our profit and loss and probably you have in mind an amount of maturing assets which is well above the level we have in mind let's say you should cut by two more or less and these &#x2013; such that our funding plan is not a huge funding plan where we are &#x2013; our projection are close above in the north then of 20 billion with cost of funding, which is one-fourth or one-third of the level we experienced in 2009.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Carlo Digrandi, HSBC. Only one question on capital generation. Mr. Profumo, you said that risk-weighted assets would resume growth in 2010, and you also indicated that capital generation was only 7 bps in Q4. Clearly, this is only limited compared to the other quarters. But I was wondering, how does the Group see capital generation during the course of 2010? If you can provide us a view, an internal view from the management in terms of run rate or what do you expect, given the fact that growth would certainly absorb some capital within Basel II framework and the expectation about any changes in rules? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the 7 bps, our latest effect that we have charged the entire dividend in the fourth quarter. Because unless we consider &#x2013; this is the reason why we are saying 23 bps, then you have to consider the fact that in the previous quarter, we were not charging the potential dividend. Because we always said we will define the eventual dividend at the year-end.</p>
          <p>There are many different components for risk-weighted asset growth in the 2010 forecast. On one side, we have the loan growth. We do expect to have a loan growth which to be honest is not yet materializing. Secondly, we do expect that further migration of risk-weighted asset in lower rating, so that the same loan should have a higher risk-weighted asset impact.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, we are considering a potential change in the market risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>Considering all these things, we do expect to have a small capital absorption in 2010. But as I said before, we start from a very strong position.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Francesca Tondi from J.P. Morgan. I also have a couple questions here. One follow-up for Ms. Natale, the CFO; on the structure of the funding cost. Can you expand a little bit more on how that is moving? You've just talked about changing the structure towards more secured funding, because it's a little bit counterintuitive, right now as you're re-pricing your funding, the cost is actually going down, whilst we hear other banks in Europe that cost is still going up, given the average structure. So if you could expand on that and especially what has happened in Q4 and how much of that benefit beside the one-off we can actually take forward in the next quarters?</p>
          <p>The second question is for Mr. Guha on asset quality trend risk management. To my mind, the increase that I see in still the lower categories in the watch list loans, in the past year, is still an indication that asset quality is still deteriorating because there's still &#x2013; there is an incoming from the good part of the loan book, and then a deterioration into bad loans actually happens later. When do you think that starts eventually stabilizing? Do you have some indication in January, February and how much further can this drive your provisioning there?</p>
          <p>And a small specific question on the Central Europe cost of risk. It actually seems to be flat quarter-on-quarter. Kazakhstan is better, but Turkey and Croatia are actually up in their provisions. Can you expand a little bit on what is happening there and perhaps a little bit on the region? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are three figures that might help on these. We had on unsecured quarter-on-quarter minus 26 basis point, on secured curve minus 45, while on the short-term liquidity, you know that the market is &#x2013; which is under &#x2013; we managed to access the market below the level of three months, under six months so due to our size, we have the ability to get a better rate also on the short-term.</p>
          <p>In terms of composition going forward, the point I made about the remixing is we are planning to have more &#x2013; a higher component related to corporate bonds and this will help our curve on the secured part. And we have &#x2013; we are planning to have a limited amount on the other type of categories since our needs as pointed out before are lower in comparison with last year. So I mentioned before the fact that we will be lower in comparison with last year, overall last year we were close to 150 basis points and as I mentioned the plan for next year is significantly below.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. With respect to your first question in terms of asset quality and deterioration, I am afraid I am going to reiterate what I said to the gentleman here, which is that the lag effect is continuing and will continue, but the pace of deterioration has certainly slowed. So what in effect it means is that from performing as it moves to non-performing, the first two categories are more likely to swell up. Having said that, we have a very centralized approach of restructuring throughout the Group, so what you do see is an increased &#x2013; also an increase in the migration, from the first two categories back to performing as well.</p>
          <p>So the second part of your question when do we expect it to stabilize, I think certainly not this quarter, not the next quarter, probably end of summer I assume it would stabilize, but don't expect an immediate sort of improvement.</p>
          <p>Again I would go back to the principle premise that you should not look at this on a quarterly basis, but look at it as a trend. The trend is definitely slowing down and I think it will take one or two quarters more for it to completely stabilize and then depending on the macros just get better. But the first two categories will certainly go down, not because it's going to go the other way into sofferenza but a lot moving back into performing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So in the last quarter &#x2013; yes, it's in the sheet. I think the last quarter off the top of my head is 2.9 billion, I think, cumulative effect in the fourth quarter if I remember correctly, it should be, and &#x2013; but I will check that and give it to you in a second.</p>
          <p>The second part of your question in terms of CEE itself, CEE overall relative to the rest of the Group, the provisions level remained high of course. But then you have to sort of look at it in country by country and the two countries you specifically have picked up, Croatia at the end of the day, there is a deterioration in the portfolio, which you have to look at in the context of quite a material contraction in the economy. And what you do see this year again, potentially 1.5 to 2% contraction in the economy. When you have something like that, it immediately affects the model, and it's a standardized charge model so it flows through. So it's at almost a near automatic charge and so that relates to it.</p>
          <p>Turkey is a different story. Turkey is two or three single name hits that basically changed the composition in the last quarter. But in terms of the underlying trend is still okay relative to the cost of risk to the revenue. I think that basis is fairly stable. It's 2.9 billion I am pretty sure, but I'll confirm it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Albero Cordara, Merrill. Just wanted to elaborate on previous questions. I think so far you've done a lot of good work in rebalancing your fund position, rebuilding capital and you've de-levered your balance sheet very aggressively.</p>
          <p>So now I think you've told us that this year, you expect loan to go up. It might be premature, but I would like to ask you which areas of the Group you see as the main growth driver and where do you potentially think to position yourselves in terms of market share gain. I mean your current position puts you I think at the competitive advantage versus other banks particularly that's for southern Italian banks.</p>
          <p>And the second question is again related to asset quality. We saw that the main contributor to the Group, deterioration of asset quality has not been so much Eastern Europe, but has been at the corporate and investment banking business. And you've been telling us that a lot of this is coming from Italian corporate. You've been taking a prudential approach in the classification of lending. So the question here is how much of this is legacy, is related to past acquisitions that you've done in Italy, and when eventually we will see or you expect to see a normalization in the trend of credit losses in the corporate and investment banking business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Where the growth will be? Clearly what we've seen is the fact that Central Eastern Europe better. Some countries in Central Eastern Europe are starting to move, clearly Poland, Russia, Turkey, Czech Republic are countries where we do see some signals of growth. As you know, we have injected two billion capital in Bank Austria in order to be ready to follow this growth.</p>
          <p>So, in general terms the risk return of the capital allocated in Central Eastern Europe and I'm sorry I am always oversimplifying talking about Central Eastern Europe, because as you know is an incredible mistake of talking as if it is a country, but I hope that you apologize me if I am simplifying. It is clearly better allocated. So we're seeing quite a positive contribution, again taking in strict consideration risk and return.</p>
          <p>Clearly, in a selective way, we are also growing in other countries, because we are interested not so much in pure market share, but we are interested in market share in value-added customers, because to make market share is very easy, to gain money is a slightly different.</p>
          <p>The Economic Value Added per customer is a matter of fact in the way Sergio is managing CIB. So again in a selective way, we're focused on how to improve the return on our customer basis; is also the reason why we have not used corporate and investment banking arm, because &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; the spread on loan is going up. But with a pure lending activity you cannot forget there's a cost of capital.</p>
          <p>This is a matter of fact, nowhere in the world. So you have to imitate the world to cross sale other services. So this is the reason why are so important services like GTB, Global Transactional Banking or other services in the investment banking area.</p>
          <p>So the overall capital allocation should be reduced in Western Europe to these segments, but maybe that we will gain market share &#x2013; more than market share, share a wallet on single customer.</p>
          <p>This is also the reason why we are redesigning the customer segmentation, because we are in the process of focusing as a CIB division on wholesale customer above &#x20AC;50 million. We are really &#x2013; we want to become the house bank may be for fewer customer, even fewer than the one we will lay as a starting point, but with a significantly deeper correlation.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we are moving the customer between 3 and &#x20AC;50 million in family and SMEs strategic business area, because we think that in this field proximity is a key element. So asset quality in CIB, I don't know if Sergio wants to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that it's clearly &#x2013; the cost of risk is not necessarily a consequence of the acquisition in the recent years. In Italy, I think is a consequence of our high market share in these segments in the SME, the low, and clearly &#x2013; the credit quality of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, I wouldn't really point out, there is no evidence of this &#x2013; of acquisition affecting one way or the other the portfolio. Clearly, I think that going forward, we do expect as long as the economy as Karl Guha mentioned before doesn't recover, I think it's unlikely that we will see a major improvement in these segments. But we have seen probably the peak and we will stay at those levels, probably with a slight reduction in the next few months, but not a material one in 2010 at least until the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One number that I think is important in this perspective, I'll give you the &#x2013; on the CIBR in Italy, the weight of the top 10 and the top 20 provisions we made on the total provision; the top 10 is 12.5% in 2009 and the top 20 is 18.8, which means so that really this is more related to the fact that Italian economy is slowing down and the fact that in Italy, there are a huge number of small companies is creating this impact.</p>
          <p>This gives you also an idea on how conservative we are, because it's a matter of classification of a huge number of customers. I think that this is quite an important element, because we are facing the reality by 100% and we are managing properly this classification and provisioning system in order to be ready to move positively as soon as the market will improve. Clearly, in Italy, this structure of the Italian economy based on micro company is a weakness in this perspective, is also an incredible strength on the flexibility side and it is also quite important in terms of social impact and since in the future one of the problems will be the social impact of huge restructuring of large companies. In Italy this is, I should say, more easily managed and this can be the positive side of the coin.</p>
          <p>As an example of the value, on value growth oriented lending that Alessandro was before highlighting is the way in which you can read the development of mortgaging consumer finance in the course of 2009, the beginning of 2010. In 2009, each single mortgage booked in Italy by Italian banks was value destroying because spreads had arrived to 80 bps; cost of funding was higher than that. So in that context we had reduced significant market share, increased significantly the price, to signal also to the market the need to change the overall pricing policy.</p>
          <p>As a result of this latest mortgages booked in the course of 2009 and beginning of 2010 are close to 150 bps. Cost of funding has reduced as you know from that time. The reality is that in the first two months of this year we have increased the origination on mortgages by almost 100% compared to what we did in the course of '09. In '09, instead, in Italy consumer finance had become much more profitable. Monoline disappeared from the market. Spreads have been that we could practice, well above 500 basis points, 560 more or less, as average for the year. As a result of this we have increased quite significantly also our market share in consumer finance. We've become number two in consumer finance and we keep on growing in that segment. The reality is that you must have in certain instances completely different attitudes from segment-to-segment because somewhere it's possible to make money and value, somewhere else not.</p>

          <p>Hi, Arturo De Frias Marques, Evolution Securities. It does seem to me that you are very, very confident on the asset quality evolution at group level and at divisional level. In general terms, we have seen in the last quarter of the year loan loss provisions going down, bad loans net terms going up and the coverage ratio going down in a very tough way if you look at the overall portfolio of bad loans. So I would like to understand given that you seem to be, to have an adequate provisions strategy through the cycle, will it be possible to have a guidance in terms of loan loss ratio for 2010 in case &#x2013; sorry, or having a few let's say color about the loan loss ratio by division? And actually Mr. Profumo you said that the Central Eastern Europe is very, very let's say different in terms of mix. There are many countries and all are very, very, very different. So why don't you give us, let's say not maybe a country-by-country analysis of asset quality in Eastern Europe, but may be if you can give us a color about the different trend in asset quality in the region this would be, let's say good at least to me? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That's a very long list of questions. Let me start with the first one. I can understand the desirability of wanted to have a guidance, but giving you one would be tempting fate certainly with my boss, because he would hold me to it. So I know that but I will certainly give you texture and color and flavor to get you to the answer that you are looking for.</p>
          <p>First of all, I think your question in terms of asset quality and the deterioration. I think you have to take the numbers that we do report is actually the gross numbers versus net. So you have to also take the net numbers into account. The lady from JPMorgan, I confirm to it, it's 2.9, I think the precise numbers 2.913, I think. So you have to add that to actually get a flavor of how much we're really providing at a gross level or not.</p>
          <p>Second, I think that your comment was about the migration into past due where there has been a material increase. Now that material increase, at certainly in the Italian parameter was largely influenced to the tune of 900 million by what we call technical past due. The technical past due was a result of a discussion between ourselves and the regulator. This is actually not a default per se, but where the review &#x2013; the annual review has not been completed. So by definition, it has to go under past due. So that part of the backlog, we will clear up by and large by the end of the first quarter, so that will take one billion, roughly one billion out. So it is not a real provision, but it's a technical issue.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of the migration what you do see is that between the performing and the non-performing the pace, as I've said earlier, the lag effect will certainly continue for a while. It's not going to disappear for the next two, three quarters. It will stabilize after that and then as a result of restructuring, it will &#x2013; our company is getting better, it reverts back into performing.</p>
          <p>Then going into your question &#x2013; sorry, you had one on c &#x2013; sorry, coverage ratios; the coverage ratios if you look at it, I think you have to look at the real issue in terms of impaired, in terms of so sofferenza it's fairly consistent. So what you do see there is no material change, which is roughly around the 61 to 62% of coverage. The reason why you see on a consolidated basis, the change is the actual mix because you take the whole non-performing part, so in past due there is a massive increase that will immediately change the mix. And this &#x2013; when you look at it through the cycle, the key issue that I focus on is materially to look at what it is on sofferenza because that's what the real criticality is. The consolidated one is a number that is nice to have but to me it's not that meaningful. You really have to decompose it and go one layer down.</p>
          <p>Coming back to your question about CEE in and of itself, I think the over &#x2013; it is obviously a mix from country to country, and I think the point of it is that you have to bucket the countries. You cannot take it in one single bucket and look at the whole thing. If you look at &#x2013; let's start with Poland first of all, Poland I think overall performance both in terms of our asset quality, I think we're clearly the outperformer in the market. This is a direct result of a fairly tough lending processes in the period to come &#x2013; in the past. So what we're seeing now is basically a direct result of that sort of prudential behavior.</p>
          <p>Overall, again, this is an important factor. All of the models, particularly on the performing part of the portfolio, is heavily influenced by what is happening in the GDP and the macroeconomic conditions. So if Poland in this case has had a fairly robust overall economic conditions, so that being said the impact therefore is quite good. And I think what we see this year is more &#x2013; without giving any guidance in whatever form, no material changes than what you've seen last year, more or less the same.</p>
          <p>Then there are a couple of countries which are, of course, of material interest to you, which is Kazakhstan and Ukraine. At this point in time in both &#x2013; we have taken close to 500 million in terms of actual provision in Kazakhstan last year.</p>
          <p>I think at this point in time between the collateral value of what we have, the way it's covered and the impaired assets, we are at a comfortable stage. But this is something that prudentially we'll have to look at. If there is any asset deterioration, we'll provide. But nothing dramatic, don't expect anything dramatic. It's &#x2013; I think it's in the context. We will manage it through the cycle.</p>
          <p>Ukraine, I think the &#x2013; again, the point of it is, our portfolio relative to everybody else is quite good, and the question that you have not asked but implied is, what's going on or why is it a whole lot better? The truth is that, our portfolio is actually better than the rest. And there are a couple of factors which are not beyond our control &#x2013; under our control macro factors, FX, government policy on certain things, which may force us to do something. If that happens that would affect everybody, not just us. But in terms of our own portfolio don't expect anything materially different than what you've seen in '09. It's more or less similar in working through it.</p>
          <p>And the current &#x2013; without in anyway making an announcement or pronouncement on the political choice process that is taking place, this stability is actually good for us, good for the country and good for business, so once that you begin to flow through, once that flows through I think there is a more positive.</p>
          <p>Then you have to look at Turkey. Turkey, in itself I think is doing &#x2013; yes, the provision levels are high. As I mentioned earlier the fourth quarter was influenced by a couple of single item names. But largely speaking it is okay. So what should you expect in terms of asset quality deterioration and the rest...</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Turkey, as well we &#x2013; there has been a quite huge increase in coverage ratio in the fourth quarter, which is a very conservative stance, as you can see 12% higher coverage ratio.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you look at the other countries, I think in general you have to break it down into &#x2013; so we've spoken about Poland &#x2013; I am sorry, we've spoken of Poland. We've spoken about Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and then, you look at the middle countries. So if you look at Hungary, if you look at Bulgaria, if you look at Romania, I think it is going to be challenging as in last year. Nothing &#x2013; no dramatic deterioration, but it is going to be challenging. We have to manage that through.</p>
          <p>Czech Republic, Slovakia, quite positive overall. Croatia, we've already touched upon early in terms of the &#x2013; relative to the economic contraction, I think we will be, okay, no surprises there. Bosnia is too small at the end of the day, but effectively it will just flow through. So that pretty much covers the texture and the flavor in terms of the large countries.</p>
          <p>The only one I have not covered here right now is Russia. Russia, the overall picture is beginning to get better. There is a distinct improvement both in terms of what we are having to do in terms of asset quality trends but also in terms of demand. This is intrinsically linked to, at the end of the day, the price of oil. So if it stays at 70, $80 a barrel, you'll see it flowing through, you'll see the same companies being able to &#x2013; that was struggling, are able to refinance themselves, they are able to pay back, they've done structural improvement. So I think net-net I'm quite positive actually in terms of the &#x2013; what you see bottom up on Russia.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Giovanni Carriere from Autonomous Research. One question on the change in mix market risk weighted assets. Could you explain a bit on that, is it going to be anything meaningful and what's the trigger?</p>
          <p>The second question could you comment a bit more on corporate spreads in Italy, assets spreads I mean mark-ups? Clearly things in retail are improving significantly as late as January for the system thinks don't feel like they are improving, but I wondered what you are seeing?</p>
          <p>And then lastly bit more of a strategic question. I get the sense comparing UniCredit two or three years ago to what it is now that the firm has moved a bit more towards a more product-based approach across geographies, right? But now we have bigger data for the CIB across the Group and it looks like that a potential new structure in Italy is emphasizing product lines. I wondered what &#x2013; but first am I correct in seeing this trend over the last few years?</p>
          <p>And second what are the different considerations, if yes, that they are going to into this change? There is clearly &#x2013; the synergies, customer focus, considerations, as well as I guess also market consideration as investor I mean we don't speculating as to what regulators are thinking. I do get a sense that the market is giving a premium to those institutions where they basically complete visibility on capital allocation, NPLs, liquidity by country and I am not saying that the market is right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can start from the last question which is the most strategic one. To be honest, the strong focus we have is on customers. Then we have to be able to leverage the customer across the countries. So, it's not a change in terms of strategic perspective of the Group. We think that clearly &#x2013; and we can discuss if Europe is a single country or a single market or not, in my opinion we're moving in such a direction because if you consider the discussion which are undergoing on the supervision and regulation side, we're moving in such direction, we have seen the proposal by the commission, the European Council, the Parliament now is even &#x2013; at least I think the two proponents. So &#x2013; and for us, a key element is really to be capable to exploit the value we have in our customer base with the products we're capable to add, thanks to our economy of scale.</p>
          <p>This is our strategic view. Thanks to the deal we have done and also thanks to the work have been done by the colleagues in this &#x2013; in the last three years you are referring to, we have good factories. And we are paid in order to exploit as a value of our customer base. Then a different story is the way we will or we represent our side, so we think that for you is important to understand what is our capability of having synergies. We have been always convinced that transparency is important. We think that for you is important to understand us both on geographical base and on the business line base, and this is the way we're representing our self, again being based on the customers.</p>
          <p>This is also the reason why Roberto and Sergio are responsible for families and things in the four major countries. We have Roberto and Corporate Investment Banking and Private Banking; Sergio in order to have this capability. And if you do see the organization and then is pretty clear, there is coverage. So Roberto <mark type="inaudible" /> Piccini, Buschbeck, Piwowar and <mark type="inaudible" /> for the four countries get one for Marketing Product and Segments and Cicala for the factory. Sergio will have exactly the same organization with Peluso, Diederichs, Bernkopf and Kopyrski on the coverage side and we have it on leasing B2B markets and plus Giordano &#x2013; Ogliengo, yes, for F&amp;A and Giordano for Marketing &amp; Segments.</p>
          <p>So, there is always on one side coverage on the other side Marketing &amp; Segments which unify the service model and the service provider to product providers. I think it's quite a good organization in to order to be capable &#x2013; to exploit how you expect.</p>
          <p>It's also important for instance to say that TJ Lim and Mike Hammond are reporting as well to Federico Ghizzoni for Central Eastern Europe, because our Central Eastern Europe is a mine of value we have and we have to be capable to expand this &#x2013; to exploit this mine. So I think that that answer to your strategic question, again, is the base of our strategy view. On market risk, weighted assets, Karl will answer and then on the spread Sergio and Roberto can answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the market risk side, I think you've seen a material decrease from 20 to 9 odd billion the essence of that is actual rigorous de-risking process that has taken place throughout the year. Accelerated after the summer because the markets opened up, but there has been a massive material de-risking that has taken place. The second, this has happened despite the fact that we have put as of July a much more conservative rigorous VAR model in place. So this is &#x2013; so the central message is that the de-risking when you go into the de-components of it is being very, very material. So this of course the conversion factor is exactly the same, so therefore the RWA reflects that element of it.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you allow me just to complement on what Mr. Profumo just mentioned on the organization, at the end of the day, the commercial network is measured on 100% of the revenues of the clients, no matter which product. So there is absolutely no conflict and actually our relationship managers and our network is motivated to look at the overall relationship, knowing that there is a high degree of flexibility in using products as a leader in to the relationship to deepen the total share of wallet we have with clients.</p>
          <p>In respect of our margins of course, I think that the repricing efforts has been the factor completed. We have seen a little deterioration in the margins in the fourth quarter, but it's totally correlated with the cost of funding of the Group. Clearly as the situation normalizes, clearly we can't continue to have this design but we are talking about two, three basis points. So I think overall when I look at the F&amp;A activity, our spreads went down by 2 bps from &#x2013; so nothing material. So I do expect this trend to continue maybe a couple of bps in on there, but clearly totally related to our cost of funding.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Retail, I would say that spreads have become healthier almost everywhere &#x2013; Italy, Austria, Germany and Poland. Even in some areas where in the past they were almost structurally unhealthy. I make an example, medium-term lending in Italy used to be very unprofitable, now we are getting 200, 250 bps on the lending on a small business medium term lending on top of which the upfront fees has been increased.</p>
          <p>We have an increased penetration of in short answer borrower protection product, so that becoming quite good. Even in Germany, we've seen some signals of improvements in spread even if very, very clearly in Germany the industry structure with still important, say, majority role that is played by the Sparkassen Genossenschaft and is making all repricing efforts more difficult. Now we really to wait as working capital demand and investment demand increases.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Anke from Execution. I have three questions, please. The first one is on net interest income. I just wonder, ex the 60 million in the fourth quarter, should we basically assume net interest income to go up from the fourth quarter level or stay flat worst case?</p>
          <p>In terms of the cost reduction, I just wonder given the employee reduction in the course of the year, I guess and some of this only coming in the fourth quarter, some further cost reduction should sort of like be in the bag, and how would the five, 6% &#x2013; I think the 6% reduction in staff costs look over year-over-year if you have reduced the total number at the beginning of the year just to see how much you have in the bag?</p>
          <p>And then I just wonder, I'm not quite sure if you're going to comment. But in terms of your potential reorganization, you're going to decide in April. Is this something we should expect financial &#x2013; significant financial benefits or is it more in terms of longer term reorganization?</p>
          <p>And then, lastly, on the &#x2013; what was previously an MIB division, I just wondered if you're willing to talk a bit about the start into the year, or is your 400 million run rate for fixed income revenues a bit of a comment or is it also clearly &#x2013; are you still concerned about your Greek exposure? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On NII, the positive &#x2013; the one-off element was a positive contribution, so will not contribute anymore in a positive way. So the direction will be not up, but down going forward, and also the 60 million was one-off.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ex the 60 million, let's say, we exploited the benefit of reduction in interest rates in relation to wholesale funding and financing of our participation or in this &#x2013; getting the benefit of the reduction of freights in the fourth quarter. So in the first &#x2013; in the coming months it will be more difficult to benefit in this term of the reduction of freights. So, again, we are not in the position to give you a guidance, but let's say, the elements that we commented before were contributing in a positive way, and so there will not be anymore positive contribution. I think that's all I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost side, first of all, we want to clarify that while the numbers that Alessandro showed before that there are 9,500 people less that we have in our staff, we also have a decrease of external people that are working for us because also their overall efficiency in the group was higher and we have the chance also to free up 1,500 external people working for us with a professional reconversion of internal staff that today is doing something before was done by external people.</p>
          <p>The numbers for the first quarter are still positive. We had the last code of the Capitalia plan that will impact clearly also the overall average cost for 2010. Clearly, everything that is staff for us, just to remember the number is 59.1% of the overall cost base is also impacting the other cost, because for each single employee we have an average cost additional that is in the range of &#x20AC;4,500 for each single employee. So, clearly, the average effect will have a positive impact on not only on staff costs, but also on other costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of reorganization, first of all, the plan is mainly focused on the improvement of customer service, as I said before, and this is a key element. There will be also a significant reorganization of the network that on one side will bring the decision closer to the customer, on the other side will have a positive cost effect. But the key focus is on customer service improvement and all the people are already working on that because the key element of their organization as I said before is this new segmentation of the customer base combined with a new design of the network. And this would be realized in the course of 2010. Clearly, this network reorganization combined with the &#x2013; at quarter the company merger would bring as well some benefit on the efficiency side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess &#x2013; I will comment I guess the market segment that you see in the new reporting. Clearly, as we mentioned before Q4 was an industry-wide and seasonal effect. The first quarter is clearly closer to that and therefore the activity as I said before for sure is reduced from a client standpoint of view is very volatile. Because January was somehow good, February not so good, March looks okay. If you look at the rates business, it's clearly confirming what I just said. Credit seems to be a little bit more favorable. When you look at our performance though you have to consider that the de-risking and de-leveraging exercise will have an impact. Having said that, we didn't have a particularly strong first quarter last year, if you may remember. Therefore, when you look at quarter-on-quarter sequential, I think we are quite positive about the development. But when you look year-on-year, I am quite confident about these numbers though they won't replicate Q2 and Q3 of last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning to everyone. I just have a few questions left. The first one is on the cost savings in Italy which were clearly quite impressive particularly in retail. And I was wondering how much of that is related to rationalizing the number of branches, and what's going to come on this front in the course of this year? Secondly, on the concentrate in Germany, it was very low again in the quarter about nine basis points. Is this sustainable run rate? Is this what we can expect for 2010? Thirdly, on Ukraine, I understood the messages that were given. I was just wondering how much of the loan book has already been written-down? What is the non-performing ratio and the coverage for the non-performing loans? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Roberto. What we've been doing during the course of 2009 has been mainly coming from the actual implementation of the Capitalia integration. That has allowed us to actually close approximately 400 neighboring branches and reduced by 2,800 the full-time equivalence. In parallel, what we had has been a continuous migration of the low-added value transactions from physical delivery to online delivery. To give you an example, we moved the actual cash deposit transaction from what was at the beginning of the Capitalia integration of 41% transaction being done through the automatic teller machine to now 52%. This is a huge number of transaction that move from physical to automatic and are allowing this significant decrease. Having said this, the game is far from finished. The actual productivity that we currently have in terms of transaction customers per full-time equivalent in Italy is still significantly lower than what we have in Austria and in Germany. In reality, there is enormous potential of continuing with the actions we've been doing up to now and as a result of this, we expect better and good news on the cost side to come also for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, Alessandro, just to add on top of that the retain Italy is leveraging on the synergies also we have on the operational machine means back-office, IT after the merger of Capitalia. So the overall cost that you are challenging in retail is much less than the combination of the day one after the Capitalia acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a question on retail Germany on the cost side &#x2013; on the cost of risk &#x2013; the nine basis point, I don't think is sustainable over the long-term. It is the result of the fact that over the past few years, we've been extremely selective, and also in a context in which margins were not particularly attractive. So there was no point in pushing ahead with asset growth. The more we'll see attractiveness in increasing lending, the more we're also going to see over time some increases in cost of risk, not necessarily in the next quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On Ukraine. On Ukraine, it's &#x2013; I would repeat what I said earlier effectively what you do look at, when you look at Ukraine, we're fairly comfortable with the level of provision that we have at the basis and also going forward. If I look at the asset quality we will provide prudentially, but no surprises there. I don't expect any surprises I think as the overall environment stabilizes, I think it's actually good news. The only thing that we don't know our extraneous factors, if the government does something or imposes controls which will affect the entire banking industry it's not specific to us. But assuming that that doesn't happen there are no surprises expect more or less what you've seen in '09.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Riccardo Rovere of Mediobanca. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. I have just one question which is in provisions, if I look at your provision in charge, loan loss provisions, in Italy, you are charging more or less 160 basis &#x2013; this is in 2009 for the full year. This is calculated as the brutal average between what you report for retail and corporate. In Austria, looking at your slides and your division on database, you are reporting in 2009 around 100 basis; again, average between retail and corporate. In both these countries &#x2013; and it seems to be &#x2013; the level of provisions seems to be much, much higher than what the &#x2013; actually the system, domestic system are reporting.</p>
          <p>When I say domestic system, I'm talking about in Italy and the other banks that have &#x2013; Italian banks that have reported so far and are expected to report in the coming days. And when I look at Austria, I am mostly referring to Erste Bank where they charged less than 80 basis in full year 2009, and Erste is Austria-like, Bank Austria is the average, what I am trying to understand, the breakdown and the risk profile of your loan book in Italy and in Austria is structurally different from the system average; and the risk profile is structurally higher than the system average or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't feel that we have any difference in terms of portfolio structure. So clearly, Italy banks could depend a little bit on the weighted average of retail and corporate that can make the difference, but &#x2013; and SMEs clearly. But again, in the same customer segment, and the different customer segment you have also different spread. But clearly, we don't feel that we have any differences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, just to complete; in Germany, at least to the numbers I'm looking at, it seems to be more or less okay, at least on the corporate side, more or less the same situation. What you charged in 2009 in German corporate from your slides seems to be higher than what Commerz is charging or charged in its Mittelstand bank division. Is that &#x2013; do you now &#x2013; Germany is a bit different &#x2013; but do you think that in Germany, your loan book breakdown is structurally different again than system average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the cost of risk in Germany is incredibly low. But to be honest, I think that all these numbers must be seen across a cycle. Because to see on a quarterly base, on a yearly base in our opinion is &#x2013; could be misleading. So at the end of the cycle, we can see what has been the real impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you can be sure, is the fact that we are very strict in terms of classification rules and provisioning on the different assets class. So for assets, we feel fully comfortable with what we did.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Just one question on that net interest income, I wasn't clear at all, what is extraordinary, what is not, what is the impact on the hedge &#x2013; of the hedging. So we understand this 60 million one-off. You mentioned the figure of 40 million relating to the hedging quarter-on-quarter, and I don't understand these elements. Can you just clarify what is the amount of net interest income in Q4 relating to hedging of any sort in Italy, Austria and Germany together? And if whatever you have in place and unless you close it, is in place for the whole of 2010 as well. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yes, I think that the relevant information for you is &#x2013; since your aim is to understand the future developments in the delta quarter-by-quarter, rather than to have be &#x2013; component related to the replicating portfolio, which contributed to our net interest.</p>
          <p>So this is reason why I give to you this amount, which is helpful to understand the contribution. The point is &#x2013; and I understand that the aim is to understand what is going forward, that the level of NII we shall see. And my point is, I give to you the two figures, which if you sum up these two elements, you should have a better feeling in terms of how we will lend in the next quarter.</p>

          <p>Just a general follow up. I know you'll be doing more work on reorganizing the Italian business &#x2013; talk about cost savings. But generally, how do you look at your cost structure? And actually, what do you look at in terms of your benchmarking? Looking at it from the upside, it actually strikes the external viewer that you still have significant pockets for efficiency improvement. You run an incredibly large group, but at the same time you have also what it appears to us, a very heavy cost structure base, whether that is in the central headquarter or perhaps in some of the regional businesses in Italy, in Germany. I mean without you wanting to <mark type="inaudible" />, how should we be looking and how are you looking at it in terms of the benchmarking?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we had &#x2013; we are trying to compare ourselves with someone that has a similar, let's say business model; mainly some Spanish players and French players. Today, we are very close in terms of cost structure, using some parameters like asset costs for example, to some Spanish competitors. But by the way, we have our own strategy in cost saving.</p>
          <p>It is a mix of &#x2013; to take care of our staff cost, that is the name of the game up to yesterday. By the way, it was very much driven by the Capitalia deal. Then we have a huge issue in &#x2013; and huge opportunity, if you like, on the headquarters because we are a 22 countries organization. Up to now for us, it was crucial to drive the car to run the show via regulation. Now we know much better people. So it means that we can start cutting a lot of bureaucracy that we have in our group, and we will start streamlining our headquarters across the group starting from the main countries, including Poland in which still we didn't cash the opportunity after the BPH merged. But clearly, Italy has a huge opportunity looking at the holding headquarter and also the regional headquarters for which we are discussing potential actions &#x2013; strategic actions.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we are a big real estate player. Last year, we freed up 250,000 square meters and for this year we have more or less a similar plan that is linked clearly to the staff reduction. And finally, also we expect next year 100 million of potential synergies just for the IT, after the integration of HVB and additional integration in Austria and partially in Poland.</p>
          <p>We'll use part of these resources for financing additional investments in CEE countries in which we would like to grow up also in terms of additional solution. But clearly, the main task for next year &#x2013; the big battle would be in streamline the overall headquarters that we have in our group in which we see a lot of opportunities.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry Francisca, if I should read this same number because I think that the indicators are &#x2013; have to be analyzed and the business model do have a very significant influence. Because when &#x2013; I would like to read you two numbers. One is operating cost on total assets and the risk-weighted asset on total asset. We have operating cost on total asset 155 and the risk-weighted asset on total asset 49. Santander is 152. Risk-weighted asset on total asset 51, maybe we'll have 155 like us, 54. Then pay 112, 30, SocGen 146, 32, and Deutsche Bank 106, 18. So clearly &#x2013; the business model in terms of total asset on the risk-weighted asset is influencing quite a lot.</p>
          <p>So there are no single indicators in this perspective. As Paolo was saying clearly, the headquarter management is very, very important, but as well as Roberto was saying before the way we do manage the networks because the number of transaction we have at the desk, these are a number of transaction, we have another channels is a key element for instance. And we made incredible investments in this area.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we are moving ahead in the annex for retail there is a page which is quite important, I don't know if you have the same number of pages, it's page 31. If you do see what we have in Italy on withdrawals, we have 88% of withdrawals which are made on &#x2013; through ATM. Deposits, we move from 41% to 52 and we are still growing because clearly when we compare the previous UniCredit network with a previous Capitalia network we have huge differences. We move from having 5,000 ATM to 8,000 from 1,960 advanced ATM to 3,400 from 2,000 kiosks to 3,300. All these things are related to the fact of bringing the customer to other channels.</p>
          <p>For instance, in CIB, we have an incredibly low cost income ratio. And if you analyze for us is incredibly more important to increase our revenues of risk-weighted asset and as a cost of risk and the cost income ratio because the sensibility &#x2013; sensitivity sorry &#x2013; in terms of return on equity. On revenues of risk-weighted assets and cost of risk is incredibly higher than the one to cost income ratio. So, I think that we have to continue to work on cost mainly, as Paolo was saying on the corporate center side across the group and on the retail distribution capability, the cost to serve per segment, but the key focus has also to be on revenues of risk-weighted assets as well as cost of risk clearly.</p>

          <p>Well, there was one last question. So you will be starting the questions and we will be starting the end. I am overruling the CFO.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very quick, what's your stable funding ratio under Basel III? And what's the outlook for dividends going forward? And in your restructured loan portion that you showed in the asset quality section, what is a restructured loan under your definition? Is that including loans that you restructured before they go sold basically or only loans where they have gone to court and you went through a formal restructuring procedure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the net capital funded ratio very, very easy because we are still waiting from &#x2013; clarification from the working team and we are going through a quantitative analysis so which will allow us to have a better understanding of the deficit and the commission will take a view how to build up these new KPI, new indicators. So unfortunately, we are not in the position today to give you an assessment of how will be the impact of these new KPI to our actual funding structure, so still working on this.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the restructuring, it's really the hospital phase, so it does not mean that it's in court or otherwise it's a company that needs to be restructured in a way so that they can &#x2013; to put the basic balance sheet structure and their ability to service their debt on a sustainable footing. That's what we mean by restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the dividend policy, clearly as I think all the banks are doing today, we have to see the capital base and then we have to define the dividend policy. Clearly today, we are working with a moving target. As you know the discussion on Basel III are still ongoing. We feel very comfortable with our capital base, but we have to understand what would be the final implementation of the Basel III rules. So I think that it's something, which is really difficult to be predefined. As you know perfectly, our board is very careful on dividends also because a huge portion of our capital base it works for their institutional role on dividend. And so we have to manage properly that element. But there is an interest in evidently in inflow, very well represented at the board level.</p>
          <p>So many thanks to all of you and have a good day.</p>
