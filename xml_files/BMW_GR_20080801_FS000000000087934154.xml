        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Maximilian Schoberl, Director of Corporate Affairs. I would like to thank you all for dialing in today under such short notice. However, I think you would agree with me that this call is quite necessary. Today with me here is Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMWHE; and Dr. Michael Ganal, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First Dr. Reithofer will give you all an update on the market situation and the company's operating performance; Dr. Ganal will then take you through our financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Afterwards we will have time for a Q&amp;A session. Mr. Reithofer, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to cover the following points; first, how have we improved our operating result? Second, what are our targets? Third, how do we plan to respond to current challenges? And fourth, how do we plan to secure our future? You have read our ad hoc announcement.  As you know, business conditions worldwide have gotten even worse over the past few months. Nevertheless, BMW Group has improved operating performance during the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>First, we have managed to compensate for the next strong increase in raw material prices, as well as negative currency effects. Second, we have lowered our functional costs, meaning proportional manufacturing costs, fixed costs and depreciation. Third, we have also optimized material costs. Fourth, our cars' quality has improved further so our warranty costs have decreased accordingly. However, our group results in the first six months of the year have been affected by additional burdens. The used car market in North America is recovering more slowly than expected. As this situation may bring about further risks we have increased our provisions for residual values and credit risks.</p>
          <p>At present these provision amount to a total of 695 million euros. This explains why our current profit before taxes of approximately 1.24 billion euros at mid-year 35.2% lower than the 2007 figure. As we all know, a company's actual performance is reflected in its operating figures. Let's now take a look at what this means. We have taken out additional risk provisions of 695 million euros. We had extraordinary personnel expenses of 107 million euros. Not to forget that the previous year's result included a book gain from the Rolls-Royce exchangeable bond amounting to 61 million euros. When you take these figures into account you will see that our group result has actually risen by more than 190 million euros compared to the first six months of 2007.</p>
          <p>The group's adjusted return on sale is then 7%. If we take out the additional burden from the increase in raw material prices of 152 million euros our result would have improved by around 340 million euros. The BMW Group is and will continue to be a high-performance company. This brings me to my second point, what are our targets? Our long-term gross target for the year 2012, which has been determined in our strategy number one, will remain unchanged. So we are talking about an EBIT margin in the automobile segment of 8 to 10% and a return on capital employed of over 26%. For 2010 we have set an interim target; this is when the strategic activities will have an obvious effect on our result.  For the group we plan to achieve a return on sales of about 6% or better. We also plan to achieve an EBIT margin in the automobile segment close to 6% or better.</p>
          <p>In the business year 2008, our main focus today, we intend to reach a return of sales of at least 4% for the group. In the automobile segment EBIT margin is to stand close to 4% or better. We plan to meet these targets despite the strong headwinds in the business environment. Prices for most raw materials are skyrocketing. Since summer 2007 the crude oil price per barrel has risen by 73%.</p>
          <p>The second quarter 2008 alone saw an increase over the first quarter of 26%. In less than 10 years the price per barrel of crude oil has increased more than 10-fold. And it is almost the same for steel. In the last 12 months the steel price has risen by 60%. At the end of the second quarter 2008 steel was almost 30% more expensive than in the first quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>The international financial crisis poses further risks for the global economy. There seems to be no let up in the headwinds on the horizon. Foreign currency effects arising from the dollar, the yen and the British pound will continue to burden our results. Energy is becoming more and more expensive, just think about gas and electricity.  Consumer sentiment is getting worse. This is apparent most of all in the United States, Europe and Japan. New car registrations in the mature markets are expected to decline further, a development that affects us as premium car manufacturer as well.</p>
          <p>And the political environment is not very helpful for those in the mobility business either. There are diverging carbon regulations in different countries. Germany, for example is still lacking a clear decision on a future carbon-based motorcar tax. As a result many customers are postponing their buying decision.</p>
          <p>Now on to my third point, how are we responding to these challenges? We are taking action. We are realigning our U.S. business. This means first we will manage our retail development strategically. This is not the time for mere growth in numbers. What we need is the active management of sales.  Growth must not be achieved at the expense of profitability. We will sell fewer cars in the U.S. this year than last year. But rest assured that this decline will not jeopardize our market position in the United States. A certain share of costs from the dollar area will be transferred to high demand markets. This is also true; it will be a surprise for you or not.  This is also true for cars produced in the United States.</p>
          <p>Second, our global production capacities will be aligned more strongly with crucial sales markets. Plants will become even more flexible in handling demand fluctuations, both upwards and of course downwards. Third, our price volume program will be adjusted.  Our price volume program will be adjusted including price rises. We will start the respective modifications for the American market this year and will continue in 2009 because you cannot do it in one year. Furthermore, we are set to focus more strongly on demand-oriented production. We stand to benefit from our customer-oriented sales and production process that allows us to adapt quickly.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to push forward our strategy number one. In the first half of 2008 we were able to reduce functional costs by 2.4%. I can add it was the first time in our company's history that we were able to turn it around. We also achieved a decrease in material cost per car adjusted for the cost of our EfficientDynamics program.  As part of the strategy we announced our intention to reduce our dependency on the U.S dollar. The expansion of our production capacities in the United States and China is in full swing. And we are also making progress with regard to our purchasing volume in the NAFTA area. In the near future some important decisions will be taken that should be very helpful.</p>
          <p>We continue to evaluate options for corporation in order to achieve further economies of scale. In addition BMW and MINI are strengthening their spare parts and equipment business. We expect a rise in profit in the three-digit million range in this area as early as 2010.</p>
          <p>We are also putting planned projects up for discussion if we feel they might not fully match market developments, internal return targets or customers' demand any more. Personnel reductions are proceeding as planned.  Compared to the end of 2007 we have lowered BMW Group's head count by 1,500 employees.  And if you only consider the automobile segment there has been a reduction of almost 1,700. Since September 2007 we have cut the number of temporary workers by 4,000, which means that we are close to meeting our target of shedding 5,000 temporary positions.</p>
          <p>And not to forget we will also negotiate with the employee representatives about voluntary benefits beyond general pay. I would like now to turn to Point 4. How do we plan to secure our future?  We were the first carmaker to invest in fuel saving technologies. Earlier than others we thought it through and took our decision. So far over 1 billion euros in R&amp;D have been allocated to EfficientDynamics. On average applying these innovations cost 900 euros per car. In addition we have invested a total of almost 250 million euros over the past three years into developing a hybrid powertrain. You see, we have deliberately decided against reducing our investment in favor of improving short-term profitability.  Today EfficientDynamics puts us in the lead.</p>
          <p>There are already 1.1 million BMW and MINI cars equipped with EfficientDynamics. We will begin the model year 2009 with 23 BMW and five MINI models that emit a maximum of 140 grams of CO2 per kilometer. And with the market launch of the new BMW 7 Series due out this fall we are going to set new standards in the segment of luxury sedans as well. At present the BMW 7 Series that needs only 7 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers is unparalled in its class. Compared to competitors' cars our customers in Germany save an average of one liter of fuel per 100 kilometers but for us more important is EfficientDynamics is BMW Group's number one close driver.</p>
          <p>Over the first six months of this year we have increased our global sales volume in the automobile business by 4.7%. We expect new record sales on group level for the business year 2008.  It is our experience that whenever a country launches strict carbon regulations we have a competitive advantage over others in the automobile industry. Many countries in Europe have a carbon-based motorcar tax. We achieved a sales increase of 7.6% compared to last year despite a general market decline during the same time period.</p>
          <p>And now a very interesting example, in France, requirements regarding carbon emissions are very strict.  Nevertheless, we delivered almost 20% more cars to customers in the first six months of this year. The University of Applied Sciences at Gelsenkirchen, Germany recently carried out a study evaluating carbon emissions of various car fleets and comparing the savings potential of smaller models versus that of innovative technology.  The result, as the only German car company BMW ranked among the top three.</p>
          <p>Please keep in mind that our EfficientDynamics program will also enhance the value of our future pre-owned cars. A few years from now on people buying a pre-owned car will definitely pay attention to a model's fuel consumption and efficiency. We are also taking mobility to the next level.  Our first BMW hybrid, the X6 will be launched in 2009. The new BMW 7 Series will be available with a hybrid drive as well. Further car concepts such as the BMW X1 or the Progressive Activity Sedan will also combine sheer driving pleasure and great efficiency.</p>
          <p>The same is true for the model update of the BMW 3 Series Sedan in Touring, due to arrive at dealerships on September 20. As early as this year 500 MINIs equipped with an electric powertrain will be on the streets. This is the next logical step in our EfficientDynamics strategy. Our goal with this project is bringing electric powered mobility much closer to the driving experience we are familiar with today. And as a side note, we are the first car company to start limited lot production of an electric car with lithium-ion technology. So next step is supposed to be a megacity car. Our Project i is working on this new type of mobility concept. We will keep you posted. Before closing I would like say BMW Group has improved operationally over the first half of 2008 and we will continue to define this company's future. We are convinced that this period of change will enable us to become even stronger and make our vision for tomorrow a reality. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. From my side is though, thank you for dialing in today. Ladies and gentlemen, let me come immediately to the topic. In the second quarter of the current financial year a number of key external factors have got worse since last year and since our last forecast. History has rarely seen factors like this occur at the same time. Faced with these changes in conditions and despite a fundamentally positive operating performance in our intensive efforts we will no longer be able to meet our original earnings forecast for the full year 2008. For this reason we have decided to hold this conference call earlier than usual so that we can inform you promptly and in depth about the latest developments.</p>
          <p>First of all, I would like to say a few words about different adverse factors, which have led us to our new assessment. As in the first quarter the adverse factor with the biggest quantitative impact has been the downward trend in the residual value of pre-owned vehicles. The lease portfolio in our balance sheet is valued at 17 billion euros. As we already reported, we increased our risk provision back in the spring. We also introduced a series of measures designed to take pressure off pre-owned vehicle prices, for instance by expanding the company's own marketing program in the United States.</p>
          <p>However, the pressure we are up against remains enormous; the credit crunch and the housing crisis, the weak economy and lower consumer confidence. And so the situation in the U.S. pre-owned vehicle market has not got any better contrary to the forecast we made in April. Residual values remain at an unfavorable level. Also looking at market conditions in July 2008 and the forecast available, a rapid improvement does not yet appear to be very realistic. The current negative mood is illustrated among other things by the traditional consumer confident index of the U.S. Conference Board. In June it fell by 7.7 points to 50.4.  This is the lowest level since February 1992.  Compared to the 65.9% points at the end of the first quarter the index fell by another 15.5 points.  Compared to the long-term average of 97.5 points the index fell by 47 points. And in July the situation was virtually unchanged.</p>
          <p>That is the situation in the United States. At the same time we are starting to see the first signs of similar problems in Europe, too. Economic fundamentals do not look good here either particularly with stronger inflationary tendencies emerging.  Combined with political uncertainties, for instance regarding motor vehicle taxes, this makes consumers noticeably more reluctant to buy. As a result, European markets are also seeing increased pressure on residual values, for instance in Italy, Spain, and lately also in Germany. So the situation in the market for pre-owned vehicles has further deteriorated.</p>
          <p>A similar situation applies to the financial sector. Our credit default ratio for the first half of 2008 was 0.56%, up from 0.53% in the first quarter. So things have worsened here too. Under these circumstances we have increased our additional provision for residual value and credit risks from 236 million euros to a current total of 695 million euros.</p>
          <p>Of that total, around 450 million euros are for the Automobile segment, and around 250 million euros for the Financial Services segment. Half of the latter 250 million euros is for credit risks. The remainder is provision for residual value risks. However, if there are growing indications in the second half of the year that prices will stay at their current low-level throughout 2009, it would be necessary to further increase the provision. That brings me to the extraordinary charges associated with the workforce reductions we previously announced.</p>
          <p>This will amount to a total of 107 million euros in the first half year. Essentially, these reductions are more important than ever in the current circumstances. We are sticking to our goal of reducing our workforce by a total of 3,100 permanent jobs by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>As stated previously, we expect these steps to reduce our annual fixed cost by around 500 million euros by 2009. But first of all, we have to shoulder those costs, which is why the second half of the year will also be burdened by further extraordinary expenses associated with the chop reductions.</p>
          <p>The third sector is the issue of raw materials. Up until now we have assumed there would be just a slight increase in prices, although, increases in this area were quite significant already in 2007. But over the past few months the situation has once again risen considerably. For the full year, we start to anticipate an additional burden of approximately 400 million euros resulting from trends in the raw material markets. In 2007, that amount was no more than 288 million euros, in the year before it was 178 million.</p>
          <p>I would also like to say a few words at this point about currency charges, even though their effects are already well known. And do not as such represent an unexpected change for the growth since the first quarter. As communicated earlier, currency charges for the full year will be around 400 million euros higher than in 2007, owing to the deterioration in exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the sectors I have described should give you a pretty good idea of the huge challenges which the BMW Group, and the automotive industry as a whole, faces in times like these. A little later I will talk about what we are doing to respond to this situation, but before that I would like to discuss the results for the second quarter in the context of the current situation. I will explain the key data only, without going into detail on individual items at this point in time.</p>
          <p>First of all, the Automobile segment. This is where increases in raw material price in most of the risk provision occurred based on the loss-sharing agreement with our financial services business. Accordingly, quarterly profit before financial results in this segment were 52.1% lower than the same period last year, at 395 million euros, while the EBIT margin achieved in this quarter was 2.9%.</p>
          <p>EBIT for the half-year totaled approximately one billion euros. That represents a decrease of 31.7% and an EBIT margin of 3.9%. The Financial Services segment is where the credit defaults and the remaining risk provisions occurred.  Consequently, earnings before tax for the second quarter were down 66.1% to 64 million euros. For the half-year it decreased 60.2% to 148 million euros. Despite the current situation our Financial Services business is, and will, continue to be of major strategic importance. That is not going to change. Here, once again, we will make profitability our clear focus. That is why we will not be increasing the penetration rate at any cost; instead we will deliberately structure our Financial Services offerings so that they support our measures to stabilize residual values.</p>
          <p>Now, ladies and gentlemen let me turn to the group. In the second quarter group revenues totaled 14.6 billion euros. That is about the same level as the previous year. For the half-year that brings us to 27.8 billion euros, a 4.5% increase on the same period last year. It is obvious by our revenue performance, was not reflected in a similar trend in earnings figures considering the adverse factors I already spoke about. As I mentioned earlier, since some of the effects were already impacting the second quarter, group EBIT fell 58.3% to 425 million euros. For the half-year it amounted to 1.3 billion euros. Group profit before tax totaled 602 million euros, 43.5% less than the previous year. For the first half-year group profit was 1.2 billion euros, or minus 35.2%. That represents a return on sales of 4.1% in the second quarter, and 4.5% in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>At this point I would like to underline once more that our operating performance has improved. Adjusted for charges from risk provision extraordinary personnel expenses, our group profit has increased by almost 190 million euros compared with the first half of 2007. The adjusted return on sales for the group amounted to more than 7%, excluding the charges associated with higher raw material prices, group profit improved by about 340 million euros. The BMW Group is, and will, continue to be a high-performance company.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the quarterly figures again. Taxes on our quarterly profit were 95 million euros adding up to total tax expenditure of 249 million euros for the half-year. This corresponds to a tax rate of 20%. Net profit for the quarter, that amounts to 507 million euros; for the half-year, a profit of 994 million euros was generated. This represents a decline of 25.8%.</p>
          <p>For the first half-year the R&amp;D ratio, as defined by German HDB, was at 4.8%, down from 5.9% for the same period last year. And so, if the result of seasonal factor's below, the target corridor of five to 5.5% of revenue by 2012. For the full year, we anticipate a ratio of more than 5%. Our policy here remains the same. We will continue to invest in our future and in that way safeguard our technological leadership.</p>
          <p>As far as investment is concerned, this quarter saw a seasonal reduction from 7.1 to 5.7%. For the full year the ratio will most likely level off at over 7%, the same level as last year. In the second quarter operating cash flow amounted to 1.2 billion euros. For the half-year it reached 2.3 billion euros, down 17% on the first half of 2007. Free cash flow from industrial operations thus fell 24.7%, to 780 million euros, during the first of year. For the full year, we expect free cash flow in our Industrial business to reach approximately 1.5 billion euros. This is also reflected in our consistently high liquidity. Our net interest bearing assets in industrial operations currently amount to seven billion euros.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, based on current data, we are now projecting the following targets for the full year. Despite difficult circumstances, which make it almost impossible to predict trends for the second half of the year, we have set ourselves the goal of achieving a return on sales for the group of at least 4% for 2008. For the Automobile segment, that would mean generating an EBIT margin of almost 4% or more for 2008. Despite the current environment, we intend to reach these goals and we plan to do everything in our power to achieve them.</p>
          <p>Another reason to be optimistic is the ongoing improvement in our operating performance, in spite of the increased burdens imposed by raw materials and currency charges. The measures and initiatives to introduce, as part of our strategy, number one, are already proving to be effective. In this way, we have been able to cut our fixed cost and reduce product expenses. We have already outlined further levers and measures on the performance side, in particular, the issue of price and volume planning, as well as the related issue of production modifications.</p>
          <p>I would also like to take this opportunity myself to stress once again that growth is still on our agenda, but right now we are taking a very close look at how much each model can expect to earn. Profitability has top priority. At the same time, we also need to do better on the cost side. In view of this we will continue to push forward our profitability program consistently and intensified in some area. First of all, we will be examining all fixed costs very closely.</p>
          <p>On the human resources side, we will be talking with the employee representatives about voluntary benefits for our employees.  Clearly, benefits like these cannot be static.  They have to evolve inline with the company's general situation and the competitive environment. We will also be slimming down our administrative capacity.  This will make a major contribution to reaching our goal of shedding 3,100 jobs.</p>
          <p>So we see even more possibilities when it comes to material cost as a result of our extensive benchmark. And we know exactly where fine tuning is needed to realize further efficiency potential. As you can see, we are taking far-reaching measures on a scale this company has never seen before.</p>
          <p>But tough times need tough actions. What can you expect from the BMW Group up to 2012 as a result of these measures? How do we see our earnings progressing? First, we have already talked in depth 2008, second, as far 2009 is concerned, we agree with most of the experts that the headwinds will get stronger rather than weaker.</p>
          <p>Economic factors will remain critical. That is prices for energy and raw material inflation and consumer confidence. About all the currency situation will remain challenging in 2009, with a continued weakness of the dollar and the pound as well. We have taken additional financial hedges to give out a certain degree of planning stability for 2009, but if the main currencies stay at their current levels we still face major challenges next year.  At this point in time, an earnings forecast for 2009 is neither possible nor does it make much sense. There is too much uncertainly surrounding how conditions will develop from here.</p>
          <p>Third; but in 2010, we will start to pick up speed again. This assessment is based on previous titles of crisis and recovery spaces in the past on the one side, on the one hand. And the fact that by then, the measures implemented by the profitability program will be becoming more and more effective, particularly with regard to material costs, where we will have considerably greater leverage as a result of the generation change taking place among the our key high-volume models. As you know, in the automotive industry, the best time to address cost is when a new model is introduced. And so between 2010 and 2012, we will replace about 50% of our weaker portfolio.</p>
          <p>Fourth, for 2010 <mark type="inaudible" />, we plan to achieve a group return on sales of at least 6%. That represents an EBIT margin of almost 6% or more for the automobile segment. Essentially, we then see ourselves back on track to reach our goals for 2012. For that reason, our profitability targets for 2012 remain unchanged, namely, an EBIT margin of eight to 10% for automobile business.</p>
          <p>So ladies and gentlemen, let me try to draw a conclusion. Let me summarize by saying that we are operating in a macroeconomic environment, which is difficult in every respect. At the same time, our entire industry is being put to change. We are actively shaping that change. You can see this not least from our efficient dynamic strategy. Our strategic projects will strengthen our competitive edge on both the product and the performance side. Of all the premium manufacturers, we were the first to gear ourselves to the challenges of the future. We were also the most consistent and the most ambitious.</p>
          <p>But safeguarding our future naturally means being profitable about all else. However, in this difficult phase, we will not be competing for the best operating figures at the expense of the company's future security. We are profitable, despite the extremely difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves. But the current level of profitability is not enough for us. That is why we are now intensifying our profitability program. But for me, there can be no doubt about one thing, in the past &#x2013; as in the past we will emerge from this situation stronger than before. We have outstanding brands and technological know-how and a highly-qualified workforce.</p>
          <p>We have earned ourselves a competitive edge, when it comes to the major challenge of reducing CO2. We aim to build upon that advantage. That costs money and it will continue to cost money. We will get earnings and profitability level spec where they should be, based on these strengths. Ladies and gentlemen, so far, thank you a lot for listening and now we are prepared to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Alex Albert, Natixis in Paris. I have three question if I may. The first one is regarding the residual value, especially in Europe.  You said that you were seeing or facing some troubles in Europe. So I would like to know if of &#x2013; the 695 million euros, is that something coming from Europe? This is the first question. The second question is regarding the guidance for 2008. You said that you might have to pass some more provisions during the second semester. So I would like to know if this is included in the guidance for 2008? And the last question is regarding 2009, you said it was too early and too difficult to give a guidance for 2009. So could you just elaborate on why it is easier to give one for 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alexis. The answer comes from Michael Ganal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As we said, we have increased our risk provision in the second half &#x2013; in the second quarter of around 450 million. This pays contribution to the fact that Europe is step-by-step affected as well from residual values losses.  The major portion is still caused by the US market, but a part of this 450 is dedicated to the European development.</p>
          <p>2008, yes, we said that the actual development in the market has led us to a cautious step, and we have put this in words saying there might be additional provisions needed in the second half of 2008. But when we mentioned that our target is 4% return on sales, and more &#x2013; or at least, what we said, this did include the sweat coming from this particular aspect; meant, once more increasing the risk provision.</p>
          <p>Third, the guidance for 2010, there are two reasons why we are more precise, and, to some extent, more optimistic for 2010. We said we are really in a very difficult situation. Not just BMW, the macroeconomic situation is difficult for all players in the field. And the car markets are, as you know, therefore effected. And we said this is, to some extent, a crisis. But we looked into how did crisis evolve in the past tense. And what we learned is after certain period of time, most probably &#x2013; at one to two years later, markets did we cover.</p>
          <p>So we don't know what the recovery speed will be this time. But what we assumed, this crisis will not last forever. Second aspect, we explained our profitability program to you. And this profitability project has a strong element in improving the material costs of our cars. Whenever these are focused on new cars to come, they have, by far, higher impact. And I mentioned in my speech, from 2010 onwards we will launch a lot of new cars and these new cars will profitize from our profitability program on the cost side. And these, both aspects together, have encouraged us to be that optimistic in 2010.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have two major questions. Dr. Reithofer, I think it was you, you mentioned the fact that if efficient dynamics gets rolled now, improves residue value in three years down the line for the cars that you sell this year. But isn't the fact that you have not really addressed the price side of your vehicles, exacerbating the problem for residual values of cars that got sold a year or two years ago?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I don't understand why you maintain your volume targets 2012. Isn't the fact that BMW was a too-volume focused organization in the past years, exactly explaining the current reasons? Don't you read anything into the fact that BMW, since the start of the year, was the only premium manufacture to raise risk provisions for residual values. And if so, don't you fear that BMW is structurally a too big organization for the underlying volume there really is, and in case you have to raise lease rates now there's real risk that underlying volume might fail to meet your expectations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me focus on the US market. And, if you look into the US market in the year 2008, to prove my point that we will refocus and readjust the US market. This year we will take out about 40,000 BMWs out of the US market. We will move part of the 40,000 units into growth markets, for example, like Russia, like China and that can be around 15 to 20,000 units. That means we will not produce, of the 40,000 units, about 20 to 25,000 units. So that is, in my opinion, a very consequent step. To help the US market, from a BMW perspective, to recover, and I mentioned, we will increase the prices because, in our opinion, it is a very important step. And of course, as I mentioned, we will lose volume. And our guess at the moment is around 40,000 BMWs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And efficient dynamics I mean, I said France is a very good example for efficient dynamics. I mean if you see the market in Ireland, the first six months of 2008, then you can see it was very difficult to sell cars in Ireland. Because the customers in Ireland, they knew that a CO2-based tech system will come. And from 1st of July of 2008, car sales in Ireland is picking up again. And I mean I have to look the figure again. And I mentioned France, if you see France, they have a very strict carbon emission regulation, and we have efficient dynamics. That means in the first half of 2008, we were able to deliver almost 20% more cars to customers compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>And I mean &#x2013; look, if you see only the next two years, your remark is true to say at the moment, efficient dynamics costs us 900 euros per car. But if you look &#x2013; let me say into the year 2012, 13, 14 and as a car manufacturer and I say it is crystal clear, and a car manufacturer did nothing, then you can spend one centimeter before a wall, and you cannot maneuver anymore. So that means if you have only the next two years in your mind, yes, your point may be valid. But if you have in your mind a strategic focus, then it can be that your point is not valid.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. First question is also concerning residual values. Why should you &#x2013; why do you think that used car prices should grow up again in the second half or only stabilize, given that consumer confidence is falling further, and as you also said, in January you expect headwinds to further increase in the second half and in 2009. And second question is will you stick to your plan to increase capacity in the US?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My answer concerning residual values, there's already assumption on the table from your side that consumer confidence is falling further, might be. But in our expectations, what we experienced the first six months, might have reached a certain level why we, at least for the time being, do not expect a further deterioration, it is already a substantial deterioration. And therefore, we have built up, or derived, the assumptions for the risk provision from this very negative situation as it is today.</p>
          <p>This is so far, incorporated in our figures. If your assumption is proven right, that the situation will further blossom, we had to act accordingly. And this is why we announced today, in case the risk provision has to be increased further up. But we want to watch the market closely in the second half of the year. And then, as I said, we act accordingly. But for the time being we are not that negative as one could be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The capacity targeting the United States will be 240,000 units from the year 2011 onwards. And I mean, we have a lot of volatility at the moment because of currency effects, because of raw material prices and we have to have a higher production capacity in the United States. It's now even more true than two years ago. Of course you can have, from a point in time, on a stronger dollar again. But if you have a better distribution of your production capacity worldwide, it will help you to compensate volatility.</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you and good afternoon to everybody. I mean isn't this whole leaving issue not something where you have to move your business model from push to pull really? And doesn't it tell us that you've been selling above natural demand for a couple of years? And this 20 billion leasing portfolio has to work through your system now. You have to increase leasing rates, and simply create more of a pull effect for your products.  And could you elaborate, and that's going to the question that Jorgen had as well, how much this could affect your unit sales growth, not really longer term? Because BMW, potentially just &#x2013; a company that shouldn't sell so many cars, and such, sell fewer cars at a better price.</p>
          <p>And more practically for us, could you tell us on your 2010 margin target, what underlying volume assumption you have there? That's the first part of my question. And the second question is I think it's a fair point that you're not giving an outlook for next year, because it's really difficult there I guess. But you mentioned on savings that you can achieve savings of 500 million from the labor side. And could you tell us on material costs or some other savings, because that's really something you can plan what you could achieve in growth savings? Is it another billion for material cost? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Arndt . We understand. I think we start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, let me say, if I have 2012 in my mind, of course, we stick to our targets that we intend to sell 1.8 million units. Because in meantime, in my opinion, if a company is not able anymore to grow, the company will be, in a couple of years, be dead. So that means no growth, no additional revenues. So that means, of course, we have plans for further growth. That is one thing. But, the vital question is, when and where will growth be worth while? And growth, to make it crystal clear, at any price, is not worth while nor is growth at any time. So that means in general, of course, we will carry on to grow. But, as I said, growth at any price is not worth while.</p>
          <p>And if I look into the US market, and I said we readjust our philosophy or our strategy in the US market, we take out volume. And, in my opinion, it's 100% the right step to do so. And of course, we will adjust our prices. We move our prices up. You mentioned we are a premier manufacturer. Yes, we are a premium manufacturer. And the possibility is high that we lose volume. And I said my guess is that we will lose about 40,000 units in the US market.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless it is the right step. To do such, now let me say, adjustment, it takes not only one year. It will take 2008 and 2009. But we have to do it now, and now it's the right time to do it. And the current situation is a very good catalyst to do so. But I would like to say as well, I mean, I mentioned it already during my speech, rest assured that this decline will not jeopardize our market position in the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second part of the question will come from Michael Ganal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me refer to your question, are you selling above natural demand? The interesting question is what is natural demand? I think this is formed by the substance we are selling, and clearly the price comes into this game. Our advantage in the past tense was that whenever we calculated our lease rates, we had above average residual value assumptions in the market. And this turned into better lease rates compared to our competitors. So, and with these lease rates, we could place the volume in the market. So, is this natural demand? I would say there was a natural demand based on our favorable lease rates.</p>
          <p>Now, we are affected by a negative, or shrinking, residual revenues. And therefore &#x2013; and we have to say, to some extent we were surprised by this crisis, and fortunately we were not the only one. But this financial crisis did affect our residual values, and did affect lease rate calculation and did finally affect our sales success. But I think it was just the shear consequence out of what happened in the market. And we did not before &#x2013; or let me say, in the years before, we served the market according to the demand. Now the &#x2013; so the answer is I don't regard the sales success as a critical one. It was driven by the demand.</p>
          <p>Now you asked about the material costs, and can we put them into figures when it comes to 2010.</p>
          <p>This is a very difficult exercise. And this is why we still refer to our figure, fixed cost plus two billion and material costs plus &#x2013; or an improvement of four billion euros. Behind these four billion are very concrete measures. I, in particular, talked about new cars to come then we will see a reduce of complexities. Then we will see a better usage of synergies. To some extent we will see economies of scale, one of the reasons why we see growth is a elementary part of our future. So they are &#x2013; the reasons behind, but I can't tell you today what will be the effect of the material cost savings in 2010.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, gentlemen. I've three questions.  The first one is the best way to understand your guidance, is it correct to say, in '08 the real, real operating margin that you take out one-offs is somewhere in between six and 7%, then 2009 you face a pretty steep decline of your margin, and in 2010 it recovers back to some &#x2013; the 6% level you mentioned?  Or is it that you also include in the next two years some restructuring costs, some possible one-offs?</p>
          <p>The second question, why isn't there the consequence of &#x2013; I mean, you are pretty much below the plan after six months in 2008.  Why isn't there the consequence to step up the cost measures in order to come back to your targets maybe quicker than in 2008? I understand you &#x2013; the original targets can be reached maybe 2011 or 2012 now. Why not a step up of the cost measures, or is it simply isn't more possible at this point in time? Or are you waiting more or less for the external factors you mentioned to simply improve over the next one, two years to give you the help from that side?</p>
          <p>And the third question, an open question to Dr. Reithofer, would you say now that the competitiveness of BMW looks weaker than two years ago when you started &#x2013; you started your drop, I mean, looking at how fast things deteriorate at BMW in the crisis compared to your competitors? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you very much, Yorgan Piper . I think we start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look there is a clear answer from my side, I can only say we can see operating strength, and of course we are not weaker after two years. In my opinion we are, from operating point of view, much stronger, and we have improved operationally. And the unusual accumulation of a number of adverse environment factors has overshadowed this strength; I have to say, however. And I mean, if it comes to costs, for example, overheads and function costs, as I said function costs, our own manufacturing costs, fixed costs and depreciation, have been noticeable reduced. And I mean, I would like to give you an example, and then you can judge by yourself are we on the way. I used the example already during our conference call after the first quarter. I mean, if I look into the capitalization ratio of R&amp;D costs, and I compare the previous years, let me say 2005 capitalization ratio 44.8%, you can say roughly 45%. In the business year 2006, full year 47.9% that means 48%.</p>
          <p>The first full year 2007, I was in my job, 42.4%. What that means, as we all know, it's an additional &#x2013; it was an additional burden compared to 2006, and I mentioned other figure of roughly 440,000 million euros, just because of these effect. That means capitalization of development costs versus depreciation, 440 million last year. And this year in the first half, we talk about 221 million. So &#x2013; and I compare now the first half of 2008, our capitalization ratio is about 35%, compared to first half of 2007 about 39%.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, we are crystal clear on our way, and if we look deeper into other operational figures, you can see more or less the same. But I mean, if you focus the current BMW challenges, then you can say our strong market position in the United States is one of the most important factors of our issues during the first six months of 2008. And I mean, have in mind, 695 million euros for additional provisions, and the 107 million for job cuts. I mean, it's good for the future, but it's not good for the year 2008. As I said, we are on the way to reduce our capitalization ratio on the R&amp;D side, and that means we work on a lot of fronts. And in my opinion, we are very well and very good on track.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can add one more aspect. You asked isn't there a need for stepping up cost measures. Yes, there is a need, and this was already confirmed in our speeches. And the focus is, beside all the measures already put in place and will be put in place, and there are smaller and less important ones, but we are looking in any and every possibility. But a bigger lever we will address now is that we will start discussions, and you will clearly understand what the outcome will be, that we start discussions with the Works Council representatives about voluntary employee benefits beyond general pay. And this, as BMW is known for, this is not a small amount of money. And if we can succeed in this field, I think it is a strong proof that we have improved our efficiency in this side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley. I just have one clarifying question for Dr. Ganal, and then a question for Dr. Reithofer. The clarification question is, just to be clear, are you saying that you will take write-downs further, or further provisions for residual value risk, if things do not get better? Meaning, even if the residual &#x2013; the used car environment just stays where it is today and doesn't get better, you will have further write-downs? That's just a clarification point.</p>
          <p>And my questions for Dr. Reithofer would be, if you felt &#x2013; if the macro conditions got bad enough, be it used car prices, raw materials, things outside of your control, and you, as a long-term driven company, a innovative driven company with a long-term focus, and not afraid to spend money for sure, would you be willing to losing money for a year, a short-term period like a year, for example, absolute in the red, to be a more successful company, to achieve your targets in 2012?</p>
          <p>And then finally, for Dr. Ganal, does this &#x2013; sorry, for Dr. Reithofer. Does the current environment increase the need to do M&amp;A, in your opinion? Does it decrease the likelihood of M&amp;A, meaning, should you just focus on the core business, or is this a time to actually start to branch out and do more cooperation? Thanks.</p>

          <p>I mean, Adam, just a clear answer, we will be a better company, and we will not be red. Both answers will be true. I mean, if you see the year 2008, and if you can read the signals in the right way, you know that we are in a adjustment phase, in a real adjustment phase. And after the adjustment phase, we are absolutely sure that we will be a better company. But I mentioned prices, for example, in the United States; you cannot do it in one year. We think, to be honest, we need the year 2009 to readjust our company. But definitely we will not be red.</p>

          <p>Your question referred to the risk provision and to what extent the '09, 2010 and '11 off-leases are affected or &#x2013; so our calculation is as follows: The off-leases in '08, as far as they are concerned we have now built a risk provision, which refers to the situation as it was in the first half of the year, more or less. When we talk about the off-leases in '09 and the following years, here we expect, at least it's the basis of our calculation, a certain improvement. We have treated these costs. So a part of the risk provision goes to off-leases '09 and '10, but for the time being, as we rely on a recovery of the economic situation, we did expect a certain improvement on the used car side as well. This is why we formed risk provisions for the '09 and following off-leases better than achieved in 2008.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have got a very simple question, rather &#x2013; or rather two questions. Firstly, it's on in general on the premium car market that you have told us in the context of your number one program what you expect in terms of penetration rates here for the global premium car market. My question is when we run now into recession here in Europe, is there chance that the penetration rate maybe can fall here, so that in general less premium cars will be sold? So what is worrying me particularly is the product mix shift that seems to accelerate. So does that mean that there is also generally a lower demand for premium cars, especially for your higher profitable premium cars?</p>
          <p>And then second question is do you still expect a rise in unit sales for the BMW brand in 2008? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Schneider. Michael Ganal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with the second question, as you know we announced and we committed to a volume increase in 2008, as well. And we stick to this forecast. We think even on the BMW side, on a worldwide scale, we will grow in 2008.</p>
          <p>The other question is what about the future of premium cars in Europe, will they be affected by the expected or the &#x2013; maybe the upcoming more difficult environment? This is clearly an argument which might affect the demand. On the other side, I think the environmental issues, the CO2 issues, if they will be supported tax-wise, as they are already supported, for example, in France, this might increase the demand. People might ask for new cars which has less fuel consumption. So I think we should not expect a sharp downturn in the European market.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you very much. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll now move to Frank Biller from LBBW.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have actually two questions. The one question is relating to your dividend payment, expecting your new guidance for 2008 figures, were you then still increasing the payout ratio, let's say, assuming as payable dividend?</p>
          <p>And the next question is on &#x2013; based on raw material price and additional burdens, you mentioned about 400 million additional burdens from the raw material side in 2008. I was wondering how much is going into the accounts in 2008, because right now there are some negotiations with steel manufacturers about new contracts, new pricing, also going into actual accounts here in 2008. And of course, a higher burden in 2009. Would it be fair to assume an additional burden of about 600 million in 2009 from the material side? And also from the forex side, as well, the 400 million in 2009, that would be my assumption, and maybe you can confirm or give a glance if it's too high or too low?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. We'll start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My answer towards dividend payments is we are sticking to our dividend policy that is oriented towards the Company's financial performance and overall strength, as well as characterized by stability and continuity. That will be my answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Raw materials, Michael Ganal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Raw materials, we told you in detail what we had to compensate in the year 2008 and the years before. Now we can speculate what will happen in 2009, what we saw, and this is why we will not participate in this speculation. In the last days watching the raw material, you saw that the prices went down. So I think there is no natural expectation, or there is no increase which will be &#x2013; confront us at any reason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. I think we have time for two additional questions. I think the next will be Christian Breitsprecher, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon.  Yes, hello, good afternoon. It's Christian Breitsprecher. Just two precise questions on volumes. Could you say exactly what is the production cuts that you're anticipating for the second half of this year? Is it 40,000 units or 25,000 units? Maybe you can give us a more precise number there.</p>
          <p>And then looking into next year, I mean, you talk about optimizing the price volume function. If you do that, I mean, what is your assumption what's going to happen to volumes? Is it a 4% decline, 5% decline, or is it flat? Just to give us an idea, based on current macroeconomic situation, what is your underlying assumption for 2009, what will happen to volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Norbert Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, if it comes to volume, for the total year 2008 we expect a production cut of above 30,000 units. I cannot say at the moment it will be 32,000 or 35,000, it's too early, because if the markets would pick up again, then we need more production volume. If we go into the other direction, we need a further cut. At the moment my guess is for the whole year 2008, more than 30,000 units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well we are now at the starting point of our budget discussions. What you saw in 2008 that we had to adjust our volume planning. And similar might happen in 2009, but there aren't any decisions taken yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a good question for Q3.  Last question, John Buckland [Mann Securities]?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Hello, can you hear me?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a comment, first of all, I mean, I always understood that BMW always at least used to have a reputation of being conservative. It's seems that this conservativism is being diluted somewhat. If you continue to say we need the market to recover in 2009, '10, not to avoid further residual value write-downs. It would be a natural assumption, given the current environment, given the outlook, that conservative would necessitate for you to say that there isn't going to be a recovery. In fact, you could argue that because of the success of your efficient dynamics, the cars, BMW cars, that have don't those efficient dynamics are even more difficult to sell than before, even without this crisis. And we may be &#x2013; you could almost say that we need to write down those used prices by the cost of EfficientDynamics employed in the new car prices of 900 euros per car. What is the residual value write-down per car in your assumption, and should you not be increased to 900 per car?</p>
          <p>And then you say for this year your forecast of 4% includes some assumption that you may need to increase provisions. What is that number of provisions that you say is in that 4% number? We need to have some greater clarity, I think, at least on what your assumption are.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Michael Ganal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To me it's quite difficult to start an answer if you already rule out the importance on the influence of the market. So I think we are all dependent on the market development. And if you say here you cannot rely on recovery of the market, okay, but then we are really in a difficult situation. We all rely on and we all live with the ups and downs in the market. For the time being we live with a downward trend. But as I've said, and I think so far nothing is wrong about that, what goes down must go up, and therefore we have committed to certain targets in the future to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but is it &#x2013; I mean, can we rely on a market recovery in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, come on. This is the reason why we have not committed neither to volume nor to profit in 2009. But as I said before, we have analyzed the crises in the past tense, the last 30, 40 years, and how did they effect the development of the car markets, and we have all the crises did effect the car market, sometimes there was a downturn of more than 10%, but it did never last longer than two to three years. Never. And now you can question whether this time it will last five years, but at least in the last 10 crises we have analyzed, there were some sharp crises. Most often it was the story of one year, and now we can discuss about the speed of recovery. But the total &#x2013; the car markets did recover.</p>
