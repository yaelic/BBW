        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to the Lloyds TSB Full Year Results Presentation for 2007. With me up here on the platform are Eric Daniels, the Group Chief Executive and Helen Weir, our Group Finance Director and they'll both be making some prepared comments after me, following which we will open the ... open up the floor to questions.</p>
          <p>I am particularly pleased to be standing here today presenting these results. Firstly because as you know, 2007 was a really good year in terms of both our operating and our financial performance and this notwithstanding the turbulent backdrop of recent times and events.</p>
          <p>But more importantly this set of results is part of a continuing journey over the last four years or so which has transformed this company into the strong and growing organization that it is today.</p>
          <p>Whereas I'm pleased, I perhaps understate what I really feel. I take great pride in our performance as a company. Yes, profit before tax of 3.9 billion is a great underlying financial performance. But there are so many other achievements of this Group that don't necessarily always get there due credit.</p>
          <p>Our position is number one in current account ... in the current account market, in personal loans, in new business start-ups and home insurance and so on, our high scores around customer service and customer advocacy, with our key focus around wanting to help our customers to succeed financially.</p>
          <p>The industry recognition that we receive for products and services that we provide. I mean, just to pick a couple: most trusted banking in Britain, for the seventh year running; corporate bank of the year, for the third year running; best individual pensions provider, and the list goes on.</p>
          <p>I am proud of the achievement and the commitment of our employees. Not just to Lloyds TSB itself, but their commitment and involvement in their communities through, for example, the work they have done both for and with <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Our work around social responsibility partly, through the Lloyds TSB Foundations, who give away over &#xA3;37 million each year, one of the largest corporate donors in the country and reinforced by our work in the community supporting the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
          <p>And last, but by no means least, our work around Climate Change, and where we set out ourselves stretchy targets for reducing our CO2 emissions, a 30% reduction by 2012, and the commitment which we have achieved to be carbon neutral through the purchase of credits in 2007.</p>
          <p>This sort of performance and these achievements do not happen by accident, and they're a credit to the strategic vision and leadership of Eric Daniels and his management team. That's what they have brought to Lloyds TSB.</p>
          <p>Today, we have a strong and sustainable business built around the lower risk, low volatility business model. It's one which continues to thrive and grow due to deep-set relationships that we have with our customers, based on the products and services that meet their everyday financial needs. And whilst we're likely to see a slowing of the UK economy during 2008, we're confident that our business model cannot just withstand the downturn, but continue to grow. In many respects, these are the conditions that will prove the strength of the model that we have created. For these reasons, the Board of Lloyds TSB has decided to increase dividend for the year by 5% to 35.9p per share. And going forward, we expect to continue to grow the dividend over time whilst also growing dividend cover.</p>
          <p>And on that positive note, let me hand you over to Helen who will take you through the numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Victor and good morning everyone. This morning I'm pleased to be presenting another strong set of results, which once again demonstrate the momentum we've established in our business. Notwithstanding the relatively limited impact of the market dislocation, we've delivered a very good performance.</p>
          <p>On a strategy basis, earnings per share were up by 17% and economic profit up by 21%. These figures include the significant disposal gains made on the sales on non-core businesses. To get a better sense of the underlying momentum in our business, it's more appropriate to discuss the trends excluding the impact of these disposals, and other one-off items including the settlement of overdraft claims and last year's pension scheme credit.</p>
          <p>On this basis, profit before tax is up by 6%, with earnings per share and economic profit growth of 8% and 9% respectively. Our return on equity is also increased slightly from an already high base. Overall income growth of 5%, despite the impact of market dislocation, demonstrates the good progress we're making in delivering our relationship strategies across our businesses.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we've continued to maintain strong cost control, with group expenses up by only 1%, giving a robust set of positive jaws. This, combined with our strong top-line performance, means that our trading surplus grew strongly, up 9%.</p>
          <p>Impairments were up year-on-year in part as a result of the market dislocation, with the result that profit before tax grew by 6%. However, included in these figures is a 280 million charge relating to the market dislocation in W&amp;IB. Adjusting for this to get a better picture of the Group's operational performance during 2007 would result in strong double-digit profit growth with revenue up by 6% and profit before tax up by 13%. And this is after a charge of more than &#xA3;100 million in respect to flood-related claims.</p>
          <p>We've made fundamental improvements to the business in the last three to four years, and the results are evident on each line of the P&amp;L. Firstly, the good income growth is a result of our focus on building customer relationships and gaining greater share of our customer's wallets. This shows first in our sales figures and then in income. The good news here is that we are building annuity-like income flows, evidenced by the strong flow in liabilities. In addition our margin is improving.</p>
          <p>On costs, we continue to focus on sustainable cost reduction that then creates headroom for further investment in the business. Our productivity program has once again delivered benefits ahead of target. And we remain well on track to deliver net benefits of &#xA3;250 million in 2008, even after reinvestment.</p>
          <p>Our asset quality remains satisfactory. We've actually seen an improvement in the quality of the book reflecting the relatively conservative nature of our business model. Alongside this, we've continued our work on capital efficiency and on transition to Basel II, we'll actually see an increase in our Tier 1 ratio and a stable capital ratio. Last, the robustness of our model including our strong customer deposit base, has meant that we've continued to fund very successfully during the recent market turmoil.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the drivers of income growth. Firstly, balance sheet growth. In retail, asset growth was 6% driven primarily by mortgage balances, while unsecured retail lending was broadly flat in a slightly declining market.</p>
          <p>We've seen very good growth on the liability side of the balance sheet and our savings growth has been particularly strong. Retail deposits increased by 8%, including strong growth in bank savings, which were up 15% and wealth management, up 12%. In the last six months alone, retail savings balances were up by over &#xA3;4 billion. In the wholesale bank, we saw a strong performance with particularly good asset growth in commercial banking, and in corporate markets where our strong liquidity position has allowed us to continue to lend to good quality customers throughout the more challenging conditions in recent months.</p>
          <p>Liability growth was also robust, with customer deposits up 18%. There was strong deposit growth in commercial across a range of products, especially fixed interest saving accounts, as well as good growth in large corporates and also in our international businesses. So our focus on continuing to build strong customer relationships is delivering good growth on both sides of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Turning now to margin. This is a slide I've used a number of times. The key difference this time, however, is that we've actually seen an improvement in margins in the second half of 2007 compared with the first half. Over the last year or so, we've talked of total product margins being broadly stable, and the decline in margin being driven by mix. While this picture is true for the year as a whole, in the second half some product margins began to increase and more than offset the mix effect. In particular, margins have widened in the corporate book and margins on mortgage allocations have improved. Although the benefit of this will primarily be seen in 2008, as allocations in the pipeline are drawn down.</p>
          <p>Turning to the individual divisions and looking specifically now at the drivers of income growth in the retail bank. This is now a familiar picture. Once again we've seen the liability side of the balance sheet making the greatest contribution to overall income growth. And this is important in terms of income sustainability because liability-led earnings tend to be recurring.</p>
          <p>We continue to make good progress in driving income from both savings and investments. Our focus has been very much on growing bank savings deposits, where we've been encouraging our customers to save regularly. Similarly, we've been focused on growing our wealth deposit book, and have increased the number of customers in our investment portfolio who also bank with us.</p>
          <p>These relationship balances are the more profitable areas of our savings book, and are also important from a liquidity perspective, because they tend to be more sticky. We've also seen good growth in AVA fees as a result of both strong sales and higher fee levels. And last year we opened almost half a million new or upgraded AVA accounts.</p>
          <p>On the asset side, we saw continued income growth from lending, and an increase in commissions from insurance products reflecting improved pricing to risk and an increase in the proportion of sales through the branch network.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the wholesale division, where if we exclude for the moment the revenue impact of market dislocation, income is up 6% year-on-year. Most of this growth came from two key relationship businesses &#x2013; Corporate Markets and Commercial Banking &#x2013; while asset finance income was impacted by the slowdown in the unsecured consumer credit market and tightened credit criteria.</p>
          <p>Commercial Banking income, increased by 8% as a result of continued strong lending and deposit balance growth driven by new-to-bank recruitment. In addition, we saw  very strong growth in cross-group business generation. For example, Scottish Widows product sales to commercial customers, and a new product, such as fixed rate deposits in credit cards.</p>
          <p>In Corporate Markets, we've continued to develop our business with core -... with our core corporate customer base. This long-term relationship strategy, as well as the development of new product capabilities, has enabled us to deliver very strong growth in cross-selling income up nearly 35% during the year.</p>
          <p>Lloyds' development capital growth for the full year was up by nearly 50%; albeit the unusual level of realizations reflect at the half-year returned to a more normal level in the second half. Clearly, no bank can be immune from the significant turbulence in global financial markets over the last six months or so. However, Lloyd TSB's limited exposures in the key areas of contagion mean that we've relatively very well positioned.</p>
          <p>In our news release, we've endeavored to be as transparent as possible and split the impact of market dislocation into its different components. The overall impact on our product to market's P&amp;L is limited to &#xA3;280 million. The first point to note is we've no direct exposure to U.S. subprime ABS.</p>
          <p>We've broken out our CDOs held as part of our structuring business. In terms of the unhedged positions, all the junior tranches are effectively fully written-down, and the limited residual exposure amounts to some 130 million relating to super-senior high-grade notes, which have a 2005 vintage and with no underlying asset defaults.</p>
          <p>We also have a holding of CDO super-senior notes, which is fully hedged with a CDS from a triple rated -- a AAA rated monoline. The gross value of the position stands &#xA3;470 million after we have taken &#xA3;25 million write-down against the CDS protection. At the end of the year, the reliance placed on this swap was &#xA3;155 million.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've approximately 1.9 billion of CDOs hedged by leading financial institutions with any exposure fully cash collateralized. The risk here is, therefore, effectively global bank counterparty risk.</p>
          <p>With limited SIV Capital note holdings, all of these SIVs are fully funded, although the costs of funding have clearly increased. This, combined with some uncertainty of the future funding has led us to take a provision of &#xA3;22 million against these holdings.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had a further 370 million of SIV liquidity backstops of which 98 million were drawn at year end. These are senior facilities, and there's no reason to believe that they're impaired.</p>
          <p>We've also provided details of the impact on our trading portfolio. We're aware that not every bank has done this, but we wanted ensure that we provided full disclosure. We've seen mark-to-market falls in parts of our trading book, which reflects the market wide re-pricing of liquidity into a lesser extend credit.</p>
          <p>Our greatest write-down, at &#xA3;92 million, is in the ABS book, while we've written down our secondary loan trading book, which consists entirely of performing corporate loans by &#xA3;20 million. The remaining &#xA3;32 million represents a variety of small mark-to-market adjustments against high-quality assets, primarily, high-quality senior European and U.S. bank bonds and investment-grade corporates. We're confident in the underlying quality of these assets and expect the recovery in values as and when the market returns to a more normal state.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've seen a write-down through reserves of just over 400 million in our AFS book. Over half of this relates to the ABS assets held in Cancara, our conduit. At the end of the year, all the ABS bonds in Cancara were AAA rated, although since then about &#xA3;70 million of the 8.3 billion portfolio's been downgraded. Since its inception in 2002, there's never been a default on any asset in Cancara. In addition, there's no exposure either directly or indirectly to subprime U.S. mortgages, and only very limited Alt-A exposure. Throughout the credit crunch, Cancara is continued to fund well and at market leading rates.</p>
          <p>The remaining AFS write-downs are split broadly between U.S. Government-backed Student Loans and major bank senior paper, as well as high quality ABS, of which more than 95% are AAA rated. These AFS assets are intended to be held until maturity, and under IFRS are marked-to-market through reserves. The assets are not impaired, and we expect to obtain full value from them on maturity.</p>
          <p>So, overall, as we have said before, one, no financial institution is left unaffected by the recent market dislocation. Our prudent business model has meant that the impact on the group is relatively low.</p>
          <p>Turning to Insurance and Investments, where we again saw good growth. On an EEV basis, Scottish Widows profits were up 6% or 11% after adjusting for surplus capital repatriation. New business sales were up 7%, with sales through the more profitable bank insurance channel up 20%. Contributing to this was the strong growth in protection sales, including the new protection for life product, and also the insourcing the manufacturing of an existing product.</p>
          <p>Sales through the IFA channel increased by 2%, against record eight day related sales in 2006. Retirement income products and corporate pensions grew strongly, more than offsetting a reduction in savings and investments sales, where we choose to focus on margin and not chase  uneconomic business.</p>
          <p>The new business margin remains strong by industry standards at 3.1%, but was lower than last year's, as a result of the in source protection product and a higher discount rate. Existing business profit remained robust with overall lapse experienced in line with the expectations. Weaker persistency in life and pensions was broadly offset by a favorable experience in the OEICs business. And the expected return on shareholder funds increased as a result of the higher levels of free assets and higher returns.</p>
          <p>As well as growth, return is an important metric throughout the Group. This is reflected in the continued improvement in capital efficiency at Scottish Widows. Through, for example, the introduction of an OEIC-backed savings product replacing a more capital intensive life bond.</p>
          <p>As a result, despite a 7% increase in new business sales, less capital was required to support new business volumes. This, in addition to the regulatory changes introduced in late 2006, resulted in  significant improvement in new business capital efficiency. Improved capital efficiency, combined with the capital repatriation program, means that our return on embedded value has again increased and stands at 9.9%. We expect this level to improve further in 2008 as a result of the full year impact of the disposal of Abbey Life, which was a relatively low returning business.</p>
          <p>Turning now to costs. As you'd expect, tight cost management continues to be a priority for us. All our divisions have once again delivered a strong cost performance, notwithstanding the continued investments we are making in the business. All our divisions have also once again delivered income growth ahead of cost growth. As a result, our cost income ratio continues to improve and now stands at 49%, down almost 2 percentage points on last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to impairment, the group charge for impairment losses grew by 15% or 8% excluding the impact of the corporation tax rate change and market dislocation.</p>
          <p>In the retail bank, we've indicated earlier in the year that we didn't expect that retail impairment charge to be any higher in 2007 than in 2006, and our expectations have been realized with the charge actually falling by 1%, and an improved AQR.</p>
          <p>The quality of new unsecured lending continues to be strong, and we've seen lower levels of customer insolvencies, improvements in the group's collections procedures, and a reduced level of retail arrears. In particular, mortgage arrears are down year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Over the last few reporting periods, I've used the dynamic delinquency charts to demonstrate the quality of our new business. I've decided to retire these charts, or this set of results, although they are included in the back of your packs. Suffice to say, they show the same patterns as previously, that recent lending in both our loans and cards books continues to perform well.</p>
          <p>In wholesale, as expected, the underlying impairment charge increased, reflecting a lower level of releases and recoveries, growth in the book and a couple of specific charges in the corporate book.</p>
          <p>Impairments in assets finance followed a similar trend to the retail book falling slightly year-on-year. Asset quality in the SME book continues to be strong, reflecting in part our strategy of focusing on secured lending. So, overall, asset quality in the wholesale remains good.</p>
          <p>In the past year, there have been some questions about our property lending, particularly given the recent growth in the book. So, I thought it will be helpful to give you some facts which will indicate why we're confident in the quality of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>At year-end, the lending to property companies amounted to &#xA3;17.6 billion, or about 18% of our overall wholesale lending. Growth in the second half slowed to &#xA3;1.5 billion. The portfolio split's approximately one-third residential and two-thirds commercial property.</p>
          <p>Of the residential lending, over half is to local authority-backed public housing. Within the commercial property portfolio, over 90% is investment or corporate credit lending. Development lending is less than 10% of the portfolio and is subject to strict lending criteria. We require that the interest expense is fully covered by pre-let income and that the overall level of lending does not amount more than 60% of the gross development value.</p>
          <p>We're relatively underweight in the office in retail sectors, and our geographic spread is consistent with the market as a whole, although, we don't have any office lending in either the City or Canary Wharf. Our loan-to-value on the commercial portfolio as a whole is around 62%. So, I hope this information goes some way towards providing you with some background and context as to why we are so confident in the property portfolio we've built up.</p>
          <p>You may have already seen the new IFRS 7 asset quality disclosures in this morning's announcement. The first point is ... to make is that the quality of the book remains very strong with over 97% of our assets classified is unimpaired. However, the new disclosures enable us to look one level lower by portfolio.</p>
          <p>On this basis you can see that the quality has actually improved since last year, with the percentage of our assets classified as either good or satisfactory quality increasing in two out of our three portfolios. And in the third, mortgages, it's already very high.</p>
          <p>There's been a great deal written about the potential for a slowdown in the UK, and the knock on  impact on impairments. So, I thought it will be a good time to pause for thought and reflect on some key factors that are tied to our impairment outlook.</p>
          <p>In terms of the economy as a whole, interest rates are a downward trend, and our employment levels remain at a relatively low level. In addition, levels of corporate liquidity remain strong. At the same time in our own book, the quality of new business remains good, arrears levels are falling and our underwriting and collections procedures continue to improve.</p>
          <p>So, whilst the economic outlook remains uncertain, many of the current lead indicators are good. As a result, we don't expect to see a significant change in the retail impairment charge in first half of 2008 compared with the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>I've already spoken about the good income and profit momentum in the business. However, this growth has not come at the expensive returns. Our return on equity is high and stable, and during the year, we increased both the return on risk weighted assets and economic profit. Note that these figures include the impact of the market dislocation. So although the economic profit growth is not quite double-digit, I think it reflects very well on the underlying performance of the business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our capital ratios. Growth in group risk weighted assets was 10%, much of which is accounted for by wholesale, where RWAs grew by 14% with an increase of only 4% in the retail bank, reflecting growth in the mortgage portfolio.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect high single-digit or low double-digit annual growth in RWAs, reflecting increased customer lending opportunities. We've repatriated a further &#xA3;1.9 billion in capital from Scottish Widows during 2007, making a total of over &#xA3;3.6 billion in the last three years. Overall our capital position remains strong. Our capital ratios are robust and we continue to have significant capital headroom.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of 2008, we successfully transitioned to Basel II. This new regime impacts both regulatory capital as well as the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The chart shows the impact on our capital ratios, if we'd been operating under Basel II at the year end, so effectively our 2008 opening capital ratios. As you can see, the net effect on the Group is a significant increase in our Tier 1 ratio, while our total capital ratio remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>There are a number of factors behind this. Firstly the risk weightings used under Basel II reflect much more closely the underlying risks associated with our assets. And we've seen a reduction in our risk weightings, particularly in the mortgage book and in our corporate business. Offsetting this is the deduction for expected losses, which at this point in the cycle are actually above our actual provisions. And the disallowance of collectively assessed provisions which were included under Basel I. So, overall our total capital ratio is unchanged, while our Tier 1 increased by 1.4 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Before I finish, I would like to touch on the liquidity position of the Group. Throughout the crisis, we've continued to fund well, and at market leading rates. There are a number of factors behind this. I have already mentioned not just the absolute size, but the growth that we've seen in our customer deposit base. As a result, we have a conservative wholesale funding profile. Our strong funding position is evidenced by our AAA Moody's credit rating, which was reaffirmed only last month.</p>
          <p>A final factor has been the consistent market presence that we've maintained through the recent months, leveraging our long-term relationships. And we ensured that all times we have significant headroom over our short-term funding needs. The recent liquidity crisis has been another situation which our relationship model has proved itself. One of the key reasons for our strong profile is our high and growing customer funding base.</p>
          <p>We currently over ... have over &#xA3;156 billion of customer deposits, the majority of which are sticky relationship deposits. This includes over &#xA3;46 billion of current account balances. As a result of the strength of our relationship customer funding base, our overall wholesale funding requirement is significantly lower than that of our peers.</p>
          <p>Net net, all this translates into a funding advantage for the bank, such that during the recent period of market turbulence, our funding operations continued to fund on a business as usual basis.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the chart on the left, our short-term funding level has remained relatively consistent, even slightly down over the last six months, notwithstanding the credit crunch. And our cost of money market funding has remained broadly unchanged from a year ago. Looking at longer-term funding, using UK bank five year senior CDS spreads as a proxy for funding costs, you can see that in June last year there was very little difference between spreads of the four major UK banks on this chart. By December, while spreads had widened for everyone, Lloyds TSB CDS remained significantly lower than that of our peers.</p>
          <p>Spreads have moved even further out now, but our advantages remained. Our prudent business model and the strength of our customer deposit base, means that we have a demonstrable funding advantage.</p>
          <p>In summery then, 2007 has been a year of considerable delivery, as we've continued to build momentum, notwithstanding the challenging market conditions. We've delivered a strong set of figures and continue to build earnings momentum in a high quality balanced set of businesses. Cost management remains strong, and we've again delivered wide positive jaws.</p>
          <p>Our focus on improving efficiency means that we've once again substantially improved our cost-income ratio. Asset quality remains satisfactory, and we continue to demonstrate that we can both grow the business and maintain our high returns. Finally, we have a robust capital position, having successfully transition to Basel II, and we continued to improve our capital efficiency.</p>
          <p>All this has created an increased confidence in the Group's ability to sustain good momentum, a confidence that's reflected in the Board's decision to increase the dividend, and endorse a progressive dividend policy going forward.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to handover to Eric, who will take you through a further overview of our progress.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much Helen. Good morning and thank you very much for coming. Over the next few minutes I would like to update you on our strategic progress for the year and give you some context  around our results, as well as to what to expect as we look forward.</p>
          <p>2007 has been a good year for the group, despite the challenges coming from the credit markets in the second half of the year. We've shown good progress across the group in furthering our strategy and virtually every front.</p>
          <p>We cannot ignore the 280 million we took in losses from the market dislocation. It clearly impacted our results. However, if you look at the charge in relationship to the Group's balance sheet and profit and loss account, it is manageable and reflective of our more conservative business model.</p>
          <p>We are facing into more uncertain markets than we have seen for some time, but that said, we have solid underpinnings and good momentum. To get a better view of our performance for the year and what's really going on in the business as well as our prospects for the future, it's more appropriate to look at our core business results.</p>
          <p>All my subsequent slides will talk to business performance and exclude the market dislocation impact. All three divisions are growing. We have good income growth, positive jaws, good growth in profit before tax.</p>
          <p>We believe we have significant potential for growth and a substantial track record of accomplishment that gives us the confidence that we can realize that potential. We think that 2007 demonstrates that we're producing good growth and high quality earnings that will be sustainable even with lower economic growth and a more uncertain environment.</p>
          <p>Our core income, excluding the market dislocation impact, grew by 6% in 2006. We've shown sustained momentum over the past five years. The growth in income is high quality and based on building relationships, and reflects another strong year of growth in sales and gains in market share.</p>
          <p>The results are broad based. We saw good progress in each division. Income rose 6% in the retail bank, 6% in the wholesale bank, and 7% in the insurance division. As Helen showed you, we worked every line of our P&amp;L effectively.</p>
          <p>In addition to broadly based income growth, we had good jaws and well controlled impairments. PBT as a result increased 13%, again excluding the impact of the market dislocation, continuing the good trajectory that we've established over the past several years.</p>
          <p>As you know the guiding principal for the group has been to deliver double-digit economic profit growth on a consistent basis. With the strong profit before tax and the rigorous management of capital, we delivered a 20% growth in economic profit for the year. Our expectation is that our current momentum, which is based on solid fundamentals, will allow us to continue to drive future profit growth.</p>
          <p>Our future growth will in some measure depend on what happens in the market, but in a much greater measure to our ability to be able to grow share. Looking first at the market: this is a good market to be in. It's the second largest economic profit pool in the world after the U.S. And the economic profit pool will continue to grow over the medium-term.</p>
          <p>UK households have the greatest financial wealth of the major countries in Europe, and the UK has the lowest unemployment rate amongst the G7. Within the market, we expect to see strong growth in long-term savings, as Britain's demographics change, which plays well to our strengths in customer, distribution and product. We think the UK market remains an attractive one over the medium-term.</p>
          <p>The second and most important driver of our future profit growth is our ability to capture share within the market. We do not see any near term limits to growth. We currently have only about a 10% share of the economic profit pool for financial services, and we believe we can enhance that participation, as we only have about one-third of our customers' wallets today.</p>
          <p>We are gaining new customers at record rates, and we're deepening relationships, such that we are gaining share across a broad spectrum. Our relationship-focused business model has driven growth over the past few periods and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>We fundamentally believe that our business is about efficiently acquiring customers and serving their full set of financial needs over their lifetimes. We believe our relationship model leads to higher quality income, as much of the revenue stream is recurring. Having the relationship allows us the opportunity to cross-sell against additional customer needs.</p>
          <p>The relationship focus also leads to lower costs, as incremental sales to existing customers are more targeted, more effective and far less costly. We don't have to acquire a new customer in order to sale a product.</p>
          <p>Our relationship approach also leads to better controlled risk. We know our customers well, and we are better able to assess their capacity for credit. When we designed the model, we consciously set our risk parameters with a view to losses through the cycle. If you believe relationships are over a life ... over a lifetime are the key driver to your business, it serves you well to help your customers manage their credit position.</p>
          <p>As our strategy is less subject to cyclicality and has more stable earnings, this translates into lower volatility, and therefore lower capital requirements. The result of the relationship strategy is sustained profitability and growth.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the divisions and talk about the quality and sustainability of earnings, and why we will continue to deliver over the next several periods. Turning first to the retail bank, we've moved to ... the franchise to a strong relationship focus over the past several years. As you can see from the chart only 15% of our earnings are product driven, principally IFA introduced business, and some non-franchise card sales.</p>
          <p>Importantly, if you look over the past two years, relationship driven revenues have increased by 11% whereas product driven revenues have improved by 2%. The UKRB is a terrific franchise and the great majority of the revenue and our future growth comes from relationship selling.</p>
          <p>A critical part of the approach is managing customer information. In the retail bank, we have 18 million customer records, and we see 16 million transactions a day. That give us over 2,000 data points for each customer and, as evidence by independent benchmarking, we are rated top quartile in our customer relationship capabilities. The data is now well-integrated into our sales processes, and allows us to sell to customer need and price to risk on an individual basis.</p>
          <p>Additionally, our data provides us critical early warning indicators about individual customers, as well as broader behavioral trends. By way of example, in the third quarter of 2007, we noticed a change in our customers' behaviors as they were spending more on food and less on clothing. This was an excellent indicator of a more cautious consumer and a shift in consumption patterns. We used our data to tune our lending policies and to change the sale force emphasis.</p>
          <p>Let me give you an example of how we use customer understanding to grow the business. Two years ago we identified a modest shift in consumer behavior away from consumption and toward more concern for savings. The slide on the left is what I showed you in February of '06. The heat map identified areas where we expect to see stronger income growth from consumer demands, such as savings and investments, from the over 45 year olds.</p>
          <p>We focused on the opportunity, renewed the products set and improved the sales process. As you can see from the chart on the right, we had a 16% growth in liabilities over the two year period. We also managed lending growth effectively, flexing our scorecards to reflect the environment and this supported the improvement in impairments.</p>
          <p>We have the best single brand distribution network in the UK and in recent periods, we've shown how we can systematically use it to grow share as we've developed the skills to acquire and deepen relationships.</p>
          <p>We're building market leading positions. We're the number one in terms of the acquiring new current accounts and new credit card issuance. And we're number one in terms of both flow and stock for added value accounts, home insurance and personal loans. We're continuing to grow our sales volumes, which rose 17% during the year to record highs.</p>
          <p>One of the things we watched carefully is the new current account sales as they are the key to relationship banking. In 2007, we opened over 1 million new current accounts, a fantastic achievement by Terri and her team. We're improving our ability to cross-sell ... to sell more products to customers at the initial account opening. We're currently selling 1.2 additional products on average for new-to-bank customers, up from half a product two years ago.</p>
          <p>We've shown that we can successfully acquire customers and to cross-sell them. Despite having made considerable progress, we know we have significant opportunity within the franchise. Of our customers who use a savings account, only 50% of them have them with us. Of our customers who have a mortgage, only 25% of them have them with us. The potential of the existing franchise is significant, and it will continue to grow as we capture new customers.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned before, we run lower risks as our lending is principally to the franchises customers. In mortgages, we sell a higher percentage of loans to customers than any other major lender. We avoid the more extreme areas in the market and we focus on profitability rather than share. We have very good loan-to-value ratios with 63% on new business and 44% on the book overall. We do not offer self-certification mortgages and never have. As a result, our three month arrears actually fell during the year, down 12% and we have deminimus impairments.</p>
          <p>The unsecured portfolio is also performing well. The major emphasis again is on franchise lending where we use our superior customer understanding. 99% of personal loans and 89% of cards are sold through to franchise customers.</p>
          <p>During 2007, we saw falling arrears in impairments as our portfolio held up well. Wholesale and international, in our case, is also fundamentally a relationship business. We derive 70% of our profit from relationships. Over the past two years the income from relationships has grown more than three times as fast as that of products. In commercial banking, one of our key relationship franchises where we look after customers with the turnover of up to &#xA3;15 million, we've seen further strategic progress. Truett and his team have put in place a platform to grow. We're experiencing record customer satisfaction in combination with strong product offers. We have leading share of start-ups and we are a net gainer in terms of attracting more valuable switcher accounts. As with retail, we're getting stronger results from relationship deepening and we saw a 23% improvement in cross sales, including of 36% growth in Scottish Widows products. And a 15% growth ... please excuse me, a 15% growth in sales from commercial finance products. We have a similar story in the other wholesale relationship franchise, corporate markets, where we made further progress during the year.</p>
          <p>In our key target segment, mid-market corporates with turnover between 15 million and 250 million, we saw great success with a two percentage point gain in share, as validated by TNS. In another major survey, we were rated the top relationship bank. Just as importantly, we continue to invest in the relationship management teams, and we are building up the specialist sale forces to serve our customers and better meet their needs.</p>
          <p>We made great progress again last year in cross-selling product into Corporate customers, with a very impressive 46% increase. The wholesale and international bank is focused on serving relationship customers. And this has limited our exposure to the product based issues that currently confront the industry. As a result of our relationship orientation and through the cycle risk polices our portfolio is in very good shape. And asset quality has actually risen over the past few years.</p>
          <p>The insurance and investment division is a key part of our strategic model and is growing well under Archie's leadership. We sell their products into our customers across the group, and the division has seen good profit growth as a result. Scottish Widows overall sales are up 7% with bank insurance sales up 20%, and the bank insurance share of Scottish Widows sales continues to grow.</p>
          <p>We are seeing similar progress in other parts of insurance and investments. For example, franchise sales of home insurance continue to grow strongly up 14% in 2007. Scottish Widows investment partnership is managing more and more of our customers' assets, with the growth of 46% in new products designed for the retail bank. We've seen ... what we've seen in each of the divisions is that we have built high quality sustainable incomes streams that are relationship based. At the same time, we are driving our productivity across the Group. We've consistently worked our cost income ratio, which improved again in 2007 from 50.8 to 49%.</p>
          <p>Significant investment programs are key to supporting our future growth. Each year, we invest about &#xA3;1 billion, or about 10% of our revenues. We are investing in four key themes that's support our relationship strategy. We are making it easier for customers to access our products and services, improving our effectiveness with customers through more training and better tools, enhancing our products and services to deepen wallet share, and improving our efficiency, which also supports future investment.</p>
          <p>We have the confidence that our model ... we have confidence in our model as we have demonstrated it delivers high quality earnings through the cycle. As Helen showed you, we have a strong capital position and enjoy a funding advantage. We have a large and growing customer deposit base. And we have no need to turn over our balance sheet in order to be able to achieve asset growth.</p>
          <p>We're advantaged in that we have a deep understanding of customers, which affords us the opportunity to grow. Our through-the-cycle approach to risk gives us less volatile earnings. We are well placed for growth.</p>
          <p>So, summing up, 2007 was a good year for us. And we showed good momentum across the business. We are, however, conscious that the environment in which we operate has changed and we have taken a loss from the market dislocation.</p>
          <p>That said, we're building the business, and have been able to show consistent progress year-over-year. In each of the core businesses we've established good momentum. We enjoy strong shares, and we have significant headroom available to us in all our markets. Our strategy is producing good results and gives us confidence in our future outlook. We're delivering double-digit economic profit growth and we will continue to use this as our objective. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Oh. Yeah. It's Sandy Chen from Panmure Gordon. Three quick questions if I may? One, just looking at the lending to non-bank financials on page 44. That's probably more a question for Helen?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. It's ... looking at the lending to non-bank financials on page 44. I know this has gone to 29.7 billion now up from 23 billion at the beginning of the year. Could you give us some more flavor to what that non-bank financial lending is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be a variety of different things in terms of products. It's not just non-bank financials, financial business and other services, so it will cover a variety of different areas. I'm not sure I can provide you with any more details off the top of my head. I don't know if Truett whether you're able to give more insight into that. No, I'm sorry, we're not going to be able to give you more detail. We can probably provide it after the meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. The second question was on Scottish Widows. It looks like second half '07, your business margins came down quite a bit, compared to breaking out the first half versus the second half in full year figures. And that's on page 21. What was driving that, particularly because the discount rate was probably coming down in second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the observation is exactly right. What's driving most of the Scottish Widows margin is mix rather than individual products. As you know, Archie and his team have done a terrific job over the past several years, in fact, improving the internal rates of return for virtually all of the products. But because of the mix, we actually saw some decline during the second half. Archie did you want to comment? Don't feel like you have to, it's all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously I have to say something. Yeah the main change is a change in the  mix, and you'll see the margin coming down and underlying margins of the products are sustaining. So we haven't had any changes in the absolute margins of individual products. But what we've had is the change in the mix and when you take a credit or deal in the managed funds increase that we've had, those tend to be final margin products. And that's the impact that you're seeing in the second half of year. The other thing, I would say, on savings and investments as a product market, we're seeing that market coming down slightly and that's a reflection of the kind of consumer investor insecurity that one sees in volatile markets. So savings and investment, we find a bit more tricky in the second half of the year and going into this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one last cheeky question. Given that you've been reported looking at various Northern banks, earlier in the year ... last year and given that banks like Lloydminster are trading at, well at, sale prices. Would there be any potential interest in &#x2013; or why not buy something like a Lloydminster with its customer deposit franchise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you got the remark right at the beginning. I mean, it's not cheeky; it's a very fair question. But you know our policy is never to comment on any rumors or speculations or thoughts for the future of that sort. So I am sure you'll forgive us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What I would add to that, if I may, Chairman, is that the nice part about our franchise is we have very, very good momentum across all of our businesses, plenty of headroom to grow. So we in fact do not have to acquire something in order to be able to achieve the double-digit economic profit that we've set out as a goal. That said, we're alert to opportunities. But the nice part is that we have choice because we have such a good momentum in the core franchises.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Manus Costello from Merrill Lynch. A question I think for Terri. You saw a tremendous momentum in savings deposits in the second half of the year, annualizing at about 20% plus. I just wondered how much of that you think was due specifically to market dislocations in the savings market in the second half of the year? And then more generally with the nationalization of Northern Rock last week, how are you going to see that develop and more generally how do you actually manage to compete against a nationalized institution like that. How does it influence your thinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terri...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly some of the events of the last year have influenced consumers, who definitely have flown to quality and we've benefited from that. We did many other things however, including some new product introduction and some new internet capability that drove the second half. So, I don't want to say it was all flight to quality, but I don't want to deny that we benefited from that. And in terms of nationalizing Northern Rock, I think I had ... at this point have confidence that the government has that well in hand and is aware of the issues. So I think it's a wait and see attitude but I'm confident that it will work out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I...I just came up with a related on I&amp;I. I noticed that the bank assurance mix in the second half actually looked like it was down on the first half. I just wondered to what extent the growth in deposited products at the bank was the flip side of lower savings and investment growth <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you driving the right sort of conclusion. The OEICs: we had fantastic year in 2006, if you remember we were up some 60% overall and some 40-odd percent in overall bank assurance. So we had a really bumper year, and our overall OEICs savings through the retail banks are sort-of flattish and slightly down. We've got new capital protected product that Helen referred to, which is starting to give us some good growth in that area. But the areas that we're struggling in are the insurance bond market, and there is a number of reasons for that. Part of it has to do with investor uncertainty, part of it has to do with uncertainty over the whole insurance bond market that's come out as a result of the P budget report. But, I think if you look at both sides in terms of the long-term savings investment, which tends to appear on my side and you look in Terri's balance sheet, and you see the shorter term cash deposits, you can see a bit of a change and a bit of a flow there. And it's quite logical given the market uncertainty that has taken place that you would see that type of shift to cash-based, secure flight to quality as Terri has said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Ian Smillie from ABN. Two questions please on the funding side of the balance sheet. Firstly, of your 64 billion of wholesale funds, could you give us some idea of how much of that will mature this year? And could you perhaps give a sense as to how you think about dealing with that in the current environment? Are you willing to shorten the duration or will you be looking to term out the profile? And if so, will there be any meaningful impact on margin as we work our way through this year? That's the first question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to attempt Helen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I have to say that .... I mean you saw from the charts that we showed that in terms of the absolute level of short-term funding that's sort of about 40, &#xA3;50 billion of that total, of the 64. Also we've got the securitization program, which is part of our long-term funding, obviously that's more than a one year. Of the reminder the amount that actually terms out this year is relatively limited. You are talking about single billions, so maybe 5 billion, something of that kind of order of magnitude. I should think it would be less than that. So, in terms of the balance of our book, we are still funding extremely well in the shorter term market and actually I think probably the best in that market, where you can see we've actually been able to reduce our dependence on that.</p>
          <p>In part, because we've been gathering further customer deposits. And actually if you look for the year as a whole compared with this time last year, we've pretty much funded all of our asset growth with the increase in customer deposits that we've put on and also a reduction in lendings and arrears, which part of our strategic strategy. Our overall terming in terms of our book ... in terms of the short-term, long-term on wholesale, looks pretty much the same as it did a year ago. And that's the sort of basis on which we are operating going forward. Clearly, if there are opportunities to go longer term that we think are of good value, we'll look at that. But, overall, we've pretty comfortable with our ... the term of our funding. Our absolute short term funding levels in the wholesale market are significantly lower than our peers and yet our absolute access to funds is very, very good.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the second question was on customer deposits and that very strong performance there as you said. I think, if I have done the numbers correctly, about two-thirds of that came from the corporate side. Could you just give us a bit of the actual increased amount, if you like? Could you give us some sense as to should we think about that as a profit center or is that more of a funding source? In order words could you give us a bit of color as to where it's coming from?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, I think if you look at what's coming through on our wholesale side, it's about a 50-50 split. So about 50% of that is actually coming through in our commercial business, which is long-term, longer term balances typically. I mean I talked about fixed term deposits on the small business side. And then about 50% of it &#x2013; something like that perhaps a little bit less, is coming through on the corporate side of which an element clearly tends to be overnight or money market type funding. But obviously, we have access on an ongoing basis. That's not something that comes and goes. It's actually a steady amount that we have. So that's more of a funding nature. So it's probably about a 50-50 split.</p>

          <p>If I could just add on, we're in a very comfortable funding position as Helen has indicated. And the good part is we're growing the customer deposits and of the more wholesale nature of deposits, that's a market that we have systematically worked for years and we are sort of business as usual. So we're in very comfortable position.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Peter Toeman, from HSBC. On page 26, you talk about some normalization in the SME and corporate credit charge. I wondered if you could give us an idea of what a normalized charge for these businesses might be. I raised this because you've given us the forecast for the retail bank and I wondered if you could give us steer on wholesale bank as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll, sort of, give an introductory comment and then turn it over to Helen and then to Truett. We are pretty comfortable. Asset quality in the wholesale bank is very good. What we clearly are seeing is lower recoveries. We had told the market that we would not have the kind of recoveries that we've seen in prior years simply because we haven't been writing-off enough to experience the recoveries. So that's part of the normalization. I think the other is that we were living in a very benign environment. Our through-the-cycle models basically say that we are not going to have this ongoing low level of write-offs. That would be would be sort of expecting too much. So as we see a tougher environment and the cycle start to turn, then we'll expect more normalize losses. Helen, did you want to add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean, I think the comment that you read on ... sorry. I've forgotten which page it was on ... on page 26 you say? That comment is one that you may have read before in some our news releases in the sense that we do expect to see over time a return to some normalization in the corporate book. Actually when that's going to happen is still unclear. As we look over our book going ahead, it actually looks pretty robust. We can typically see three to six months ahead and all the lead indicators there are good. In the corporate markets specifically, which is our &#xA3;15 million plus turnover part of our business, we have seen a year-on-year tick up as I showed in my chart on the impairment, but that's quite specific in the sense of lower recoveries, a couple of special particular situations, and then an overall growth in the size of the book. Our actual AQR in terms of the new impairments or gross impairments is flat. So at the moment we're actually seeing a very good trend. I think our view though is there will come a point when that will start to deteriorate and we will see a return to normalization. That's what I would say...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks. Mike Trippitt of Oriel Securities. Two questions actually, just one on mortgage markets. I know you indicated last year looking for sort of ... not going for share and going for high value. But it looks like the redemption stays at about first half level with quite a drop off in the new business levels. And I just wondered, given your funding advantage, and given that asset spreads probably have moved out slightly, whether you're giving up an opportunity here and what your appetite for risk is going into 2008? And I have follow-up question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a very good observation, if I may Chairman, that we have very consistently had a posture where we're managing the place for value. Now that means two things. We want to have the right terms, so when the market has moved to what we believe are not sensible loan-to-value ratios, not sensible certification and so on, we simply choose not play. And then we don't think we can get the appropriate returns, we choose not to play. Now, the market has changed and I think does represent opportunity. Let me ask Terri to tell you a little bit more about the ins and outs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So one of the reasons why the retail bank has been so committed to diversifying our income stream is so that we don't have to sail into the wind we can tack. And while mortgages is certainly not a small business, it is a pretty small part of our income statement. What we saw in the second and third quarter, and remember those are the allocations that we book in the second half of the year, was really a collapse in margins. But we also saw quite a bit of degradation in credit terms, a lot more self-certification, many of the major lenders following Northern Rock into the 125% loan-to-value market. That's just not a market space that we're interested in playing in.</p>
          <p>For one thing, the cost of capital and the cost of credit associated with those mortgages is quite a bit higher, and when we looked at the pricing at the time, we couldn't see where you could be achieving a reasonable return. So in the second and the third quarter, we not only were not in the growth lending market, but we allowed redemptions, as well. Now of course, as you know, often times the collapse of margins and degradation in credit are pretty good indicators that you might be coming to an end of a cycle, and that's certainly when we feel we have to sort of hold our courage and not follow the market in. What we saw at the end of the third quarter was margins began to strengthen. They have continued through this period. And more recently, and it has been quite recently, we've actually seeing some firming up of credit criteria. So many players exiting, for example, the 125% loan-to-value marketplace. So, I would expect that if these trends continue, then our participation in the market would continue, as it has been in the past few months, to be quite a bit stronger than it was in the few months before that.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow-up. Could you just give us an indication of the income and costs that drop out with the disposals from -- are there any 07 numbers that clearly won't be there next year?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Stephen Andrews from UBS. Just another question on the retail bank. I think the standout performance relative to your peers in the retail bank as a general insurance business because I think most other banks are talking about a 30% decline year-on-year because of the impact of PPI. Can you perhaps give us a bit more flavor and break down why you have had such a strong performance in general insurance? Is that sort of growth rate sustainable? And why you haven't seeing the 30% fall in PPI that everybody else has. What's driven that general insurance because it's half of your retail revenue growth this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Good. I'll again ask Terri to comment. But I think there are a couple of things, one is I couldn't possibly comment on what's happening with our competitors' books. I don't know. But what I can do is comment on what's happening with us. This is a product which customers actually demand. They want the product. They want the assurance that if something should happen that they are well protected in terms of being able to pay off their loans. So this is something that's a very legitimate consumer need. That's sort of the first statement. Second statement is we have designed our product, so that de facto, which is the independent rating agency, basically says it's the top of the pops. It is the best product on the market. And it's priced very much in the middle of the market, in fact I think slightly below the middle. So this is a very good deal for consumers. We think that we have the highest selling standards. This is something where we hold our people to a very high standard of making sure that this is completely separate from the loan sale in the consumers mind. So we have a good product. We have a very good sales process, its very good value for the customers. We think that explains our success. Terri, would you like add on?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that there is nothing exceptional about that <mark type="inaudible" /> it is pure cross-selling underlying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That it is pure cost selling underlying, and if you look our penetration has been relatively consistent. I mean were couple of months percent up, couple of percent down. But our penetration is pretty darn consistent.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. It's Alastair from UBS and just to finally do the wholesale bad-debt charge to death, page 45, it's about a 79% increase in past year in impaired wholesale loans. Can you just map that to your clear confidence in the performance of those portfolios? And then I have a second question, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You just wanted to give me a chance to get back right? You wanted more detail. I think the drill down that I would try to give you to understand what's going on in impairments on the wholesale side. It is a fairly complex waterfall, but the bottom-line is indeed a high degree of confidence in the performance as well as the quality of the portfolio. And the easiest way to kind of look at it is to, we basically moved from what 307 million to 547 million. The way you have to break that down is you actually take out the dislocation which 90 plus 92.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, perhaps I'll ask a second question, well.  I'm just quite struck by...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can I talk to you after in terms of that level of detail because that's ... that and the approach to the way we would think about impairment. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Yep, I can do it...I'm just quite struck ... you're taking market share and mortgages. You're the biggest new lender in credit cards. You've got the fastest growth in unsecured personal loans, you've grown your commercial property book and yet you're looking for strong growth in SME. I mean it's kind of a relief as a UK citizen that somebody's lending into the market. But just is there a plan B in case the problems that so many of your competitors actually drag the economy down to a place that's a worse one than you're currently expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you. Yes I think there is a plan B very clearly. We would be remiss if we didn't stress test the heck out of our portfolios as well as our growth assumptions. We have gone through the exercise. It's a normal part of our business planning, so this isn't something that's a new requirement. It's something that we think about. Carol and her team have done a wonderful job in terms of raising our risk awareness and helping us to think through what happens if our economic assumptions are wrong. That said, we think we have a very robust medium-term plan. We expect the UK economy will continue to grow. It will grow with a slower rate, but we expect growth to continue and not to fall into recession. We think we are extremely well-positioned against that. Given that we are funding ... we have a funding advantage, given that we have build relationships over time, given that we have invested in the people and in the business, we think that we are extremely well prepared. Now, if we have slower growth even than we think, we again stand on our virtues. That our policies are through-the-cycle, they're built on relationships. You saw the great majority of our revenues, whether it's in the wholesale bank or in the retail bank come from building ... through that relationship building. Customer needs don't change over time. They may go up or down somewhat in tune with the economy. But fundamentally the customers have a constant set of needs. And we're getting increasingly good at acquiring customers and then selling into those needs. So, we think we have a very solid business proposition.</p>

          <p>In your presentation, it was notable for the absence of the Phase II versus Phase III distinctions we've talked about in the past. And I guess as you stand here today against where you have been in previous result seasons, the environment clearly is very different out there. And when you think about where &#x2013; how you are positioned in terms of the balance sheet, the organic growth within the core business, momentum you have, the credit rating you have on your business &#x2013; do you look around and think the world is different in terms of where we think about developing this business  there is now more opportunity there that we should be considering? Or do you still come back to focusing on just on where you are now and growing the business and not being a sort of ... I think, the siren call outs if you like from distressed assets etcetera. Just wondered you can maybe just paint the strategic picture about how you look at your group related to others now.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, of course, what you say is true. I mean the world today is very different one from the one we looked at 12 months ago. Our first job is to make sure that this group is intrinsically strong and has high growth potential. That we satisfy shareholders in terms of the value that we create for them, but also that we got strength and headroom to take advantage of opportunities. And if your basic point is are there opportunities today that there weren't 12 months ago? The answer has to be, look at the pricing of assets around the place, that has ... the answer to that has to be yes. But we are not rushing out to take advantage of inorganic opportunities. We've got lots of opportunities as you've seen this morning from the presentation, in the businesses itself, and I think that's were the concentration will be. But the basic premise are there going to be opportunities around that weren't there before when you had very, very high prices? Yeah. Absolutely. Eric, do you want to answer that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'd just simply add-on. I fully agree with the sentiment. What is remarkable is, yes, we are in relatively, I think, very good shape and the nice part is we have choice. Because we are growing our organic businesses with such good momentum and we think we can make double-digit economic profit growth on a sustained basis, that we have the luxury of being able to in fact make very sure that whatever we look at fits well with the business ... that we can make the numbers work. We have a reputation for being very prudent, and we have no reason to vary from that posture. I guessed I'd remind you that because a pair of shoes is cheap doesn't mean necessarily that they would fit you well. So we want to make sure that we have a good fit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. It's <mark type="inaudible" /> Helen you've talked about increased opportunities to grow your customer lending. I was just wondering if you could tell us in which product you see the greatest opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I don't think we think about in terms of products, I think we think about in terms of our customers sets. And frankly it goes across the piece. We've seen some good opportunities in the cooperate space where other lenders are perhaps not able to fund or for whatever reason not choosing to participate. And so, there is some good opportunities coming through but what I would ... as well as also on the commercial side. Terri has already talked about some of the opportunities we've also seen coming through on the mortgage side. So I think it goes across the piece. What I would say though is, we are still adopting the same rigorous approach to those opportunities that we do to business anyway; i.e. is this value creating, does it enhance ...is it consistent with our strategy? This is not about sort of Eric's comment about the shoes just now. This is not about us going out and sort of grasping every opportunity that's out there but it's actually thinking about in the context of our strategy where might there be opportunities to grow and develop that bit more rapidly in the current market environment. And clearly, we are very, very well placed and we're able to perhaps step up to the mark in terms of our funding when maybe some of our competitors are not able to do that. But the point I would want to emphasis is subject to still the same kind of criteria and approach in the context of our strategy and also in the context of our risk approach that any of the lending that we'd be doing or any other product that we would be doing previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So. Is it fair to say that your high single or low double-digit risk asset growth is going to be broadly based or where that's going to be coming from mortgages, unsecured and corporate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I took mortgages, I took commercial and I took corporate. I think those are probably likely to be the main areas. One point I would make about that is don't forget that our actual risk-weighted assets have down under Basel II. So, what was high single-digit would now be low double-digit anyway in terms of the Basel II. So, while what we're not doing is suddenly opening the flood gates, but where we are and identifying is that there are some opportunities that we will be taking, you know, we feel that we're well placed to take advantage of going forward.</p>

          <p>Derek Chambers from the Standard &amp; Poor's Investment Equity Research. Could you tell me about credit cards and dynamics of that business because there do seem to be some shifts in what are you doing. Perhaps you could say what do you expect to happen? Because balances in 2007 were still falling but your numbers out standing were rising, so is it more transactors? You say in the statement that arrears are falling but impairment charges actually went up in 2007. So, are those dynamics going to change? And you don't ... maybe you are not go into the ...all those card lines and talk about delinquency but it doesn't look quite as good on the credit cards as it does on the personal loans. So, how is the business changing and perhaps in a broader context, you haven't mentioned that as one of the main drivers, but presumably it's quite a substantial income stream relative to mortgages, could you perhaps just put that in context?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, I'll ask Terri to comment but let me give a little bit of context. What we look for is relationship and the key to that is a current accounts. We then use that relationship and sell into the customer need. The relationship with current accounts means that we have the data, because we can observe the flows of funds and then that allows us and gives us the insights to sell further on. Now, credit cards are important but they are less important than customers wallets than they have been previously. Debit cards are growing much more quickly. Although, credit cards still are important. One of the things that we have is sort of the anomaly within credit cards that while we do the majority of credit cards sales to our own customers &#x2013;  89% of our sales are to own customers.  Because we introduces the Airmiles Card which I will ask Terri to talk about which has been so successful. We are actually attracting in the lot of non-customers. So, that sort of the phenomenon that you are seeing and why are we seeing terrific growth in terms of number of cards there. They will necessarily as we bring on new cards have different characteristics than the existing book. They are unseasoned; there are different target segment. So that's explaining an awful lot of what's going on. In terms of outlook for arrears, we are pretty content with the ... well it doesn't look as good as personal loans, credit cards never well. But we're pretty content that we have a good grasp on our credit models and that our collection processes are working well. Terri.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you for the question because we have in fact been doing a little work on the structure of that portfolio and you may not be aware we've actually taken our Credit Card and our Debit Credit business and combined it because of the point that Eric is making. Increasingly for the consumer, the credit card is not really a credit product it's a payments product. So we put the two together so that we can focus on a consumer payments strategy. Credit card balances in the UK, and we hold the record because we are the first country in the world to achieve this, we have actually been declining now for a couple of years in the UK as consumers have been re-structuring their balance sheet. Lot of it has been consumers refinancing their mortgages and paying down their credit card balances. So we have had a couple of years of a study decline in credit card receivables in the UK. We've kind of bucked the trend of that mainly because of the increased cross-sell of our Credit Card product into our customer base and then more recently the Airmiles products. We did allow a little bit of balances to roll off this year, because when we looked at what was happening in the balance transfer space we thought that too had maybe pushed beyond our economic profit goals anyway so, so we have reduced our participation in the zero interest balance transfer type of marketing. What we benefit from of course is the Airmiles partnership but more importantly there is a third partner in that and that's American Express, which allows us to sell both the usual MasterCard and Visa branded product, but also the American Express branded product, which does enjoy a better profit margin from fees as opposed to having to be so entirely reliant on net interest income from revolving balances. So that's a little bit of  what has helped with the income side of the credit card business.</p>

          <p>Thanks Terri.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And then I'll take one last question after this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's <mark type="inaudible" /> I'll ask you just a question on revenue growth within the Corporate Bank please? I'm just intrigued. There is a comment about venture capital gain sales, I wondered whether you could quantify what they were for us in relation to say 2006 and more particularly also what the outlook is? And what impact you might perceive for revenues in 2008 from the dislocation of debt capital markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean in terms of LDC gains, we talked in the first half about having made on unusual gain, and the run rate being about 50 million. And our net gain ... our net profit in LDC is probably around 130, 140 for the year. So, you can see that that's gone up quite significantly since last year, but it's still not a very large proportion of our overall business. Perhaps I'll hand the second point over to Truett.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. The -- it's good if you look at the income and you take dislocation out. You do see corporate markets income growth that about 17%.  It was a very strong year. And you saw the income growth in commercial, very strong as well. Matter of fact it was pretty good across the division. IB by the way is a bit of the way we've compounded things, if you don't mind this tangent. You will see International Banking and it looks like it didn't have as good a year as it did. What you've got mixed in there is the sale of Registars, so you got a partial year 2007 versus a full 2006. So you actually had good income growth across those core corporate businesses.</p>
          <p>The way we look at 2008 and the dislocation, is actually the strength of the businesses which drove that 17% increased in income will not be dramatically impacted by the dislocation and even a bearish outlook in terms of what that might due to volumes. Indeed probably a good example of that would be in something like acquisition finance. That's our mid-market focused leveraged finance business. What you see there is you see a lot of demand, you actually see a much better market than we had last year. And by that I mean lower leverage, low overall leverage better spreads, better spreads on the margins on the mezzanine. And we actually have that as a sweet spot where we've actually dramatically increased our positioning offset that market in last 60 days, the last six months. We've got a good pipeline for the year ahead of us. If you look at our risk management business, we're off to one of the best starts that we've had. If you look across to commercial finance, if you look across to LDC, the private equity business, most of those businesses are going to continue to have a strong 2008 based on the fact that we do have a funding advantage. We have developed capabilities and credibility in the market that I think we didn't have two, three years ago. You do have better margins and we are better positioned in terms of our staffing. So I do not see that that's going to be a threat to our core underlying momentum that both Eric and Allen talked too.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'll just take one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's <mark type="inaudible" />. I just wondered about this conduit that you have, Cancara? If you could tell us a bit more ... a bit more background. And also what this 3.7 billion client receivables transactions is please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought it was getting too good to be true to get through the whole results meeting without anything about this. Absolutely, I'd be happy to answer the question. I mean Cancara our conduit has about &#xA3;8.3 billion of assts in it. They're all AAA, ABS primarily vanilla asset classes. About 50% or so, I think is UK or European prime residential mortgages, about 15 bank balance sheet CLOs, about 15 European UK CMBS ... that sort of asset. We've not seen any default. It's all highly performing. You see we've had a very small proportion that's been downgraded. It's being ...continues to be funded very well by investors. And so it's performing extremely well. I think we described it before as sort of the Rolls-Royce of conduits and I think that's an appropriate description of it. So that's that piece. The other was the 3.9 sort of other assets that we had described there. That basically consists of high quality senior bank debt. And when I took about high quality senior bank debt, I understand you say there's high quality banks, and high quality banks, and this is really high quality. These are global banks effectively so large organizations and also corporate assets but these again would be high quality corporates effectively within that's are corporate bonds. There is also a small amount of ... well footnotes on the slide that I showed ...a small amount of subprime ... about 180 million, something like that. But it's actually ...the rest of it's extremely and that's subordinated -- well subordinated by note. So, overall it's a very, very high quality portfolio.</p>
