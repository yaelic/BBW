          <p>Good day and welcome to the Munich Re Quarterly Financial Statements Three 2011 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christian Becker-Hussong. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Warm welcome to our call on Munich Re's third quarter 2011 financial results. Today's speaker is J&#xF6;rg Schneider, CFO of Munich Re Group. J&#xF6;rg will give you a short overview on the main developments first. We will then have our usual Q&amp;A. Please allow for my usual housekeeping remark in that context, we would like to ask you to limit the number of your questions to a maximum of two per person.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your cooperation. And J&#xF6;rg, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to ask that we also have Alexander Becker here from our ERGO Operation and Jo Oechslin, who will like myself be happy to answer your questions later on.</p>
          <p>Let me start with slide three. A net profit of &#x20AC;290 million is as such not compelling for quarter with relatively benign Mother Nature. But as you know the result was distorted by several non-recurring one-off &#x2013; some of them are unavoidable &#x2013; according to IFRS accounting rules, I do not want to complain about it.</p>
          <p>As you know, we strive for an economic balancing of assets and liabilities. We apply strict limits. We are taking only very moderate bets. But at times of high capital market volatility, we had significant accounting noise which is symptomatic of this kind of economic approach. And in the third quarter, this concedes a good underlying result.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, with the consolidated result of &#x20AC;290 million in third quarter stand alone we arrived at &#x20AC;80 million for the first nine months in all quite pleasing, giving the extremely challenging environment. Against this backdrop, preserving capital strength is important to us.</p>
          <p>Our strong capital position allows us to take market opportunities. Our group equity rose by &#x20AC;1.9 billion in the third quarter. As far as revenues and revenue reserves of our parent company under German GAAP are concerned. Our high dividend capacity remains intact. This has to do with the beneficial impact of the equalization reserve. By the way, the parent company's capital will also be strengthened by the fact that our U.S. operations will pay a dividend of around &#x20AC;500 million to Munich Re in the fourth quarter. I am very pleased about the development in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our return on investment was down mainly due to one-off effect to 3.3% for the first nine months.</p>
          <p>Slide four provides short description of the most relevant one-off, I've just alluded to, I'll comeback to the effect resulting from the euro crisis anyway. So, let me just add some explanations on reserve movements. Reinsurance life required a reserve strengthening of &#x20AC;148 million for the Australian disability business as a result of the 2011 review. The Australian market as a whole has seen a worsening of experience from this business over the last two years or so.</p>
          <p>The main courses were lower than expected, claim termination rates, i.e. claimants returning later to work or dying later than anticipated. The bulk of the reserve strengthening relates to business which is in one-off, i.e. no longer opened to new business. To put the size of this &#x20AC;147 million reserve strengthening into perspective, this was about 18% of the losses we expect for the Australian disability business in total. So, these reserves are not yet reserved because it had not developed to claim, that means that this is sizable, but well digestible.</p>
          <p>For property-casualty reinsurance, reserve indications in the calendar year have been positive with reported losses emerging below actuarial expectations, more or less across-the-board. Analysis across all segments are ongoing with initial findings <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:41). In credit, aviation and marine lines of business, that means in short-tail lines, the indications were so clear that we had to release &#x20AC;200 million for the third quarter. For the other lines of business, we continue to observe the data on the basis of the Q3 numbers before deciding on further reserve releases.</p>
          <p>Slide five explains the foreign exchange result in more detail. As we do not account for full fair values in IFRS, a neutral economic currency position inevitably means a structural mismatch according to IFRS, because in IFRS the liabilities are largely undiscounted. This exposes us to income statement volatility and if you would like &#x2013; I would like to give you some examples during the Q&amp;A session later on. The &#x20AC;342 million pre-tax loss in the third quarter was roughly double the size of the earlier gains in the first two quarters, so the impact for 2011 as a whole was &#x20AC;146 million before tax.</p>
          <p>On slide six, there's the short overview of the results. After nine months Munich Re is back in black. Reinsurance returns to a net profit due to fewer large losses in Q3, but also due to better underlying profitability. The sum of the primary insurance segment was &#x20AC;418 and ERGO's consolidated result was &#x20AC;260 million on prior-year's level. For ERGO, also for the full-year, we now expect net earnings on the prior-year's level, which were around &#x20AC;350 million. Munich Health had an operational result, which was positive, which increased but due to negative foreign exchange impact that led to marginal loss for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's continue with our capitalization, I'm on slide nine now. Even after the capital market turmoil in the third quarter and on the backdrop of an extremely adverse environment, our capital position remained solid with very sound Solvency II capitalization.</p>
          <p>Let me start on the left-hand side with IFRS, equity increased by almost 10% in the third quarter. You'll find the numbers on slide eight. This was due to the unrealized gains and to a positive currency impact. The available financial resources according to our economic capital decreased in this extreme scenario and economic risk capital rose, the low yield environment and high volatilities broadened the MCV in primary life and increases the economic liabilities, and this despite our mitigation measures in asset-liability duration management.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the economic solvency ratio is well above our internal comfort level which is based on a confidence level of 175% of the future regulatory solvency capital requirements, which are based on value at risk of 99.5%. So, I repeat, our confidence level 175% of the regulatory minimum or in other words, it is substantially above 175% of the solvency capital requirements. And this SCR is by the way as such not the legal minimum, but a kind of target level. This demonstrates that our group solvency position is quite robust, even in such an extreme capital market environment. And this is also shown on slide 10, where you see on the right-hand side the debt leverage ratios in terms of &#x2013; in percentage terms, with more or less unchanged 19% leverage ratio, but this is IFRS numbers basically. On the left-hand side, the market also reflect their strength by the very low level of CDS spreads for the credit Munich Re.</p>
          <p>Moving on to asset management, slide 11. You see our investment portfolio on the left-hand side, there's some increase in miscellaneous, this is due to high deposits from the last large three deals. Fortunately, we did strong derisking with regards to equities and this is early enough before the sharp decline of stocks in September. We are now at or not now, but at the end of September we were at around 2% of our overall assets exposure to equities and in October, we reduced this exposure even further.</p>
          <p>We further diversified our government bond portfolio which remains dominated by the strong countries with a strong overweight especially of the German bonds. We have a very manageable exposure to weaker sovereigns. You'll find the usual list on the following slide 12. Diversification remains key in such a situation and we are well positioned for all scenarios. And our reinvestment yield of 3.4% allows us to nicely slowdown the decline of our average regular investment income.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the investment income on slide 13, 13. Pleasingly robust with 4.1%. The other I drivers are the write-downs mainly on the Greek sovereign with &#x20AC;200 million for the third quarter. Significant impairments on equities in the third quarter, the write-downs on other derivative, these were partially compensated for by the impact of the swaptions with which we insure against an extreme low yield scenario.</p>
          <p>And as regard Munich Re's business segments, let's start with an overview of primary insurance in ERGO on slide 16. Premiums are stable overall with a shift towards more profitable property-casualty and health segments. Life had an ongoing decline of single premiums which comes &#x2013; is very welcome with us in this very low interest environment. We have an increase of regular premiums from a low level. We have growth in health, travel and direct insurance as well as some organic growth in property-casualty.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we gave additional information on the management of the low interest environment in primary life, given average group slightly above 4% and reinvestment rate of 3.3% in primary life. We view this for a longer scenario as a manageable challenge for us. Compared to 2010, life and health are suffering from lower investment results, particularly from the write-down of the Greek bonds and of the equities, while the technical results are improving as you can see on the following slides 20 and 21.</p>
          <p>I go on to slide 22 for property-casualty primary insurance. We had higher claims from weather-related losses in Germany and therefore we still had a good combined ratio of 91.7% there, but not as good it was in the preceding years.</p>
          <p>In International business, we had some improvement. Poland is back to normal conditions. Part of international business remains in a turnaround mode for the time being, especially situation in Turkey is still difficult. We took the necessary radical measures as you can see on slide 23 and it takes more time then anticipated, but now we see first signs of success, this is far more than hope. And therefore, we are confident that the international business will contribute positively in the long run to our overall book of business. But we also take action as you can see from the sale of our Portuguese unit.</p>
          <p>I continue with Munich Health on slide 26. Gross premiums written continue to grow nicely. This is similar to the development in the life reinsurance; this is based on large volume surplus release years in reinsurance. We have a slight improvement of the technical result, but our U.S. primary business show some deterioration from the legacy business which is based on the model of private fee for services.</p>
          <p>We reoriented our U.S. business in line with the new political landscape and introduce more managed-care elements and Windsor Life Group with its good track record and network is a perfect addition to our business portfolio.</p>
          <p>We sold our unprofitable Italian unit and we saw substantial improvement in European primary insurance, the subsidiaries of DKV, with a particular strong result from our Spanish subsidiary. We look forward to our further expansion in Middle East which was most recently lagging behind due to the political development. In the long run, the democratic development and modernization provide us with good chances, very interesting chances in that region, so much from Munich Health.</p>
          <p>Finally, reinsurance, slide <mark type="ph" /> 28 (17:58). Gross premiums plus 13%, in life plus 22%, this is based on large solvency relief deals. But also in property-casualty, plus 9%; two sources, one also solvency relief deals of a more shorter nature, but, also one can see a very clear impact from the July renewal and better terms, especially for natural catastrophe business.</p>
          <p>Life Re on slide 29. Our key figures improved due to the expansion in Asia and capital relief deals. But there was the already described, hit to the bottom line due to the negative one-off including foreign exchange and reserve increase in Australia.</p>
          <p>The large volume deals and in particular, also our business in Asia, Canada and U.S. performed well. And in the context of the usual ups and downs as regard to reserve developments in each and every quarter, in the third quarter we observed a quite positive trend. This is reserving development partially compensated for the negative impact of the Australian disability business; I would guess roughly one-third of the effect was mitigated. Overall, we are on track to achieve our aspiration of 400 million technical result for 2011.</p>
          <p>Property-casualty reinsurance on slide 31. With a good combined ratio of 89% in the third quarter, including very low basic loss ratio and rather benign nat cat loading of approximately, or even lower than 6%. The Japanese earthquake loss remains at around &#x20AC;1.5 billion. The two New Zealand quakes stand at &#x20AC;1.1 billion, West Spain flood &#x20AC;200 million, all now with a lot of reporting <mark type="ph" /> and first settlements (20:23) with small movements compensating each other. The largest loss in the third quarter was Hurricane Irene, with around to &#x2013; with around &#x20AC;195 million.</p>
          <p>As mentioned we had the reserve leases. But this is no change to our more cautious reserving approach, our reserves continue to carry sufficient margin.</p>
          <p>I come to the outlook on slide 33, basically not changed. We are more confident with regards to the high premium level, a little bit increase here, &#x20AC;49 billion to &#x20AC;50 billion. Return on investments now down slightly below 3.5%, based on the latest experience, we still aim for a positive result in the fourth quarter. But due to the enormous accounting impact of changes in interest rates and FX rates, we do not want to give a quantified target now, because that would require, perhaps, to give a profit warning upwards or downwards every two days. We stick with our return on risk adjusted capital targets with 15% after tax over the cycle.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize, Munich Re has a good track record of dealing with challenging economic conditions. We have a highly diversified business, strong capital position and we strive for a limited correlation to economic cycles and capital markets.</p>
          <p>Our rigorous approach to risk management means that we apply clear limit, which forces us to further diversify our investments. Stringent economic steering also means that we have to accept some unavoidable accounting volatility, let me add, within boundary. So, we are not immune to everything, therefore we look at restricting also the accounting effects to reasonable numbers here.</p>
          <p>We are well positioned to participate in market opportunities of profitable growth. And our expectation for the incoming renewal is becoming, in my view, if I listen to my underwriting colleagues, more and more optimistic. So, the tone has slightly changed during the last couple of days.</p>
          <p>Last word on dividend, since the equalization reserve absorbed the extraordinarily share of the 2011 losses, we are looking to pay the same dividend as for the previous year, but it is still too early to make a definite announcement.</p>
          <p>With that, I get back to, Christian. Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Michael Huttner at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, you're there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I was a bit asleep here. Thanks a lot. And two things which interests me. One, you have this slide, was it slide nine on capital, which shows that available goes down, required or whatever risk capital goes up, and yet you sounds incredibly positive on capital and you mentioned capital strength several times. Can you give a bit of color there, because it sounds to me as it got worse? But I still remember what you said about maybe S&amp;P changing their model and so I'm a little bit confused here why you should be so positive when on the face of it things aren't quite going your way at the moment on capital.</p>
          <p>And then, the other thing. When you mentioned the 50% &#x2013; 15% rollout target, it's almost, I mean, such bland question. But is it applied on the risk capital, which you published at 1 of January, which is &#x20AC;17 billion, which presumably now that capital's gone up is up a little bit, so maybe &#x20AC;19 billion. So, this mean that if I multiply say &#x20AC;19 billion by 1 point &#x2013; by 15%, this would be about &#x20AC;2.6 billion or something, that's the result we should be expecting for 2012. Here's my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. Jo Oechslin will help me out, but let me start. 2011 is close to kind of worse case Munich Re. On one hand, we had the enormous natural catastrophes. On the other hand, we had this extreme low interest environment, which is decremental to our capital &#x2013; economic capital position. And seeing on that background, I am quite pleased about the resilience of our capitalization, but more from him.</p>
          <p>Second, on the RORAC target, yes, we referred to the risk capital at the 1 of January of each year and your calculation was roughly okay with that. So, it's far away from where we are in 2011, but it's not completely unrealistic under good conditions. But we would anyway like to move to more economic targets in the course of the implementation of Solvency I when we have better basis here of published number, on which we can base these external targets on. So, please, I beg for your understanding and some patience with that. We are also not so happy with the RORAC targets. But Jo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There is just very little to add to the what, J&#xF6;rg, already said, Michael. And let me just make three minor points. When I can refer to the sensitivity analysis that we have disclosed at year-end 2010 in March in the analyst conference, if you go back to that slide, you can see some of the sensitivities we have been showing there. One was a combined sensitivity to a 100 basis point fall in rates and a 30% drop in equity market. That's about what we have seen now, maybe slightly less on equities, maybe more even on interest rates than 110 basis points. At that point in time, we have said that we'll bring our solvency ratio to 118%.</p>
          <p>In addition, this year, we have got a widening of credit spreads. In addition, we have got a &#x20AC;1.5 billion claim in Japan. Some other disasters have been hitting us in New Zealand, the earth quakes, and Australia, and tornadoes in the United States. Nevertheless, we are still able to say we are comfortably above 100%, which is, I think, strong in the context of what have happened to us. And also, you need to consider that we have been continuing to calculate the numbers the way we had always done. So, we have not taken higher interest rates into consideration.</p>
          <p>And the third point is that we have a year ago told you that we do not see the level of intervention at 100%. But we have purposely taken that down to an intervention level of 80% on our own capital standards, and that is because 80% solvency ratio in our own capital standards, not including a illiquidity premiums, still corresponds to 140% solvency ratio under Solvency II. And this is why we are relatively very comfortable, very relaxed on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brilliant. And, there is no update on the S&amp;P thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, last time, in August, I told you that there is not much of a buffer left. And you will not be surprised that this hasn't changed. But we expect Munich Re's capitalization to remain compatible with a AA rating by S&amp;P. And in its assessment of an insurer's capitalization, S&amp;P does not only recognize any buffers, but also the quality of capital, which is of equal importance. And anyway, capital is only one of many rating criteria applied by S&amp;P and we also expect better recognition of our capital according to the internal model going forward. Therefore, we will be able to continue to commit capacity for organically growing the business and we will seize the opportunities of the hardening reinsurance market in a profitable way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Spencer Horgan at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much, good afternoon. If I could just return, actually, briefly to slide nine and Michael's question. Obviously, you're not putting the numbers on here, but I think we can all agree that, as you say, you're far away from the dangerous position in terms of economic capital. But I assume in terms of that traffic-light system, Jo, that you showed us at the analyst conference at the year-end, it is in the sort of yellow zone. So, I'm kind of wondering, presumably, the ultimate goal is to get the economic capital back into what you'd call, the green zone. And I was just kind of wondering, how you sort of envisaging getting there and what timeframe looking are you looking at for that?</p>
          <p>And then the second one is just a quick clarification actually. In the outlook section of the report, you talked about a combined ratio in reinsurance of 113% for the full year before taking account of reserve movements, is what it says. I assume that means without taking in account of any further reserve movements in Q4, but including the reserve movements we've already seeing in the first nine months, which would give us a combined ratio of 97% or 98% in Q4, just to make sure I understood that correctly. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I start with the letter before handing over to Jo. Yes, you're right, yeah. So, this is a more conservative view. But we also have to look at the flood in Thailand, which seem to be developed to a major loss from what we hear from market observers. Therefore, the fourth quarter is going to be a normal quarter with the usual burden from natural catastrophes. But, Jo, with the capital question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Spencer, you're right by referring to that chart, and you mentioned the colors that we have shown in that presentation, which was green above 140%, yellow between 100% and 140%, and red between 180%. And that color scheme &#x2013; yeah, I'll tell you what it should tell you. We already have been in the yellow zone at year-end 2010, right, with about 136%. And the green zone, we consider the zone in which we have likely some excess capital. The yellow zone will be the zone where we don't consider ourselves overcapitalized, but adequately capitalized, I would say. And the red zone is where we would think about action, and below 80% we think about action. That color scheme is &#x2013; it needs to be understood in terms of management calibration. It's absolutely not red or yellow in terms of regulatory and that would still be above. And so, that is the way you should interpret the color scheme. The color scheme, yellow means we are still comfortable, very comfortable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I understand, it's got noting to do with the regulatory point of view. But &#x2013; so, should I, therefore, assume that you target actually the capital level to be within the yellow zone most of the time, and actually if it goes into green, you need to take some action to redistribute <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:42).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there, J&#xF6;rg. You referred several times to the buffer provided by the equalization reserves to Munich Re AG level year to date. What &#x2013; I mean, given looks like to be potentially quite a lot of natural catastrophes in Q4, particularly from Thailand, what's the remaining stock of equalization reserves left in the fire account to buffer the Q4? I guess I'm trying to judge at what point nat cat losses, at what point you would be nervous about kind of the full year commentary you've given based on the nat cat experience of Q4?</p>
          <p>Second point, I guess, would be the U.S. dividend at last, just to clarify, is that fund driven in euros or dollars? Does that turn the tap on? Is there more to come? Has the regulator basically said you're free to take dividends in a more flexible basis going forward.</p>

          <p>It's still subject to regulatory consent, yeah, so also in future. But to me, it's very good sign that it has been resolved in a very relaxed way here. Good. Your first question about the equalization reserve. We have a prognosis for the end of the year that it's clear that it will be reduced by the impact of the natural catastrophe of this year. I should rather look at the line of business fire. There's some &#x20AC;1.5 billion left and overall roughly &#x20AC;6 billion, but this is a very rough prognosis. In addition, this takes into account the normal nat cat burden for the remainder of the year. That means quite a lot can come before it's expired.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just a similar question, actually, to Andrew's. I just wanted to ask about the U.S. capital position, because you're obviously paying this dividend back to the holding company, &#x20AC;500 million in Q4. And you kind of alluded to the fact that maybe that's kind of an ongoing sort of thing. But I'd say from my angle, I was more interested in the actual stock of surplus you've got in the U.S., because you gave the update at your capital &#x2013; on your Capital Day was suggesting that over time and subject to certain things than you'll be able to extract the surplus from there, so I was just looking for an update on that situation please.</p>
          <p>And my second question is on casualty reserves, because your positive development you've seen in Q3 is obviously the shorter-tail stuff; the marine, aviation and credit. I was just wondering about casualty, because a number of your competitors are seeing positive development on casualty. You obviously do your reviews on long-tail reserves at the year. I was just wondering if you could talk more generally about some of the trends you're seeing in the industry, sort of talk us what you might be thinking about casualty reserves and the sort of conservatism and you've got baked in to that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the latter. And so, our current position in &#x2013; with our casualty reserve is that across all lines of business, including property, but also casualty and more or less across all under-writing years, the actual reported losses are lower than expected by our actuaries, by a sizable amount. But it's premature now to draw final conclusions from that, because you know that we tend to be a little bit cautious here with that regard. It might take a little bit more time to materialize in a way that we will also release reserve. There is, I think, from today a quite high probability about that. If inflation stays where it is at the moment, the reserves are very, very rich. If inflation rises substantially, we have a different situation and therefore one is well-advised not to be too quick with this kind of response here.</p>
          <p>Our situation in the United States is that we are still working against negative revenue reserves in a way that means that we cannot pay dividends without the approval of the local regulator. But when I look at the operating performance of more or less all our U.S. entities, it's very stable, very pleasing and we are currently looking at a renewal round which looks, at first glance, quite good. Therefore, we are confident that the incoming earnings will allow us also in future to pay dividends, perhaps and most probably not to the same amount as this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So my question was more about the stock of excess that you have had. So that's kind of like subject to the operating performance and the ability to remit out that profitability back to the holding company. But there's also --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, yeah, exactly, yeah. So there is some overcapitalization but it's very difficult to quantify because we are not only subject to regulatory requirements but also rating requirements and our position on the market is also supported by a very strong capitalization. Therefore, it's not such an easy calculation but there is some buffer that is for sure.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions, please. First of all, could you elaborate on the new money yield? You're very good to mention what that was at the group level, 3.4%, and then what it was in the primarily life segment, 3.3%. I guess I was a bit surprised that primary life was lower than the overall group. I thought primary life would have a longer duration, perhaps a bit more appetite for credit. But, J&#xF6;rg, can you just elaborate on the new money yield, particularly for the other segments like non-life, reinsurance? And just clarify is that new money yield as of today or is that a Q3 number? Those are my two questions, please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Brian. So the difference is tiny, but the risk-bearing capability of our primary insurance operations is somewhat limited. As you know, we do not want to overcapitalize them, and therefore, they are not in a position to take very high bets here. Yeah, they are sitting on some exposure to the southern European countries, but also the primary insurance companies have a very strong focus on German bonds and highly-rated and German lender and very highly-rated credits. Therefore, there is not such a big difference between the two. And another reason is that primary insurance is &#x2013; was 75% of its premium income operating in Germany. And as such typically biased towards the German, which translates currently in relatively safe credit, whereas reinsurance is in multiple currencies and therefore, partially higher rates apply here. That is the reason for this very small difference.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good afternoon. Two questions. First &#x2013; both questions actually on ERGO life. You mentioned that the available financial resources fell and risk capital went up. Could you tell us at what stage you would believe a capital increase for ERGO or a capital injection would become necessary? And second, I saw the figures for the guarantees and the new money yields. Can you give us an indication where you see the sustainable net profit of ERGO life Germany and also for the segment life going ahead &#x2013; going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, this is difficult. I'll start with the second one, because it's so highly influenced by the impact of the swaptions, for example, which react, as you know, somewhat counterintuitive, the lower the yields, the higher the swaptions and so on on an economic basis and this refers to your first question. Yeah, primary life is particularly hit by the difficult conditions, the low interest scenario, but I have to add here that for Solvency II purposes, it's calculated on the basis of swap rates, not of German bonds. And these are substantially higher than German bonds at the moment. Second is that we do not know the final Solvency II calculation yet. And in the group context, we are absolutely well capitalized. That means from a group capital, we do not have any issue and let's see what the outcome of the final Solvency II implementation will be and then we look at the capital of the ERGO companies. Jo, do you want to add anything to that?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I come back to the question on the potential impairments, but I have to make a reservation here. This is not a linear calculation. It would be for Q4, at current levels, somewhere between &#x20AC;100 million and &#x20AC;150 million for the whole equities portfolio. And the hedges which are in place would move in the opposite direction and would mitigate some of that effect. Next question, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions, please. The first one regarding the outlook for the P&amp;C reinsurance renewals in January. Certainly the comment in your press release was a bit subdued. There is a quote here talking about market stabilizing, hardening in the number of segments. It seemed to me that you were a bit more bullish at Monte Carlo, for instance. So can you please recap your outlook for the general renewals? What do you expect in terms of price movements overall? And then the second question has to do with your investment income. So you provided some clarity on the running yield as you see it now. But also in the press release, you're talking about a shift in your investment allocation, focusing on sovereign debt of Germany, France, Netherlands, strong corporates, also talking about emerging markets. So are we here talking about the change of view in terms of the reinvestments, how meaningful is that and the reinvestment yield you just alluded to is that reflective of this new approach to your investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Jean-Francois. I'll start with the first on the renewals. I wouldn't call it bullish, but optimistic about the renewal. Yes, we are. We say that we see stable developments across the board, more or less. But, as I said during my presentation, with more and more improving tone, I cannot add more at the moment because it's just anecdotical evidence and not more what we have. And you have the usual play of brokers talking prices down and reinsurers talking prices up. I see more and more optimistic faces and we see more and more business opportunities for large deals with Solvency release character and when the Solvency II criteria will be finally defined. And with the phased implementation of the next couple of years, I'm sure that we would see substantially more of that.</p>
          <p>With regards to the investment allocation, there is no major change, but there is a constant trend to even better diversification without giving in with regards to the quality of the investments. What we did most recently was buying corporates, buying covered bonds, buying also government bonds. And especially in our government portfolio, we further diversified within the class of the strong countries like Canada, like the northern countries, and so on, and also with some investments in emerging &#x2013; in the strong emerging markets like Brazil, like China and so on. So this is the trend we are currently in but with &#x2013; not with drastic moves and reshufflings. And therefore you will not see enormous amounts of realized gains in the weeks to come. That is at least my personal expectation here. Does this answer your question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, J&#xF6;rg and team. Two questions. One &#x2013; and I apologize for German GAAP questions again, that we talked a little about the underwriting side. I was wondering whether the cost accounting &#x2013; whether you might be able to briefly outline if there is any significant FX or investment impacts on German GAAP that might hinder dividend payments. I know historically, it's relatively immune from that, but given the current volatility, whether that's an issue.</p>
          <p>Number two question is, there has &#x2013; there are, as you mentioned, I think, some big potential deals out there. I mean, <mark type="ph" /> Greek farm (53:11) has been well flagged as one that needs a little help at the moment and your name has been associated with that. But without explicitly commenting on that, I was wondering whether you might be able to comment on the way you would be happy to invest in those? My assumption is you would be looking primarily exclusively as when underwriting capacity. But would you all consider equity stakes in those particular &#x2013; in scenarios where there is <mark type="ph" /> big farm insurers (53:37) with &#x2013; that need a bit of help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy. There are no major impacts of market movements for the German GAAP calculation, especially from the change in interest rates. If interest rates go up drastically, then we can allocate part of our fixed interest portfolio to held to majority under German GAAP, which would mean that we do not have to impair it at all as long as there are no credit issues here. And the same applies more or less for currencies, yeah. So we do not foresee any problems here. So this should be no issue.</p>
          <p>Second, appetite for major deals. Yes, it is there. Yes, we have the tools at hand. And &#x2013; but we also &#x2013; we talked about our capitalization and so explained quite precisely where we are at the moment. So we are far away from any dangerous zone, but we are aware that capital is a very valuable good for Munich Re. That means we are prepared to enter into reinsurance arrangements, which have an attractive risk return pattern for us, but that has a price. That is clear under current conditions. We have no appetite for equity investments in insurance companies for such a situation, because with that we would use our capital in an inefficient way, because the capital loadings are for good reasons very high for equity investments. And in addition, there could be an issue of accumulation loading. And therefore, it is not highly probable that we do anything of that kind.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you very much. First for J&#xF6;rg. In your prospects, when you're talking about the &#x20AC;355 million expected profits for the ERGO Group, you're concerning the inclusion of the gain on the DKV foreign subsidiaries. Can you give us an indication of the order of magnitude of that? I mean, I'm assuming we're talking mid double-digits, but I'm not very familiar. So can you let us know if it's much more or much less than that? And then secondly, just to clarify your answer to another question. When you guesstimated &#x20AC;100 million to &#x20AC;150 million potential impairments of equity markets stay flat, was that fully gross number or was that net of policyholders and share &#x2013; sorry, net of policyholders share and tax? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, William, yes. It was fully growth number. That means before shareholder and taxes but the tax impact is low, close to zero, because impairments are not tax deductible for German tax purposes. Second is prospect for ERGO, in line with the prior year's numbers, roughly &#x20AC;350 million, yes, this includes the impact from the group internal sale of participations in unique health companies that is the DKV's subsidiaries with an impact of roughly &#x20AC;100 million for ERGO.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, there, a couple of questions. The one is on the U.S., just coming back again. Am I correct in assuming that you're going to be moving from negative to positive through the course of this year, so that next year basically you'll be going into the &#x2013; be able to distribute under the rule of 10% <mark type="ph" /> of sold plus your (58:07) prior year earnings, whichever is the highest or whatever?</p>
          <p>The second thing is on New Zealand. How confident are you in the &#x20AC;1.1 billion on New Zealand loss estimate and if you could talk about more in detail about February and June? And especially looking at a number of competitors that have increased sharply in the third quarter, but also looking at what you did last year, that means in the fourth quarter, you increased sharply on the first New Zealand earthquake and Antalya earthquake. It was nearly 50%. So could you give us your thoughts on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Thank you, Jason. On your first question, the issue is here that this &#x20AC;500 million goes against this number. That means that we anticipate further distributions. But I'm quite confident that we will also get in future regulatory approvals as long as the company is outperforming pretty well and are producing capital. But I expect future dividends to be lower in volume than the amount paid this year.</p>
          <p>Second, on the New Zealand losses, we had timely reserve moments. And you're right in saying that we had a major increase in the reserves already in the second quarter. So overall, it's a movement below &#x20AC;50 million &#x2013; substantially below &#x20AC;50 million and partially due to currency effects, so more or less unchanged. And this is what I said before about reporting ongoing and settlement ongoing. So we are not worried about this loss, but it's surprisingly high compared to what we saw directly after the event.</p>
