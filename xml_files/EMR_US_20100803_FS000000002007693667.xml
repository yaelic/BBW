          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Emerson Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year.  Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. At this time Emerson management will discuss non-GAAP measurements about the company's performance and the reconciliation of those to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Contained within the presentation is posted in the investor relations of Emerson's website at www.emerson.com/financial.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Ms. Lynne Maxeiner. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeremy . I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Emerson, and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2010 results. The conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available in the investor relations section of Emerson's corporate website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months.</p>
          <p>I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Third quarter sales were up 11% to 5.6 billion, with increases in all five segments. Underlying sales growth of 7% with growth resuming in the U.S. and Europe. Operating profit margin improved 330 basis points to 18%, which is a modern day record for Emerson. Business Segment EBIT margin up strongly increasing 460 basis points to 16.9%. Earnings per share from continuing operations of 78 cents up 53%. Operating cash flow of 703 million in free cash flow of 581 million. Our free cash flow conversion year-to-date is 122%. Strong trade working capital performance in the quarter with trade working capital as a percent to sales improving from 19.4% to 16.3%. We do believe the recovery will be gradual and reasonably steady, and we do not expect a double-dip recession.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the P&amp;L. Sales in the quarter of 5.641 billion, again up 11%. Underlying sales increased 7%, acquisitions added 3 points and currency added 1 point. Operating profit of 1.017 billion, or 18% of sales. The increase driven by cost reduction benefits and volume leverage. We are seeing our investments in new products and technologies paying off here, and we continue to increase investments in technology and growth.</p>
          <p>Earnings from continuing ops, up 53% to 594 million. Diluted average shares in the quarter of 757.7 million, which gets you to an EPS from continuing ops of $0.78, again, up 53%. A negative $0.01 impact from disc ops related to LANDesk gets you the reported EPS of $0.77.</p>
          <p>Slide 4, underlying sales by geography. Growth resumed in most regions, with the U.S. up 11% and Europe up 9%. Asia was up 3%. Latin America up 7%. Canada was flat. And the Middle East/Africa down 8%. Total international growth in the quarter of 4%, which gets you to the total underlying sales up 7%. Currency adds 1 point and acquisitions add 3 points, which gets you to the 11% increase in consolidated sales. China was up 7% in the quarter, and is still expected to be up 12 to 15% for fiscal 2010. Our trailing three-month underlying order trends excluding currency are up approximately 18%.</p>
          <p>Next slide, more income statement detail. Gross profit dollars of 2.211 billion, or 39.2% of sales, an increase of 310 basis points. This is driven by aggressive cost containment programs, volume leverage, restructuring benefits, acquisitions, and favorable mix, including new products.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A was 21.2% of sales, getting you to operating profit dollars of 1.017 billion or 18% of sales. Other deductions net of 70 million, with restructuring expense $56 million lower and favorable currency impact partially offset by higher amortization expense. Interest expense of 64 million gets you to the pre-tax earnings of 883 million, or 15.7% of sales. Taxes in the quarter of 273 million for a tax rate of 31%. The tax rate for the fiscal year is estimated at approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Slide 6, the cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow of 703 million, down 23% versus an extremely strong Q3 2009, when we had operating working capital liquidation of over 400 million. Capital expenditures of 122 million gets you to the free cash flow of 581 million. Our free cash flow conversion in Q3 was 99%. The trade working capital balances show another quarter of very strong improvement in trade working capital as a percent to sales ratio, improving to 16.3% of sales in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 7, the business segment P&amp;L. Business segment EBIT in the quarter of 988 million, or 16.9% of sales, up 53%, or 460 basis points, with benefits from cost reductions, volume leverage, and lower restructuring cost. Difference of accounting methods was 52 million, corporate and other of 93 million, an increase of 16 million. We had lower one-time and commodity mark-to-market gains this quarter versus the prior-year quarter.</p>
          <p>Stock compensation was neutral in the third quarter 2010, but will likely be a headwind next quarter in fourth quarter 2010. Earnings before interest and taxes from continuing ops of 947 million, interest expense, again, 64 million, gets you to our pre-tax earnings of 883 million.</p>
          <p>Next we'll go through the business segment starting with Process Management on slide 8. Sales in the quarter of 1.511 billion, up 2%. Underlying sales were down 1%, acquisitions added 2 points and currency added 1 point. By region, the U.S. was up 12%. Asia down 10%. Europe down 2%. And Middle East/Africa down 19%.</p>
          <p>Order rates are rebounding globally. The trailing three-month underlying orders excluding currency are up approximately 10%. MRO spending is driving the sales growth, and we have seen project quoting activity increasing.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars of 311 million, or 20.6% of sales, up 41%, driven by significant cost containment actions, restructuring benefits, positive mix, lower restructuring expense, and favorable impact from foreign currency transactions. We continue to increase our investments in technology and recently opened a $30 million global innovation center, including the world's largest flow lab.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Industrial Automation. Sales in the quarter of 956 million, up 18%. Underlying sales were up 16% and acquisitions added 2 points. By geography, the U.S. was up 12%. Europe was up 20%. And Asia was up 20%. We saw broad-based growth across businesses and geographies within Industrial Automation. Trailing three-month underlying orders excluding currency are up approximately 45%, and we see our global power generation orders coming back very strongly.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars of 122 million, or 12.8% of sales, driven by volume leverage and cost reduction benefits. During the quarter, we acquired Nutsteel in Brazil. This acquisition expands our presence in the global power distribution market.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, Network Power. Sales in the quarter of 1.418 billion, an increase of 7%. Underlying sales were down 1%. The Avocent acquisition added seven points and currency added one point. By geography, the U.S. was up 5%, Asia was down 3% on a tough prior year comparison and Europe was flat. The trailing three month underlying order trends excluding currency are up approximately 12%. EBIT dollars of 182 million or 12.8% of sales up 31% with positive impacts from significant cost reduction benefits, lower restructuring expense and favorable foreign currency transaction impact. In the quarter, Emerson announced the terms of an all-cash offer for Chloride Group PLC. The shareholder vote is scheduled for August 9th.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Climate Technologies. Sales in the quarter are 1.106 billion up 29%. Underlying sales up 28% and acquisitions added one point. By region, the U.S. was up 23%. Europe was up 22%. And Asia was up 49%. We saw broad based strength across Asian end markets as well as strength in European refrigeration and U.S. residential refrigeration and commercial end markets. There was also solid growth in global transport end markets. Trailing three month underlying order trends, excluding currency, remains strong, around 20%, but are moderating from the peak levels as comparisons get tougher.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars of 221 million or 20.1% of sales, the margin improvement driven by buying leverage,  benefits from cost containment actions and lower restructuring expense. Materials cost containment was substantially offset by price and wage inflation.</p>
          <p>Slide 12, Appliance and Tools. Sales up 10% to 850 million. Underlying sales increased 8% and acquisitions added two points. By geography, the U.S. was up 8%. Europe was up 23%, and Asia declined 2%. We saw growth in the tools, motors, and appliance solutions businesses that was partially offset by a decline in the residential storage business.</p>
          <p>Trailing three-month underlying orders, excluding currency, were up approximately 7%. EBIT dollars of 152 million or 18% of sales driven by volume leverage, restructuring benefits and cost containment actions. We are considering the sale of our appliance motors and U.S. commercial and industrial motors businesses and will finalize this decision in August.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the summary and outlook. We had a strong quarter with good momentum as we finish out fiscal 2010. Underlying sales growth resumed, up 7%. Our underlying order trends remain positive across all five business segments, which points to two or three-quarters of solid sales growth in front of us. Operating profit margin was very strong at 18%.</p>
          <p>We continue to see signs of recovery in our global end markets but expect it to be slow and steady. We will continue to make investments in next generation technologies and expanding our global market footprint.</p>
          <p>For fiscal year 2010, we expect underlying sales to be approximately flat and net sales up 4 to 5% to 21.7 to 21.9 billion. Operating profit margins 16.2% to 16.5%. Earnings per share in the range of 2.60 to 2.70. Operating cash flow of 3.1 to 3.2 billion. Free cash flow of 2.6 to 2.7 billion. And return on total capital, ROTC, of 17 to 18%.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Lynne.  I want to welcome everybody to the call.  I appreciate you being with us today.</p>
          <p>As you can see that we had a very strong third quarter, and continuing our recovery from what we've been undertaking the last 18 months.  The people across Emerson have continued to have strong execution relative to our order pace, which is running at 18-plus percent levels on a real underlying basis.  Sales now turning positive with a positive 7% underlying growth in the third quarter. And anticipating a higher level of underlying growth in the fourth quarter as we look at the current pace of business.  Operating margins at record levels.  Cash flow strong.</p>
          <p>Restructuring undertaken in the last 18 months clearly starting to pay back quickly in many of our marketplaces.  And then our emerging market investments which we have been accelerating the last six months as this recovery continues, continued to benefit us from a growth standpoint and also our best cost positioning standpoint.</p>
          <p>It's pretty clear to me as I look at the industrial world the trends continue to be positive.  They will be moderate.  These are no different trends than I anticipated as we looked at our business back in early this year.  We expected the business to have an inventory surge and then start slowing down.  But we continue to see pretty good growth across the world.</p>
          <p>As company after company like Emerson invest in next generation technology, they invest in the capacity. They're investing in repositioning their company, and we're seeing the money being spent by companies which have generated an enormous amount of cash flow as they position themself for this recovery.</p>
          <p>I would expect our gross fixed investment indicators which we look at, GFI, to be positive in the 4 to 5% range over the next 12 to 18 months.  A very steady recovery.  This is not what I would call robust or sharp recovery, but a steady recovery.  And I would expect the companies out there that drive this GFI, they have the money.  They're starting to spend the money and they're releasing that spending, just like us.</p>
          <p>Our capital spending bottomed probably in the May time period.  And if you look at our capital spending going forward, sequentially it will continue to improve.  This year we'll probably spend somewhere around 475 million plus or minus 5 or 10 million.  Next year we'll spend somewhere between 575 to $600 million, plus or minus $20 million.  But clearly the trend line is moving upwards.</p>
          <p>Our order pace has been very strong for the last six months.  Part of that is an inventory replenishment, part of it is an overcorrection.  But as I look at the underlying pace of that it's still very positive.  And I would expect Emerson to be next year above the 7% underlying sales growth level that we have in our target.</p>
          <p>Now, that is still below historical recovery levels, but still very positive.  So I feel very comfortable right now with what's happening.  I feel cautious, because not every economic indicator is positive.  But I also look at our space today and what's going on around the world from spending and the lack of spending for the last 18 months, it's clearly turning back to a positive mode.</p>
          <p>As I look at China, I just came back.  I did a special trip. Ed Monser and I did a trip, special trip last week to China.  The China investments are continuing to flow.  We are about to make some major investments in China, and I met with the people in Beijing to talk about these investments and get their support of what we want to do here.  So I expect China's economy to continue to move forward.  I expect us to have good growth this year.  I expect us to have growth next year, maybe not at the same level but still very good growth from China.</p>
          <p>As I look at U.S.A., I look at what's going on in America right now, industry is spending money again, which they had stopped spending and they had overcorrected and now will start spending money again, which is a benefit for companies like Emerson and other industrial companies in this space.</p>
          <p>Same thing is going to happen in Europe.  Europe had gone through two very, very difficult years.  I expect Europe to now see some growth from a spending standpoint, modest growth.  And I also expect the benefit of a weaker euro, in the 1.30 to 1.35 range, to help some of the key export markets coming out of Germany and other markets like that.</p>
          <p>So as I look at the markets around the world right now, the only markets I feel nervous about are Middle East and the Eastern Europe, these two markets I think will struggle next year.  I also feel very good about Brazil, all parts of Latin America.  I feel good about the Americas in general.  And I feel good about parts of Western Europe, and I feel good about parts of Asia in total.</p>
          <p>So right now, the trend lines, momentum are pretty good.  It will be not a normal recovery but it will still be a positive recovery.  And the key thing for us is, as we went through the restructuring starting in mid 2008 and really accelerating that through all of 2009 and the first part of 2010, we've got our position really strong from a cost standpoint, the emerging market standpoint, and now we're getting the benefits of that.</p>
          <p>I would anticipate that we will continue to have very nice leverage as we move forward here in this type of growth environment, from the standpoint of our capacity, our cost position, and a moderate growth environment. So I like this type of environment.  And I've mentioned that to you before, because I believe that we can execute extremely well with this type of growth.</p>
          <p>As you look at our profitability, we've delivered very strong record levels of profitability in the Q3.  I expect us to have very good levels of profitability in Q4.  And as we move into 2011, I expect us to also increase our profitability. And as I mentioned in February, I believe we are en route to set a new level of a 17-plus percent operating margin, and I wouldn't be surprised, based on what I see right now, we don't move to that level in 2011.</p>
          <p>As we go forward and look at the repositioning, we look at our new product efforts.  I look at selling some of our lower margin businesses.  We're getting out of some of our lower margin businesses by not taking that business on.  We're disinvesting that.  We have continued to position the company for better levels of gross profit, better levels of profitability.  And we have our global price costs in a very good position at this right time. Pretty much neutral.  This year, net material inflation has been negative.  We've been able to deal with that from a price cost standpoint.  Next year I think it's going to be neutral, maybe slightly positive net material inflation, but not a big number.  So it's well in focus right now as we look at going forward into 2011.</p>
          <p>As I look at from an operating standpoint, from the standpoint of executing at the plant level from productivity, from a working capital standpoint, the company is running at levels that we have not seen for a long time.  Our trade working capital percent to sales at record levels this quarter.  We had a record level for the second half this year.  Days in the cash cycle, record levels for the quarter, be the record level for the whole year.  Inventory days on hand set a record level in June.  And I expect that trend to continue as we move forward here into the second half of this year, going into next year.</p>
          <p>So as I look at where we sit right now, operationally-wise, the folks out there are executing for the shareholders.  We are driving higher levels of underlying growth, both an order standpoint and a sales standpoint.  We're driving very good profit conversions. And we're investing in the emerging markets for future growth and we're investing in new generation technologies. So I like the position.</p>
          <p>The other thing that's been very good, to me from this standpoint, even with the return to growth, I believe that we could have &#x2013; we could set a record level of free cash flow this year and actually get very close to $2.7 billion, despite from the standpoint of having to start investing back into the balance sheet. The operations have continued to do extremely good jobs in this area.</p>
          <p>So as I look at where we sit going forward for the next 30 to 60 days, we have a couple acquisitions and divestitures we have to get done.  I really can't talk a lot about it right now.   From Chloride, they still have the shareholders meeting on August 9.  We anticipate a positive outcome.  We anticipate closing some time in September.  And there will be one-time closing cost as we look at inventory, as we look at some of the write-offs that we have to deal with from the standpoint of closing costs, investment costs, and as we get that shareholder vote, as we move into August, as we move towards the end of August, getting sure that we're going to close in September, we will communicate what that one-time number will be.  We will let you know.  Right now, it's not in our forecast, but it will flow in and flow out and obviously from a comparison standpoint, it's something that's not really relevant as we move into the 2011 time period.</p>
          <p>We also have two divestitures underway right now.  Divestiture of LANDesk which we anticipate to be closed sometime in December.  We'll tell you what that means as we finalize that.  And we have the final evaluation of our U.S. motors industrial market business and also our appliance components business which we would also anticipate we'll make a decision here in the next week or so and then would anticipate if we move forward that would close sometime this quarter.</p>
          <p>There will be some pluses and minuses, and we will let you know what those are as soon as we have a good handle on them.  I don't want to put numbers out there just from a speculation standpoint until we have a good idea what they are.  But there'll be some pluses and some minuses, and we'll communicate those.  And as I look at it, they're just going to wash into that fourth quarter and they'll come out and they won't actually be part of the comparison as we go forward here into 2011.</p>
          <p>But clearly, as I've gotten to look at Chloride, I'm very excited about the opportunities here.  I think we're going to have a very strong global franchise with our current business, and it will be very positive as we go forward as we do the integration of the two businesses, assuming we get a positive shareholder vote on August 9.</p>
          <p>From the perspective of acquisitions, last year we did $1 billion.  This year, we're doing $3 billion.  From what I look at 2011, I would anticipate that number to be under $1 billion, to be more in line probably at half a billion dollars, around the $500 million level.  I would expect our share repurchase program, which this year's running at about $100 million, to be somewhere between 100 and $200 million based on what I see from our cash flow standpoint at this point in time.  And I expect our capital, as I said earlier, next year to be somewhere in the 575 to $600 million.</p>
          <p>We will also look at potentially looking at, do we want to sell off one other business, which we have earmarked, as I told you.  We looked at &#x2013; anticipate selling somewhere between 1 and $2 billion over the 2010 to 2012 time period, and I would look at probably doing one more sometime in 2011, not a big business, somewhere in the 100 to $200 million range.</p>
          <p>As we go into 2011, we have very good momentum.  Our order pace has continued to be strong.  We have I think slightly improving economic momentum.  It's mixed.  From the industrial standpoint it's good.  People have held back their investments and we no longer can do that.  We're going to have to start investing and we're seeing that.</p>
          <p>I like the shape of our business as we continue to invest in emerging markets. Those markets are going to grow.  I also see that we'll see some sustained recovery in our mature markets both here at U.S. and in Europe.  And I think the repositioning of the company will benefit us from the standpoint of the markets we serve as we move into 2011 to drive a pretty good underlying growth rate.  As I said, I would anticipate at this point in time looking at what I look at today, our underlying growth rate to be above the 5 to 7% range, which will be a good thing for us to do.  If you look at the last recovery it would be a lot higher than that.  But we're clearly on a different recovery.</p>
          <p>So as I look at today, I'm extremely pleased with the people across this company and the execution for the last two years.  We are now delivering what I would say a very strong above-average growth, profitability and cash flow conversion.  The momentum is good across this company.  I like where we sit from a restructuring standpoint.  We will do less restructuring next year.  Probably in the 120 to 130 million range but we still have restructuring to get done across the world, as we continue to position ourself for best cost and for growth in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And we will have some positive tailwinds.  Our long-term compensation program will not double up next year.  It will be a single plan which will help us.  I do anticipate interest rates will stay low which might carry a mild pension headwind, but I mean mild pension headwind, not something I'm worried about too much at this point in time.</p>
          <p>And as I sit right now, I feel good about closing out this year.  The board today reviewed where we sit relative to this year and the next six months, and I think that we had a very positive conversation relative to the momentum we have created with the company right now.  And job one for us was continue to grow the new products, continue to invest in that future, continue to invest in emerging markets and continue to execute at higher levels of profitability to take this company to the levels not seen before as we committed to you shareholders back in February.</p>
          <p>So with that, I want to close saying thank you very much across the organization for the commitment you gave us the last six months, and particularly this quarter.  We look forward to a strong close and we look forward to a strong 2011.</p>
          <p>I thank everyone for joining us and look forward to answering any questions I feel are appropriate.  Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Great results so far this year, Dave.  Can you talk a little bit about these big margins, though?  Coming back, I went back and looked at about ten years of data, and I don't think we've ever seen incrementals at this magnitude and obviously last year's restructuring is really paying off.  But what do you think about sustainability and kind of that balance between making additional investments and keeping those margins up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a couple of things going on as we look and analyze from a profitability standpoint.  The repositioning, the restructuring has really helped us from a cost standpoint, plus we've been repositioning into businesses which generate higher levels of margin.  And we're moving away from lower margins.  So that helps us a little bit.</p>
          <p>The second thing that's helped us, and it's very, very difficult to anticipate or quantify how much it means to us, but if you remember, Scott, last year we were greatly decreasing inventory.  We took out about $700 million of inventory as our sales dropped.  We've got that inventory out by the end of the fiscal year.  And then our businesses stabilized, from the standpoint of our run rates and our inventory.  And so now as we've moved into a growth mode for production, we are replenishing and building inventory live and we're building it in very low cost, best cost locations, and that productivity is really helping us. That's helping us a little bit.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, there's two other things that helped us that I would say gave us what I would say an extraordinary margin at the 18% level.  Number one, from the perspective of currency.  The currency market swung a little bit on us from a transactional standpoint, and because of the way the euro moved from very strong to very weak, it gave us a benefit of some of our transactional hedging that we do at the divisional level that gave us some margin improvement, in particular companies like the process business got this benefit.</p>
          <p>But as I look at the fundamentals right now, and I look at this fundamental margin, I fundamentally believe, as I said to you in February, we will drive this peak above 17%.  We are not cutting corners relative to our long-term investments.  It's just that we are fundamentally mixing the business to give us a higher margin and allow us to sustain that and still have sustainable investments.</p>
          <p>So there's a lot of things going our way right now this quarter.  Not as many will go that way next quarter.  So typically, our third to fourth quarter, we've seen margin expansion.  I think it'd be very good for us if we have a flat margin or slightly tick up higher margin as I look at that fourth quarter based on what benefits we had in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>But I like where we are at right now.  We're running at levels unseen ever at Emerson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for sure.  Dave, you mentioned you just got back from China and are making bigger investments there, but can you give us maybe a state of the union of what you're seeing in the local environment there and sustainability, and that'll be my last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the perspective of China, I think the market &#x2013; we're going to still have pretty good growth.  It's slowing down.  The government's clearly modulating what they're going to invest in.  I think the economic growth will still be very positive next year.  We are making investments primarily in the Process business, our Climate business, some of our Industrial business and a bit &#x2013; one of our Storage businesses, and some unique positioning that we want to go after the mid-tier market in China, and both for China but also expanding across Asia-Pacific.  So I think the China market right now is clearly slowing.  I still feel okay about it as we move into next year. I think it'll continue to slow.  But I think we'll still drive maybe 8, 9, 10, 11% growth next year in China.  I am not worried about China at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is in &#x2013; just trying to get a sense for what's changed and improved in your outlook, or what's driven the improvement over last since I think the beginning of June, when you looked at sort of Europe and the macro situation in Europe and the U.S., and the impact that would have on China. What I'm hearing in this call is really just more concern around the Middle East, but a frankly more positive sentiment around these other areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that from the U.S. standpoint, the economic stability is there from the industrial world as we had cut back so deeply for so long, and now as the companies decide, okay, we need to invest in productivity.  We need to invest in some incremental capacity. We need to do certain things for new products that momentum is going to continue.  And we have the cash to be able to do that.  If you at look at the balance sheet for most of our customers in this space, they're very strong, and many of these customers have global businesses which are now improving and they're starting to export.  So that has changed in the last, I would say the last 90 days, that has continued.  I expect that modest momentum to continue.  I'm not looking for sharp, sharp, sharp numbers recovery but a modest type of recovery.  And there's clearly concern at all times is something going to hiccup that. But at this point in time just looking at my own investments that we're doing internally which we held off, we now are to the point that as we restructure and reposition, we need to make incremental investments both from a technology, new products and capacity standpoint.</p>
          <p>In Europe, they've gone through a very difficult two-year time period.  The governments are attacking.  I think there are issues relative to some of their cost positions, the debt positions and with the weaker euro even at the 1.30, 1.35 level they've become a stronger export engine around the world, and we will benefit from that as we look at the order pace.  So I would anticipate Europe to have a very nice recovery even though the economic numbers may not be that robust.  So that's my view of this right now, and I think that the companies feel comfortable, our customers feel comfortable and they're starting to invest.  If there's a change, we'll see that in the next 60 to 90 days, but if you look at our order pace, our order pace on a month by month basis, has continued to sequentially get better.  I anticipate within the next two months, this month here or the next month, that pace will start slowing down, but I still think it's going to move down towards that 8, 9% level as we look at where things are going at this point in time.  It's a modest recovery, but a recovery that's supported by companies that have the cash and the investment needs to be made.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we talk specifically about the big Climate Technologies had a huge volume gain, probably much bigger than I expected.  Phenomenal margins and I don't think we've ever seen that.  What's driving that, and what caused that big step-up in profitability?  You talked about sustainability, but this is a new level for that part of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a couple things going on. You'll remember probably two or three years ago that we made the decision to move forward and create some best cost manufacturing locations of the Climate business.  We did that both in Eastern Europe. We did that- expanded in China. We expanded in Thailand and we built a new facility in Mexico.  We obviously got hit with that during the downturn, and I took the blame for that because I made the decision to move forward.  We're now getting a tremendous benefit of that cost structure as we recover.  That's helping us.  We made the investments, we made the decision to reposition and now we're getting the benefit of that cost structure.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you look at all the markets we had gone for three years what I would say challenging markets in this space, and people had to start buying again, and so we saw a recovery.  Even though the housing market's not recovering, people had to make investments in their heating and cooling systems.  And we get the benefit of that. Even if they don't replace the whole system, we get the benefit of it from a compressor and a technology standpoint.</p>
          <p>And the third thing is, as the efficiencies have changed and they've had to go into more, higher level scroll, a higher level electronics, and higher-end type of products that's a good mix both from our customer and also for ourself, from the standpoint of higher dollar values, so we get that benefit for growth, and also higher profitability.</p>
          <p>So we've had a lot of good things come our way here in the last 12 months.  I anticipate the business still will be good, but the growth rates will moderate, and we'll have to try invest.  We could start seeing some of the mix change in the margin a little bit, but we have set a new level of profitability like we did in Process.  And I believe it will be one of these nice levels that we sit up there and we'll drift back down as things slow down, but it's a nice level of profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess you didn't use the China new standards that went in as part of this thing, that was not a big major deal in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From my perspective, that started a year ago.  It definitely was a help, there's no doubt about it.  It was part of the whole efficiency standards I said improvement.  So we have that going on in Europe, in the United States, and in China.  So all those things help us from that mix standpoint.  And we have the market recovery.  This business will cycle from quarter to quarter but right now it's been in a pretty good sweet spot for the last 12 months.  It started recovering at this time last year so we're now starting to get into the tougher comparisons.  The management team has executed extremely well on new products. They brought a lot of new technology into play and we have the best best cost locations in the world now for this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One final question.  Same thing in Process Management, the 20.6% margin you got, that mix from MRO and, of course, you mentioned currency, was that a percent or two of the margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So does that go back down a little bit towards the high teens is more likely in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From my perspective we had a couple of things go our way in the Process world.  The Process Management team did a great job starting mid last year restructuring, and they really got behind and did it.  And got it done and we're seeing that benefit.</p>
          <p>Two, we did get a benefit from currency in the quarter.  They are clearly one of our more international companies, in particular in Europe, and they had some transactional hedging which moved our way.  Some quarters it moves our way, some quarters it moves against us, right?  This quarter it moved for us.  That did help us from a margin standpoint.  Third, MRO was really strong in North America, again as companies had held off last year.  They start spending and the large projects really haven't started kicking in yet which are will start kicking in probably in the first half of 2011.  I anticipate the profit margins at Process to stay at pretty good levels maybe in the 18 to 20% level here as we go forward here the next couple quarters.  But this business has run at 20% a lot before.  People always question us, can we do it?  We invest a lot of money.  We have a very good mix of our business, and we are also very aggressive relative to repositioning our cost base.  So we drive hard to deliver this 18 to 20% operating profit margins in this business, and I think we can continue to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Dave, just picking up on Climate.  Wondering on your thoughts in terms of the hot weather that the Northeast has been experiencing the last few weeks. Has that played into results to any meaningful degree? And perhaps, if not this quarter, what about the September quarter and maybe a little bit of potential channel fill or inventory restock or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the channel right now &#x2013;  in supplying this industry the supplier base is probably as stressed as far as you can go.  I don't think there's much upside.  I think what it means is hot weather will liquidate inventory, which will allow us to stay stronger probably in the first four or five months in the next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>We've been running very strong.  I think right now, as I look at what's going on in the supply chain out there, I think there's some tension.  That means some of the guys are having to struggle to keep up.  We're not having any problem at this point in time because we put the capacity on two or three years ago.  But there are other people that are having trouble keeping up.  We're not the only supplier to the HVAC industry.</p>
          <p>And so I would anticipate the hot weather will liquidate inventory.  I anticipate that we will not see a lot of surges in the upside right now.  I think we'll see a stronger first fiscal quarter or fourth calendar quarter because of the liquidation of inventory.  That's what I see at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then thinking about the timeline, Dave, where does your capacity stand?  I know you talked about Eastern Europe and Mexico, if you do see a surge later call it in fiscal '11, are you prepared to meet that upside demand or are you having to look to put capacity in or where does that stand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, one of the reasons I took my trip to China is because we're about to expand in China both from a manufacturing of compressors, but also for the next generation technology investments.  I want making sure that we get protected, which I've got the commitment that we will be protected.  And we'll be significantly expanding Suzhou relative to technology and all manufacturing.  We're also putting an expansion in Mexico at this point in time.  So we are already looking into 2012.  I'm okay for 2011.  From our perspective, John, we in this industry we look out about two to three years.  And so I'm already making investments for 2012 and 2013.  We're okay.</p>

          <p>I understand.  Industrial Automation -- you'll like this -- the volume levels if you think of sort of the run rate today they're so much below where they were at the peak.  I'm just thinking kind of once we through the whole comps issue we're rolling into next year, shouldn't that business be running on an order rate perspective above the eight-ish percent that you think the underlying company can do.  And how do you think about that business basically growing forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, your observations are right on the mark.  This business has went really deep and I think will conceivably run at very high levels here, probably for 18 to 24 months.  It will modulate at the high end of our growth rate in the recovery mode, which we're starting to kick into right now.  And so as I look at the investments around the world, the type of investments we're in I think it's going to be a pretty good marketplace for us.  I think it's still going to take three, four years to get back to levels that we were in 2008.  But I think because of our restructuring, our profitability is going to come back much faster.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on projects.  In terms of what you're seeing out there, are you seeing -- do you expect a surge here once we get into the fall where companies feel better about 2011 and the spending really picks up or is this going to be more gradual in terms of how things pick up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's going to be more gradual.  There are a handful, probably 10 let's say, very large projects around the world primarily in emerging markets, like Brazil. There's several large ones going on in Brazil, couple in India, couple in China.  Most of the projects we see right now are what I call small-medium size, not the 100 to $200 million level projects, but more the 10 to $25 million level projects.  And I don't think we're going to see a surge.  I think you're going to see a gradual improvement.  We're seeing that going on right now.  We see that both in Process.  I see that in Industrial and I see that in Network Power.  The activity level is increasing, and getting stronger as people get more and more comfortable relative to the investments they're going to make.  So I feel right now based on talking to CEOs around the world, they have the money.  They've held back.  And so therefore they're going to start inching this capital out like we're doing right now with a little bit of improvement every quarter.  As long as they're getting the payback, and seeing the growth, they're going to keep going this way.  So that's why I feel reasonably comfortable that we're going to see a modest recovery.  I feel modestly optimistic about it.  And I like our cost position, and I like where we're positioned on a global basis.  That's where my basis comes from for this recovery not some economic models.</p>

          <p>Okay, that's helpful, thanks.  And then on Climate, I don't recall seeing commercial being mentioned as an area of strength here recently, what are you seeing there?  Are you more encouraged with what you're seeing on the commercial side as it relates to Climate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes.  Commercial has continued to improve both here in the U.S. and also in Asia.  And I think we're going to start to see an improvement in Europe starting about now because the commercial business in Europe has also been underinvested for the last couple of years, and you're going to see some of the marketplaces, in particular the export marketplaces that Western Europe serves will be better.  So I think our Climate business is going to shift a little bit here. It's going to go from less residential, less to that area to more commercial as that growth rate modulates.  And that will help us also from a profitability standpoint.</p>

          <p>Around the electronic component area, primarily the active electronic component area, I see the first signs of it stabilizing.  I believe that it will probably take until the rest of this calendar year, early couple months of 2011.  But I start seeing it stabilize, now as capacity is coming on from the suppliers there.  And clearly we could have more sales, but I think it's going to take us a while to work our way through there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Dave, you mentioned the Climate Tech margins being reset along the lines of the Process Management in the past.  Can you give a little bit of a framework for thinking about how Network Power might come along into that solution, higher margin pathway over time?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I've talked about before historically our Network Power business would go down to that 8, 9% level and move its way up to, say, the 13, 14.  I believe the work we're undertaking right now and with the acquisition of Chloride, that range is going to be, we will drive above 15% as we get into the peaks of this recovery.  There's a couple of more years before that recovery happens.  But I believe we're trying to drive this business to being in the 10 to 15% level, and I think that's where we're going to go for that range.  And I would like to see in this cycle get to that 15% level, which we've not reached before on an annual basis.</p>

          <p>I think we're Process is in the mode of recovery and what that cycle looks like.  This is an unusual cycle in many of our businesses.  So I'd be very careful about mapping cycles right now for a while.  I'm struggling with it myself and I run the business.  I think you're going to see a pretty good first half for Process which will probably not be the same type of mode that we would see normally in a cycle right now.  Because we're coming out of it.  And the question is, what's the mix of those projects, what's the mix of MRO and where is it coming from.  Right now I would say that momentum is pretty good for an unusual first half for Process.</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is in your Asia business outside China, because your China business obviously grew much more than Asia overall.  So I just was wondering what was happening within your Asia business.  I saw you said the Process is down 19% in Asia.  Appliance and tools is down 2%.  So I just wondered if you could give more clarity on Asia ex-China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, Julian, I think there's a lot of projects that go in and out, and we had a phenomenal last year in Process in Asia.  So the business moves around from quarter to quarter.  There's nothing unusual there other than we went through a period that we had some very large projects that shipped last year.  Then we had a period of very little order pace.  Now the order pace was going positive and we're starting to replenish that.  So it's a lumpy business in Process, in particular in Asia and Latin America.  So there's nothing really hard you can get out of that.  But I can tell you the pace has picked back up in orders in Asia for Process.  The other one is appliance and tools?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just within Asia, both Process and appliance and tools were down, I was just asking about those things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Things move in and out.  The Process is far more important in Asia that appliance and tools.  By the way, am I going to win the bet or are you going to win the bet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I think we had a bet that the second half would be 580, I even gave you the calendar year second half.  I think I know the numbers.  I think you're going to owe me 20 bucks, partner.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The other one was just the SG&amp;A to sales ratio.  That was sort of flat year on year and came down a bit from the first half to Q3.  I guess you'll grow that sort of in line with your revenues, when you're talking about the investments in emerging markets and so on, just how you see SG&amp;A to sales from here?  Because obviously your order growth is running far above your revenue growth.  So I'm wondering if your OpEx growth would start to catch up with your order growth or you'll keep it in pace with revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't be surprised next year if our SG&amp;A doesn't go up from the mix of business.  As the higher GP margin business and Network Power kicks back in for sales, as the higher GP margin business for Process kicks back in. They both have higher SG&amp;A.  My gut tells me next year our SG&amp;A might tick up a tenth or two, at the same time our GP margin ticks up.  If the mix goes on, a little bit right now, the mix helps us, to be honest for SG&amp;A this year. Next year it's going to move against us.  But I would expect our SG&amp;A to move in line with sales and maybe a little bit faster in sales as Network Power and as Process kicks back in.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Appreciate the color on '11 and just wanted to follow up on a couple of points there.  One, wondering if -- well, I think we're probably crossing the line asking a lot of detail about Chloride accretion, dilution at this point.  But maybe if you think about all the acquisition carry over into '11 and net that with the divestiture picture that you know of, how do we calibrate kind of the acquisition impact all in, both revenues and EPS in '11, if we can do that at this point on '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little bit early.  I think, from the sales standpoint, we'll be okay.  The motor business that we're looking at selling is about $800 million. And &#x2013; so that will come out. If we make the decision to go forward, that will come out.  But then we've got other businesses.  Chloride's going to run around, I want to say around 500 million? What's it? Yeah, around 500 million in the &#x2013; yeah, a little bit of 550 in sales and dollars.  And we've done some of the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>So I think the sales standpoint will be okay.  Fundamentally, what I would factor in right now, and we're just starting this process, my opinion will be the 2010 acquisitions will be slightly EPS dilutive to us.  Chloride will be, based on what &#x2013; you can see the numbers. And also we will be taking out the motor business, which did make money, though not high levels of profitability, so that will also hurt us.</p>
          <p>We'll lay it out for you as soon as we get this in focus and share it with the board but overall for us to do is we're going to have great underlying performance which we talked about and then we have a couple of negative things we have to deal with and then we have a positive headwind. So we've got some things going our way and some things going against us, so I expect a pretty good year next year based on what I see at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then also a follow-up on your 2011 commentary around the margins.  I think you said 17% plus.  If you calibrate the fourth quarter at 18, a little over 18, you're kind of at 16.5% for the year.  If we put the acquisition effect aside for a moment, 30% incrementals would get you over 18% versus the over 17.  And maybe that's just if way you were scoping it out not trying to be as precise as I'm trying to be.  Why on underlying basis might 30% in incremental margins not be pretty doable next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they will be pretty doable, but you have to factor in all the acquisitions and divestitures going in there.  So there's no doubt that the margin will be above 17% next year.  The question is, is it going to be 17.1 or is it going to be 17.5.  It's a little bit early to be making that call but we're going to set a record level margin next year based on what I see right now, assuming the underlying growth continues to happen as I see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thirdly, lastly, quickly, if I could, can you talk about the data center cycle as you see it.  Both in terms of how you think you're doing versus peers here in the near term, but how long do you think this very strong level of demand on the data center build out can continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The data center has an interesting thing, obviously the inquiries and order pace is turning positive right now.  I don't think there's been any major shifts amongst the major players at this point in time.  If you look back at late 2008, early 2009, that business continued to do very well, because it's a longer cycle business.  They put the capacity on line.  Now they're absorbing that capacity.  Now they are starting to see that they're going to need more incremental capacity as they leave '010 and go into 2011.  So I think the cycle which usually runs four or five years is just starting to kick back in, and it should be pretty good cycle as we start going into 2011.  I don't think there's been any fundamental shift relative to the market positions.  There's so many moving parts out there when companies talk about it and no one reports a clear number.  But based on what I know of the marketplace, I think we're all starting to recover and we're all going to start doing pretty good as the market continues to get stronger and stronger.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, how about final question from me.  A little more color on Industrial Automation? It sounds like the orders real strong.  You haven't really disaggregated that business on the call. You're buying what sounds like a business for EPT in Brazil.  Maybe just give us some color around the alternator business and EPT and control techniques and what else is going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the industrial businesses are starting to come back around the world.  So the business we bought in Brazil is actually for EGS.  And it has the IEC technology, which we really didn't have a lot of IEC technology. It's a nice little business.</p>
          <p>I mean, from my perspective, people are going to start spending money.  They had underinvested.  They had taken a lot of capacity offline as they reposition, and now that people are starting to spend money, I think you're going to see a gradual recovery, as I said on the phone, I think this is going to unfold over the next two or three years.  But our cost position is pretty good, and I think we'll see pretty good growth here in the industrial space, and all the industrial companies will do pretty well here for at least 12 to 18 months as this continues the recovery.  I feel good about this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did I hear Lynne in her comments saying the orders there were tracking 45%?  Did I misunderstand that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a correct number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That sounds like more than a gradual recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You got to think about where it came from. It came from death. I mean it came from like zero.  And so it's going to be a high level number and then it'll slip its way back down.  We just wanted to give you a little nugget to let you know that we actually do have pretty good growth in this company unlike what you think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're listening. Thanks, Dave.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>See you later, Bob. Have a great rest of the summer. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.</p>
          <p>Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon, guys.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How are things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not too bad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sounds like life's good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're going to set 104 in St. Louis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a couple of compressors, I can hear them cracking out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great for business.  Obviously you covered a lot of ground here so I've got three quick ones for you.  Just want to calibrate the comment on the four key margins, I think you talked about modest expansion, was that a Q over Q or year over year, Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our fourth quarter margin is going to be pretty close to what it was in the third quarter.  Because third quarter had some help from the standpoint, a couple things I said we had great mix. We had the currency helping us a little bit for that margin.  So I think typically when we go third to fourth it would be up.  I think today I think our third to fourth sequentially, third to fourth, will probably be about the same level of profitability at very, very high levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As someone pointed out earlier I'm not backing off investments.  I'm not interested in inflating margins just to inflate the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then secondly you talked about the Network Power supply chain shortage.  The gap between order growth and organic growth has been pretty wide for two quarters now.  Implies that there's some nice backlog build in that business.  I'm just wondering once you get beyond the supply chain shortages should we expect a surge in core growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should see as I've been telling my guys I expect some pretty good underlying growth rate once we get things balanced, assuming there's not double orders going on out there, which you can never tell, which I probably bet there are.  But I expect some pretty good underlying growth to catch up that backlog and to catch up that order pace that's been going on.  The answer is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then finally, just on the motors business, if you listen to the press, it sounds like this process has been in process for quite some time.  What's been the big delay in terms of filling this up?  Is it price?  Is it structure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, there's a rumor that Crompton was bidding on something, which is not true.  That rumor is not true.  We don't even have a transformer business at Emerson, as you know.  It's been going on because there's been a very, very strong interest.  So there was a lot of participants.  We are now narrowing it down to a couple and we're going to be making the decisions here in I would say the next ten days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's where we are.  So we're moving to a closure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks.</p>

          <p>Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Steve Searl from Conning Asset Management. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your short-term debt went up about a billion from the March quarter, I was curious what drove that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to put money up for Chloride.  Part of the U.K. takeover rules is you have to have money in the bank ready to do Chloride when we made the offer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So was that just commercial paper borrowing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You got it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And once that closes you're just going to draw down on your cash balances, you're not going to issue new debt to fund that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to draw down our cash balance, and we happen to generate pretty close to $3 billion operating cash flow a year, so I'd say we'd be paying off within six months out of our international markets.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I decided that you're on the good guy list since you're charging me all this money to participate in Chloride.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to start with a layup and ask you if you're hiring in the U.S.  But I think I'll move on and talk about HVAC.  What do you see -- your revenue comps I think in the U.S. were, what were they in North America HVAC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously better than the kind of the mid teens that the OEMs are reporting, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is that kind of an ongoing replace versus &#x2013; or fix versus replace dynamic there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty dramatic.  So I mean these consumers are just, are not going-- is that more a function of how expensive the new systems are or what's your guy's sense around or just generally the high unemployment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's three things.  One, people are very concerned because they don't have a job or they may lose their job so they're being very concerned about how much they want to spend for a whole new system.  Two, there's a shock and awe effect when the guy walks out and says I need this much space to install your new high efficiency unit.  And after you hit the ground they throw water on it, and wake you up, you start to say, I don't have that type of space to put it in, okay?  So there's a shock and awe effect.  And the third thing really boils down to is people realizing that they can just replace components sometimes and keep the system going for another two or three years and they're going to do that in this type of environment.  It's a good thing for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How concerned are you that the guys in Washington don't approve something that's comparable to the $1,500 tax credit is that a factor in how we think about next year?  I know there's...</p>

          <p>Irrelevant for you guys, I guess, but for the industry irrelevant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I personally think tax incentives don't do diddly squat other than pull stuff forward for six months and then you have a big hole so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's what I mean, are you worried that there's a big hole for the OEMs next year because of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll see.  We'll see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then one more question just on the appliance and tools business has gone through, going through a little bit of a facelift.  Anything else in the portfolio that's of size that you're looking to kind of swap out of here over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be more businesses in the appliance and tools section that will be sold over the next two or three years, but as I said earlier I don't anticipate anything of substance next year. I'm looking at one business or two businesses in the 100 to $200 million range nothing of size at this point in time.  We'll probably wait for a continued recovery to happen there.</p>
