          <p>Hello. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Husky Energy Second Quarter 2010 Conference Call and Webcast. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Patrick Aherne, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today to talk about our 2010 second quarter. With me in the room today are our new CEO, Asim Ghosh; our CFO, Alister Cowan; our COO, Robert Peabody; and our Vice President of Mid-Stream and Refined Products, Terrance Kutryk.</p>
          <p>Today, Asim is going to provide an overview of Husky's strategic direction and then Alister will talk about the company's second quarter performance. Rob will provide an update on the upstream operations and Terrance will conclude with talking about the mid-stream and downstream activities.</p>
          <p>Please note that in today's call, there will be some forward-looking information and actual results may differ materially from the expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions, which we've described in our quarterly release, in our annual filings and those are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and on our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Asim.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking the time to join us. I've met a couple of few people before, but I am sure most of you will be new and then it's a media over the telephone, but nice to meet you anyway.</p>
          <p>I think in the circumstances given that clearly there has been a &#x2013; I am new in the chair. Before I get into a discussion of the second quarter results, it might be worth a while for me to put ourselves back and look at the bigger picture from my fresh eyes so to speak view point.</p>
          <p>I've been in the position actually for less than two months as we speak, but I've been a Board member since May, 2009 and I guess what I am going to say today reflects the cumulative learnings over that more intense two months and the Board advantage view point since last May, 2009.</p>
          <p>So let me start with a look at basically what I'd call in a non-financial sense our balance sheet. And the first thing that strikes me, and I actually said this to a couple of you, whom I've had the opportunity to meet is the one thing that sticks out when you look at Husky compared to any of our peers is, the completely outstanding resource base that we've got.</p>
          <p>It's a country-to-country across a range of types of resources, different levels of maturity and I'll build on that theme in a minute, but the simplest qualified sort of quantification I can give of that is that if I take last year's production rate, we got something in excess of 60 years worth of discovered recoverable resource, and I stress the word recoverable resource, not total resource available to this company.</p>
          <p>The second point I just touched on actually weekly is that that resource base is very diverse and therefore we don't have an exposure to market psychos and market FAS in any single type of play, you know, we are not an Oil Sands company. We are not an offshore company. We are not a resource company. We are all of the above.</p>
          <p>So that's the second thing that hits me. And then in the context of portfolio management really what I would say is, our conventional assets in Western Canada and our heavy oil assets in the Lloyd complex are basically what I would consider as the company's bread and butter of providing a solid sustainable foundation of cash flow.</p>
          <p>Then looking to the growth part of the assets, we have three tremendous pillars. One is absolutely unenviable position in the Oil Sands and leading all the way from technologies still to be discovered to capitalize in Saleski, but the here and now types of top tier results in Sunrise.</p>
          <p>Then we got continued growth on our East Coast where we haven't really very, very strong position, but while this is already delivered, the further investment it still has material long life and in fact up side ahead of it and finally, of course, we've got a growth opportunity in South East Asia. So that's it for the portfolio part of it.</p>
          <p>The second part I will highlight is that, sticks out to anybody coming in a fresh into this company is a very defined strong corporate culture, which has a number of elements to that, I'll speak to them in a minute. But the corporate cultures, high intangibles then they cannot be put down on a piece of paper. They evolve over decades and in this case if you are talking like seven decades.</p>
          <p>So we got a very talented and dedicated employee base and its better &#x2013; the backbone of our company, it is middle management and this company has got middle management that is got being with the company for decades. That is a depth of knowledge of the business and a commitment to the business and I'll drill another very strong part of the culture in my next section.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there is a very strong safety culture and Rob will expand on this later and we are not talking of this because safety happens to be sort of very top of mind right now. It is something that hits me as soon as I joined this company and thought of the Board and actually got them in health and safety committee.</p>
          <p>So I mean that in itself was symbolic for you that is needed, that comes in and gets the health and safety committee. So it is not something that is static for us and we have in that employee base and through our work skills and technology leading positions in several core producing areas such as heavy oil, such as east coast, which great enablers to our business strategies going forward.</p>
          <p>The first strength I want to mention and again this is really an amplification of culture is our cost consciousness. This company I mean, I've strongly &#x2013; one of my industry colleagues has been in this company for a few years, but he has been around and he has been in a number of companies and when they are doing a soft analysis of the company and this guys has more perspective than virtually we have made in the oil industry.</p>
          <p>Hey, where would you rate Husky on cost consciousness? He said, immediate words, best in class. So by cost consciousness, I don't mean cost cutting, I mean a basic in eight is as of prudent discipline allocation of capital of budgetary control of execution, which is deeply invained in our culture.</p>
          <p>The final differentiator I will mention again, because this has had to what I point on leading us to is our strong balance sheet and as you know John and the management team before me have worked diligently to create and maintain a strong balance sheet and honor those relatives and I would say absolute basis we have low debt levels, which has been a key Husky strength. However, a strong balance sheet is only an advantage if we use it wise to create shareholder value and that's the topic I will touch on in a minute.</p>
          <p>Coming now to the issue of the day, so as I said, the company is extremely well positioned for the long-term, but we do have and let's call a stellar state some short-term issues around production.</p>
          <p>In 2008, I guess, that's right, that's right, in 2008, as the economic markets went into &#x2013; as the markets were in a bit of turmoil, we took a very prudent approach in managing the international position as you will recollect and we spoke about at that time. And we had a number of long-term projects which we didn't want to jeopardize because that's what jeopardized the position of Husky in the long-term. So, therefore we did take off some short-term production opportunities, knowing at that point, that there will be a price to be paid in the 18 to 24 month period and we're seeing some of that now.</p>
          <p>So, while we have emerged from that recession in a very strong financial position, we are seeing that impact on the current production levels and therefore I would say my single action point at this point in time is, while maintaining the integrity of our long-term projects, we are going to rebalance our portfolio. We will direct a measure of our capital to those low cost high return projects which give us a reasonably short-term returns and by short-term in the oil industry context this is not like telecom where it is conformed, but this is &#x2013; so we are really talking 18 to 24 months from now we'll start to see the impacts of those. And the goal would be to build a production bridge while maintaining the integrity of our long-term objectives.</p>
          <p>So, how are we going to do this? Well, some of the investment, our capital investment will shift towards our bread and butter shop in our four Western Canada areas and over the next few quarters, we will be identifying opportunities and taking action to increase the short-term organic growth and as I just mentioned we should see the response in 12 to 18 months and we will also more importantly, that's for the organic part, but in an organic sense, we will be completely open to acquisitions of properties which give us currently flowing barrels in a -- I stress completely intended to a culture than in conscious way.</p>
          <p>And to put some further perspective on these acquisitions, we are looking for opportunities that the word I've used, we are looking for opportunities that strategic contiguity with what we've got i.e. acquisitions that are either near or adjacent to our existing operations where we can realize synergies or acquisitions where you can apply I think bigger skills to realize value. You won't see us going up to Afghanistan or offshore India or other sexy parts that abate. We are going to stick to the netting because that is what Husky is good at because this company has a lot of experience in meeting certain things and its kind of something that comes historically naturally to me, okay.</p>
          <p>So going forward, how we add to our shareholder the value, so you had discussion on this before, but it was a little bit reiteration in the context of change of that. The first for oil of course is Oil Sands. And as I said earlier, this company has an incredible Oil Sands resource base and those are going to play an increasingly prominence role in our production profile and as you know it is an exciting story to tell because our portfolio in this projects have contained over -- overall magnitude $50 billion of discovered petroleum initially in place of which 4 billion are recoverable using today's known here in our technology, and these projects alone when commercialized could double Husky's productions in time.</p>
          <p>Now, this -- the first major new project of course is Sunrise which is a top gear results and we are making good progress on these development. We've should receive the tenders I think today is 28th, so that the closure date is within this month and we are on fact to sanction the project by year-end. We are confident that these vital resources and I believe there are vital for the energy needs of today's world will be developed within the context of our commitment to safety, and our focus on responsible environmental stewardship because that again is something that is core to the heart of Husky's value system.</p>
          <p>The second pillar of growth is the leading position we built already on East Coast and while White Rose has been very profitable, it will continue production from the Main Field, but &#x2013; and I just want to put some perspective on it, I guess if you take the total amount of money we put out into a White Rose we recovered what 3.5 times Alistar I would say over a seven year timeframe, three and half times of that so that's the perspective on where White Rose has been, but it's a decline.</p>
          <p>So we believe we can increase the resources coming from White Rose above the 30 to 35% level under the current development scheme. We are accessing development opportunities of other near field tiebacks and production from other reservoir zones such as the Hiberner formation. We've been advancing, our steady of development alternatives for large gas resource in the area which currently of course as you know we are not harvesting, it's been pumped back in, and as many of you know there is I think in excess of 2 tcf of gas in the White Rose Field alone.</p>
          <p>And our East Coast portfolio basically includes 23 significant discoveries in the offshore Newfoundland and Labrador area, so it's a land position second to none. The third pillar of growth is the exciting story that continues to emerge from South East Asia. The core Wenchang oil field in the Pearl River Mouth basin, keeps contributing to high net gas production and developing work is continuing on the significant Liwan gas discovery.</p>
          <p>Now, some of you are aware, we spoke a month before, about the possibility of a spin-off, so we are evaluating in detail whether a spin-out and a separate listing of our Asian assets represents the best way to maximize value for the shareholders, all our shareholder -- minority and significant shareholders.</p>
          <p>But if any such transaction, it goes without saying that meticulous attention must be paid to legal, to regulatory, to tax considerations in Canada, and also in the countries where these assets are operated. So that work is currently underway, and we would be in a position to make a definitive recommendation before year-end. And I don't want to preempt any conclusion, as I said, that is something we are simply studying at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Coming now to the quarter, I am going to hand over to my colleagues Rob, COO, whom many of you have met in previous calls and Alister our CFO. But basically I just want to repeat a couple of highlight points that a key goal at this point for the Company is to deliver near-term production growth.</p>
          <p>To that intent as we talked about acquisitions, so we have actually mentioned this in our press release that we've just recently signed a letter of intent to purchase some natural gas producing properties, which are currently flowing barrels, which meet the criteria of synergies with existing -- processing infrastructure. So, it's a -- we believe it is value accretive and is spot on strategy. And we should be in a position to give you greater details of this once the SPA's are signed and the regulatory approvals are obtained.</p>
          <p>On that note, let me hand you over to Alister for more detailed look at the result. Alister?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Asim. I'm going to take the next few minutes and just walk us through the financial results for the second quarter. And as you see, these clearly reflect the impact of the current economic conditions on the different parts of our business.</p>
          <p>From an overall perspective, we generated cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 806 million, which is comparable to same period last year. Our net earnings of 266 million were however lower than last year, as you've seen.</p>
          <p>There were four key factors, which influenced our financial performance, and I will give you some more color on each of these in a moment. There were lower product margins in the Downstream segment, lower production, higher realized commodity pricing and increased depletion expense in Southeast Asia.</p>
          <p>If you look at our U.S. Downstream business, the results reflect the continued weak economic demand, which had kept market prospects similar year-over-year. When you look at our realized refining margins there're impacted by product differences from arising as a result of our refinery configurations for Toledo and Lima. And the transportation costs <mark type="inaudible" /> to those refineries in Ohio. We have different accounting policies for the purchase of crude oil compared to the very small pricing, and we have the translation impact of the stronger Canadian dollar.</p>
          <p>Looking at our Downstream business, you need to understand that our realized refining margins will always be different from the quoted benchmarks. And I'll give you a couple of reasons why. Benchmark crack space such as Chicago 3:2:1, a calculated, based on standard ratios of gasoline and distiller products. But our product slate produced at Lima and Toledo refineries contain roughly 10 to 15% of other products, which are typically sold at much lower market prices, compared to gasoline and distillants.</p>
          <p>We've realized refining margins that also affected by the accounting -- the different accounting treatment for the purchase of crude oil. We have a time lag between the time we purchase and deliver the crude oil to the refinery, and we account for our purchases on a first in first out basis. And that's in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Canada.</p>
          <p>Benchmark pricing that you see in the markets, however, is calculated on a last in first out basis, which just actually reflects market pricing. Overall, the net result is at the financial performance of our Downstream business will typically be better in times of rising crude oil. The absolute price of crude oil is not as important as the trend of pricing when trying to assess performance.</p>
          <p>If you look at the second quarter of 2010, crude oil prices are relatively stable. Therefore the impact of FIFO, LIFO accounting was minimal. However, in the same period of 2009 crude oil prices rose significantly. They were up 44% from the end of March '09 to the end of June '09. As a result, our realized refinery margin in 2009 reflected that increase due to the specific time lag of between the purchase and delivery of crude oil to the refinery. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar year-over-year which is up 13% against the U.S. dollar compared to 2009 also reduced the results this quarter of our Downstream business when we translated them back into Canadian dollars.</p>
          <p>As Asim highlighted, overall production was down in the quarter and is a clear focus for the near term. Our Liquids production in the second quarter was lower compared to last year due to peak production rate decline from the White Rose field and lower AVR production resulting from the lower capital expenditures in 2008 &#x2013; 2009, sorry.</p>
          <p>On the East Coast, our production will stabilize with North Amethyst satellite which commenced production at the end of May this year. Our average natural gas production was similar to levels in the second quarter of 2009, but was impacted by some scheduled plant underwrite activity in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Based on commodity prices denominated in U.S. dollars, we're up significantly from the same quarter in 2009, as you know, but the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar did reduce the impact of these higher prices when we translated them back. That resulted in a 15% increase in Canadian dollar pricing for commodity prices, and that is 31% increase in the U.S. dollar pricing. So you could see the significant impact there on our results.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Southeast Asia, we did have higher depletion expense during the 2010 on the quarter, and that's as a result of our increased activities. We continue to execute on our exploration plan as we build our material oil and gas business in the region, which is a strategic objective.</p>
          <p>Operationally, we enhanced the successful testing of the first appraisal well of the Liuhua 29-1 discovery on Block 29/26 with encouraging results. And we also made another natural gas discovery at the Liuhua 34-4-1 exploration well,0 and that's the fourth discovery on Block 29/26. As Asim has said, we're firmly committed to the development of the Liwan Gas discovery, and we do expect to sanction that project later this year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the balance sheet, we remain in a strong financial position. Our total debt at June 30, net of cash, and cash equivalent was $3.9 billion. Our debt to cash flow and debt to capital employed ratios at the same date were 1.4 times and 21.6% respectively on a trailing 12 month basis. And both of these ratios remained well within our target ranges, and they did provide Husky with a flexibility to take advantage of value adding opportunities as they arrive. As we announced earlier this morning Husky's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to turn you over to Rob and he is going to give you some more details on upstream operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Alister. I want to start out with some remarks on safety and operational integrity. As I always do, when I am talking to my operations team. A good measure of occupational safety is our total recordable incident rate. Performance for the first half of the year was 1.15 and just to put that in context since we often think of these as metrics as opposed to what they actually mean under underlying -- that means that in 200,000 man hours we would expect a medical aid or lost time injury to one of our workers. I thought about another way, it means that &#x2013; if an average worker worked 100 years they would expect to have one medical aid or one lost time injury. And this is &#x2013; in this case in the last quarter that would be 1.15 in our case. And that's comparable to our performance in 2009.</p>
          <p>Husky's 2010 target is to be less than one and we are continuing to drive towards that goal. We've also been making good progress in implementing the Husky Operational Integrity Management System known as HOIMS, but we first adopted in 2007. HOIMS is a comprehensive system that integrates elements of process safety, occupational safety and environmental stewardship all under one umbrella. This is a way forward that will provide for the safety of our employees, our contractors, our neighbors and our assets.</p>
          <p>I now want to talk about production. We've completed a comprehensive review of operational activities in the first half of the year and an assessment of activities in the second half of the year. As a result we are adjusting our 2010 production guidance to 285 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and we expect to exit the year at around 300,000 barrels per day. The main reason for this adjustment was the delay in the North Amethyst startup, and that's had an impact of about 10,000 barrels per day versus our original forecast and that was combined with modestly lower production from our heavy oil operations compared to our original forecast.</p>
          <p>Compared to 2009 as Alister previously mentioned, production for the quarter was impacted by lower rates from the main White Rose field, which is part of its natural decline and heavy oil production as a result of the reduced capital expenditures, as I previously mentioned.</p>
          <p>Planned maintenance turnarounds, looking forward for the remainder of the year planned maintenance turnarounds in the remainder of the year that will impact upstream production include a 24-day shutdown -- planned shutdown at Terra Nova which is currently in progress and a 16-day shutdown at White Rose, which is planned for October.</p>
          <p>North Amethyst production, which is currently around to 20,000 barrels per day, will ramp up as additional wells are drilled and brought on stream. Production should reach a gross peak rate of around 37,000 barrels per day in 2011, 25,000 barrels a day about is net to Husky.</p>
          <p>Turning to upstream growth projects, as Asim said earlier, our key goal is to deliver near-term production growth. And I would like to update you on some of the steps we are taking to accelerate production growth, while continuing to build a foundation for the long-term.</p>
          <p>First starting in Western Canada, where the future is -- the future for Husky in Western Canada is really going to be about developing number of gas resource plays and number of oil resource plays and applying new technology, new enhanced oil recovery technology to our extensive portfolio of fields -- matured fields.</p>
          <p>So just going into some of the specifics about, at Ansell, two wells were drilled in the quarter to test multi target zones. In the second half of the year, we plan to drill an additional 50 gas wells at Ansell where the economics are supported by high liquids yields compared -- that come along with the gas production. Husky continues to build a position in a number of gas resource plays and now holds more than 952,000 net acres in established assets in the Alberta foothills and in northeast British Columbia.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, Husky acquired additional land in Bivouac, located in British Columbia, as well as deepened our holdings in the Ansell area. Well resource play evaluation and testing activity continued in the quarter. Six Viking wells were placed on production in the Dodsland Elrose area in Southwest Saskatchewan to bring the total number of producing wells in the play to 11.</p>
          <p>An additional 15 wells are planned for Redwater in the remainder of the year. Evaluation wells are currently in progress to assess the Cardium at Lanaway, the lower Shaunavon in Southwest Saskatchewan and the Bakken in Southeast Saskatchewan.</p>
          <p>Moving over to the heavy oil segment we are increasing our drilling activity. In 2010 we planned to drill around 290 CHOPS wells and 84 horizontal wells compared to around 175 CHOPS and 27 horizontal wells we drilled in 2009. So we will see that's a significant increase in activity in this critical area.</p>
          <p>The horizontal wells are interesting because this is new -- a new technique we are using to access thinner reservoirs in the Lloydminster area, which opens up the potential for increased recovery. At McMullen, an additional 32 wells are planned for the second half of the year to further exploit the heavy oil production potential of this lease. And looking at McMullen, we see potential in thermal development at lease and we are doing some work on scoping that development now, but we've also found good opportunity in just coal production on the lease, coal production of heavy oil, which recourses something we are very experienced at based on our Lloydminster operations.</p>
          <p>We are currently also constructing an 8,000 barrel per day thermal project at South Pikes Peak, which follows on our very successful Bolney Celtic and Pikes Peak projects that are currently on production. The project is approximately 30% complete at the end of the second quarter, and we're expecting to start that project up in 2012. And this is really the first stage of a successive number of these additional thermal project aimed at doubling our current heavy oil thermal production from its current level of around 20,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Turning to the East Coast, we've had a very busy quarter at the North Amethyst field. And well as I previously mentioned, we brought the field on about three months later then our original forecast due to the availability of drilling rigs in &#x2013; over the winter. We actually did get this project on stream 30 months after sanctioned and less than four years after discovery, which is a tremendous achievement by the team out there, and I personally very proud of what they've done.</p>
          <p>In the quarter Husky and its partners also extended the agreement for the Henry Goodrich offshore drilling rig and this will enable Husky to continue the development of the White Rose and adjacent oil field through January 2013. And, of course, one of those is the West White Rose pilot, which we're looking to get approval from very shortly. We're expecting that from the regulator, so that we can move ahead there.</p>
          <p>Now, finally moving to oil sands. Husky continues to progress the development of the Sunrise Energy Project as Asim mentioned earlier, and we are just about ready to &#x2013; we expect that tenders in by the end of this month and we expect to get the contractor selection done in over the third quarter and sanction the project before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>I also wanted to update you on some work we have underway at Tucker. As many of you know, Tucker's issues are largely related to the subsurface, and we conducted a detailed review of Tucker, which started at the beginning of 2009. And the objectives about study and what we managed to achieve with it was first to optimize the projects forward development.</p>
          <p>Second, we want to make sure we captured all the learning's from Tucker. And then because those learning's have a applicability both clearly to Sunrise we want to make sure any learning's that were applicable were applied to the design of Sunrise, but also to our other oil sands leases, because Husky has an extensive portfolio of other leases.</p>
          <p>And so what's what we did, and also critically we wanted to confirm that our projections for the Sunrise project remained robust going forward and we're confident of that. So we believe now that the forward plan for Tucker can achieve economics comparable to the original approval case. However, this is only possible because higher bitumen prices today will offset projected higher steam oil ratios and lower production because of the reservoir quality we see at Tucker.</p>
          <p>In the quarter at Tucker, we drilled three new well pairs and tied in and put on &#x2013; well, we actually, in the quarter at Tucker three new well pairs were tied in and put on steam and additional four well pairs were drilled. These wells incorporate a number of design changes and their performance were prove if our revised development plan is on track, and we should have confirmation of that by around the middle of 2011.</p>
          <p>Terrance, will now talk about the Midstream and &#x2013; our Midstream and Downstream activities, which of course are strongly linked to our heavy oil and oil sands business and growth plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. As Rob has emphasized, Husky does have a strong position in heavy oil. And while there is a specific market for that product the reason that we are in the Midstream business is to maximize its value and capture synergies, including transport as upgrading.</p>
          <p>With respect to the upgrader throughput for the second quarter averaged 73,500 barrels per day with operating cost of $6.60 per barrel, the upgrader is scheduled for its plan five-year turnaround to begin in September for approximately 53 days.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to make a few comments on our Downstream activities. This sector captures the full value from our heavy oil and bitumen production and minimizes income and cash flow of volatility. Despite the challenging refining economic conditions, throughput was up in the quarter for U.S. and Canadian refining at 253,000 barrels per day, compared with 230,000 barrels per day in 2009. And this year's performance reflects the improved operations at Lima following the very successful turnaround in 2009. Lima is going to complete the remaining portion of its five-year turnaround in November of this year, and at that time it's going to operate at reduced rates of approximately 100,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>To refresh your memory, in our retail area, our retail network extends from British Columbia through to the Quebec border, Husky continues to progress with our integration of newly acquired 98 retail stations in Southern Ontario, and they will continue to provide us with some future optionality for our Ohio refinery production. Rebranding is underway. We have completed 37 sites and the remaining locations will be brought into the network in the last six months of 2010.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question today comes from Andrew Potter of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, guys. Two quick questions. First, could you give us a little bit more detail on the land positions in the Bakken, Shaunavon, Viking and Cardium, or I guess, alternatively, maybe you can talk what kind of resource potential you see there? And second, maybe if you can just give a little bit more color on Liwan, in terms of kind of what you're currently thinking in terms of cost estimates and gas market and arrangements there? And I guess if you can't comment on that, when will we start to see that definition? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Andrew...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll take that one. On the oil resource plays, as I say, we have positions in the Pembina Cardium, in the Bakken, in a number of different areas. We also have positions in the Viking, which is an area we have some fairly &#x2013; for historic reasons as well some pretty good land positions. Husky has a large land position in Western Canada, and of course occasionally you get some good overlap with some new plays regardless.</p>
          <p>And so we've actually built ourselves a position where, in aggregate, we think we have something in the order of 500 &#x2013; over 500 &#x2013; let's call over 500,000 acres of perspective land in oil resource plays and we're still in the process &#x2013; I mean you can understand with the wells we're putting into these resource plays to actually understand the potential of each one of those plays. And I don't want to go into our own internal assessment at this stage of where we think that potential is.</p>
          <p>But we do think it's substantial, and certainly as we go forward, where we see it as a key component of our growth plan in Western Canada, and I think that the only other thing I'd say is that I think it's the result of new technology we've seen being introduced into the basin, both in terms of gas resource plays and oil resource plays and EOR. We now feel that the Western Canada basin, excluding heavy oil and oil sands, has the potential for growth over the next five years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, Asim. We want &#x2013; from the gas marketing perspective, the gas will go into the Hong Kong and Guangdong area in China, and we're certainly in the process of discussions with some key long-term buyers in that area. And I would expect that we should be able to have something to report on that by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, clearly the engineering receipt is done. We are looking at estimates and &#x2013; based on various contractors, but we'd expect to be able to give you more color on that when we sanction that project later this year and we get ODP approval, which we would expect to file in the next couple of months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And maybe another way of approaching the question on Liwan is based on kind of the early indications you're seeing on the cost side, maybe what oil or what oil and gas price would you need to see to make this a viable project? I'm trying to get a sense in terms of how robust the economics are on this project.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would point you to, Andrew, is if you look at what our sort of LNG prices that are going to go into, that are currently going into that region in Asia, and you should expect that will be probably something similar to that level, that makes it a very robust project.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. Just curious on the natural gas acquisition. If you could give us what the effective date of that acquisition would be and if those -- the 10,000 BOE a day is included in your current guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the 10,000 BOE is a run rate. The key issue really for us is regulatory clearances, which you know, we don't control the timing of, but we would expect perhaps we time the NOI, so somewhere in the order of a quarter to get the -- all the clearances, of three to four months to get all the clearances, basically. Yes, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just wonder if you could update us on the ramp up progress on North Amethyst and when you see that getting up to design rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. Thanks, Asim. North Amethyst, we're currently producing in the range of about 20,000 barrels a day with the first production well. We're looking to bring the second production well on stream in late August if all the completion operations go to plan. Then we have to drill a second water injector. You can think of these as well pairs into the reservoir, and so when we bring the first production well on, it'll be at relatively low rates until that water injector comes on stream, and that water injector that coming on stream is linked to the turnaround we're doing in October at the facility. And then, we'll bring on further wells, or we'll be drilling and completing further injectors and producers as we move into next year. So I hope, does that give you a good feel for it?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions. Morning, Asim, what are the --maybe just go back to Liwan gas. What are the steps that you still need to take in order to sanction the project and then to move to commerciality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alister, you take that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'll do that, Asim, thanks. Greg, we need to finalize negotiations on the gas contracts with the major offtakers, and that's well in hand. We need to just finalize the commercial agreements with CNOOC on the shallow water facilities and the onshore facilities. The deep water facilities are all clearly laid out in the price and sharing contract. Once we finalize that we will file for ODP approval, and we'd expect that in a few months, and then we'd move to sanctioning the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. And then, maybe just a question for Rob, I mean you look at where heavy oil differentials have been over the last couple of years, and we see your billable weight numbers well under 100,000 barrels a day now. Within the 300,000 barrel a day exit rate you were talking about, how much of that would be weight, or do you think you are back up above 100,000 by the end of this year, and what kind of running room do you see then in driving the business? I know you prefer to doubling the thermal which is I think 20,000 now. But just want to get a broader sense of how big that business will get.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay, thanks. I mean, first and foremost, I think, yes, if you think about the 300,000 barrels a day total heavy oil production for Husky is around a 100,000 barrels a day. Some of that comes from outside of the Lloyd complex, a small amount of it. Most of it's from within the Lloyd complex. If, I think the &#x2013; there is a number of new technologies coming along to increase recoveries in the heavy oil area currently. Again, just to take you back to the basics, Lloydminster has about a little over, Husky's land in Lloydminster, a little over 10 billion barrels of oil in place.</p>
          <p>And currently, the chops technology that we've traditionally used on these, it gives you about 700 million barrels of recoverable reserves of which around 7% of the total. Looking forward, we are looking at a number of new technologies. Thermal is clearly a technology we've used and have proven very well, but you can only use it in portions of the Lloydminster area. You can think of this as a large deposit of heavy oil, but it had channels running through it, which creates thicker sections of the reservoir, and that's where we can use our -- that's where we can use thermal techniques, and that's where we expect to be able to increase production from the current sort of 20,000 barrels a day up towards something approaching double that number going forward.</p>
          <p>But there are other technologies like our horizontal wells allowing us to access thinner reservoirs, and we actually have a number of others, including looking further out cold enhanced production, which we've talked about a few times before where we have a number of pilots that have shown very good technical results, and we continue to work them to turn that into ultimately commercial results going forward with further development.</p>
          <p>So all those things are giving us a lot of confidence about the very long-term future of the Lloydminster resource, and one of things I like to say is I mean there is a lot of interest and excitement about various resource plays out there at the moment. But I like to refer to Lloydminster as the original play out resource play. It's been producing very large volumes for a very, very long time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a 60 year-old reservoir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we believe it has very long legs going forward. Now how much growth we'll see coming out of that going forward, our media targets with all this technology ultimately are to continue to deliver that 100,000 barrels a day over an extended period of time. We do see the potential for increasing that, but that depends on a number of these technologies working out and how rapidly we apply them clearly because we are always fighting at declined curve.</p>
          <p>But the idea is, and again, in my mind I linked quite closely the heavy oil business and the oilsands business, there is the lot of commonality there and if we can hold Lloydminster at a 100,000 barrels a day, we may be able to do better than that, but if we can do that for a long period of time and then grow our oilsands portfolio as Asim mentioned earlier in his talk where we take that alone excluding heavy oil has the potential to double Husky's current production overtime, we think we've got a great business there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, thanks, Rob, just couple of last points, then around the CapEx, you are keeping days CapEx unchanged to 3.1 billion, so, are you just more or less just changing the lineup here for the balance of the year? And then, to go back may be to Mark's question, it looks as though like hitting your gas volumes for the year you need to more or less hold the volumes flat to a slight incline during the balance of the year, so is the 60 million a day acquisition in the numbers, in the guidance numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the capital side, yeah, we have maintained our capital gains at this point. We are currently going through an extensive revaluation project on -- process on various options to accelerate the capital. Once we have been through that in the next three weeks, we have never clear picture of just exactly where we are going to shift during our portfolio, some of it would be project we won't do, some of it will be additional projects. So I think in a couple of months, we will be able to give you a much clearer picture on how much extra, if any, there'll be on our capital side.</p>
          <p>And on the gas production...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, just on the guidance may be kind of back, I think we had the question few times a little bit about, is that extra production volume in the guidance and on a run rate basis since we can only sort of book production after that acquisition closes. We are talking a little bit of, you know, somewhere between depending on when you get closure sometime between 2 and 3,000 barrels a day or something that would act in terms of an average addition to this year. So, I just say within the range of guidance, we quoted I think -- it's not material and it's within that range at some point.</p>
          <p>In terms of gas production, we certainly expect to kind of hold gas flat. Well, I think if you look over the year, I mean, we will finish off the year a little bit above 500 million in -- very close to our original guidance for the year. I think gas production has been holding up pretty well relative to our original forecast and the work we are doing in the second half of this year should actually, if anything, slightly increase gas production over the second half of the year. And, of course, as we previously mentioned too, this quarter was heavily impacted as it is most year by turnarounds of our gas plants and pipelines, some of the pipelines that are servicing our gas plants, the second quarter being the biggest quarter for turnaround every year.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning gentlemen. Probably a question for Terrance. I was just wondering if you can -- if you guys have the numbers on what the FX rates impact was on your U.S. downstream results for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will take that one. It's -- I want to talk to because the numbers are the underlying businesses. Therefore, the Canadian dollar, the average Canadian dollars strengthened by 13% year-over-year in the quarter. If you look at the results that we have, it is approximately 10, $15 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, I guess I should have been more clear, Alister. Just with respect to your inventory costs and the FIFO or not FIFO, but with respect to your inventory--?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said in the -- in my comments, I mean, we are a FIFO company. We don't have -- we don't account for it on a LIFO basis. We do have kind of make some educated estimates on it. We could never audit any number on those. But the price in the quarter was relatively flat. Therefore, the impact of LIFO in this quarter is quite small. If you look at last year, you saw prices go from $48 to 65, $69 by the end of June. So there was a big impact on last year's numbers, and it's relatively straightforward to be able to calculate that.</p>

          <p>Yeah. We continue -- I would actually &#x2013; I wouldn't call ASP piloting. We're on our fourth project, and we get good results from those projects. Husky is the leader in the application of ASP technology in certainly in North America, if not the world. And we're seeing good results, good economics, and we have a significant number of projects we intend to apply that for that technology too going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi. My question is within regards to the dividend. When you guys cut the dividend from $0.50 to $0.30 they said it was a goal of the company to bring you back to $0.50. Can you just elaborate a bit on that within &#x2013; what the goal is now with increased production and everything? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time, the dividend is what it is and there are no immediate plans to increase or decrease the dividend because, as we've indicated, I mean, the thrust &#x2013; the continuing thrust is that we are in an investment mode, and that's where it will be. So the dividend policy, of course, reviewed from time-to-time, and we've just done a review and stayed where we are.</p>

          <p>Thanks. This question is for Asim, just in terms of the &#x2013; you talked about your potential M&amp;A transactions, the way you're looking at M&amp;A transactions. Just wondering if you can provide a bit more color in terms of scale or the things you look for production growth. You've talked about production growth in the near term being a key focus. Would that be the driver for your &#x2013; for any potential acquisitions here? Or would it be a running room or would it be a combination of both? Would it be long life assets? What would you be looking for exactly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good question, and it is worth putting some clarity on that. The prime focus of acquisitions at this point would be currently flowing barrels within the context of strategic contiguity. And I have defined strategic contiguity which basically stopped us contiguous to where we are geographically or stopped us contiguous within our core skills.</p>
          <p>If as a corollary, we get additional long life assets that is gravy, but this company has got so many long life assets already in its portfolio that is not the focus for the additional effort we are putting in now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Secondly, we are agnostic to oil or gas. It is really a matter of evaluation and thirdly we would like to stay within conventional technology. Again, if there are some additional possibilities coming with the asset in terms of the application of unconventional for the longer life, that is crazy but that is not the focus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot. What about the scale, are you able to talk about that at all in terms of...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, when you announced that you are in the acquisition mode there's already a danger of prices going up and if I start to mention scale the prices didn't go up further, so I think at this point in time I would like to keep our cards closer to our chest, but clearly we are interested in making a material impact on our production in the near term and in the near term I am going to defining in the next 12 months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. Thank you. I would like to thank you for your questions. Thank you for joining us on this, my first call. I just will end on a sort of a very simple recap if I may of what I told you earlier.</p>
          <p>Basically I feel very good about the very solid results for this based on this company has, we do have a unique portfolio. We do have a strong balance sheet. Our Western Canada and heavy oil asset base do provide a very strong foundation for us to work forward. Both in terms of production moving probably sort of cash flow and short term, continued production built from there combined with the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Mid to long-term, we are extremely well positioned on Oil Sands and we have already taken active steps to commercialize those opportunities. We continue to have transformational opportunities on the East Coast and we can either build a material oil and gas business in South East Asia.</p>
          <p>And, again, I do want to say this because, actually we've made a fetish of saying this in all of our internal operational meetings in the company, but its stop &#x2013; it gets reputation in the context of our more public conference call is that whatever we do will be governed within the focal list of safe work practices. So thank you for your questions. Thank you for joining us. Much appreciate. Bye-bye.</p>
