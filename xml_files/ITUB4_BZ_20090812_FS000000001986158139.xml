        <plist>
          <p>Good morning for all in the U.S. Good afternoon for those who are in Europe. As for who are calling through the Internet, we're starting with slide number two, highlights of this second quarter results. The first one is earnings. Recurrent earnings of R$2.429 billion with a decrease of 5.2% when we compared to the first quarter of this year. And this means ROE of 21.1% annualized.</p>
          <p>The second highlight is related to extraordinary items. We have a positive extraordinary gain this quarter of R$142 million mainly related to the sale of shares of Visa International and VisaNet here in Brazil that provide these net positive results.</p>
          <p>The third one is related to the additional provision. You remember that at the end of 2008, we made a huge additional provisions for credit loan, for credit losses to &#x2013; because we expected at that time an increase in the deterioration of the credit portfolio. As we did in the first quarter of this year, we used part of the additional provision that we made. And this quarter, we used R$775 million of this additional provision to complement the normal provision that we made in the quarter.</p>
          <p>At the end of the second quarter, the additional provision balance was almost R$6.500 billion, what give us a very good comfort to face the losses of credit for the coming quarters if necessary.</p>
          <p>The fourth highlight is related to NPL and past due of 90 days. NPL ratio have finished in 6.7 when we are talking about 60 days and when we are talking about 90 days, the ratio reaches 5.4%.</p>
          <p>We said in the previous conference calls related to the end of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, that these numbers would increase and that what happened in the second quarter and the first quarter of this year. So &#x2013; and that's the reason we made the additional provision at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our expectation is the deterioration of our credit portfolio, we'll achieve the peak in this quarter, the third quarter, as we expect the economy to start to get better shape and also because we have been more restricted in terms of credit in the last quarter. So we expected, as I said, to achieve around 7% above NPL by the end of the third quarter and probably these will be the peak in terms of deterioration. This is &#x2013; highlight is related to our BIS ratio that finished at 16.5 in the same level of the first quarter of this year and Tier I, which is 13.2%.</p>
          <p>Going to the slide number three, we can see here that the total assets decreased 4.5%, part of this is related to loans that also decreased 2.5% achieving R$265 billion. These also related to the valuation of the real against the dollar and because of less demand for credits related to large companies. The stockholders' equities finished R$47.2 billion with an increase of 5% when we compare to the first quarter this year.</p>
          <p>On page four, we can see the difference between the recurring result and the result that we published. The difference is related to non-recurring effects of total of R$142 million. As I said the main reason was the &#x2013; because we sold shares of Visa and VisaNet that gave us a gain of R$212 million and also because we made provisions for claims from our clients related to the saving accounts, related to the economic plans that we had in the past, that had some discussion about that and we made R$54 million in provisions for individual claims.</p>
          <p>So that explains, with also a small goodwill amortization is still related to the increase of participation that we have, that we did in the first quarter in Redecard, when Ita&#xFA; Unibanco achieved the majority of the voting shares of the company.</p>
          <p>On page five, we can see more details about our results. I think it is important to see that the net &#x2013; the managerial margin remained stable when we compared the first quarter to the second quarter. The margin with clients also remained stable, R$9.3 billion and also the financial margin with the markets also with an increase of 1.2%, R$1.2 billion in this period.</p>
          <p>Banking fees was a good level of revenues, an increase of 2.6% in the quarter, achieving R$3.6 billion. Result for our insurance companies, a decrease of 5.3%, achieving R$1.3 billion at the end. So the managerial financial margin and including the banking fees and services, R$15.7 billion, almost stable when we compare to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The bad news came as expected from the loan losses when we achieved R$4.5 billion with an increase of 15% when we compare to the first quarter of 2009. And also we, as I said, had to use part of our additional provisions for credit in the level of R$775 million when we compare with 539, when we use in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So, as I said, we continue to see a deterioration in our credit portfolio, both because of delinquency and also because we continue to make changes in ratings, especially for large companies and when we change the rate for worse, of course we need more provisions.</p>
          <p>The recurrent net income, so &#x2013; before that, non-interest expenses also stable when we compare to first quarter in R$6.4 billion. So, recurrent results R$2.4 billion, non-recurrent effects as I mentioned R$142 million, and net income of R$2.5 billion, we said are increased when we compare to the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Going to slide number six, we can see more details about the loan portfolio by customer. The total of the portfolio is R$266 billion with a decrease of 2.5% in the quarter and we continue to focus more in individuals. We can see that individuals' portfolio increased 2.2%. We continue to focus on vehicles, continue to be a very important part of our portfolio, more than 50% of our individual portfolio is related to car finance.</p>
          <p>When we look in terms of business, in terms of companies, we see a decrease of 4.5%. We go in more details looking in the line of corporate. We see 9.5% in &#x2013; decrease in the credit portfolio related both because of valuation of the real in the loans, dollar related, and also because less demand for credits for companies in this segment in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to increase our portfolio when we talk about this small and medium size and micro companies. We increased this portfolio 5.3% in the quarter, achieving R$54 billion. Mortgage continue to increase. At the end of the quarter, the total in terms of mortgage, R$7.1 billion with increase of 7.2 is small, but it's growing.</p>
          <p>As we can see in the next page, on slide number seven, we can see real estate credit continue to increase in the pace less than when we compare to last year. But we continue to see demand both from individuals with the increase in the quarter of R$500 million and also from the developers that we give credit of R$700 million in this quarter. It is the segment that we'll continue to grow in the coming quarters and the coming years.</p>
          <p>On slide number eight, you can see the NPL ratio related to 60 days. We can see that individuals continue to increase delinquency achieving 10% in the quarter. Companies increased 3.9 also related to the change of rating and the average of the total portfolio, 6.7.</p>
          <p>When we see the NPL ratio related to over 90 days, we see better numbers. The total is 5.4: individuals 8.1, and companies 3.1. We continue to have a very good cover ratio as mainly because of the provisions that we made at the end of the 2008 to face the delinquency this year.</p>
          <p>On page nine, we can see more details about our provision for loan losses. We can see that in the second quarter, we achieved R$5 billion in terms of provisions, including in this number, R$775 million that we used from the provisions already made in 2008.</p>
          <p>In terms of funding and managed resources, we finished the total client money with us both in terms of deposits and funds and reserve, technical reserves, R$638 billion, with an increase in the quarter of 3.6% was a very good number and showed our capacity to have deposits and money from our clients.</p>
          <p>On page 11, we can see that we reduced the level of cash of the bank, because of the lower level of demand for credits and also because a little bit better environment in the economy. And that's the reasons, because a credit now represents 85% in the end of March.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, we see more details about the growth in the quarter when we talk about banking fees and banking charge, an increase of 2.6%. And we believe this &#x2013; we have continued to increase as the economy gets better and companies and individuals use more the bank than in the last quarters.</p>
          <p>Good news also on slide number 15. And when we talk about non-interest expenses, we see the level of the second quarter is stable when we compare to the first quarter of this year. And of course, have a lot of synergies to come in the coming quarters, when &#x2013; as long we increase the merge with Ita&#xFA; and Unibanco.</p>
          <p>On page 14, we see the efficiency ratio 44.8% in the quarter, a little better when we compare to 45.1 and in 12 months, 47.4. We continue to believe that we go in the direction in the coming quarters of a much better level around 42%, 40% in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Segmentation, on the slide 15. The four big segments that we analyze and we release for the market, Commercial Bank, Ita&#xFA; BBA, Consumer Credit, and Corporation + Treasury.</p>
          <p>When we go to slide 16, we see these managerial numbers, pro forma numbers. We split the recurrent net income of R$2.4 billion in these four segments. And we can see that Commercial Bank has a recurrent net income of R$916 million. We allocate capital related to the total assets of R$452 million of R$19.1 billion as remembering that our stockholders' equity is 47 billion. So almost 40% &#x2013; more than 40% is allocated to the Commercial Bank. And this give us a RAROC return of 19.3% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The same analysis to Ita&#xFA; BBA, R$443 million in net income, allocated capital, 10.6 billion and RAROC of 15.2 related to the total assets of R$175 billion.</p>
          <p>Consumer credit R$545 million in terms of net recurrent income. <mark type="audio gap" /></p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry for the technical problem. We are back here with the &#x2013; onto slide 16 that I thought was &#x2013; where I was when the problem happened. So, the RAROC for these four segments, we see RAROC for the Commercial Bank, 19.3, Ita&#xFA; BBA, 15.7, Consumer Credit, 28.9 and Corporation, 25.2, also &#x2013; always remembering that this is pro forma, is managerial numbers, so for the four segments that we traditionally released to the market.</p>
          <p>On page 17, we have the same numbers, the same view. We can see this &#x2013; how these segments were splitted including also insurance in this pizza graphic.</p>
          <p>To finalize for those who are in Brazil, or we will be in Brazil next week, we have our traditional meeting with the investors and shareholders here in S&#xE3;o Paulo, Wednesday 19 at 2 P.M. This will be broadcasted through our website for those who want to or can't &#x2013; are able to follow our presentation in Portuguese, this presentation will be made in Portuguese and it will be released through the internet for those who want to follow the presentation that we are going to make for investors and shareholders here in S&#xE3;o Paulo.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And now we are open for the Q&amp;A part of this conference call.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have two questions. The first one is, can you give us some color on the deterioration in asset quality as &#x2013; you mentioned there are two things at play here. One is a normal deterioration of the book due to the economic environment and the second is the change in the risk or risk assessment that you're doing to &#x2013; part of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So on the portion that is the actual deterioration, what is driving &#x2013; is there a specific segment, maybe auto loans or used car loans or SMEs or personal loans? I mean any color that you could provide us to understand what's driving these and especially why you think it's going to already peak this quarter?</p>
          <p>And then for the second portion, the one that is due to the changing ratings, are you done with it? I mean, is there more to come in the next quarter or basically that was it? So that's my first question, and I'll wait for you to answer and I'll ask you the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In relation to the vehicle loans and to the SME, the problem happened across the board. So we don't have a specific segment that appears in this deterioration. This is according to what we announced before, when we made the last conference, we mentioned that probably we would have a deterioration in the credit quality. That's the reason because we made the provisions in the end of last year and the &#x2013; our vision and our models show us that the NPL will increase, probably we will have to make more provision. And this happened, and we have seen a continuation of this situation until September.</p>
          <p>But let me give you more details. First, this deterioration happened with the older loans, before &#x2013; the loans that were granted before the crisis. When the crisis started last September, we became much more selective and we became more cautious. And then when you look at these delinquencies, it's very clear for us that it's much better than the situation that you had before. That's the main thing that is including this scenario.</p>
          <p>I will transfer to Mr. Alberto Fernandes to talk about the corporate loans to give you more details .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge, in the corporate side, what we are seeing now is, the first semester was the worst for us. We made a lot of downgrades because of the huge debt of the company brought to 2009 from 2008.</p>
          <p>We were not expecting, although it's very difficult to forecast what is going to happen with this sector specifically in the second semester of this year. But we are not expecting a huge losses or a huge downgrade in the third and the 4Q of 2009. I think it will be better quarter for us. The companies are improving. The economy are improving. Although we are &#x2013; if we are right in our forecast for the economy, for the cash flow of companies for the next semester, we will expecting a better shape for companies in these times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you. And the second question is related to the financial margin with market. Second quarter was 1.2 billion, same thing as the first quarter 1.2 billion. The run rate in the previous quarter was around R$500 million, and I'm assuming that that increase had to do with the reduction in interest rate. So should we expect this number in the second half, now that rates are basically flat, go back to around 500 million? Is that the right expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me tell you our expectation with relation to the second half of the year that the &#x2013; probably the performance of the share &#x2013; the treasury <mark type="inaudible" /> the same.</p>
          <p>Remember that in this figure, we have the impact of the &#x2013; decrease in the interest rates that happened very fast and the second point is related to the recent appreciation of the real. We are not seeing this scenario for the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, but I just &#x2013; I agree. I just wanted to sort of get probably some quantification on it. If I just look at the financial margin with market, for example, in the first half of 2008, it was exactly half of what you delivered in the first half of 2009. So I just want to understand if the run rate, which I've calculated for your business to be around 500 million per quarter, is that the right expectation for the second half of the year versus kind of like the 1.2 billion per quarter you did in the first half? Are those more or less the right numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I understand, but what I can tell you that to our expectation that will come down. How much is very difficult to forecast. Treasury &#x2013; it's treasury. It's very difficult to have an idea I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez with J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everybody. Couple questions, also on asset quality. Your reserve coverage of 60 day and more past due loans as you highlight I think on page eight of the presentation, has fallen pretty dramatically over the last, not surprisingly, over the last two quarters to about 146%. It's pretty close to what it has been historically prior to your big additional reserve increase in the fourth quarter. How comfort &#x2013; at what level would you stop feeling comfortable allowing that reserve coverage fall to? Would you allow it to fall to under 130% or 135%, because that may limit your ability to release reserve results &#x2013; reserve &#x2013; excess reserves into earnings?</p>
          <p>The second question also on asset quality, are you seeing any improvement, for example, in early stage delinquencies? Obliviously, your 60 and 90-day past due loans have been going up, but as we've seen in the Central Bank data, 50 to 90-day past due loans have actually been declining for the system as a whole, even as 90 or more days past due loans have been increasing. Are you seeing any improvements that make you optimistic in say earlier stage delinquency rates, say 15 to 60 days or 15 to 90 days that might make you feel more comfortable about the future evolution of your asset quality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Saul, let me give some figures. And if you look at the ratios in the slide eight, then if you look the NPL over 90 days, you will see that with &#x2013; in the part of the individuals, it's possible to see a stabilization of this; it's increased, but not very fast, as the past. And this indicate us that we have improvement in the credit quality compared with the recent loans that were granted before the crisis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look the new delinquencies that you didn't release yet, this show us that after the crisis, when we became much more selective, the credit quality is much better. And this give us confidence to us that to forecast that this probably the third quarter will be the peak when you look these ratios. The coverage ratio that we have now about 146, well, I suppose that can come down to 140 or even a little bit lower than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But what &#x2013; I mean, but the problem isn't with the retail loans right now. The problem is that you've seen huge deterioration in your corporate loan book and especially in the SME loan book. Are you seeing similar types of improvements in vintages, where even though I suspect are the real short-duration loans, but are you seeing signs of encouragement there in terms of say earlier stage delinquencies or new past due loans that are starting to emerge? Because that's really the question more than the retail side is what you are seeing in the corporate loan book and especially in the SME loan book. Why are you more optimistic there? What are you seeing that makes you more optimistic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me tell you &#x2013; remember what the answer that Mr. Alberto Fernandes made in the last question is, he mentioned that when you look at the corporate loans, we analyzed each one of the customers. It's not related with the vintages. It's much more related with the segment and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; the company that operates. In this part of the portfolio, we see very good sign of that the situation, it will be much better in the second half of the year. When you look SME, it's more risk, no doubt, but it's similar to the individuals. And we are so ex &#x2013; sorry, we are expecting that the GDP will grow much more in the second half of the year. It means that the current year will be much more active. It gave us some signals that the situation is much better.</p>
          <p>I think it happened in all the Brazilian bank system. It's with the economy. It's not exactly this situation really &#x2013; we don't have a different portfolio profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one final really quick question on loan recoveries. As we head later into the year in 2010, given the asset quality issues, and the fact that a lot of your loans are collateralized, should we see a nice pickup in loan recoveries in &#x2013; later this year, into 2010 that can help bolster your &#x2013; help your net interest income going forward?</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. And if I understood Alfredo correctly when he was discussing page 14 of the presentation about efficiency ratio, he said that this ratio, which is currently about 45%, it's been 45% in the last couple of quarters, could reach the low 40s, 40 to 42% I think he said in coming quarters. I assume if those numbers I understood correctly that that's where the main effect of the cost synergies from the merger will start to impact.</p>
          <p>So if you could elaborate further on how the merger is progressing, what are the cost savings that have been identified, and in what area, and if you could be a bit more specific of by when we could see the efficiency ratio down to the low 40s? Are we talking about already later this year, are we talking about next year? If you could be a bit more precise on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are talking much more about the 2010. Remember that this year we are just started &#x2013; we started the beginning of the integration of the branches. It will take time and this will be more present next year. And one other point, that's in next September we'll have a new agreement with the union. This negotiation probably we will increase our personnel cost about &#x2013; related with the inflation probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you are saying that by 2010, we will see the efficiency ratio down somewhere in the 40 to 42% range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anything else that you want to comment on the progression of the merger? You're saying that the branch network will start to be integrated later this year. Any additional new development you want to comment on the progression of the integration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me give you more details about the integration. We just finished the integration among the operations with Ita&#xFA; BBA. There we've had before three treasuries, now we have one. The areas of the corporate investment bank &#x2013; the Unibanco and Ita&#xFA; is totally integrated.</p>
          <p>In terms of the retail, we will start a pilot test in this month, probably next week, with four branches, and we will study these integrations very, very deeply, while deploying all the different branches just to give an idea about the situation, and &#x2013; but the acceleration of the process of integration will happen next year.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Silvio. Quickly a follow up question on a different topic. I noted in your loan to portfolio base, on page six of the presentation, a big contraction in the loan book outside of Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, down about 14%. Was that something that you planned that you wanted to see a contraction into exposure outside of Brazil? And if that's the case, why, what is going on in your operations outside of Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, problem. Just an accounting effect, but related with the currency, because the real appreciate a lot during this &#x2013; the second quarter. And when you convert this currency to the real, it appear decreased the portfolio. But it's not &#x2013; it's happening with the big corporate loans as well. We have R$46 billion in loans to big corporates that are indexed in dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't impact the fact &#x2013; there's no problems abroad that has forced you to try to contract the portfolio?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a follow-up on this synergy efficiency ratio. The 2010 42% efficiency ratio is for the full year or on the end of the quarter, on a quarterly basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Will happen more in the end of 2010 this level that is possible to achieve. It will happen quarterly by quarterly. We have now 45, but probably will not decrease this level this year, but next year, probably will start to decrease.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's a quarterly number, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one more question on savings. A lot has been said about interest rates coming down, you could have a jump in your savings account, and that's a question for the sector. And actually, you had an increase this quarter, but also you had an increase on &#x2013; in assets under management, right? So which was more than the savings account. Where this is coming from? Is that the time deposit that &#x2013; the money from time deposit migration to these two accounts? And what &#x2013; in your view, what will be the good solution for this issue in the mid-term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing in the market movement that most of the banks reduced substantially the price they were paying for CDs and time deposits and so on. So, many clients, now are moving as the investment they made last year when interest rates were very high, they're moving now &#x2013; they're not renewing the deposits, the time deposits, and they are moving more to funds, especially in our case, we reduced a lot the price for time deposits.</p>
          <p>So in our case, this movement is more, you can say, better. But it is in general, in the industry is happening. And also &#x2013; you have seen also some movements to saving deposits. In June, July, the figures released by the Central Bank shows that more deposits and higher pace relates to saving accounts also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the future solution would be taxation in your views on both personal and savings accounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this tax problem gives some distortions in the economy of course, not only in the savings, but also in other financial instruments related to real estate that also has the same benefit. It is a problem &#x2013; potential problem that the government and Central Bank and the finance minister will have to address probably next year or 2011 to avoid a big distortion in terms of deposits for savings. Because you remember that the 65% of the savings deposit must go to real estate, to mortgage. And if the savings deposit increase very fast, it will be impossible to serve this Central Bank regulation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the assets under management, what funds did you saw an increase &#x2013; a large increase, is that fixed income or equity funds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two more related to fixed income, but we see also a lot of money, I think, if I'm not wrong, the figures of July for hedge funds were more than R$14 billion, at hedge fund also invest in equities. So indirectly money is going to the stock market through hedge funds. But in terms of equity, pure equity funds, we are seeing a lot of deposits, but a lot of withdraw, especially from people that are recovering from the losses during the worst months of the crisis. So probably we are going to see is our expectations more net positive inflows in equity funds in the second semester.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I have two questions. Just quickly, as a follow-up on the cost savings. I know the Bank has not quantified publicly how much you expect to achieve in cost savings, but just to give us an idea, what percentage of the cost savings do you expect to be achieved by 2010, and what percentage by 2011? So should we &#x2013; the budget of 2011, already the full benefits of the entire cost savings being achieved or will the bulk of that be achieved in 2010?</p>
          <p>Second question is with regards to your net interest margin. Excluding trading gains or treasury gains, your margins have been quite resilient despite a lower interest rate environment. I wanted to get an idea of how do you see your margins, excluding treasury, behaving in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of cost savings, what I can tell you, Mario, that the plan that we talked about before, that our normal turnover of personnel is 10,000 people. If you look the figures that we released yesterday, you'll see that we are in this direction. And this &#x2013; it's according the plan that we announced. Recent here in Brazil, we made a special program to the people that is related with the people that is closer to the return. This plan, we are forecast &#x2013; some synergy that will happen is implemented already and it's happening this second. But if you &#x2013; it's more impact in the saving cost.</p>
          <p>For 2010, we are forecast that in the end of 2010, 80% of the synergy cost will be implemented. The 100% will happen in 2011. In terms of net interest margin, before treasury, before market, just related with the customers, we are forecast that in 2010, this figure will probably increase to this &#x2013; this is the normal track of the Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify then, when you say &#x2013; are you talking about net interest income growing double-digits or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net interest income before treasury.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But that's with your expectations of loan growth. I think you said before 20 to 25%. So does that mean -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2010, yes. The total of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So what I was trying to understand is, does your net interest income grow below the 20 to 25% or does it grow in line of that 20 to 25%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably go lower than to 20%, because of the lower interest rates and lower &#x2013; probably lower spread.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. Since my questions on asset quality and costs were already asked, I'll take this opportunity to ask how Ita&#xFA; sees the progress in establishing a positive credit bureau in Brazil? When we could see that if in fact be implemented and how that might impact Ita&#xFA; Unibanco?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the regulatory front, we continue to see more stories about, let's say, pressure potential pressure on banking fees or spreads. If you could give us an update if you see any regulatory changes that would impact your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is S&#xE9;rgio Werlang. Well, so, so your first question was on the positive credit bureau, okay. The positive credit bureau &#x2013; the law that is now in the Congress is a law, which is not good for the credit bureaus. So unless there is a change in the law or there is another project of law, the approval of this project is actually not very good in terms of increasing credit distinction between good and bad clients. So what we expect in fact is that there is going to be some change in the project of law, which is in the Congress and that will have a very positive impact both on spreads and on the increase in terms of credits over GDP according to our estimates.</p>
          <p>According to our estimates, the Brazilian credit bureaus are very good, but there are still better benchmarks internationally. And it would be possible to have a law, which would make us achieve the best quality credit bureaus in the world and this would have, as I said, both good impacts.</p>
          <p>As for regulatory pressure, I mean, we see it naturally and we don't expect any major regulatory change apart from the ones that are already around. What we expect naturally, with the recovery of the economy is fall spreads, which will naturally happen as the economy grows and credit quality improves, as I said, as a result of the macro situation of the country, which we forecast for next year very positively.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. I have a question regarding your potential revenue synergies going forward. Can you comment a little bit which areas you think you could you will be able to extract some synergies on the revenue side, at least since we've been mainly focused &#x2013; focusing a lot on the cost side.</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding asset quality. And as you mentioned earlier, I mean, there were provisions that were done in relation to reclassification criteria. So I was wondering if you could tell us if there was any specific credit or any companies that represented an important amount of the amount of incremental provisions that were done in the quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The synergy avenues that we consider, it relates with the segment of SME that we implement the platform &#x2013; the new platform that was created after the acquisition of BankBoston. And today we see very good opportunities to operate in the same level or with the new customers in the new bank that's coming from Unibanco. And we have started working with them already.</p>
          <p>The second possible synergy avenue is related with the segment of insurance. Insurance, we are adopting the model of bancassurance, because of the partnership with AIG, Unibanco did have bought so much insurance through the branches. They utilized more brokers. With the new bank, we are utilizing much more other branches to sell insurance products. For example, pension plans. This is a very good opportunity for us and we are &#x2013; this will appear when we start the integration in terms of branches.</p>
          <p>The second question, I will transfer to Mr. Alberto Fernandes.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcelo, there is no specific sector in the Brazilian economy that we focus on &#x2013; review the ratings. This is happening all over the economy, as you know better than me. The crisis affected all sectors, all companies, and this is kind of a general policy, as long as you see the whole balance sheet of all companies in all sectors have deteriorated in the first semester of this year. So this is not any specific sector. This is spreaded all over the companies that we have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow up on the same question. Do you have at least an idea of what was, let's say, the maximum or the highest provision per client that you had in this quarter? What was their largest amount, over R$200 million, 300? Just to have a sense. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. I just want to ask if you could comment on some of the &#x2013; if you have kind of a regulatory environment surrounding the merchant acquiring and credit card issuers, how you see that playing out over the next six months that &#x2013; and then maybe a little further out over the next couple of years with increasing competition and new issuers, and some of the other banks that have not been participating looking like they're going to start entering the market?

          <p>Let me talk about the credit card industry under this regulatory environment. What we have here is a big discussion about the exclusivity, about the ramp-up of the POFs. This is &#x2013; speaking many issues that they are discussing, if you &#x2013; probably, we will have just one POF that will be shared with the acquirers, that's the probable scenario that we have.</p>
          <p>In relation to the exclusivity is other point that probably will be broken, this &#x2013; but it will not be implemented immediately. It'll take some more months to do that. That's the &#x2013; probably the main scenario that will happen.</p>

          <p>Thank you all for your participation and the level of questions. We are still open if you have more questions. Our team in Investor Relations are here to serve &#x2013; to help you to understand better our numbers. We think it is a good number for the quarter, especially when we consider the situation of the economy.</p>
          <p>We expect that as we said, the economy to be in better shape from this quarter and that in the fourth and next year probably we will see a growth of more than 4%.
