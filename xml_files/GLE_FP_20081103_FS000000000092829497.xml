          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale's Group Third Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call. The presentation, hosted by Mr. Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oudea, Chief Executive Officer will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the floor over to Mr. Oudea. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for attending this conference call. Before handing over to Didier Valet, our CFO, who will get through our third quarter results, I just would like to say a few words about the Group's highlights during this third quarter. Clearly, it's not a surprise we've all encountered this very difficult environment, particularly in September. Every one of you know that the crisis has deepened following the Lehman bankruptcy, knowing that we've seen in the last recent days some early signs of improvement on the financial markets. Against this backdrop, I think that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale's third quarter results demonstrate our capacity to resist to a very negative market and to keep going our franchises.</p>
          <p>In French Retail, we still have a very dynamic growth, both of credits and of deposits: plus 13% for the credits, plus <mark type="inaudible" /> for deposits. The pick up in new accounts opening that we see at the end of the quarter is encouraging, given that we have improved at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>The net banking income is up 2.4% compared with last year in this quarter. In International Retail, we still have a very dynamic growth. We have an NDI growing at 18% on the like-for-like basis at constant exchange rate. We will tell you why we remain very confident in our developments, in particular in Romania and Russia, and committed to these countries: the cost of risk is low, at 71 basis point.</p>
          <p>In Global Investment Management and Services, which is suffering, of course, from the market environment, I've asked Jean-Pierre Mustier to takeover Asset Management, where he's launching restructuring plans. The asset gathering businesses are having a hard time, given the decrease in financial markets, but we have good results in Private Banking.</p>
          <p>In SG CIB, we have both a very good commercial performance given the background, with client net banking incomes of down 7.8% compared with last year. And we've a very prudent management of our trading risks. We've also been able to significantly decrease our exposure of risk, as you will see in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Overall, I think that these results demonstrate the solidity of our universal banking model. We know and we've been telling you for a couple of weeks that banks will face, of course, a certain increase in provisioning. The cost of risk stands at 67 basis points on the quarter for the Group. We will try to give you a prospective view of how of cost of risk may develop in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale will not be immune to what the &#x2013; to the phenomenon, but I think that we are well-armed. We've a very financial structure. At Tier One ratio we stand at 8.5% without taking into account the hybrid capital that we will issue in the fourth quarter under the French Government plan, which means that we have actually on a pro forma basis; a 9% Tier One ratio, a 6.8% core Tier One ratio. It's a very comfortable level, which will enable us to further grow, as well as potentially absorb a potential further deterioration of the economic environment in 2009.</p>
          <p>Didier, please could you comment more in detail our results?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fr&#xE9;deric. Good afternoon to everyone. Before starting the presentation, I would like to mention that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group has not used the amendment to IAS 39 in respect of its third quarter '08 results. You know that this amendment <mark type="inaudible" /> from trading portfolio to available for sale held to maturity, or loans and receivables. While this amendment fully makes sense in our view in competitive markets, we will use it only as from 1st of October 2008 and we have not decided to use it in a retrospective view.</p>
          <p>Our decision means that the assets that we, eventually will transfer as of 1st of October 2008, will have an evaluation, which will be even more rigorous and conservative, impacting the third year of the comparative income in a very limited way going forward. I remind you also that at the end of September '08, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale has very limited negative other comparative income, which account for &#x20AC;1.4 per share negative or total book value of 53.6 after this 1.4 negative.</p>
          <p>On slide five, just to remind you that this is the &#x2013; this diversification of our revenues, which show the strengths of our universal banking model. You can see that on an underlying basis, our revenues, which amounted to &#x20AC;40 billion in the third quarter '08 are, let's say, 60% coming from Retail Banking and Financial Services, almost a fourth &#x2013; 27% from Corporate Investment Banking, and slightly less than a sixth from Global Investment Management and Services.</p>
          <p>On slide six, we have the P&amp;L of the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group for the third quarter. You can see there that the net banking income stands at &#x20AC;5.1 billion, down 8.2% compared to last year on a like-for-like basis. And as I will comment on later and you would have also already read in the appendices, this includes &#x20AC;1.2 billion of non-recurring items, which are essentially concentrated on the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Corporate and Investment Banking division. Costs are increasing by 8% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting some investment that we continue to do in the Retail Banking outside our France division, as well as the Financial Services, where we continue open branches, to recruit people and to grow the business.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk increases from a low base. I will comment on next slide, and so the bottom line level, the net income stands at &#x20AC;183 million for the quarter, down 87% on a like-for-like basis compared to last year. Compared to the guidance that we have given to the markets three weeks ago, so the net income is positive as expected and the underlying net income, as we mentioned, would have reached &#x20AC;1.1 billion excluding non-recurring items after-tax, and it is exactly in line with the message that we sent to the market three weeks ago. On an underlying basis, the return on equity for the quarter would have stand at 14% after-tax.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, I comment on the increase in the cost of risk, which is moderate. We can see that the cost of risk for the quarter stands at 67 basis points in third quarter '08. Looking at each businesses &#x2013; in the French Networks, there we have seen a limited increase in cost of risk at 33 basis points compared to 25 basis points a year ago and 28 basis points the last quarter, in second quarter. International Retail Banking business, the cost of risk stands at 71 basis points, 57 basis points excluding Rosbank, which compares to the 42 basis points of last year, where Rosbank was not fully integrated in the Group accounts.</p>
          <p>In Financial Services, cost of risk at 127 basis points is totally in line with the one of the previous quarters, and reflects the effect of recent acquisitions notably compared to last year, Banco Cacique in Brazil, but also the effect of the evolution of the business mix where we know consumer finance is growing faster than equipment finance. And within consumer finance, we have a slightly more dynamic growth from the emerging market exposure.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in Corporate and Investment Banking, the net allocation to provision for the quarter stands at &#x20AC;270 million because of this <mark type="inaudible" />. But these &#x20AC;270 million encompass a very cautious provisioning attitude. Because as you can see, we have set aside, in the quarter, &#x20AC;132 million in collective provisions for non-recur losses. So this is a way for us to have a crucial stance at this point of the cycle.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, we have also moved &#x20AC;40 million of provisions linked to financial institution risk, mainly, let's say, 24 million linked to Icelandic banks, 5 million to Washington Mutual and 11 million due to Lehman Brothers. Even though the bulk of the burden from Lehman will be booked in revenues and I'll come on to that later. So as you can see, the underlying cost of risk in CIB is more in the order of &#x20AC;100 million compared to the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide eight, the picture for the nine months results where the bottom line stands at &#x20AC;1.9 billion with the solid base represented by the Retail Banking business in France, outside France and the financial services. And if we were to adjust this 1.9 billion performance from the non-recurring item, the bottom line would have increased from &#x20AC;3.3 billion after-tax equivalent to return on equity of close to 15% on an underlying basis.</p>
          <p>Slide nine, just to make a brief comment on the financial support for the economy, and so the application to France of what Eurogroup countries have decided and announced now two weeks ago. As you know that there is two legs of this plan. The first one it measures the strength in capital. So the French government has decided to allow financial institutions, so banks and insurance, to subscribe equity or capital equity securities in a 40 billion envelope, that it has &#x2013; French banking sector is very safe.</p>
          <p>The first envelope of &#x20AC;10.5 billion will be injected through deeply subordinated debt in to the Six National banks. So no voting rights, no Board &#x2013; no seat on the Boards. And this would allow Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale for its own share of 1.7 billion to strengthen its Tier One capital ratio by end of this year by additional 50 bps, bringing it to 9% under Basel II.</p>
          <p>The second leg of this plan are measures to facilitate medium-to-long-term refinancing. You know that contrary to some other countries where the state has provided guaranty directly of unsecured bonds issued by banks, the French plan has put into place a structure which will refinance itself on the markets with the guarantee of the state and relaying the money rate on the capital markets to the bank in exchange of collateral, so assets, that will be bought as security, reducing the risk of the structure. And so the maximum envelope available until end of '09, it accounts &#x2013; it amounts to &#x20AC;255 billion.</p>
          <p>In exchange of these two measures, the banks have committed themselves to increase credit volumes in the French economy by 3 to 4% per year. And Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale have decided to increase by 4%. On top of these French state measures, of course we have benefited like all the banks in the regions by the measure set by the Central Banks to restore interbanking markets' equity, <mark type="inaudible" /> on a more global basis, all Central Banks.</p>
          <p>Our next slide, slide 10. You have the evaluation of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Basel II Tier One ratio. You can see that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, thanks to a stabilization of its risk-rated assets from end of June to end of September has been able to improve its total Tier One ratio, up 8.5% compared to 8.2% at the end of June. And also to improve the core Tier One ratio of the bank by 20 bps, moving from 6.6% to 6.8%. In this figure at the end of September, we have, let's say &#x2013; as always, we have taken into account 45% dividend provisions based on current net profit, which accounts for 25 basis point negative deduction from the Tier One.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the share of hybrid capital in the Tier One at the end of September remain limited to less than 20%. And if we were to include the 1.7 billion that will be subscribed by the state in the coming weeks, the pro forma Tier One ratio of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale will increase to 9.0% pro forma at the end of September, which, again, a limited part represented by hybrids, only 24%, well below the TRV ceiling, which is 35%.</p>
          <p>Our next slide, slide 11. We have tried &#x2013; even if it's not, let's say, our usual approach &#x2013; we have tried to demonstrate using market estimates. So let's say, the Tier One ratio of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is appropriate in current market context and is appropriate also to face intense credit stress into '09. So all the figure that I will comment are not forecast, but they're just there to demonstrate the resistance and resilience of the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale business model.</p>
          <p>So we have taken the gross operating income, the lowest estimate of the gross operating income from the consensus, which stands, as of Friday, at &#x20AC;7.9 billion. We have assumed for next year a 10% organic growth of risk-rated assets, including the impact of rating migration. We have stress-test the Group cost of risk to 110 bps with some specific assumptions for each core businesses.</p>
          <p>And so are the results, the net income would stand at &#x20AC;1.6 billion next year. This is again, not an income forecast, but more a figure to demonstrate the state of the USIs. Assuming all that, we would have, by the end of '09, a Basel II Tier One ratio of 9.0% and a core Tier One of 6.6%, assuming that if there is a stress test -- with approving that the additional 1.7 billion available by the state, but if the markets were to reopen we could raise this resource on the market. And as you can see, we could have <mark type="inaudible" /> of the financial flexibility to play, let's say, on the dividend provisions which again, in <mark type="inaudible" /> being maintained at 45% for both '08 and '09 for an equivalent deduction of 40 bps for the three years.</p>
          <p>So this shows you that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale from it's business, thanks to the business model, thanks to its sound position as of end of September is able to navigate and to fare even a difficult credit environment.</p>
          <p>If I now move into the performance in the third quarter of each of the business lines. On slide 13, just to remind you, the strong growth that has been delivered by the retail banking activities which, on a current basis, will grow by 14.7% excluding non-recurring items. Thanks to a strong growth in the international retail banking, which does include Rosbank, but excluding Rosbank, the growth could have been still 18% on a like-for-like basis. Financial Services grew 14%. And Retail Banking in France, that I will comment on next slide, an above guidance growth of 2.4%.</p>
          <p>Global Investment Management and Services, we've seen revenue decline by 15%. I will comment on that later. And CIB on underlying basis, so excluding non-recurring items, would have seen its revenue growing by almost 21%, supported by dynamic growth &#x2013; dynamic commercial performances as well as robust trading in a very difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>On page 14, a comment on the French Networks. As you can see there was satisfactory development of the activities of the retail banking networks of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group, so Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and <mark type="inaudible" /> We've seen an increase in new current account opening by 27,100 in the third quarter and almost 98,000 for the last 12 months. For the retail for the <mark type="inaudible" /> customers, the rise in outstanding housing loans was 10.1% compared to last year and the performance was even stronger in the business customers with balance sheet deposits, so <mark type="inaudible" /> deposits and term deposits increasing by 32.4% compared to last year. Investment loans by 19.5% and operating loan by 13.8%.</p>
          <p>As a result, I already mentioned that the top line did grow by 2.4% third quarter on third quarter supported by net gross margin increase of 1.5%, despite the increase by 50 bps of the regulating deposits that took place on the 1st of August. And commissions, they increased by 3.5% third quarter on third quarter with service commission increasing by more than 10%, thanks to synergies developed between our CIB activities and the domestic retail network, while financial position, we are going down by 15%.</p>
          <p>Operating Expense were under control, an increased limited to 1.8% during the quarter, leading to an improvement in the cost/income ratio of the two networks by 40 bps to 63.3% in the third quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>On next page &#x2013; next page, sorry, the slide shows the structure of the loan portfolio of the French Retail Banking activities at Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I will not comment in too much into detail. But just to remind you that 45% of the total loan book is represented by housing loans which, as you know, have a very low structurally risk, thanks to the approval criterias as well as the pooling of risks that we obtain credit thanks to Credit Logement</p>
          <p>We have 6% of consumer credit, whose risks are probably lower than the risk embedded in a pure note bank consumer credit activity. Before banking loan &#x2013; and we have a strong relationship with our customer base &#x2013; we have also reviewed other client behavior through the checking accounts, which of course will improve this current system.</p>
          <p>At last, business customer loans accounts for 46% of total. And these outstandings are well diversified, we take credit for as much as possible as we can and we have also a strong intimacy in &#x2013; with French Corporate which allow us to have a low cost of risk.</p>
          <p>Overall, we do expect that the cost of risk mid cycle of the French domestic business are between 30 and 40 basis points with an around 5 bps on housing loan, around 130 bps in consumer lending and overdraft, and around 50 bps in business customer loans.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to international retail banking business. International retail banking has had a good quarter, continuing to expand its franchise compared to last year. Today we have 12 million individual customers. We have increased the franchise by 710,000 new customers over the last 12 months. We continue to expand our network with more than 3,600 branches as of end of September and 320 new branches opened over the last 12 months. We continue to expand the sales force and the employees. Gross of the outstanding are 12.1% for deposits, 12 &#x2013; 28.4% for the loans and the loan-to-deposit ratio stands at 100%.</p>
          <p>I will not comment because of Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric's comments earlier, but overall, as you can see, revenue did increase by 18% on a like-for-like basis and excluding &#x20AC;75 million capital gain booked by Romanian subsidiary, we have a cost income ratio, which has continued to improve, again excluding this capital gain, to 54.4% in the third quarter '08 compared to 53.7% last year. The return on equity stands at 31.5% high level, in line with our expectation.</p>
          <p>On slide 17 and 18, I would like to get &#x2013; to make a focus on Romania and Russia. Romania, despite currency volatility and some imbalances, remained for us fundamentally an attractive country. And if there were &#x2013; there would be suddenly a slowdown from the high gross level that we have over the last couple of year, we do &#x2013; we are convinced that there is still huge potential in term of banking penetration, in term of long-term gross prospect.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the IMF, in its recent forecast that were released at the beginning of October, continue to expect, we'll say a 4.8% growth rate by 2009, which is well above, let's say the almost nil growth that most economists are expecting for the Western Europe as well as for the U.S. Inflation is not &#x2013; it should decelerate and also when you look at other large imbalances or balances of the revenue and the economy, you can see that public debt remains very low at 17.5% of total GDP and that also foreign direct investment continue to be important at 6 to 7% a year in the coming three years.</p>
          <p>One of the data that is often looked at by the market is the proportion of foreign currency lending, which is admittedly, well developed in Romania, accounting for 55% of the total loan of industry. <mark type="inaudible" /> over the last 18 months. This level stands at only 50%. And that being so, that &#x2013; the lending practice have been not liking Romania recently. Just to mention that lending in Euro &#x2013; or <mark type="inaudible" /> of the Romanian economy is increasing. We have more and more, let's say, <mark type="inaudible" /> which are paid on debt on Euro. We have also a lot of large corporates which are export driven, and so we have resources paid in Euro, which means that the risk profile for such type of lending is mitigated by these two elements.</p>
          <p>Also, as you can see on the market share evolution on the lending side, BRD has been more selective than most of its peers in its lending policy, restricting foreign currency lending, which has led to a relatively limited but voluntary loss of market share, which has decreased from 19.2% at year end '06 to 15.8% at the end of September. In due course, we have continued to be very dynamic in term of gathering deposits from the customer base, with the market share has been almost stable over the last three years.</p>
          <p>Our next slide, a word on Russia. So, we are very well committed in Russia. As you know, we are expanding in this country over the last year, stocks in Greenfield with DSCV our 100% <mark type="inaudible" /> reached. We have been putting into place <mark type="inaudible" /> in consumer lending and now we have taken the control of Rosbank at the beginning of the year. The robustness of the Russian financial system has been fuelled by the rapid reaction of Russian authorities, which have injected, or are committed to inject in the coming weeks, almost U.S. $200 billion into the system, which accounts for a little bit less than 12% of GDP and almost a third of the more than U.S. $500 billion foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank.</p>
          <p>As you can see, again, IMS, still recently expects a growth of the GDP in Russia, 5.5%. Inflation to slightly slow down at 12% and the current account surplus to remain high at 3.4% in 2009.</p>
          <p>Rosbank is benefiting from the Central Bank measure to support liquidity. So, it has some lines from the Central Bank and from the Ministry of Finance. Its loan to deposit ratio stands at 123% at the end of September, and has also a well diversified customer portfolio, and has been over the recent months increasingly selective in the approval of loans to corporate customers.</p>
          <p>I would like now to move to financial strategies, where we have seen a sustained and electrified revenue growth over the quarter. Starting with our leasing and equipment finance activities, you can see that the outstanding of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Equipment Finance did increase by 10.8% on a like-for-like basis over the last five months reaching &#x20AC;18.5 billion at the end of September.</p>
          <p>In consumer lending, we have continued to see a high growth in loan origination up by 30% and outstandings up by 20%. In term of cost of risk, as I said, the mix is more explaining the overall increase in cost of risk affecting Consumer Finance. In some countries, we have seen a reduction in the absolute <mark type="inaudible" /> namely Brazil and Russia for example.</p>
          <p>In vehicle leasing and freight management, where <mark type="inaudible" /> ranks number two in Europe after we've gone ahead of <mark type="inaudible" />. We have seen an increase in the <mark type="inaudible" /> number by 8.4%, up 773,000 units and we have seen as we were mentioning in the previous quarter an impact of the second-hand vehicle market decline, this has triggered a minus &#x20AC;13 million revenues in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So, overall, satisfactory performances, with net banking income increasing by 7.7% on a like-for-like basis. Rosbank of 1% for the store specialized financing activity and plus 0.8% for insurance, which reflects the reduction in new business premium as well as the low level of market activities.</p>
          <p>If we now move to page 20, starting in GIMS with Asset Management division. Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Asset Management had a bad quarter with outflow of &#x20AC;7.9 billion mostly coming from equity outflows, which amounted to &#x20AC;2 billion, regular money market funds 1.9 billion negative, thanks to &#x2013; due to arbitrage in favor of term deposit as well as <mark type="inaudible" />. And we've seen &#x20AC;1.5 billion of outflows in dynamic money market funds, which amounted, at the end of September, to only &#x20AC;1.3 billion less. So, this is no longer a question or problem for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
          <p>As we have announced earlier in the month, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Asset Management is currently putting into place a recovery plan, which tends to enhance costs and revenue synergies between GIMS and SGAM and also between SGAM and the rest of the Group. And so, one of the projects of this recovery plan is to merge SGAM Alternative Investments and Lyxor. And you can see, at the bottom of the slide, that Lyxor had over &#x20AC;70 million in assets under management at the end of September. <mark type="inaudible" /> will go 1.2 billion in close during the quarter, essentially on the trackers and -- on the trackers, yes. We are also aiming to refocus the target customers of SGAM and to streamline and continue to have an innovative product tranch in the coming months.</p>
          <p>If we move to Private Banking, the commercial activity was very satisfactory with net inflows of &#x20AC;1.8 billion for the quarter, an equivalent of 7.3% of AUM at the beginning of the period. Total assets under management, as of end of September, amounted to &#x20AC;73 billion, 85% in Europe. And as you can see on the sliding 12 months' period inflows amounted to &#x20AC;6.3 billion from end September '07 to end September '08. SG Private Banking is continuing its business development, it's publishing in the region of the share with domestic retail banking activity at Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. The gross margin was stable during the quarter compared to last year, at 109 basis points. Net banking income was slightly down minus 1% and the operating income still at &#x20AC;53 million, which as I mentioned &#x2013; as we said, you can see on the slide, a loss on Washington Mutual investments of &#x20AC;10 million.</p>
          <p>On slide 20, I focus on the custody activity, brokerage and clearing activities and online saving. You can see there in the assets under custodies or SG Security Services that we have a very resilient business in term of the evolution of the assets under custody which are relatively stable despite the market environment.</p>
          <p>Newedge, which is a joint venture that we have with <mark type="inaudible" /> 50-50 has performed strongly during the quarter. We have gone up by 4.9% compared to last year and also with a very strong activity in September. Newedge, as you can see at the end of August, ranked number one in the U.S. market and even if it's competitive to have a worldwide ranking. We have in mind but Newedge is close from the top one position worldwide in this activity.</p>
          <p>BOURSORAMA <mark type="inaudible" /> compared to last year but recording almost 5% compared to the second quarter, again with high activity <mark type="inaudible" /> and in term of city banking offering we've seen almost 5,300 new accounts opened in France in the third quarter. Overall, you can see that GIMS revenue did grow by 4% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to SG CIB where you can see that the net bank income resulted from non-recurring items reached &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of almost 21% compared to the third quarter of last year and a modest decline compared to the strong second quarter level of 8.5%.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring items, as I detailed in the bar chart at the bottom of your slide, amounted to &#x20AC;1,079 million <mark type="inaudible" /> and are split as follows. We have booked at plus &#x20AC;252 million of mark-to-market positive in our CDS which hedged our loan portfolio. We have moved plus &#x20AC;68 million on the revaluation of our own debt on the structured products.</p>
          <p>We have benefited from an early liquidation of our portfolio one of CDO where there was two CDOs which have triggered no longer exposure for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and the write back of the marks that we've taken up to end of June, so equivalent of &#x20AC;606 million. We have booked additional write-downs on monolines remaining exposure to NH CDOs on the ABS portfolio of SGAM and on the exotic credit portfolio which are the four main components for almost &#x20AC;1.6 billion, and we have booked at the position in net bank income by &#x20AC;435 million due to the Lehman bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>In due course, and I will comment later, we have reduced our risky exposure and see something very important. Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale have continued to reduce its exposure by amortizing some exposure by selling some assets. And we have also strengthened the assumption and the provisions that we are applying to riskier exposure.</p>
          <p>In term of operating expenses, you can see that they were mildly down by minus 2.9% for the first nine months of '08 compared to the first nine months of '07.</p>
          <p>One page 24, I would comment the underlying performances of SG CIB starting with the Equities division where, as you can see, there was a good commercial performance with the &#x20AC;499 million revenues which are account-related thanks especially to strong performance <mark type="inaudible" /> recorded in the Group business. The trading activities are -- we did report 161 million of positive revenues which <mark type="inaudible" /> positive and trading of volatility having achieved good performance. So, I think this highlights the capacity of our equity-related activities to face even a difficult environment as we faced in September.</p>
          <p>Fixed-income currencies and commodities have gained for the almost third quarter in a row, did report record revenue level at &#x20AC;744 million with the record customer revenues at 445 highlighting the growth of the platform especially in term of flow business as well as in term of structure fixed-income and currency products.</p>
          <p>On the telling side, you can see that with &#x20AC;299 million. Performance was also very high benefiting from especially very good revenues in the treasury business.</p>
          <p>Lastly, with the financing and advisory activities, which in the mix performance with the continued good performance in infrastructure and <mark type="inaudible" /> financing. We have also <mark type="inaudible" /> acquisition finance. We have contributed to the syndicate that did finance the acquisition by EDF of British Energy. On the other side, let's say we continue to see unfavorable conditions for the leverage and property finance activity leading to the total overall &#x20AC;322 million revenues. As you can see our revenues of 1.7 billion are 75% coming from client revenues and 25% from trading and market making.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, just to comment a little bit further at the reduction that I mentioned earlier in term of exposures at risk, you can see that in the ABS portfolio the exposure has been reduced by 30% in the last six months to &#x20AC;8.0 billion. We have continued to make some disposals in the third quarter, almost &#x20AC;600 million. And I would like to mention because in the G7 reporting we have continued <mark type="inaudible" /> but which is not, let's say a compulsory but &#x20AC;5.1 million on non-CMBS and on non-RMBS U.S., on non-RMBS U.K. on non-RMBS Spain exposure, so which are of a better quality and our competitors do not disclose this type of exposure.</p>
          <p>On the unhedged CDOs, we have 1.9 billion exposure net of marks that we have taken, again in the third quarter, which is a reduction of 36% of the total net exposure compared to end of March. On the monolines, we continue to apply the same brackets of coverage depending on the monolines, which amount to an overall corporate level of 73% of the fair value of the hedged exposure and the net exposure amounted to &#x20AC;0.9 billion at the end of September.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on the exotic credit derivatives, we have not only reduced the net short exposure to a &#x20AC;0.5 billion but we have also much reduced the complexity risk, we think that &#x2013; and you will see that in the appendices, the bulk of the marks that we have booked in the third quarter each coming from reserve policy rather than losses in the management of this position which is in my view something quite positive. So that's what we would like to say on the businesses and we'll now let Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric make the conclusion of this third quarter results <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Didier. What I'd just like to highlight in the conclusion is the following. First of all, our business model has enabled us to maintain a good level of activity despite a very challenging environment and excluding non-recurrent items, the return on equity this quarter stands at 14%, 15% for the first nine months. I think that illustrates the robustness of this universal banking model.</p>
          <p>We have in this third quarter a carried on in reducing our exposures at risk, not only did we manage to sell some of them, but we also benefited from the termination of an unhedged synthetic CDO position and we also deliberately applied conservative provisioning to our remaining exposures. Our objective is to build the balance sheet as strong as possible entering 2009.</p>
          <p>In International Retail, we have benefited again our strong growth clearly in this country as well as in the world in general, there might be a slowdown of the economy but the core prospects remain stronger than in developed countries. And we have strong banks with high-quality assets, which should benefit from this situation and the disappearance of smaller players. A few words on October financial markets fairly chaotic with extremely high levels of volatility, although despite these headwinds and difficult trading positions, thanks to our prudent management of market risk as the Corporate &amp; Investment Banking has been able to post positive revenues, a net banking income, in October.</p>
          <p>At last, the Group has a very solid capital position at the end of the third quarter with a 9% pro forma Basel II Tier One. The high quality of core Tier one 6.8, this high-quality solvency level coupled with the residence of the Groups' franchises will allow us to carry on developing in 2009, and to weather through potential adverse &#x2013; some of the adverse economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention, and with my colleagues, we are now going to answer your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have our first question from Mr. Guillaume Tiberghien from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Corporate and Investment Banking, would you actually be kind enough to tell us whether you've been having a positive operating profit? And the second question relates to the Forex lending in the whole of international retail. I think you mentioned 50% for Romania, is that 50% of the entire loan book, and also would you mind giving us per country the total size in billion euros of the foreign currency lending? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guillaume, I didn't hear the beginning of your first question, but I guess, you've mentioned about <mark type="inaudible" /> on the CIB revenues in October?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question was actually, I think you've just said that the revenues in October in CIB were positive. Would you be kind enough to tell us whether the operating profit was also positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what we've said and <mark type="inaudible" /> we just give you the third quarter results, so we'll not comment on the month of October. What I was mentioning or what Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned is that the revenues of our activities was positive in October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is not taking into accounts the fact that due to the stress of credit that took place in October, we have a very high positive impact of mark-to-market of our CDS, which is several hundred of million euros which we are not taking to account in the figure of positive revenues as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned. So this could give you perhaps some comfort on the performance that we have made on an accounting point of view for the month of October.</p>
          <p>And the second question regarding the foreign lending exposure. For Romania and U.S., in the appendices on slide 22 as a detail of each of &#x2013; for each of our subsidiaries in retail banking outside France, the loan deposits, risk-weighted assets, net equity position, loan to deposit ratio. So I will not comment on them. But what I can say that in Romania, we've &#x2013; as you mentioned and as I mentioned earlier, 50% of foreign group which is in fact currency. In Russia, for example, we have 53% of the <mark type="inaudible" /> and so in foreign currency just to take the two major subsidiaries, because in Czech Republic that is almost no foreign currency lending activity, and I would not comment on the others more than this.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Brice Vandamme from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brice Vandamme from Deutsche Bank. I have three quick questions. The first one, with regard to the application of IFRS 39. I've seen on your slide that you mentioned you will apply it from your &#x2013; in Q4. Do you have any estimation of what could have been the positive impact in Q3, and what kind of assets you would be able to transfer in a non-mark to market portfolio in Q4? The second question relates to the stress test you mentioned, where you also mentioned the possibility to perhaps cut your dividend in '09. I just wanted to know if it's a likely option for you in order to increase your capital ratio for next year or not? And finally my third question relates to a comment we had this morning of the French Prime Minister saying that he does not rule out the possibility to take stakes French banks. Just wanted to know if you also see it as a likely outcome of this crisis for you shortly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brice, thank you. I'll let Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric answer to the dividend and the Prime Minister, and I will take care after that the IAS 39 question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the dividend, we just tried to illustrate that there is always this flexibility to totally premature to comment either on 2008 or 2009. In the Q1 figures that we have just communicated for 2008 for example, as we said, there is a provision of 45% of our net results, which means a 25 basis point equivalents to one, and the Board will of course decide and assess the situation every year. Regarding the Prime Minister, I mean, I think nothing has changed and the plan is very clear. We have negotiated with the government something, three elements in the public initiative, in line with the plan announced by the different European governments. The first one is on the liquidity and we've put in place a scheme, which in practice is a little bit different from other countries. We don't have &#x2013; the government did not give a guarantee, a formal guarantee on the inter-banking credit.</p>
          <p>But we put in place a specific company, which will receive access from banks as a collateral, as a security, which will issue bonds guaranteed by the government and then we'll lend money to the banks according to the proportion of assets brought to the company, that's the first thing. Secondly, there are two different kinds of banks in government intervention. The first is for companies which are under -- banks which could be under trouble and Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> again referred to this category clearly the states of course would intervene like in other countries to avoid the potential of the systemic risk, if again a bank, a French bank, was in trouble. Clearly, the six largest networks that we can have in mind are in a good shape and what we decided to do with the government is to get hybrid instruments and not preferred shares or core capital.</p>
          <p>What does that gives us? That gives us if you wish the comfort in 2009 to respectively pursue the growth of our lending book without taking any risk in terms of Asset and Liability Management and that's coupled with refinancing. So we have the capacity to have -- at Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale we get &#x20AC;1.7 billion, it will allow us to have again a more flexibility &#x2013; financial flexibility to increase our lending by 3 to 4% for next year. That's the commitment all the French banks have taken in 2009 with the support &#x2013; with this comfort of the government, but a bank like Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale are in such a good shape, does not need any additional measures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to answer &#x2013; on your first question, again <mark type="inaudible" />. So yes, we have decided to apply or to use the amendment twice as from the 1st of October '08. I would not comment and say on what would have been the result in the third quarter because our decisions are not -- were not taken to boost or just to take into consideration what could have been our result in the third quarter. The decision that we will use or the criteria that we would use to reclassify our portfolio will be based essentially on the fact whether or not we believe that they are appropriately provisioned and we make further efforts this quarter, and also whether the change in the market environment does prevents us to manage them in a trading way as we used to do when we bought these assets.</p>
          <p>So what are the types of assets <mark type="inaudible" /> through a reclassification and again you mentioned non mark-to-market accounting practices. I know that some banks in Europe we got a quite aggressive diversification last week. When I say non mark-to-market, my view is to more reclassify them in available for sales, which means that the mark-to-market with synergies will no longer in the P&amp;L, but more in the equity. The classification to loans and we see <mark type="inaudible" /> held to maturity seems relatively aggressive. So we believe that for example a certain part of the exotic credit derivative book, where, as I mentioned, earlier in the presentation today, the bulk of the mark that we took in the P&amp;L are linked to uncertainty on the valuation and not to the management of this portfolio. Let's say a certain part of that will be eligible to reclassification.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier some cash CDOs and <mark type="inaudible" /> that for example the portfolio too of our exposure, which is unhedged cash CDO is likely to be reclassified <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; reclassified from a prudential point of view in the banking book. We will certainly also look at some exposure in the negative business trade in the monolines where we have lost some efficiencies in terms of hedging because of the uncertainties prevailing on some monolines and last but not least, we could also potentially reclassify certain assets which <mark type="inaudible" /> asset-backed securities portfolio but after, let's say, first of all taking into account some strict valuation as of end of September because we have, as I said strengthened again the marks in the third quarter and also looking at the underlying quality of credit that we all have in these assets. So that's the way we will practice let's say as from 1st of October, '08.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Antonio Guglielmi from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have four questions. The first one and the second one is on capital. Core Tier is up some 20 basis point in Q3 versus Q2 in spite of low reported earnings or flattish <mark type="inaudible" /> assets, just wondering where is it coming from, I guess is the basic two deductions in Q2, but maybe you can add more color here.</p>
          <p>The second one on dividend policy, again you have approved the dividend in Q3, or does it mean, it is likely you will pay the dividend for '08 or you will just decide with the year-end results?</p>
          <p>Two questions on GIMS. If you could add more color on the new asset management platform which will include Lyxor and the status of risk of cannibalizing SGAM here. And finally I see trading gains again in CIB in Q3 in spite of very weak markets. I was just wondering what is the Group's attitude now towards risk at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'll take the first two questions. Next <mark type="inaudible" /> on GIMS <mark type="inaudible" /> on the trading gains in the CIB. First on the core Tier One which is up by 20 bps from end of June to end of September, what happened and you remember that we did mention that we had at the end of June some deduction on the remaining exposure of our unhedged CDO portfolio. The only termination of the portfolio one that took place during the quarter not only that they reduced the exposure, but also they reduced deduction that we have to face on Tier One capital as well as the <mark type="inaudible" /> under Basel II. Secondly <mark type="inaudible" /> because as you've seen, we have strictly controlled that during the quarter, we get the stability cut &#x20AC;140 billion, of restricted assets from end of June to end of September. So this explain the bulk of the 20 bps increase of the core Tier One and of the total ratio over the quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding the dividend policy, I think Frederic did mention already. What is the position of the Management and of the Board, I guess that's what we do and I will remind you that also French banks do provide for the dividends on an accrual basis over the years and there is more <mark type="inaudible" /> but charge of these <mark type="inaudible" /> of the closing. So we're &#x2013; that's to take into account in the Tier One calculation. So far let's say, we're accruing in a normal basis. We are expecting a typical analysis of market of 45% payout and this should be the decision of the Board at the beginning of the year to propose to the <mark type="inaudible" /> dividend. So, it's a little bit too early to comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the asset management side that the direction to move between these governments and between Investment Banking and <mark type="inaudible" /> was two-fourth. And one side we feel that there are stronger positive synergies in terms of the revenue generation between the groups, and by mixing expertise we can develop our product, a new product and not bit more I guess <mark type="inaudible" />. And on the other side, there are cuts over the last two weeks. We should base our <mark type="inaudible" /> use of &#x2013; we have to launch an initiative, which we will have to be presented to the union and we couldn't achieve all these stuffs and which should be done by the beginning of 2009.</p>
          <p>Compared to what you said we figured it is not something which will cannibalize our asset management business and we are within the asset management side of <mark type="inaudible" /> when we view the alternative side for all the <mark type="inaudible" /> we have approved our more traditional activity, with three legs. The U.S. leg <mark type="inaudible" /> the European leg with <mark type="inaudible" /> Europe and our emerging market leg where we have <mark type="inaudible" /> joint venture specifically in India and China and <mark type="inaudible" />. And we intend to review as far as our more credit <mark type="inaudible" /> concerned. On one side, our client target, and we're going to make sure that we target <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; on the other side, our product crunch in order to see the effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that on the trading of CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the risk on CIB, the overall focus is on maintaining our risk in as low level as we can and managing them as quickly as we can. Our VAR, our value at risk during the third quarter decreased by 3% compared to the previous quarter and by 17% compared to end of 2007. I should add that no limit of stress test has been breached during the quarter. And Didier Valet has gone through the reduction of our exposure since Q1 in ABS and <mark type="inaudible" />. So it's an active management of risk profile and I think that we're pretty pleased with the way we've been with our investor profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your question on slide 24 in the appendices that we've reduced consequently the stress test assumption since the beginning of the year for CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's me just highlight under the policy of the Group is very clear. We started the year <mark type="inaudible" /> and we've said we would reduce our market risk by enhancing the comfort. In midyear we said we carry on maintaining this risk at the low level with the volatility of the market. The markets remained volatile, so we maintained the same policy and it will be maintained to year-end. Because I don't think that the market will improve perhaps very, very quickly in the next few days.</p>

          <p>Hey, good afternoon everyone. My first question would be for Jean-Pierre in asset management. Can we have a little bit more color, so what do you want to achieve in SGAM, because that's basically one of the worst division over the last three quarters?</p>
          <p>Second one will be on the French retail. Thanks to the help of the state, you are able to have some good growth on the loan sign. Which kind of sector are you targeting? It is more SMEs, large corporate and we will have a little bit more favor on that side?</p>
          <p>And last part will be regarding the Investment Banking. You were speaking about the flexibility on the cost side, have you changed your mind or can you give us also more details of where you are on that process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the asset management side, I'll try to be brief. I suspect that we might visit that later in the course of the year or early next year. We have an overall setup on the asset management side. We feel that the market has changed and will be different in the future, very different in the future from when it has been in the past few years. So, as such we feel it is important to make sure we're mobile on our business model. And the first move, we decided to put some space between <mark type="inaudible" /> We feel and are convinced that the alternative management debt will remain a strong asset class and we feel that we have the ability as far as the tenant is concerned to keep different activities. And we look at various opportunities <mark type="inaudible" /> and maybe some other opportunities to see how we can develop alternatives within the Group. We have had various client interest for that and I think we have the skills and know-how as well to complement that.</p>
          <p>On the most traditional business, we are an area of growth that we want to keep developing, which is on the emerging market side. So with the various joint ventures we have mainly in Asia. And there it is important for us on one side to make sure that we develop more our offer to local clients and meet for a large extent the weaker clients and we have got quite large success in China, in India and in Korea from the launch of new products this year. And at the same time we have a certain number of products that we extend to our international clients, which can be seen as access trade to a certain extent <mark type="inaudible" /> markets, which can be difficult to invest in more specifically. So second leg, emerging market that we will keep pushing together with our partners.</p>
          <p>But the third leg is the most &#x2013; the more traditional business. For the more traditional business, this is where probability the evolution will be the most important in the next few years. There, it's a matter on one side of making sure that on the retail client side as we have two businesses, institutional and retail. On the retail client side, we improved the quality of our service pre and post transactions. This is what makes the different with the retail network who take and distribute our products. And we have a specific initiative there with a strong precursor in Europe to develop the retail activity.</p>
          <p>And on the institutional side, we have to review our product range, <mark type="inaudible" /> to the areas where we feel we have the strong competitive advantage. That's true for Europe. It's true for Japan, where we have a presence, as well as the U.S. And within this market and these activities, we'll probably need to have some restructuring of our products as well as our asset. So these are the direction in which we're working right now. There will be further evolution of what we do and I suspect that we'll make a specific change <mark type="inaudible" /> for first quarter and second quarter of next year.</p>

          <p>My thoughts regarding your point on the French Retail Banking business, I think it's not the support <mark type="inaudible" /> that provide this good figure, because the plan was announced <mark type="inaudible" /> October. So I think it's more that there is a confident policy that was implemented by our two brands, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and <mark type="inaudible" /> which although have to expand our customer base, expand our loans to <mark type="inaudible" /> retail customers as well as corporate customers. And I think that more important rather than the state it's more the commitment of all the <mark type="inaudible" /> which have continued over the last month <mark type="inaudible" />. It should be a pretty <mark type="inaudible" /> our customers and I think this is much more that, which <mark type="inaudible" /> performance achieved over the recent months. Then let's say the announcement of the plan, but the plan we focused more actually on the way to finance and refinance <mark type="inaudible" /> of the French banks. But as I said, the commercial policy and the dynamic in term of marketing is more <mark type="inaudible" /> local work force which is <mark type="inaudible" /> Michel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the cost of the Corporate and Investment Bank, managing cost tightly is obviously part of our strategy going forward. We made the commitment that we will maintain the head count overall stable at the end of 2009 compared to the end of 2007. You have to keep in mind that first part of 2007 we recruited a lot of people and the cost of these recruitments are carried now. And therefore, the effort going forward will be on stabilizing and selling down these costs and the head count. So, if I give you some figures of the whole, the cost for 2007 &#x2013; nine months 2008 are down 3% compared to nine months 2007.</p>
          <p>The third quarter, the costs in third quarter versus second quarter 2008 are down 18.5%. And if we compare third quarter '08 versus third quarter '07, they are up 4.6% and it's mainly due to some adjustments made in the third quarter and in 2007, but more the investment which we've been making in '08 regarding the tighter control plan after the fall event in January, mainly on the remediation and the confirmation plan where we've been spending significant money.</p>
          <p>In terms of head count, the head count third quarter '08 compared to third quarter '07 is up 6%, and third quarter '08 versus second quarter '08 is up 2%.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the breakdown between front-office and back-office, in fact, the front-office is down 1% on both comparisons, and the back-office head count is up 12% third quarter versus third quarter, and 5% third quarter versus second quarter '08, which again reflects the important investments we've been making on tightening our control as you are well aware about. I should say that also our cost to income ratio has been stable at 43% if we exclude non-recurring items and this is something we are pretty pleased about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. To give you a backbone on our cost/income <mark type="inaudible" /> last year for the full year we had cost/income of 75% for the whole Asset Management business including the impact of the crisis. On Q3, if you take out the impact of the crisis, which is around &#x20AC;48 million, which is made of &#x20AC;33 million of <mark type="inaudible" /> which we're going to reduce in terms of absolute exposure &#x2013; as well as basically &#x20AC;50 million, which are mostly due to the impact of the Lehman bankruptcy, so <mark type="inaudible" /> of 48 million of total was called non recurrent impact.</p>
          <p>Our cost/income taking that out would have been 83%. So we're not very far from the 80% basically. But, as I said, this depends for a large part of the total amount of asset under management and evaluation of the market. So for next year, depending on market evolution and the various restructuring we take, we might be within this figure. And &#x2013; but I think we should do better in the years to come.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can I just add one last question? Apparently Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric had mentioned in an interview this morning that you are potentially looking for exponential growth next year. Can we have an idea of where do you want to extend the business model of SocGen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maxence, really what I've said this morning is that &#x2013; answering your question &#x2013; first of all, I remain very confident in the potential of organic growth within our businesses. In a world where clearly the economic growth will be low, our central scenario stands now at something like 0% for here, developed Europe and minus 0.5 around something like that for the U.S.</p>
          <p>We'll, on the other hand, benefit from a reduction of the competition. You have less banks which will be able to propose services to clients. Some of them have disappeared, some of them will have to fundamentally review their models, some of them will have the constraint of development because of the support of such government, and hence the banks like Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale in good shape will be able to increase market share. So the cake might be smaller but there will be less people to eat it.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the other hand, in line with what we did previously, we are effectively happy to consider acquisitions which can fit in the model. I'm convinced, personally, that in 2009 there will be opportunities. People will review their business models. Again, reassess whether or not certain assets are core. And I think we will have opportunities, in a very disciplined way, to look at acquisitions, which might fit again in our development.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Pierre Chedeville from CM-CIC. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Actually, you answered some of my questions, but I have some remaining question. First one regarding the growth of the credit in Retail Banking. We can see that it is very dynamic. In terms of growth, outstanding. What exactly would be the impact of the engagement you have with the government in terms of growth of 3 to 4%? Because I don't see exactly what could be the impact considering the fact that, for instance, for individuals in mortgage loans, your growth is 10% and for companies like SMEs your growth is around 13% for working <mark type="inaudible" /> financing or nearly 20% growth in Investment Financing.</p>
          <p>And what could be the impact on the cost of risk since you have to sustain a weakening economy? And more generally, don't you see, I would say, a scenario like a Japanese scenario in Europe? Banks are constrained to sustain weaker economies and the impact on cost of risk?</p>
          <p>My second question is also relative to the growth of loans and to the growth of net banking income in emerging markets. I can see that your growth in net banking income is nearly 26 or 27%, I'm not sure, but I think it's in the figure. Don't you see that it's, I would say, too huge a growth considering the coming risk in this area?</p>
          <p>And my last question is relative to CIB. It is clear that we are more or less changing the world in this part. Do you still maintain your objective of recovering ROE around 25% we've seen to year in this business? Or don't you think that the model will imply a lower profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will let Didier answer your question on the retail asset front. Let me first start with the commitment we took with the French government. Again, as I said, first of all the background is an economy which might grow at zero, zero plus percent with a low inflation rate. You know, the prospects have decreased dramatically compared with four or five months ago. And in particular, for example, in France, the idea that investment spending will not be very dynamic by corporates and factoring a sub-lending of the housing market, which means less transactions, as well as a price effect, which might be negative.</p>
          <p>And so if you wish, all that should be considered when looking at the evolution of loans, because the price effect, for example, clearly aside from the volume of transactions impact the volume of growth. So, I think by putting a figure of 3 to 4%, it's really what I would call a reasonable commitment. We will precisely avoid making loans which, if you wish, would not make sense, and maintain the same level of accountability in the French system.</p>
          <p>I think that France has avoided problems that we've seen in our economies with other indebtedness, in particular of a household. And secondly, to ensure that effectively corporates have a good level of support from the different banks in order to maintain their activities and their development. So, 3, 4% corresponds to a consistent policy in terms of lending in an environment which of course will be a low growth environment.</p>
          <p>Third element, on the CIB side. Clearly, yes, there are certain structural changes, less activities in certain markets. There will be &#x2013; there is a progressive de-leverage. And as we've said, we are reducing our assets. Thirdly, you will have, effectively, certain more controls. You will have more capital requirement on certain capital market activities.</p>
          <p>But, again, first of all, you will have less players and hence the capacity to price at the normal level, certain risk, certain services, and it will help on the profitability side. And secondly there will be an overall balance, including on the compensation side, in my view, to ensure that these activities have a return on equity, which make sense versus retail activity.</p>
          <p>I am convinced that from an investor perspective or a managerial perspective, you cannot have a <mark type="inaudible" /> where retail activities have a higher return on equity than corporate and Investment Banking activities. So there will be a new balance. It will include pluses and minuses, structural changes, but personally, I'm confident to be able to have currently on a normative basis, 6% for risk rated asset, a return on equity between 20 and 25%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to comment on your question on Retail Banking outside France. The underlying growth this quarter is on page 16 and is only 18% on a like-for-like basis, if you exclude also a capital gain that was booked in Romania of &#x20AC;75 million. I mentioned that during the presentation, it's through the disposal of an insurance subsidiary <mark type="inaudible" />. So 18%, that stayed in line with mid-term expectation which is that revenues in these divisions should grew at teens or mid-teens level. And, in fact I'd say it's a mixture of different implementation.</p>
          <p>You have today for example, the Czech Republic, which is growing nicely, thanks to the fact that is has, and you will see that in the appendices, which is benefiting from the reinvestment of the excess liquidity at level of interest rate which have been increased by the Central Bank. We have Romania, again as we've said which is slightly slowing down but still continuing to deliver a mid teen growth due to the measure that we have put into place. So I think this is totally in line with our expectation and with the targets that we have for this division in terms of gross and return on equity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I still have a few questions left. The first one, just a confirmation to be sure I understood well. The revenues for CIB in October, you said positive, not including any mark-to-market on CDS. Obviously, you're not mentioning also any depreciation in this figure. Second question, is just an explanation I would like to have on the process, it's probably a stupid question, I'm sorry. An explanation on the process of the early termination of liquidation of the CDO, how does it work? When &#x2013; what are the triggers, how are you selling this product?</p>
          <p>Third, it's regarding the cost of risk on Rosbank because you mentioned the level of the cost of risk in the whole division with or without Rosbank, but I'm not sure you're giving any number regarding only Rosbank and what is this figure? What was this figure the previous quarter and what are your views on the evolution of this number for Rosbank? And the last one is an open question on the future of the Asset Management. Haven't you ever mentioned in the past any possibility of a partnership to have a bigger size that will be able to compete more efficiently in this new world I would say. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Pascal. I will let Jean-Pierre answer the last question. Just to start with our comments on October, yes we've said so it's positive, not taking into account the positive item from the mark-to-market <mark type="inaudible" /> having in mind that we <mark type="inaudible" /> from the reserve policy over the months or over the quarter. Secondly, regarding the early termination of the <mark type="inaudible" />. So, it's just that we are entering into a <mark type="inaudible" /> transaction with the trustee which itself is entering into a <mark type="inaudible" /> transaction with a third party, and the event of default, was on the second leg of the transaction has triggers for the termination of the transaction, the unwinding of the CDO. And so as such we have no longer an exposure on these assets. On your third question regarding the cost of risk of Rosbank, it was this quarter 145 basis point and it was in the second quarter, 112. And I think this is at the range in which we believe Rosbank should navigate over the cycle. On the last question I will let Jean-Pierre answer on the future of Asset Management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I took my crystal ball with me actually and we were very open to consider any <mark type="inaudible" /> when and if for a given business it could make sense to tie up with a third party, <mark type="inaudible" /> part of our business or basically get part of the business <mark type="inaudible" /> third party.</p>
          <p>So, as I said, I think we're in a different environment for Asset Management. It is an environment which is here to last. So, we need to be mobile on our business model and look at any <mark type="inaudible" /> opportunity which could be accretive for our shareholders. We have an open mind and we look at what we can do ,and I think we have to be careful not to rush to quickly because what we've been and the key issue for us would be to make sure that the quality of the products <mark type="inaudible" /> and for that trying to anticipate on change of industry before <mark type="inaudible" /> will be in effect. So, we've been <mark type="inaudible" /> in what we do in the business model but driven by our planning needs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Just one remaining question actually on my side which was slide six of the supplementary disclosure. Really talking about this CLO-monoline hedged portfolio, the 9.5 billion portfolio. I just wanted to understand what the source of that is? Is that part of your treasury operations or is just a SocGen originated structured portfolio? Also the 98% AAA rating that you referred to. Is that an internal rating or is that coming from rating agencies? And going forward, do you see any further risks from corporate defaults specifically to that portfolio? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Kinner. So, on the <mark type="inaudible" /> that we have on slide six, obviously CLO that was <mark type="inaudible" /> negativity trade exposures so as most of banks have done, let's say over the last years and quarters. We're getting the details from the CLO exposure. You have a lot of details on page seven. So, the rating of tranches hedged by monoline is AAA for 98%. We have also the distribution of the underlying assets by rating &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> rating.</p>
          <p>And you can see that on the CLO portfolio, we have an attachment points which is protecting us, which is quite high, with a 30% attachment point and we are not exposed to maintain it. So, we are holder of the single tranches and if we were to <mark type="inaudible" /> portfolio, the weighted loss rates for underlying assets would be only 27%. The fact that loss is below the attachment point should <mark type="inaudible" /> zero markdown.</p>
          <p>But of course it is an average so as you can see we have taken a 5% depreciation assumption on this portfolio which is then provided for according to the different category of buckets for rating. And we have a 15% discount for the good buckets, 49 for the mid-bucket, and 90% discount for the worst bucket and again all the tranches of the initial CLOs <mark type="inaudible" />, so we even the structure of the event. And this is external rating under AAA as you can see.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions. First one is regarding the cash flow situation of the companies in France. If you could give some color. Is there a cash flow constraint, and how do you handle that, I mean how often are you accommodating, and what is the role of credit insurance companies in acceleration of the cash flow constraint eventually for the medium-sized companies?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding the guidance for the loan loss charges for international retail, you mentioned 60 to 80 bps. Can you explain how you get to that number, what is the rationale, or how you came to that estimate or guidance? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean Pierre, good afternoon. Regarding the cash flow of the company in France, let us say, first of all, you can see the situation in terms of cash position of our customer base, <mark type="inaudible" /> because you've seen that the deposits that we gather from the corporate <mark type="inaudible" /> 32% over the last 12 months. So we have capacity as you can see to get some liquidity from them. So a lot of our customer base is in good shape. What we've said already in the previous quarters is that we start to see some signs let's say of limited, but nevertheless there is a deterioration of the overall environment. It seems to focus mainly so far on the professionals and very small enterprise. We have to look at that quite closely, but we remain very confident in the quality of the portfolio, as you can see &#x2013; the quality of the securities and collaterals that we have taken on our own exposure.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question and the guidance of loan less provisioning, relief for the retail banking outside France of 60 to 80 basis points. Again this is an average. So we have there some exposure, that we know by heart for years and years which are the <mark type="inaudible" /> which have the <mark type="inaudible" /> exposure. Well, we have very long term, let's say data in terms of cost of risk and the return on equity in certain of these subsidiaries is very high and <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>For the rest, let's say we are also plugging that same assumption in term of cost of risk varying on &#x2013; depending on the local context and what we've seen so far is that Czech Republic cost of risk is went under control. Romania you've got under control, even if we have to change some cautious spends in term of provisioning. I commented the Russian exposure. So if you were to put, let's say and you have details lending <mark type="inaudible" />. You can play, let's say, with your own assumption and you will see that 60 to 80 bps is something which in not, let's say, either aggressive nor conservative.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it was a follow-up to the last question really. I think in your slides when you're talking about stress test, and I understand that it's relatively subjective, but you talked about 110 basis points cost of risk. And I wonder if you could explain where that comes from, particularly what you would assume in the Investment Bank? And then just a follow-up in terms of coverage and non-performing loans. I think your coverage isn't really moving, yet you seem to be taking some generic provisions to some extent in the Investment Banks. So I don't know if you could kind of explain what's happening there? And then, just lastly I know you talked about the 20 basis points rise for the Core Tier 1, but it was very difficult to hear. I couldn't hear the answer at all. I don't know if you could repeat it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes <mark type="inaudible" /> on your first point, yes, the assumption that we have taken in the slide 11 in term of the serious stress credit scenario, <mark type="inaudible" /> medium cycles because they should be around 70 bps, and we have multiplied by two, so we have applied 140. And we did exactly the same from the retail banks outside France which tends to <mark type="inaudible" /> though the middle of the range 60 &#x2013; 80, so 70.</p>
          <p>We did multiply by two also, this cost of <mark type="inaudible" /> of the underlying assumption. Regarding the coverage of let's say, NPLs which stands in the appendices at 58%. In fact, we have on top of that and above &#x20AC;1 billion of portfolio based provisioning, which is not included in the prevailing rate. And this is on the portfolio-based provision that we have strengthened, let's say, the coverage over the quarter by something between 80 to &#x20AC;90 million additional that was set aside all across the group. And you had a third question which was -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm afraid I couldn't hear your explanation of why the Core Tier 1 had gone up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Tier 1, yes. On one side, we had, as I said, we had asset devolution, we have stabilized the restricted asset during the quarter. <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x20AC;340 billion on the <mark type="inaudible" />. And on the other side as we mentioned at the end of June, we had &#x2013; at the end of June, we had to deduct from our Core Tier 1 and from our Tier 1 unhedged, <mark type="inaudible" /> exposure on the portfolio 1 and 2 of unhedged CDO because the two CDOs were less than single B under Basel II. When you have a <mark type="inaudible" /> which has below single B rating, the remaining exposure has to be deducted from your Tier 1, half for that and half from the Tier 2.</p>
          <p>So that's what something that we have to take into account at the end of June and since as I mentioned, we have been able to liquidate, the CDOs, to make an early redemption of the CDO has the <mark type="inaudible" /> authority, we were able to write back the marks that we have taken but also the deduction as the <mark type="inaudible" /> goes no longer of this exposure.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Robin Down from HSBC. Please go ahead</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Robin Down from HSBC. I had question on retail margins, but before I spoken out that, could I just come back to the questions about your appetite for loan growth across the Group. I'm surprised given the &#x2013; we're going into a recessionary environment that we're still seeing quite as much loan growth as we are within both French Retail and within the Financial Services business. I'm just wondering with the French Retail, how quickly you think you'll get down to sort of 4% type annualized growth rate? And also maybe if you could give us some sort of color on how fast do you think the Financial Services business will be growing its loan book in the future as well. That will be helpful. And then on the margins, on the French Retail margins, I was just wondering if you could give us some color as to how you see that developing going forward? On the positive side, I guess you've got <mark type="inaudible" /> rates hopefully falling next year, and you've hopefully got widening products spreads. But I guess on the <mark type="inaudible" /> side we've got funding cost in particular seems to be a big shift towards time deposits. So I was just wondering how you feel those things playing out running through into 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Robin. So, we're getting into gross in the Retail Banking front and the time to convert to the 4% from the &#x2013; growth 10% that we <mark type="inaudible" /> today. I think it's a complicated worry. It's important for us twofold, first of all that we continue to accompany, to accompany our customer base, and that also this will depend mostly on the evolution of the economic environment. Our view is that the 4% seems to be feasible, let's say by the end of '09. Without changing our rate to enter right business, and without restricting us in a way or another after our company, our customer base we will do that by '09 as we have done over the last few years and quarters.</p>
          <p>Regarding the risk, I remind you also that the risk embedded in the French Retail Banking business miles ahead &#x2013; miles away from what you can have in the U.K. or in Spain with portfolio, which is much safer <mark type="inaudible" />. Which will still prevent us to be the <mark type="inaudible" /> stop and go in our commercial policy. Regarding Financial Services, I would say that, we continue to have, let's say an adequate evolution in term of the volume margin and cost of risk. And, so let's say, as soon as we have confidence in the country where we operate, we continue to tend to develop the business, and so far that's what we've done. Regarding the margin in France, for '09, well, it's a mixture of another parameters as you mentioned. Now it seems to be more and more likely that we would see as of 1st of February a decline of interest rates, because of the strong slow down of the inflation that we've seen over the recent months and that should continue to the end of this year. So it should slightly ease the pressure for the margins on deposits, but on the other side, and you know which is that. We have an overall or so cost of funding external and also a mixed evolution which is triggering some pressure. So we would see going forward where we will stand, but again we've been always able to pass the bulk of the increase in cost of funding to the customer base, without preventing the growth of our lending activity.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. Three follow on questions. The first one is, with regards to Forex spending in both Russia and Romania. Can you give us a breakdown between the retail and wholesale and also if you can tell us some, how you're relative to the local peers? The second question is about exotic credit derivative. You're saying that the decision to put the losses against reserves are good thing &#x2013; I am not entirely sure about the situation. I mean we've been having those for three quarters to the tune of about 400 million. I'm just trying to understand, if we're going to have a recurring loss there for the exotic derivatives that we're coming to an end, and how come the last breakdown was considered as positive? And the third question is about CIB costs. I'm slightly interested in the sense that, in your views about the ongoing slowdown in Corporate Investment Banking. You don't seem to cut down costs as much as revenues and you seem to have a view that with robust capacity, you'd be taking market share. I'm just wondering if you're not rightsizing the investment bank's view from &#x2013; of the new environment in Corporate Investment Banking where revenues would be a lot lower as a result of the economic slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi <mark type="inaudible" /> good afternoon. I'd let <mark type="inaudible" /> answer the last question. Regarding your first question on the Forex lending, what you want &#x2013; what do you &#x2013; what you want is the split of the Forex lending or the proportion of Forex lending in retail on one side and wholesale on the other side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean if you &#x2013; if total of retail lending, how much of that is in percentage terms is Forex lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we would ask Investor Relations to come back to you, but overall as I said probably Romanian bank, we've today <mark type="inaudible" /> 50% of our loan book, which is in Forex currency and the average industry is 54, 55%, so we're below the average because part of your question was as related to peers. Regarding the exotic credit derivative book, why -- I did mention that it was a likely candidate to reclassification from trading to available for sale, and mainly because and again you've the details in the appendices. We can see that the loss &#x2013; the real losses on this portfolio were limited to 30 to &#x20AC;40 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And as I said during the presentation, the bulk of the <mark type="inaudible" /> that we took during the quarter was linked more to reserve policies and reserve from the valuations rather than the loss that did incur on the management of the position, which as I said also has almost no longer any productivity we have to <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; to avoid that productivity which was causing some problems in the first and second quarter. So that's why having a portfolio where now this is almost 90% or 85% of the markets <mark type="inaudible" /> evaluation question that's in the &#x2013; against reserve <mark type="inaudible" /> income rather than the P&amp;L. As that makes sense and that's why I mentioned it was a likely candidate of the reclassification in terms of volume of the portfolio. I will now hand over to Michel to answer your last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; it's a very interesting point. There is no doubt that we need to adapt to market conditions. And flexibility, it will be our motto. The fact is that we should look at the business one by one. As you can see, there is a very strong resistance on our franchise, and whether we talked about fixed income or <mark type="inaudible" /> our current business has been probably as strong as ever on the fixed income side, and then very strong on the equity side. And on the financing, restructured finance and capital raising, we know that the markets have been stopped in the last two months. But I personally think that it will reopen at some stage and we need to be well positioned for that, capitalizing on the gain, we've been making on both primary fixed income and primary equity. So there is one business, which is effectively under pressure, it is <mark type="inaudible" />. But we see also very attractive activities on the restructurings. So what we say that we are putting pressure on the front-office side, not to grow but to decline marginally. And we are still investing on the back-office or <mark type="inaudible" /> side to make sure that we are coping with our plans regarding tightening our controls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean, are you basing your views on October and on the period where we've seen a significant deleveraging, but also some selling that's linked to redemptions, especially with hedge funds. I mean, are you taking to account to the fact that we could see $500 billion from hedge fund money be redeemed in the next three to six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think that first of all, as I &#x2013; that has been said by both Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric and Didier, in this environment, we are confident that we will gain market share and we're gaining market share. So, even in October so far it's a very short period of time to look at things. Our franchisees are still quite robust. So looking at the next three to six months, we might see some slowdown on the hedge fund side, but the hedge funds are accounting only for 10% which is significant, but it's 10% of our revenues in CIB. And even within the hedge fund side, the two side of our business is done on the business we're dealing with them as clients. So, there might be less hedge funds, yes but we think that we will gain market share, with the ones we will be left.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> it's very difficult for us today to decide that we will trade down our head count because of franchises, if they are very resilient.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you said you're gaining market share, are you gaining it against local investment banks or against foreign investment banks? I mean, is it against <mark type="inaudible" /> or is it against some of the <mark type="inaudible" /> firms?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Two quick follow-up questions. The first one is a quite simple question I had in mind regarding your one-off items book on the different risk-rated assets you have on the balance sheet. I was just wondering what is the impact of the <mark type="inaudible" /> in Q3 on this depreciation? My second question regards your depreciation of &#x20AC;142 million in Corporate Center on your participation. I understand that it is mainly due to your exposure to Dexia and having a look at the evolution of the share price in Q3, roughly the stock went down 20% whereas so far in October, the stock went down almost 50%. Does it mean we have to anticipate two to three times this amount of depreciation in Q4 regarding this exposition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the exposure, just to comment on Dexia, the exposition is limited. There was <mark type="inaudible" /> during the quarter. So, I'm &#x2013; the bulk in fact of the adjustment was more on the other line that I would not comment on which is part of the industrial portfolio. Regarding the impact of the strengthening of the U.S dollar in the third quarter, you know it has an impact of course on the marks but also on the exposures, and that <mark type="inaudible" /> of the <mark type="inaudible" /> it is not moving in a <mark type="inaudible" />. Overall just also to conclude on the industrial portfolio, you have seen in the press release that we continue to have annualized gains which are 90 or &#x20AC;95 million at the end of the quarter. So which also would provide you some comfort on the position of the overall portfolio as of 30th September.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everybody. I have two quick question on my side. The first one is on the CIB recurring revenues, you mentioned 1.7 billion for the quarter and this follows 1.9 billion in Q2 and 1.5 billion in Q1. I just wanted to know whether you would feel comfortable that this 1.7 billion can be recurring will be moving forward? And my second question is on the doubtful loans. So, the doubtful loans have increased by 800 million between Q2 and Q3. Just wanted to know how much of this 800 million comes from acquisition and how much of it comes from the EBITDA relation of the loan book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just before I let Michel answer your first question. In fact, during the quarter, there was a small acquisition in the <mark type="inaudible" /> finance division, but we <mark type="inaudible" /> very limited amounts of loan <mark type="inaudible" />. So as said the evolution is more the movement of the portfolio. And bear in mind also we have some foreign exchange movements, which mean that also the appreciation of the dollar has triggered a certain increase in the NPL as well as in the customer. So this is not to say debt retentions would increase which underlying is very limited and that not highlight any deterioration in Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I think we've commented on the fact that we are confident that our clients <mark type="inaudible" /> remains robust. And hence it's translated in the figures you have in front of you, but that would be very prudent as well. We think that so far, we are seeing some, of course, some slowdown, but at the same time we are gaining market share. Now if the volatility of <mark type="inaudible" /> which is translated into <mark type="inaudible" /> for instance remained at 75 or 80%. You know it's very difficult to predict the &#x2013; what can happen in the future regarding the equity will, but what I think is that, again, our clients contract is robust and we are managing our risk very tightly.</p>

I mean, can we expect potentially a disposal offer be over two portfolios left, and what would the potential impact? The third one is regarding your insurance branches. Did you book any impairment or did you have any impairment test regarding the investment portfolio, or do you consider that's still with the question to be addressed by the end of the year concentrating in the low level of the indexes? We had also <mark type="inaudible" /> of shares, can you comment on that? And finally, you did not commute on monolines. Is that some option, I mean, you would take them in for Q4?</p>

          <p>Okay. Hi, Eric, I would let first Jean-Pierre answer the asset management question. I will take the other four.</p>

          <p>If we have any restructuring charge in Q4 for the asset management side, it could be quite small potentially. I think the bulk should come once the &#x2013; you know have completed the overall process with the representative of the staff, and as I said the project will be submitted in Q1 and it's only once the project has been submitted that we can take a restructuring charge. So expect that more for Q1 than Q4. I mean, Q4 if we have a factual adjustment then there could be some charge but not massive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So regarding your second question on CDOs, we did not discuss into detail the scenarios which are describing the appendices but first of all on the two remaining portfolio of CDOs we have put into place <mark type="inaudible" /> as we have pushed our cumulus for two or five to 11% &#x2013; it was previously 10% and we have also across-the-board increased let's say the population from subprime to prime which was previously 10 prime, was supposed to be 10% of the cumulus of subprime and now we are using 14% looking at the evolution of the <mark type="inaudible" />. So overall this has triggered additional &#x20AC;295 million of marks on the bulk of year two and three. We believe that we are well conservative in this assessment of the evaluation of mark-to-model for and to use. We have also some liquidity add-ons. We have deleted in the appendices of the remaining, let's say underlying assets in these two CDOs. I would say we still wish to have them going forward from that.</p>
          <p>Regarding insurance, we are making <mark type="inaudible" /> liquidity tests on a quarterly basis, which was actually at the end of September. Of course as usual, we will review these at the end of the fourth quarter. The question again &#x2013; the cancellation of shares, which are mentioned in the press release, this is just I would say technical. This means that we are let's say buying shares or we bought share on the market to neutralize for the impact of the <mark type="inaudible" /> and you know that under the share buyback directives and we are <mark type="inaudible" /> compliance, you have 24 months to cancel the share to the start of the first initial acquisition on the market. We are closed from that, so the board yesterday did decide to cancel 10 million shares because of course no impact on the Tier One, on the cash position of the group because of the shares we already deducted from the equity and the Tier One. Last but not least <mark type="inaudible" /> let's say we are not mentioning on that from what I hear and what I read, there was no announcement from monolines internal communication despite let's say what was rumored --  I'm cautious with this word but rumored on the press over the last three months. So we will see when this communication will become real.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I just would like to add something at the end of this two hours which is not financial. Let me just say, from a CEO perspective in such a crisis, the quality, the commitment, the dedication to the clients of the staff is absolutely critical. And let me just say that from that point of view, I personally pay a tribute to what Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is achieving in all our businesses, there is total commitment, solidarity. Rumors will not distract us from our ambitions and objectives and confidence in our business going forward. Thank you very much for your attention. Bye-bye.</p>
