          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon and good morning ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure to be this afternoon with you to discuss the Q3 sales and results of Novartis. I have with me as presenter Raymund Breu, the CFO, and Joe Jimenez, the CEO of our Pharmaceutical business. Then also in the room here and able to answer any questions you might have later on is Joerg Reinhardt, the Chief Operating Officer; David Epstein, the CEO of Novartis Oncology; Jeff George, CEO of Sandoz; George Gunn, CEO of Consumer Health; Trevor Mundel, the Global Head of Development in Pharmaceuticals; and Andrin Oswald, CEO of Vaccines and Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm turning towards the Safe Harbor to be read by John Gilardi.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, John. With that, I'm turning to slide number four. And we see here that sales reached $31.3 billion, an increase of 8% in local currencies. Operating income rose to 7.3 billion, up 11% in constant currencies, excluding exceptional items. And if one looks at these results, one can see that we had a strong underlying growth year to date, which was led really by the pharma double-digit expansion, which we will discuss a little bit later.</p>
          <p>What is also positive I think is the progress we have achieved in innovation; one, with the approval of the anti-cancer therapy Afinitor, which has a lot of promise for additional indications, which we're investigating. We have a large Phase III program underway. Then the new biologic Ilaris, which is approved for a rare indication CAPS for a start, but again we have very promising results in additional indications; the H1N1 pandemic flu vaccines, and the positive Phase III data on QAB where we have received also a positive CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] feedback in Europe, while in the US it will be delayed for a while; and then FTY720 with very positive results. So we are on track for record sales and earnings in constant currencies. And depending on the currencies, we might even make a full year of record results in dollars, but that the future will tell.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number five gives you some details of the P&amp;L, and there I'd just like to point you towards two factors. One is that net income has declined by 8% in dollars. In there, we have really a few one-time items. One is the income from associated companies that Raymund will go into more details later on, the Alcon financing, and then a little bit of a higher tax rate this quarter than we had in the past.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow had a very positive development, and that has also to do with our capital management and inventory management, which we are putting more attention now and in the future than we did see in the recent past.</p>
          <p>Slide number six shows you the performance of individual divisions, Pharma, Vaccines and Diagnostics, Sandoz, and Consumer Health. I'll come back to that, just maybe one word on Vaccines and Diagnostics. You have to be aware that in the previous period, we had still sales of the bird flu and these were not compensated by swine flu sales yet, so these sales will be booked in &#x2013; will occur in the fourth quarter only and not in the third quarter. And then we had low TBE sales or tick-borne encephalitis sales this year, but otherwise this has developed nicely. And I'm very confident that we will in the end have a good year for vaccines, due of course to also the swine flu sales or swine flu vaccines there in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows how successful we have been over an extended period of time in getting approval for new products. And slide number eight gives you a little bit more detail of what we achieved this year in quarter three. You can see Extavia, Tekturna, Valturna, which I think is a promising combination between Rasilez and Diovan, which really offers an opportunity to safeguard a considerable amount of Diovan sales. It's working very well and well tolerated. Then we also got Tacrolimus approval in the US, which allowed among other things to turn around the performance of the Sandoz business in the US, and that was a very welcome development; then in Europe importantly, QAB149 with a positive CHMP recombination, which generally will be followed by a number of other smaller approvals.</p>
          <p>So if you look at slide nine, I think we are well underway in 2009 to deliver on the priorities we had set, and we have a number of products which are in a global rollout mode: Afinitor, Extavia, Lucentis, Rasilez to name the most important ones in Pharma. And then also we have seen a positive trend now in Q3, and hopefully this will continue in Q4 in the consumer businesses where we in that after rather difficult beginning of the year in OTC, now the consumers are buying. And we have with our cough and cold range of course also a good range for the current season.</p>
          <p>We work and we will continue to work very hard to improve our productivity. That is not really an option. It's a must because we will also in the future face some headwinds in pricing in pharmaceutical. But I am confident that we have room for further improvement as to the way we operate.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to hand over to Raymund.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. I can share with you a few data points on non-operational items. I am on slide 11, and I put them into the context of the Q3 numbers, but these elements obviously then apply to the year-to-date numbers as well.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Q3 performance, you can see that the underlying operational performance continues, but that the reported numbers have benefited from effect of currencies. But on top of it, operating income being up 13% has benefited from an exceptional item there. In 2008, we had an impairment of $225 million. If we correct for these exceptional items and if we correct for currencies, then you still have an increase in the operating income of 9%, so clearly a margin improvement even on a corrected basis.</p>
          <p>Net income is only up 1%, and the reason is related to special non-operational factors, which I now can explain on the following slides. On slide 12, you will see the impact from associated companies is fairly negative in the quarter, similarly financial result as well as financial expense. And then the tax rate is up from 14% a year ago to 15.2% in this quarter, and the 15.2% is our current estimate for the full-year tax rate as well.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you see where the deterioration in associated income is coming from, related to two special events. One in the Roche contribution, we had to account for the Genentech restructuring in dollar share and the one-time Genentech restructuring expense was 97 million. Similarly in the associated income from Alcon, we had to impair an intangible to the tune of 92 million, since Alcon has decided not to continue the development of this R&amp;D project called retail.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, we give you the breakdown of the financial result. The swing to a 122 million expense is explained: one, by a lower income. Income is down 27%. And this is a result of much reduced yields in the financial markets given the very low interest rate environment, so the average yield here was 1.7%. The second fact, the interest expense is significantly higher at 129 million, up 47%. And this is a result of the US dollar and euro bond financing that we did in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Then I am moving to slide 15. We have indicated that we will switch to core EPS with the full-year results of 2009. Why are we now intending to change the focus of the presentation? Two reasons: one, it will allow the shareholders and you to have a better insight into the underlying performance of the group. And secondly, we feel that this makes our numbers more comparable to what our large pharmaceutical peers report already.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, we give you an indication for Q3 what the major adjustments will be and have been in Q3. We will adjust for amortization of intangibles. We will adjust for impairments or write-offs. Further, we will adjust for acquisition related restructuring and integration expenses; and then for exceptional items, but only if they exceed a threshold of 25 million. Typical items would be litigation provisions or exceptional settlements or other restructuring expenses. Finally, the various items will be corrected in the associated income lines. Amortization, impairments, and restructuring expenses will be adjusted there as well. In the appendix to the slide presentation, you will find restated numbers for all quarters of 2009 and for the fourth quarter &#x2013; for all quarters of 2008. So that when we will go into the fourth quarter reporting the full-year result report, you'll be able update all your models to the new basis.</p>
          <p>Finally on slide 17, you see the impact or the comparison of core EPS to reported EPS. Operating income would be approximately 325 million higher when we only look at core operating income. And net income, core net income would be 567 million higher in the quarter or 26% higher than reported operating income since we have significant amounts for amortization and impairments and exceptional expenses.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand over to Joe Jimenez for Pharmaceutical.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Raymund. So, starting slide 19, the Pharma division had a good third quarter. So I think we're executing well on the new launches and this is driving our top line. Our cost savings efforts are driving operating income ahead of sales, and we had some very strong pipeline news in the third quarter, which I'll talk about in a minute.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 shows our net sales in the third quarter, 7.2 billion, which is up 11% versus year ago in local currency. The op-inc up 27% in US dollars, but as stated earlier by Raymund, this was inflated due to a suppressed base. So if you take out the charge that we had a year ago and currency, our organic operating income was up 16%, still well ahead of the 11% sales growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 shows that our sales remain at the top of the industry as measured by IMS. This is driven by the new product launches, but it's also due to a solid base business. Most of the compounds are up mid to high single-digit growth.</p>
          <p>If you look at 22, our strength continues to be broad based across all therapeutic areas. Among the fastest growing is neuroscience and ophthalmics behind Lucentis. In the third quarter, our Lucentis business was up 60% versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>Twenty-three shows that the new launches are steadily becoming a larger percentage of our portfolio total. So in the third quarter, they were 18% of our total sales and reached 1.3 billion in total sales. These launches, as shown on the next slide, are really helping us to jump start growth in what has previously been some stagnant countries such as Japan. You can see here the level of new launch activity in 2009. It's leading to IMS sales up almost 11% versus year ago in Japan. And in 2010, we have a number of launches planned, which will be important because we do face the biannual price cut in Japan in 2010.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows our hypertension franchise and we continue to perform very well. I think the third quarter shows that our plan to shift the portfolio away from Diovan is working. So this franchise in the third quarter was up 8% versus year ago, and that's despite the fact that Diovan growth was only 2% in the quarter. So we are continuing to shift sales and marketing resources towards Tekturna, Tekturna HCT, Valturna, and Exforge as Exforge has date exclusivity far beyond the Diovan patent expiration in certain regions of the world.</p>
          <p>Our cost savings efforts are shown on 26. They have really been critical to our margin improvement. So to date, we've generated over 700 million in savings, and this is primarily through procurement and marketing and sales.</p>
          <p>On slide 27, I want to remind you of the three growth drivers that will help us get through the Diovan patent expiration: the current launches, the late-stage pipeline, and emerging growth markets. Since we have so much news around the pipeline, I'd like to spend some time talking about that.</p>
          <p>So on slide 28 starting with Tasigna; this week we released top line results of the Tasigna-Glivec head-to-head trial. This was the largest head-to-head trial among newly diagnosed patients in CML [Chronic Myeloid Leukemia]. And we're very excited that we met the primary endpoint and delivered significantly faster and deeper major molecular response. So we're going to be releasing the full data at ASH [American Society of Hematology] in New Orleans in December.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows that our two-year Phase III study on FTY delivered very encouraging results. If you look at the charts, the 0.5 milligram dose delivered a 54% reduction in relapse rate and a 30% reduction in disability progression. But probably more importantly, the 0.5 milligram dose had a safety profile that looks very good, so we're very encouraged by that.</p>
          <p>Slide 30, we were, as Dan said earlier, pleased to receive positive CHMP opinion for both doses. So right now, I'll tell you that the European operation is preparing for launch once we get the EMEA [European Medicines Agency] approval, and that will begin in 2010. And while we did receive the complete response by the FDA, we had I think previously said we did not expect first round approval. And we will be working with the FDA to do what required to get QAB approved in the US because this is a very powerful bronchodilator with a very good safety profile.</p>
          <p>Slide 31 shows that we also had very positive Phase II results for ACZ in gout versus standard of care, which is an injectable corticosteroid. We had better efficacy, faster onset, and importantly over a 90% reduction in the risk of flare recurrence. So the other important point here is that there are over 3 million patients with chronic, difficult to treat gout who could eventually benefit from ACZ once approved.</p>
          <p>And then finally, we recently announced two in-licensing opportunities. The first is iloperidone under the name Fanapt. This is already approved in the US for the treatment of schizophrenia. We will launch in early 2010 and this is a US and Canadian license. And then also PTK 0796, which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with both IV and oral form, and we will be launching post 2012. This is a good complement to our current pipeline of antibiotics.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, we're executing well. We are strengthening the pipeline, and we now expect double-digit sales growth for the full year 2009.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back over to Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Joe. Sandoz, if you look at slide number 35, had in third quarter which was in line sales-wise with Q1 and Q2 in local currencies. And you can see that retail and biosimilar sales in the US we had a clear improvement, which I mentioned earlier. More importantly, I think we were able to slightly increase the number of the approvals, which is critical in business. And I'm sure that the EBEWE acquisition adds here potential as we are not only strengthening the injectable line and the oncology line, but also have a strong pipeline which is waiting there.</p>
          <p>We were pleased that the FDA re-inspection of the plant in Wilson was without any complaint and passed there. And in order to make up for price pressures, which Sandoz is under as a generic manufacturer; we look at about 8 to 9% price decreases per annum. Productivity programs are crucial and our program COMPETE is leading to very good numbers.</p>
          <p>Consumer health, there three businesses: OTC, CIBA Vision, and Animal Health saw a very saw a very strong third quarter. In OTC, we have the momentum of cough and cold. CIBA Vision doing very well also in the US market, we're gaining market share. And Animal Health had a US performance in Aqua business which was strong.</p>
          <p>The US will of course have a deep influence in the fourth quarter and in the near future with the Prevacid launch. It's first once-a-day pill which covers really 24 hours of heartburn. And positive is the three-year Hatch-Waxman marketing exclusivity which has been granted. So we have a chance to really make Prevacid 24HR a top-five OTC brand in the US</p>
          <p>Now Vaccines and Diagnostics, I'll just talk about vaccines. We were of course confronted with a massive demand. The demand exceeds our production capacity by far, certainly in the short term. But we were also confronted, as others in the industry, with a strain, seed strain which had very low yields, about 22% of a normal influenza yield, and so the overall volume we were able to produce was somewhat constrained.</p>
          <p>But we started to ship in the US and in Europe. We also started to ship MF59 to various countries, so either in a finished form or separate depending on the country. And we continue to produce at very high intensity in all of our sites in the UK, in Germany, and in Italy. And in fact, we have transferred almost 300 employees from other divisions to help out in manufacturing in vaccines, so we could increase the volumes and produce seven days a week.</p>
          <p>We received FDA approval on September 15 for Fluvirin in the US and in the EU for Focetria on September 29. We anticipate that for our new cell based product, we will get approval in Q4. Here it is not very clear when exactly, but we are fairly confident that in Q4 this will happen.</p>
          <p>Quite large trials still ongoing; over 8,000 subjects are still involved in clinical trials. But what has become very clear from the first results is that even with one injection, you can get a very good coverage, over 70% positive response rates. And even with low doses of 3.75 micrograms in adults up to age 50 roughly and after age 10, you get a very good response. In the elderly, you need a little bit higher dose when it's augmented with MF59, which is also &#x2013; a government can vaccinate many more people than if they use an augmented vaccine.</p>
          <p>Overall, we expect the year, and I'm on slide 40 now, to be a good year for Novartis overall, reaching hopefully record results, not only in constant currencies. We have a number of products which were launched or where we have received positive feedback. And I don't want to omit that in vaccines, we have Menveo, which is hopefully going to get approval in the first quarter of 2010. So that will also be a very important product to have less cyclical sales in this division.</p>
          <p>Productivity efforts will continue to go on in 2010 and beyond. And of course, we are looking, like Joe has mentioned, to increase dynamically the sales of new products to anticipate the patent losses we will see after 2012. Of course these products will not go to zero. We have still hundreds of millions in sales of Neoral and Voltaren. And on the other side of course the life will be in innovation.</p>
          <p>Slide 41 summarizes our outlook for 2009. The big swing factor in the quarter for the H1N1 sales and I'm sure we will come back to that question a little bit later when we open the Q&amp;A, which in fact I would like to do right now.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Mr. Tim Anderson, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you, a couple of questions please. On the recent FDA decision on indacaterol, I guess I have some concerns that this represents something that seems to be happening with Novartis in the US too often, which is that in an effort to get to market quickly, you're not delivering what FDA wants. And in the case of indacaterol, I think that abbreviated Phase II trial looks like it could jeopardize the timing of various combination products, which then ends up backfiring on that initial speed to market approach. I'm wondering if you can give any perspective on your approach to this sort of thing in the US.</p>
          <p>The second question is on R&amp;D spending. And really longer term, I'm wondering if and when Novartis might give some form of guidance on what long-term R&amp;D spending might look like, given that as a percent of revenues you spend a fair bit more than your peers when looking at the pharma P&amp;L. I'm wondering if that's the sort of thing that might be delineated more clearly once Jon Symonds comes on board.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Trevor Mundel. Indacaterol so just to refresh our minds on the situation, we have the positive opinion from the CHMP in September for indacaterol, so this was approved in 10 months at both of the submitted doses, 150 and 300, which was somewhat of a record in the recent past few years for an approval, so really looking at a very good profile in terms of risk and benefit. We now have the complete response at 10 months of review in the US. We have indicated previously, as you know, that the cycle in the US has taken an average of 18 months, so this was to some extent not unexpected. We now have the standard process. We have to negotiate what is data package that would address some of the concerns around dosing, and that will be negotiated in the next couple of months.</p>
          <p>We do have some ongoing clinical studies, quite a few of them which could actually comprise that data package but that would be at the negotiation. So I think that I can give you a further update towards the end of the year in the situation in the US. I don't think that it is a generalizable circumstance. The Phase II study that you referenced was a study that we had pre-agreed in terms of its design with the FDA. So we will look at the data package is and we will get back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you fairly confident that they're not going to make you look at a 75 milligram dose in the usual Phase II sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, the negotiation will be around the current data that we have and this new data that we've not yet submitted to them. So I wouldn't want to speculate before we've had that discussion as to what exactly the outcome would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, regarding the R&amp;D question, this is Joe. We've said previously that for the foreseeable future, we want to keep R&amp;D spending as a percent of sales very close to where it is, so around 20% of sales in the Pharma division. Now we know that that is at the high end of the range, but we also know that the productivity of our &#x2013; and you can see it by our launches that what we're getting out of that pipeline is substantial. So that doesn't mean that we won't increase productivity in R&amp;D. We will, but we will reinvest that money in new ideas like iloperidone, like PTK. There are a number of ways that we can strengthen the pipeline while improving productivity, but maintaining a high level, a relatively high level of spend.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, Joe, I would like to say instead of spend, I would use the word investment. It's really an investment in the future and we know unless we do that, we will not have the results afterwards.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon gentlemen; two questions, one on products and then one on Vaccines and Diagnostics. Regarding products in Pharma, Q3 seemed to be an inflection point for the growth of three. Diovan in the US and Glivec ex-US both seemed to see a marked reduction in that growth rate from previous quarters, whereas Lucentis obviously saw a mild uptick having had stable growth rates of around 40%. It has now let up to 60%. Can you walk us through each of those product dynamics in those geographies and explain why we saw that step change in growth?</p>
          <p>And then regarding Vaccines and Diagnostics, clearly at the moment, the business is on the cusp of profitability. And we now have this very large arrival of the pandemic flu revenue in the fourth quarter and rolling into Q1 next year. Raymund, can you give us some help in terms of how to model that in terms of the margins we should anticipate on that business?  How many of the costs have already been taken because manufacturing is ongoing, and therefore what will the profitability be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with the Pharma products and specifically Diovan in the US, we did see a softening of Diovan in the US, but it's a function of two things. The first is the recession in the US is leading to more switching we believe to generic ACEs [Angiotensin Converting Enzyme] and CCBs [Calcium Channel Blocker]. So Diovan within the ARB [Angiotensin Receptor Blockers] category is maintaining share, but total ARBs are quite soft because of that switching.</p>
          <p>But the second and more important point is that we are pulling resources off of Diovan and putting them on. I'm talking about sales in marketing resources on Tekturna, Tekturna HCP, Valturna, in a way in the US that will prepare for the eventual patent exploration of Diovan. If you think back two years ago, who would have thought that we could generate 11% top line sales growth with Diovan globally only contributing two points? And to me it's quite encouraging that the strategy that we've embarked upon of shifting resources to the new products is helping. So we're not happy with where Diovan is, but we're pleased that from a total hypertension franchise, we're growing and we're gaining share.</p>
          <p>Regarding Glivec, you really have to look at Glivec year-to-date sales ex-US or even globally to get the best predictor of its organic growth rate, and that's about 12%. So we did in the third quarter see growth of only 6% on Glivec, but it was almost 100% driven by the timing of some tenders that occurred in a couple of key emerging markets. So we don't believe that there is any fundamental issue with Glivec.</p>
          <p>And then Lucentis is just firing on all cylinders. I think we've got this thing figured out in that from a disease awareness campaign standpoint that we have going on in a number of countries together with helping retina specialists with the layout of their clinics so that they can improve the flow of patients, and then together with innovative pricing schemes that we've been able to put in place in Europe to ensure rapid and full reimbursement. So those three things are working together to really drive nice growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have one quick follow-on, which maybe is better to take before Raymund comments on vaccines. Regarding Diovan, given the accelerated generic switching that you highlighted, how do you envisage those trends changing when we have generic COZAAR at the beginning of next year?  Is that going to accelerate that decline or what plans do you have in place to account for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think that when generics COZAAR comes, there will be an impact on Diovan. I also think though that the switching that we're seeing to generics today is largely driven by the recession in the US. So I would say that long term or depending on how long you think the recession is going to last, that part might become mitigated. But I do think it would be fair to say that you should expect that when COZAAR goes generic in April that there would be an acceleration of that Diovan decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on the question on vaccine profitability, you have to understand that I am not in a position to give you an outlook on the gross margin of the H1N1 business. All I can say is the following. Obviously the fixed cost of the production or the fixed cost of the selling efforts has already been spent. Now the cost that we have for the production, the variable costs and so on, that's currently keeping in inventory. And depending on when this inventory will be sold, the dropped price will then have an impact on the profitability for the period. It will be in our expectation of a profitable business, but I cannot at this point and I don't think I shall give you guidance on the gross margin that you could expect. But it will clearly elevate the profitability of vaccines and develop a much higher level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe to build on what Raymund has said, one needs also to take into account the pricing variations which we have. Andrin, would you say two or three words about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so I think we expect to produce 100 million doses by the end of the year, despite the very low yield. And I think we earlier said before by Daniel and the demand is outpacing that, so we plan clearly to sell these 100 million doses. And the prices vary quite widely, between 8 to $20. Especially countries who have ordered small volumes and who have ordered late, they of course have higher prices than countries who have ordered first.</p>
          <p>Overall for Q4, the current best estimate is that we would have sales of $600 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that has some variation because?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of the volume will be coming in December because this has been the better and the new seed strain that we use now for production will hit in, and we will see a lot of volume being shipped in December. And of course the biologics and because of the quality release that can always take one or two weeks more or less, very quickly you move a bit of this volume over into January. And because it's high volume, we will see there some variation at the end of the year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Jeff Holford, Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jeff Holford here. You've been highlighting in your presentation this afternoon the new product growth that you have, how your productivity efforts are running ahead of schedule and also some of the reinvestment opportunities that you have. Now this gives you some flexibility on this; if you can just give us a bit more detail on how you're thinking to manage during the period of slowing, negative Diovan sales and the prospects Diovan follows, how you're thinking about that flexibility to maintain margins and bottom line growth.</p>
          <p>And then as a second question, there were some comments on the wires today regarding Nestl&#xE9; and Alcon, more specifically about timing of a potential portion in the cash payments. I wonder if you can just run through this, how you understand that from your side with any financing commitments and the timing they would be. And also I'd just invite any comments that you might have on the options you think you got open to you to deal with the potential minority that might be left in that instance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with the allocation of resources, if you look at our productivity for the year to date, we've delivered about 700 million, just over 700 million of savings. And if you take our sales of 11% and say no margin increase, we'd be 11% op-inc. But then you add the productivity onto that number. That would take you to about 22% op-inc growth, but we reported 16. So the 16 points of growth represents essentially half of the productivity that was generated in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>And that investment was around the same three areas that I talked about earlier that will drive growth in a post-Diovan period. The first is new launches, so invested about two of the six points in new launches, ensuring that we have strong marketing and sales programs. We invested another two points in the pipeline, specifically around oncology and the Afinitor multi-indication development program that will help us in that post-Diovan period. And then we invested about two points in the emerging markets, specifically China and Russia and some element of Turkey.</p>
          <p>So I think if you were to think of that as an algorithm, that's just year to date; and I'm not telling you anything that you couldn't figure out by looking at our numbers. But if you were to say that that algorithm would help us over the next three to five years continue to show margin improvement but continue to take a portion of the productivity and invest it in those key drivers that will get us through the Diovan patent expiration, that's really what we're focused on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Alcon, we of course also read the wires, and we read the same comment. And since you never know what is really reported and what was said, there is little we can comment nor do we want to comment on it. It's really something Nestl&#xE9; may have said or not said; I don't know.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you know our option. We have a call option which runs for 1.5 years starting January 1, 2010. There's a put option starting at the same time and lasting for the same period. So future will tell what will happen. Frankly I don't &#x2013; I can't and I don't want to comment further. But maybe, Raymund, do you want to say something about financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of financing, our plans are that we would pay for it with cash and additional financing. Currently we are under no pressure to pre-finance or raise financing because the markets for interest rates seem to be fairly stable. And as a result, obviously we are monitoring this. But I would assume that at the moment we have &#x2013; all I can say is at the moment we have no plans to raise additional money in advance of a potential transaction. I think this can change very quickly, so it depends on market conditions.</p>
          <p>The final point, you asked about the minority. We currently have no intention of purchasing or buying out the third-party minority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to be clear, on the comment that may or may not have been made, is it your understanding that there's essentially approximately a six-month period from a potential put to acquiring cash from you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This second step is &#x2013; actually, the second step of the Alcon transaction would trigger a review by the antitrust authorities in the US, in Europe, so we would have the normal antitrust review, period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Andrew Baum, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, three questions if I may. First, you gave the long-term guidance on R&amp;D spend between each invest in your business. Could you give us some sense on SG&amp;A spend within pharma over that period of time? And then with regard to the quarter, to what extent the lower SG&amp;A spend is a function of phasing versus something that's structural?</p>
          <p>And then second on the lower gross margin in the quarter, should I assume that's just a function of mix, particularly the lower Glivec and Diovan contribution, or are there other contributing factors going on?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is on your CML franchise. How are you thinking about the risk to your 100% market share for first-line CML with the <mark type="inaudible" /> coming over the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with SG&amp;A, I think what we have said and if you just think about marketing and selling expense and you look at the third quarter, we showed about 140 basis point improvement versus a year ago. So it was 27.4%; I think it was 27.4, but it was definitely a 140 basis point improvement. That is a function of investment in the new products, but also significant productivity that is occurring among the base brands. And we're doing that through a very systematic way of looking at our investment in marketing and sales, at least in the US on a physician-by-physician basis, and outside the US on a BRIC basis, so that we ensure that we are allocating those resources in the way that we'll get the most bang for the dollar or the euro.</p>
          <p>So I think our stated objective was to take our marketing and sales number which started out over 30% a couple of years ago and continued to show improvement. This quarter was in the mid 27s. I think it was &#x2013; we typically have a heavier spend in the fourth quarter. Usually 27 to 28% of our total spend occurs in the fourth quarter. So you may not see it, you may see a little bit of a return there, but for the full year you should expect to see steady improvement because it is an area of focus. And I wouldn't go beyond just saying that we're continuing to drive that marketing and sales ratio as a percent of sales down.</p>
          <p>Regarding the gross margin, it's not mix, it's actually the fact that Betaseron royalties ended at the beginning of this year. So versus a year ago there were no Betaseron royalties in there versus year to date, we're down about 100 basis points, but that's primarily a function of the summer period where we produced less because of vacations in Europe. If you look historically year on year, our production cost as a percent of sales go up in the third quarter and it's because of spreading fixed costs across less physical production. So I think hopefully that answers your question that really it's the Betaseron royalties that's driving that difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David would you want to comment on the CML franchise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, just a couple numbers to put things in perspective. About 75% of the Glivec/Tasigna franchise is CML. The other 25% is primarily just &#x2013; within the CML franchise, we have about 92% market share and that's a combination of Glivec and Tasigna. The introduction of Tasigna and actually Sprycel in the second-line setting has expanded the overall market as patients have stayed on therapy longer. And thus you see the 15% year-to-date growth for the combined franchise.</p>
          <p>The clinical trial that we ran, the head-to-head trial in de novo CML we are particularly pleased with. The results are striking. You will see more of the data at the American Society of Hematology meeting, and the data is more than just NMR [Nuclear Magnetic Resonance] data. There are a series of secondary endpoints that I think will put into perspective for physicians and patients why Tasigna is going to become the preferred therapy in that setting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Just firstly on the vaccines, could you just give us an update on how many government orders you've actually received? You talked about 100 million you're shipping by year end or earlier if everything works well. We know you have 100 million doses ordered from the US alone, so what are your orders from non-US governments? Also when are you going to ship the bulk of the orders you have from the US? Is that going to be a next- year event?</p>
          <p>Could you also comment on where the price pressure is coming from you're referring to at all for seasonal vaccine? What we're hearing is that there is not enough seasonal flu vaccine around because all manufacturers have had yield problems.</p>
          <p>Then I have a couple of questions &#x2013; two questions on the pipeline. Firstly, is the delay of the QVA combinations, the Phase III study, is that related to your complete response for QAB and therefore we don't know whether it's a first or a second half initiation? And the other question is on Ilaris. What type of Phase III studies will you do for this and actually when can you start them?</p>

          <p>The easy question goes to Andrin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to government orders, we have orders now for about 200 million doses, but one has to take orders with a word of caution of course because it will depend mostly also on how the pandemic is going to evolve in the next year and to what extent there will be a need for vaccinations one to twelve. And there are governments now that hope they can complete the vaccination programs by December, and there are governments who clearly feel that they would vaccinate way into 2010. And what is going to prevail will really depend on the evolution of the pandemic and the epidemiology that is underlying that.</p>
          <p>With regards to price pressure in seasonal flu, of course the price pressure has changed once the pandemic fully materialized. But by that time in many major markets, the prices had already been fixed. Especially in the US, the majority of our volume is defined actually in the first quarter of the year, so we saw a significant price decline there simply because of that. Now during the pandemic there we had freedom. Prices went up clearly in the US. In Europe, not so much; there were still several suppliers that are not producing pandemic vaccines, and so we're actually shipping quite significant volumes into that market.</p>

          <p>Yes, in terms of QVA, so the delay in QVA from 2011 to 2012 is actually not very long. It's really a couple of months. And the factors over there have been that we did want to understand the implications of the dosing for that program because we had initiated a program with our desire to really have a global program where we had similarity of doses across all the regions. The NVA component of that program which is the <mark type="inaudible" /> by region or component is moving ahead, on track as we planned.</p>
          <p>As far as Ilaris goes, the 3 million difficult to treat gout patients that Joe had referred to are our target and there are a couple of ways to segment that population. The first focus is going to be the treatment of acute flares in these patients who have frequent recurrences of gout. And that Phase III program in now underway. We would look at submissions very end of 2010 or 2011 across the different gout indications that we're looking at, but that was the first one that we reviewed.</p>

          <p>Daniel, can I just follow up quickly?  When you said it is related to the dosing, so if for some reason your dosing discussions with the FDA extend for longer, then that would push out the QVA Phase III initiation also out. Is that correct as I'm understanding?</p>

First with full consideration and respect for the disclosure limitations for the ASH meeting, could you say a word on the safety profile for Tasigna in the head-to-head trial versus Glivec?  Second question, on your last but one slide, Daniel, you said that you expect to mitigate to a 12th part in expiries, but not offset it.

There were three arms, Glivec 400, Tasigna at two different doses, the 400 milligram BID dose, which is the current dose for advanced patients. And there was also a lower dose of 300 milligrams BID. I can't distinguish on the phone call for you the safety profile because it really needs to be presented at ASH; otherwise we would jeopardize the late-breaker presentation. What I can tell you is we were very pleased with the safety profile. And the fact that there are two different doses could lead to a range of safety depending upon the ultimate dose that is selected to be used. But overall, there were no negative surprising findings.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the question &#x2013; I should have a second Safe Harbor statement now because what I'm going to say is of course highly speculative. But I would say looking at Pharma sales, I would hope that the ambition of Pharma is not to have a decline. It will succeed, and my hope is not based without figures, so it's at least feasible.</p>
          <p>The second question on EPS I don't want really to answer, but if Pharma succeeds to achieve that, then there is no reason that the other divisions wouldn't be doing well and continue to grow and deliver their profits. And then we have some unknown factors currently which are the question will Nestl&#xE9; and Novartis close the deal or not. And all of that are uncertainty factors which play a role and which make the answer a little bit tricky. But all I can tell you, the ambition is here, the means are here, and so I'm really personally optimistic.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, a couple of questions if I may. Dan, could you give us your sense of the net impact of what you believe healthcare reform will be in the US on your business over the course of let's say the next three or four years rather than just 2010. We have some sense I think of what the legislation is likely to be. It would be helpful for us to get a sense of how you think that Pharma business may move forward in the context of those proposals.</p>
          <p>And secondly on emerging markets, what proportion of your emerging markets Pharma business is tender based? And so how often that we're going to get these little surprises that make it hard to follow what's actually happening quarter on quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would ask Joe to comment really on the impact on the Pharma business. I will just give you my view on healthcare reform overall on the process. First of all, I think what we have seen is that it has been a debate about access first, not about really cost containment because frankly I think it's an illusion to believe that the increase of access will result in cost containment. It will continue to grow and maybe even accelerate in the short term. And that of course will be helped by the concessions the Pharma industry made, but that will not suffice to neutralize the effects.</p>
          <p>The big question in my view is will we stay where we are or will government do what I think should be done, which is to understand much more deeply in a more granular way how patients are being treated, what prevention programs should look like. If you think of obesity and diabetes as a consequence, if the incentive systems for physicians in hospitals are being changed, are they more for outcomes rather than just volume. And there are a number of things I think which could be done to really slow the increase significantly of the overall bill.</p>
          <p>On pharmaceuticals, I believe it's recognized by most people that pharmaceuticals do improve the outcome, that they are cost effective, that they are a contributor which is absolutely irreplaceable. The fact on the other side is also that generics have volumes to over 60% now. And so the question is to what degree or what volume is innovation versus generic going to be. And now the question is in bottom line, what does it mean sales and profit-wise in the pharmaceutical business; so I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our take on what's happening in the US is that there will be a bill enacted and that it will look a lot like the Senate Finance Committee bill. So the agreement that the pharma industry has made will be delivered upon and that's higher Medicaid rebates. It's covering 50% of the donut hole as well as the prescription manufacturers' fee that got it to that 80 billion.</p>
          <p>So I think the implication for us is that we have to think about: number one, the US can continue to be a growth area, but we're going to have to think about our cost structure probably in a different way. As you know, almost now a year ago, we moved our sales force into a regional structure that allows much better and precise resource allocation on a market-by-market basis as individual markets in the US become more restrictive. So still a large number of open markets but as they become more restrictive, we're going to need to be able to react from a resource allocation standpoint in a way that allows us to show steady margin improvement despite the healthcare reform and what that will &#x2013; the pressure that that will put on prices.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of emerging markets, we have in the past seen times like this in emerging markets in terms of lumpiness of sales due to tenders. It tends to really be the large government tenders, which generally would be Russia. There are very few large government tenders in China, almost none in Turkey and Korea. But when we do get let's say a large government purchase of Glivec in one or two of the countries, you're going to see some level of lack of smoothness in terms of shipments.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Graham Parry, Banc of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Just as a quick follow-up on the gross margin question from earlier, you talked about Betaseron revenues, but also the cut ratio looks a little worse in the quarter, so I was just wondering if you could talk us through any moving parts on that as well.</p>
          <p>The second one for David on Tasigna; I'm trying to tempt you a bit further into commenting on safety. The key challenge for this drug in the first-line setting is going to be whether it's actually better from a safety point of view than Glivec or not. I'm just wondering if you could give us a generic comment whether you believe the safety aspects are the same worse than Glivec in the front line setting.</p>
          <p>And then for Trevor on Ilaris in gout, I'm just wondering if you expect this to be dosed on a frequent basis or only on occurrence of flares ultimately. And on pricing, it's a very expensive product currently at about $16,000 per dose. How are you thinking about pricing in these longer term indications?</p>
          <p>And then finally one on Sandoz, I just wondered if your recent settlements on ADDERALL XR and  SOLODYN suggest that your philosophy on settling patent litigations shifted at all? Was there something unique about those situations? Did it change your thoughts on the first-to-file changes on Galaxin?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with gross margin, Graham, if you look at our gross margin this third quarter versus year ago, the entire difference, it's about a 100 basis point reduction, is due to Betaseron royalties coming out. So, Betaseron royalties used to show up in other revenue, so below the revenue line. And so it directly impacted the gross margin versus year ago when it came out.</p>
          <p>Now versus Q2, if you look at our gross margin, there was a similar 100 basis point reduction in gross margin, but that was solely due to volume, meaning the summer shutdown that occurs and that occurs every year. So if you go back to previous years and look Q2 versus Q3, you will see an erosion of the gross margin because of that timing of that volume production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Tasigna, David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly one of the reasons we studied two different doses of Tasigna was our speculation that the lower dose may have efficacy that's similar, but that the side effect profile would be better. So I think this is one of the key things that we'll have to look at when the data is unblinded.</p>
          <p>Just to remind you in the advanced setting, Tasigna had a very different side effect profile than Glivec. In particular, Tasigna is not associated with edema. It does not have the same severity of hematologic toxicity. And in fact, the GI safety was slightly better. So there is no reason to believe that in the front line setting, Tasigna will be worse. In fact, we would expect it actually to better and represent a different kind of benefit to the risk profile.</p>
          <p>The one concern that we have had originally with Tasigna, which has been largely mitigated now with taking the drug without meals, was the potential for QT effects in the event that in there had been a certain small number of sudden deaths reported in the clinical trial. I can tell you that there are no sudden deaths in the de novo head-to-head study. I can't comment any further than that though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as far as Ilaris goes, we're talking here about the moderate to severe population. And because of the different circumstances, whether you work in the context of urate-lowering therapy or acute flares, there might be some different dosing strategies over there. The studies I was talking about around acute flares would be treating the flares, though the precise regimen would emerge out of the Phase III program. As we said in the Phase II study we saw in the moderate to severe patients, these patients were experiencing upwards of seven flares a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And pricing, obviously we're looking to the volume and pricing flexibility we have so that it is an attractive treatment for the patients overall. Then we have Jeff if you please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with respect to the minocycline launch at risk, we did settle with Medicis, as you alluded to. We thought that made sense given the risk/return profile. Our basic patent settlement strategy has not changed. I would say that perhaps we are taking a slightly more aggressive stance in terms of launches at risk, particularly where we feel that patents are not infringed. So we'll continue to look for unique first-to-file opportunities where we can take a more aggressive stance.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, two questions if I may and maybe a third on generics. But just firstly on Fanapt, perhaps you could just talk us through what you think the commercial potential of such a product might be and how you're going to position it against the incumbents.</p>
          <p>And then secondly in terms of Animal Health, I'm just trying to understand in the context of consumer healthcare, given M&amp;A activity in the area so far to date, whether that changes your view in terms of needing to bulk that up or perhaps no longer consider it a core part of consumer healthcare and your strategy there. And then just lastly, can you update us if there is any news to be added around generic Lovenox?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with Fanapt, actually Trevor, why don't you talk about the profile of the compound; then I'll jump on the commercial opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think in general in the atypical antipsychotics except maybe with the exception of Clozaril, all part, the efficacy is somewhat similar and Fanapt falls into that category. So a lot of the differentiations around it safety profile, particularly in the area of agonism and abnormal movements. In that area I think that Fanapt compares very favorably with some of the market leaders like Dilantin. That's the key profile. Also it has an interesting avenue to a deeper formulation, which we are taking on board, and there are some intrinsic technical reasons why we think we'd have a very favorable depot forming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and so just in terms of how we would position this, obviously similar efficacy, but a better tolerability profile on certain elements. And if you look at the US, schizophrenia is a $5 billion market, total antipsychotics 14 billion. Within schizophrenia, there is a lot of switching that goes on across a number of brands. So it would be premature to really give a sales forecast because we are right now building the field force that will sell Fanapt, and we are getting ready for an early 2010 launch. But framing it in about a 5 billion market where we expect to get a small piece of that would be appropriate.</p>

          <p>So on in enoxaparin, our aspiration of course is to launch as soon as we can, but we are waiting on a ruling from the FDA on two outstanding Citizens Petitions and hope that will be resolved soon, shortly.</p>
          <p>With respect to the USP monographs, the new heparin USP monograph, you see the fact that on October 1, we've confirmed the easy expectations there. The new enoxaparin USP monograph will be effective design as I understand it December 1 and we don't see that as an impediment to launch. Lastly, I would just say that all four of our Chinese heparin suppliers have been inspected in China by the FDA and have been cleared for use in our enoxaparin filing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. I have one relating to generics. Now I understand that when it comes to complex follow-on biologics, pharmaceuticals will be strongly involved in at least the marketing if not the development. Now I was wondering whether you could talk a little bit about how we should think about this. From a divisional P&amp;L point of view, who books sales, who absorbs which charges, et cetera?</p>
          <p>And then the second question if I may, this bout that you have for the priority review, have you made a decision where you would use that? I know in the past you said that you would not use that on the FTY720. But considering the competitive landscape, has that view changed?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I would like &#x2013; maybe, Joe, do you want to say something about who book sales and who books profit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously when you think about follow-on biologics and you look at the compounds and the potential, we want to make sure that we maximize the opportunity. So if there is a follow-on biologic that within the Pharma system would demand the kind of attention and get the kind of the attention from the country commercial organization, then obviously it would make sense to have the Pharma organization commercialize that and potentially help with the development. But if you look at the vast majority of follow-on biologics, they're going fall probably within a range that may not get the same kind of attention that we need to make them successful. And in that sense, there would be a big opportunity for the Sandoz organization to build out an operation that could handle those compounds. Jeff, do you want to add on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would just agree with that, Joe. I think in 80 &#x2013; 90% of the cases, biosimilars and FOBs make sense within Sandoz. Certainly if there is a 505(j) AB substituted product, it makes sense that Sandoz would commercialize that with the key account team that we have. In cases where there are B2s, where pharma has expertise in a particular therapeutic area, it makes sense for us to discuss how we commercialize that. And we're certainly not looking to rebuild capabilities that we may already have.</p>
          <p>In other areas for example in omnitrope and pediatric endocrinology, the pharma capabilities, we're not huge in that area, and this was not a sufficiently large opportunity. So we made this decision at the time to build out under Sandoz a team of key account folks and people calling, also detailing pediatric endocrinologists for both managed care as well as GP detailing, and that business is really picking up. So we're seeing Q3 76% growth of biosimilars which for year to date puts us at about 68% growth. So we continue to see nice progress. But as Joe mentioned, in certain cases, perhaps in multiple sclerosis and other areas, we will partner with Pharma on the development and commercialization.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. Koch, of course I understand the question that you would like to separate. But in our case, we have said we don't want to start a new accounting annual for sorting that out but rather taking really a simplistic approach, and we are in the same group with the same shareholders. And also keep in mind that we have a number of countries which are operating under this group, emerging countries where we put all the businesses really under one head. And we optimize the sales, so we need to have a pragmatic approach. And luckily we are working well to get as a team, and it hasn't brought up any issues or disputes. I would like to give you a clear factor, but we don't buy it.</p>

Could you please go through the major markets and tell us what the market shares are for Lucentis versus off-label Avastin?  You mentioned that the UK, France and Japan were doing well, but I just would like to get a little bit more color on that.</p>
          <p>Also what is your view on the timing and the potential impact of the cat12 Avastin versus Lucentis?  And then a question on other operating expense in Pharma, it's a fairly high number, 201 million compared to Q3 '09 when it was 226 million, but that was a very high number. We know that there were restructuring charges and Tekturna inventory provisions in the baseline. So certainly it's still a much higher number than a normalized quarter. Now, is there restructuring going on which you don't want to publish while we see a continuation of marketing productivity going up?  And yes, that's it.</p>

          <p>I just wanted to find out what your intention of Tasigna once it is established in first line and you have the data to support convincing patients and physicians that it should be used. Will you go for a quick switch from Glivec to Tasigna, first question?</p>
          <p>And secondly, given that last year you gave us an indication that outcome synergies will amount or it will give you a visibility on 1 to 3% accretion in adjusted EPS, and the market is now fully consolidating Alcon into the numbers, is there anything on potential synergies that you want to add following what you said last year?</p>

          <p>David, do you want to say something about this &#x2013; what the actual...</p>

          <p>What I'd rather do is we're planning an analyst meeting for early December right after ASH. And I think at that time we can commit to you to talk about our strategy for how the market will evolve over the next five years. But I think to do it now just in the back of the data which you haven't even seen yet is a little bit premature.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think that's very reasonable. And from the point of view of the synergies, Raymund, do you want to add numbers?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, Fabian. On outcome synergies at this point, it's premature to talk about potential synergies. First, you have to see if and when. The second step is materialize. And then once that decision is clear, then we can start to talk about potentially integration synergies. At this point, it's premature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I would add that even if the second step takes place, there are no synergies because there are still the minority shareholders and we cannot integrate. Any business we would be doing would be at arms length. So it would imply that we would buy the entire company and that is written in a totally different chapter.</p>

          <p>Or, Daniel, the synergies would have to be shared. This depends on...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but that's then the joint venture or whatever you do with that.</p>
