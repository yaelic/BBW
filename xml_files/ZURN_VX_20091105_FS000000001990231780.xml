      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to Zurich's nine months 2009 results.  Today we'll have presentation by James Schiro, CEO, by Dieter Wemmer, CFO and then the normal Q&amp;A.  So let's start by handing over to Jim Schiro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Malcolm, and welcome to Zurich's nine month 2009 results announcement.  As you will have read by now, our third quarter results are excellent with our core operating performance and capital levels returning to pre-crisis levels.</p>
          <p>This success in the face of some of the most challenging economic markets in history reflects our ability to leverage a disciplined operating platform that has become accustomed to driving global strategies across a diverse footprint of businesses.  At a time when many companies, individuals and governments are seeking to replenish their balance sheets, Zurich is posting a near-record equity level and a regulatory solvency margin of over 200%.</p>
          <p>We believe that this continued focus on the strength and quality of our balance sheet is appropriate in these uncertain economic times, as is our continued conservative approach to reserving, provisions and other core risk-management issues.  For it is this financial strength that differentiates Zurich through these times of uncertainty and underpins our confidence that we can capitalize on opportunities that may emerge in this environment, no matter what type of economic recovery scenario the future may bring.</p>
          <p>But even with a keen focus on ensuring a strong balance sheet, we continue to demonstrate consistent earning power posting our 27th consecutive quarter of profitability and our fourth straight quarter of increasing profitability.  This ability to balance the various elements of long-term success is what has allowed us once again to exceed our 16% mid-term BOPaT-ROE target.</p>
          <p>Similarly, our ability to achieve targeted profitable growth is illustrated by our Global Life and Farmers results, heightening the strength of our customer product and distribution strategies, as well as our steadily increasing capability to effectively integrate acquisitions such as those in Brazil, Spain and the U.S.</p>
          <p>Clearly however, lower payrolls, reduced trade levels and tight credit markets have impacted the economic environment in which many of our customers operate.  And we are seeing these effects in the top-line results for our General Insurance business segment. What is more indicative of our strategy for those lines though is the steady increase in rates we've been able to achieve and ensuing rise in profitability from North American commercial and global corporate, despite the economic pressures.</p>
          <p>These positive signs are reflective of the focus we place on the aspects of our business we can influence and demonstrate the impact we are making by having open and honest discussions about the fundamental cost of risk with our customers and brokers.  What these results also indicate is that Zurich systematically positions itself for any economic recovery scenario.</p>
          <p>Our capital base is among the strongest in the sector.  Our ability to generate profits has been successfully tested under even the toughest of conditions.  And our capability to create and capitalize on opportunities for growth is clear.  Together these attributes underpin our confidence that Zurich has differentiated itself during these past four quarters, illustrating the sustainable value the financial and operational discipline, as enshrined in the Zurich Way, can create for an organization and its many stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Now to show you a more in-depth look at that value I'll ask Dieter Wemmer to walk you through the figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  As Jim has said we have two primary areas of success.  Firstly the maintenance of strong operating performance in our three core business segments.  For the nine months and with a fast recovering shareholders' equity we achieved a 16.9% post tax operating ROE, again exceeding our medium-term target.</p>
          <p>Secondly we have further consolidated the strength of our balance sheet and solvency.  At the beginning of the year we put the recovery of the balance sheet as a fast-track priority. The numbers today show that we have achieved our aim in just nine months.  This gives us great flexibility and opportunity in the volatile environment we are still in.  Additionally, we have reviewed certain reserves and provisional levels and believe we now have an even more resilient position.</p>
          <p>In the nine months we have strengthened reserves on U.K. asbestosis, reserves in our run-off businesses, both Life and non-Life, and as you all know we take charges when they appear.  We also have made some adjustments to mortality assumptions in our U.S. protection business, Farmers New World Life, giving a positive benefit to the IFRS result.</p>
          <p>This greater resilience will give us more opportunities as markets recover.  But as Jim has highlighted, we are also prepared in the event of a prolonged recession.  We are confident that our disciplined approach focusing on our core business, understanding our risks and integrating asset liability matching in to our business model protected us in the last downturn and will enable us to continue to achieve profitable growth in the future.</p>
          <p>The underlying strength of the operating profit and net income can be seen on the summary Slide Number Seven.  The core operating businesses continue to improve into the third quarter and, excluding the non-core businesses, our quarterly performance of about $1.66 billion is back to the levels achieved in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our aim with the non-core businesses in the third quarter was to take actions to bring future results back into the relatively neutral run rate we have seen in the past.  Looking at the net income graph at the bottom of the slide, this would have been back close to the pre-crisis levels had we not traded net income for balance sheet protection.</p>
          <p>We have taken charges in Q3 on hedge positions set up in the first half of this year to protect the net present value of our future unit-linked fee income stream in Global Life, as well as on protection against defaults of reinsurers.  These risk-reduction hedges were set up to increase our economic solvency from the year-end position.  In addition, we booked impairment charges in the quarter of $380 million; more on that in a minute.</p>
          <p>Furthermore we have incurred restructuring charges of over 60 million in Q3, of which 36 million is from integrating 21st Century and the rest largely from setting up our E.U. carrier.  As unrealized losses in our balance sheet turned into unrealized gains this quarter, we are confident that net income after tax will be back on track in due course.</p>
          <p>Looking at General Insurance now on the next page.  Let's start with the top-line development in General Insurance.  This has been gross written premiums decrease by 3% over the nine months. The main component of this development are our continued focus on underwriting discipline, which you can see in the achieved rate change numbers below.</p>
          <p>Since our retention rate has been holding up rather very well, thanks to our portfolio segmentation these rate increases help our volume.  However this is more than offset by the impact from the economic environment which has reduced the volumes of insured exposures, particular in North America but also in parts of Europe.</p>
          <p>Despite this drop in volume, the expense ratios were largely flat, reflecting our disciplined approach to costs.  The loss ratio has improved year-on-year with lower cat charges being partially offset by lower prior-year releases.  At the same time rate increases are starting to earn in and being reflected in an improved underlying loss ratio.</p>
          <p>In all, this has led to a 4% increase in business operating profit expressed in local currency so presenting a strong performance from General Insurance more than compensating for both lower volumes and investment income.  Now we move into the detail starting with the rate change monitor on Page Nine.</p>
          <p>In an environment where others are only focused on market share, I'm very pleased to tell you that our lead-to-market initiative to protect our margins through rate increases has achieved the desired result.  Overall General Insurance rates are up 3.2% for the nine months so presenting a slight improvement over the six-months number.</p>
          <p>Global corporate continues to post strong rate increases with 6% year-to-date.  In global corporate North America, we see slightly reduced levels of increases due to lower volumes of cat-exposed property and energy coming up for renewal in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Global corporate in Europe continues to post positive price increases led by the U.K. with 7% for the year-to-date.  North America commercial is up by close to 3% both for the discrete quarter and nine months.</p>
          <p>There are suggestions in some U.S. publications that the U.S. casualty market currently is in a cheating phase by underestimating current accident-year reserves and the immediate needs for rate increases.  We have not been doing this and remain disciplined.  The 2009 rate increases have been carefully targeted by individual account profitability.  We believe we can maintain our profitability in these lines.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we are confident in our disciplined reserving approach and that we have the governance processes in place to avoid under-reserving and to make appropriate allowance for long-term inflation.  Also we believe in the mid term that we will be helped by the low-yield environment, which will be start to really affect the industry's margins in 2010.  We have, as stated on several occasions, taken this into account in our pricing, and since we doubt that on average the industry have adjusted price levels to reflect this, we believe we will be proved to be a front runner.</p>
          <p>Europe General Insurance continues to deliver rate increases of around 2%.  This is driven by U.K. personal lines where rates are up by 13%.  This is a result of the need for rate increases in the broker-distributed motor book due to the so-called credit hire problem in the market as well as the increase in personal injury severity.  I will come back to this later and discuss our response.  It is encouraging to see that in commercial lines, Europe is delivering rate increases while posting a healthy combined ratio in the low 90s for the nine months.</p>
          <p>Looking more in detail on our personal lines book in Italy where, as you can see, the rates are not up as much as one might expect in relation to the ongoing market-wide issues there.  In Italy we have taken actions and pushing through rate increases with small rate rises in the fourth quarter.  As a result our average premium per motor policy is up 5% year-to-date.</p>
          <p>This is not necessarily evident in our renewal rate change since the benefits are more from the effect of lapses of unattractive business.  In addition to rate increases, our mitigating actions also include canceling contracts or restricting premium discounts to agents who consistently fail to meet our required return expectations.</p>
          <p>International markets, rate increases here were achieved in Latin America and Australia.  At the same time, Greater China and Southeast Asia continued to prove difficult due to the relatively attractive combined ratios in this markets.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Page 10 and look at our rate changes from a new angle.  With this new illustrative exhibit we would like to put the rate increases achieved into context by showing you a simplified view of the quarterly compounded effect over 2008 and 2009.  If you look at policies renewing in each quarter as a discrete block of business we can follow them over a two-year period.</p>
          <p>This means that the policies that renewed in the first quarter on average experienced a rate reduction of 2.4% in 2008.  We then increased rates for this group in 2009 by 2.1%.  By taking a two-year perspective, this block in fact experienced an effective rate decreased of 0.4%.  This simplification obviously does not take into account lapses and new business in the period.</p>
          <p>You can however see the compounded rate changes as a response to cost drivers like inflation, interest rates, efficiency actions and changes in frequency.  In the graph we can clearly see the slowdown in rate reduction in the third quarter of last year and the turn we achieved when we started to lead the market on rate in the last quarter of 2008.  However, moving into 2009 we did not achieve a compounded rate increase until second quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to the third quarter you can see that although the rate increases have slowed somewhat, we are still improving significantly compared to the first and second quarter.  With the turn in the fourth quarter last year we can, if we match our achievements in Q3, continue to build on this positive trend.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to reiterate what I said at the half year.  For our new business we apply the same pricing methodology based on technical price as we do for the renewal book.  In global corporate for example our new business pricing is actually higher than on the renewal book.  Also we have a differentiated approach to rate increases, which models individual customer-risk characteristics.</p>
          <p>This means that it is based on underwriting and pricing discipline rather than on volume management and it enables us to renew profitable business at more attractive rates while low-margin policies lapse more often than the average.  In summary, this means that we have gained further traction in our push to defend our margins.  The positive rate development is still needed to cover claims trends as well as lower yields.</p>
          <p>Now let's look on the expense ratio.  As mentioned, the expense ratio is largely flat in spite of a lower premium base, while our investment in operational transformation continues unabated at about $400 million per year.  In addition, we have left our marketing spend unchanged as we invested in our brand and HelpPoint campaign.  This has proved highly successful at an important stage in the market when many other brands were weakened.  As a result the higher brand awareness has improved our competitive position in many markets.</p>
          <p>Commissions are up while premium tax charges are down.  Both of these are effects from changes in business mix while the commission ratio also increased due to a changed approach to broker remuneration in our North American business.  This is a result of our intention to move our risk-reward profile in line with the best-in-class U.S. commercial lines companies and through this we see the potential for significant improvement in the profitability of our book going forward.</p>
          <p>Other underwriting expenses are down, both as a ratio and in local currency amount, as our focus on expense management continues.  This disciplined approach has for example resulted in North America commercial being able to absorb an 11% drop in volumes and still achieved the mostly flat ratio for other technical expenses.</p>
          <p>Now let's have the more detailed look at our loss ratio as usual.  I'm really happy to report the significant improvement in the underlying loss ratio.  Overall the reported loss ratio is down close to 2% due to a number of reasons.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we have experienced a benign catastrophe season. Having said that, the nine months was not without weather-related events.  For example we took a charge of around 55 million in the third quarter from European hailstorms in Switzerland and Austria.  At the same time Germany experienced weather-related losses of roughly 30 million.</p>
          <p>Secondly, large losses returned to a more normal level for the segment compared to 2008 with the large loss charges coming down by roughly $300 million, although large losses in Q3 standalone were above average.  At the same time our underlying loss ratio improved by 0.5 percentage point due to our successful rate actions and portfolio management.</p>
          <p>These three positives were partially offset by lower prior-year reserve releases of 552 million, although these releases were adversely effected by the increased asbestosis provision taken in the U.K. costing a net $196 million, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>On top of this, we of course had the well-known market issues in the motor books in Italy and the U.K.  We are taking corrective actions to deal with these issues.  We talked about Italy before. Meanwhile in the U.K. there are continuing issues around the so-called credit hire practices and the closely linked inflation in personal injury claims.  Our responses are a focused strategy around claims management and increasing rates.</p>
          <p>With this we will finish off the General Insurance with a look on our U.K. asbestosis reserves.  We have in the last six months significantly increased our U.K. provision for asbestosis-related diseases, especially mesothelioma, as part of our yearly U.K. asbestosis studies.  This decision is due to revised industry assumptions as well as changes in claims experience driven by a number of factors, in particular with the right Health and Safety Executive projections on total meso deaths published in August.</p>
          <p>Roughly two thirds of the increase in our asbestosis provision has been offset by a release of previously established latency provisions.  These have been built up over time to cover developments like new claims times &#x2013; types and step changes in external benchmarks, industry statistics or democratic factors, which is the case here.  The net cost for the nine months was roughly $200 million.  As you can see, we made an initial provision in the second quarter of $116 million, with the balance in Q3.  We also show you the split between Europe General Insurance and global corporate in this slide.</p>
          <p>This concludes the General Insurance part and we now can move on to look at the globalized results in more detail.  I'm now on Slide 14.  All the six pillars are now fully operational and contributing to our ambitious growth targets.  The strategy is evident as we continue to develop global propositions and drive our operational hub strategy.</p>
          <p>Global Life reported 32% growth in local currency in gross written premiums, policy fees and deposits.  This growth, along with the focus on in-force management, drove the policyholder net inflows to a positive $2.6 billion year-to-date.</p>
          <p>The increase in new business volume of 17% in local currency reflects strong growth in Spain, where we are now the market leader with a share of 16% benefiting from the businesses acquired last year.  We have also achieved growth in Latin America, U.K. and Italy.  Even on a like-on-like comparison the new business volume was slightly up year-to-date in a difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>By country we were particularly pleased with the performance in the U.K. with local currency growth of 3% supported by our ability to be flexible in volatile markets.  In Ireland, we continue to benefit from a flight to quality with our production holding steady in a market that has declined over 30%, ensuring further gains in market shares, which is currently about 16% in terms of new business.</p>
          <p>We also saw continued growth in Latin America, balancing challenges in emerging markets in Asia. The new business margin improved from the half year at 21% to 21.8%.  This reflects both our focus on expenses, as well as a shift in product mix to protection and long-term savings in response to the changing market conditions.  Obviously the lower interest rates impacted the profitability of guaranteed-savings products in Germany and Switzerland, also this improved slightly in this quarter.</p>
          <p>The growth and sustained margin resulted in a new business value of 520 million, up 11% in local currency.  This strong value was driven by volume growth in Spain and Latin America, and improved margins in the U.S., Zurich international solutions and Ireland.</p>
          <p>Looking at the top 10 European life insurers, we have moved up to become the seven largest producer of new business value at the half year.  This demonstrates that our strategy is allowing us to grow value faster than our competitors.</p>
          <p>The embedded value earnings were $1.8 billion, representing a return of 17.1% for the first nine months.  The earnings benefited from the strong new business performance as well as the impact of the change to align more closely with the MCEV principles, as already reported at half year.  In addition, a positive economic variance of 685 million contributed to the result.</p>
          <p>Business operating profit of 1.2 billion is decreased by 6% in dollar terms, but increased by 4% in local currency.   In connection with our work on profit by force we are continuously improving the consistency of our actuarial assumptions across Global Life.</p>
          <p>In total for the quarter we have one-off adjustment of 190 million of which 182 million</p>
          <p>relates to revised mortality assumptions in the U.S.  Adding the 70 million one-off for the half year this results in 260 million positive one-off for the nine months.</p>
          <p>The underlying business operating profit increased for the second quarter in a row.  This was primarily driven by increased fund-based fee income as investment markets have recovered from the lows in the first quarter and improved profits from the protection business as we have sharpened our focus on these product lines.  In addition, we continued to build the global reinsurance desk to benefit our risk margin.</p>
          <p>We have achieved some new business growth and continued to invest in the business to implement the strategy announced in May 2008.  We have offset the cost of this investment by savings from increased operational efficiency, thus keeping our management expenses at prior-year level.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Page 15 to see more details on our new business volume by distribution channel. Bank distribution continued to be the main growth driver, principally from the acquisitions in Spain. The growth in Banco Sabadell continues to exceed our business plan expectations, driven by sales campaigns for protection and savings products.</p>
          <p>The corporate life and pension pillar grew 45% in local currency terms, driven by strong sales of protection business to international groups and from local protection business sold in Ireland, Latin America and the U.K.  The IFA/broker pillar increased by 2% in local currency, despite the tough market conditions.  Growth continues in the UK as a result of successful pension sales and an increase in our broker relationship management.</p>
          <p>For both our agents and international/expat pillars, many territories continued to be resilient in the economic conditions.  However our Hong Kong business, both domestic and international/expat business, were significantly affected by a fall in consumer appetite for unit-linked life insurance products.  The private banking client solutions achieved sales of 53 million in the U.K. as well as generating the first sales to the now fully operational private banking hub in Luxemburg.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Page 16 and the Farmers results.  We have summarized all KPIs for Farmers businesses on one slide and you find the usual KPIs for all three major entities, Farmers Management Services, Farmers Re and the Exchanges in the appendix.  Again Farmers has produced a high quality set of results, which combined growth profitability and expense control.</p>
          <p>Let's started with the management company.  The margin on gross earned premium is up over prior year as we continue to manage our expenses through various initiatives.  Business operating profit has increased by 8%, or $73 million, driven by these expense initiatives as well as a higher top line at the Exchanges.  And we included the acquired 21st Century for the first time.</p>
          <p>21st Century added about $100 million to management fees and 600 million to gross working premium at the exchanges.  I will update you on the integration progress in a minute and you can find further financial information on 21st Century in the appendix.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Farmers Re.  Farmers Re's gross written premium are up by 2.6 billion over prior year as a result of increasing the quota share with the Exchanges in two steps, from five to 25 and in turn to 37.5%, as well as benefiting from growth in the exchanges top line.  With this growth and a stable combined ratio, operating profit increased to 141 million.</p>
          <p>As to the Farmers Exchanges, the Exchanges which we manage but do not own, have maintained their strong growth track record, which started back in 2006.  Gross written premiums increased by 4.7%, largely as a result of the inclusion of 21st Century for the first time.  Excluding the acquisition and the small business transfer from North America commercial, the Exchanges top line has reduced by 1.8% overall in a contracting markets.</p>
          <p>The adjusted combined ratio is 92%, 9.4 percentage points better than last year.  Half of that, or 4.7 points, due to lower capacity experience and the balance is driven by price increases earnings through as well as improving loss trends on the motor book.</p>
          <p>As throughout 2008, the Exchanges have continued to lead the market in 2009 by taking rate increases of 5% overall.  Net surplus increased by $334 million and the surplus ratio rose to 40.6% putting the Exchanges in a very comfortable surplus position.</p>
          <p>Now let me update you on the acquisition of 21st Century.  Q3 is the first quarter which fully includes the new acquisition.  As you can see, 21st Century wrote over $1.9 billion of premium in the first nine months 2009, over 80% of which was from the direct channel.  This compares with the lower end of the range of the deal case assumptions of 2.5 to 2.8 billion per year.  But we believe the acquisition remains on track to achieve earnings per share accretion in year one because of the integration synergies we are achieving.</p>
          <p>Annual run-rate savings in the management company already amount to $45 million while savings in the Exchanges will contribute to their profitability and surplus as well as to the underwriting results of our quota share.  We are already integrating the agency business into Foremost.  On the direct side the underwriting is in profit and we are consolidating call centers and other functions in lower-cost areas.</p>
          <p>In total we have reduced 730 positions, of which 320 were employed by the Exchanges and 410 by the management company.  The integration is to continue into 2010 and will include areas such as data centers, IT applications and claims approbations.  Let's now look at the integration of this acquisition on the next page.</p>
          <p>I think we are now turning to other operating and non-core businesses.  Other operating businesses includes the operations previously described as corporate functions.  From the third quarter, following a review of its operation, our banking business has been designated non-core and transferred to the non-core business segment.  Comparatives have been restated.  You can find a spreadsheet on the website showing quarterly restated numbers for 2008 and '09 to date.</p>
          <p>As we reported previously, there was a gain of $210 million of which 137 million was in Q3 from buying back subordinated debt.  The non-core businesses segment has seen benefits of the further recovery in the financial markets in the third quarter.  At the same time, as I mentioned earlier, we have reviewed reserves in the quarter in a number of the run-off and other businesses in here and increased those life and non-life reserves in a number of places.</p>
          <p>In addition, in Q3 we have strengthened loan provisions in the banking business by $118 million, which we have predominantly taken in Ireland.  This follows a review of our Irish loan book off the back of recent market developments and the announcement of the Irish government to establish the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, indicating price levels at which Irish bank loans would be acquired.</p>
          <p>As at the end of Q3 our provision-to-loan ratio is now at 29%.  We do not plan to participate in the NAMA settlement but our provisions are now generally consistent with the average loan discounts to be applied to the NAMA portfolio purchases.  Centrally managed businesses was driven by KILICO, which achieved a small profit in Q3, following the 225 million reserve strengthening in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the performance of our Group investments.  Net investment income decreased by 15% in dollar terms and 7% in local currency, driven by lower dividends on equities and reinvestment at lower interest rates.  Net capital losses through P&amp;L before allocation to policyholders were $1.2 billion for the nine months and largely flat in the third quarter.  Although there have been some positive mark-to-market adjustments in Q3, these were offset by some impairment on bonds, equities and mortgage loans, as well as losses on risk-reduction hedges which I have already explained.</p>
          <p>In line with our strategy to maintain a strong balance sheet, we set up these hedges to protect the Group's economic solvency.  As a result, losses on such hedges are born by shareholders.  This with the bank loan provisions explains why capital losses attributable to shareholders in Q3 amounted to 260 million while being largely flat before policyholder allocation.  You can find further details in the appendix on Slide Number 58.</p>
          <p>Net investment returns through P&amp;L was a positive 2.3% in the nine months.  Changes in unrealized losses on investments included in equity were a positive 5.9 billion and more to that in a minute.  As a result, total investment return not annualized amounted to a strong 5.4% for this period.  As in the more volatile first half of 2009, the key principles of Zurich's disciplined investment approach remained unchanged and you can find further details in the appendix as usual.</p>
          <p>Our equity exposure is well controlled and amounts to 3% at the end of September taking into account our hedging programs, which protect about 15% of our equity exposure.  As equity markets have recovered in the third quarter equities have further increased in value by about one billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the next slide, we can see the movements on unrealized losses in shareholders equity in total.  Given that unrealized capital gains and losses continue to be an important driver of total investment return we have included this slide again.  Building on similar trends as in the second quarter, movements in unrealized gains of over five billion were credited to shareholders' equity in Q3.</p>
          <p>With these mark-to-market gains, the position of cumulative unrealized gains and losses has turned dramatically.  As of September 30, debt securities show a balance of unrealized gains of 1.7 billion and the unrealized position on equities is largely flat and an impressive change from the previous cumulative loss provision. This is an additional proof of the strength and health of our balance sheet and investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>As you would expect unrealized gains accrued on both debt and equity securities in Q3.  Of the total 4.3 billion gains on debt securities in the third quarter over three billion were on corporate bonds and asset-backed securities as credit spreads further tightened markedly.  In addition and in contrast to the second quarter, unrealized gains also increased on government bonds by over one billion, driven by lower interest rates across a range of maturities and markets.</p>
          <p>With that let's look at the development of shareholders' equity on the next page.  Shareholders' equity at $28.5 billion was $6.4 billion up on the 2008 year-end number and 3.3 billion on the half year.  Net income attributable to shareholders of 2.2 billion was net of an effective tax rate of 22.4%.</p>
          <p>As I have just discussed, our investment portfolio has recovered in both the second and third quarters adding $3.3 billion year-to-date net of taxes, policyholder and other allocations.  As a result, our investments now show a position of net unrealized gains confirming the recovery of our balance sheet.  Translation adjustments have increased equity by another 1.1 billion year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Actuarial losses on pension plans were largely flat in the nine months as gains from recovering asset values were offset by losses from lower discount rates.  These rates are based on long-dated AA corporate bond yields, which decreased due to reducing credit spreads.  Looking at the movement in Swiss francs, book value per share increased 20% year-to-date to CHF 201.</p>
          <p>With that let's have a look at our capital position on the next Page Number 22.  As Jim and I have mentioned, our solvency position has improved following the recovery of asset values through the last two quarters.  In addition, the economic solvency has benefited from the de-risking actions we took earlier in the year.  This puts us in a strong position to be able to react quickly to any market upturn as well as to be able to withstand a prolonged recession.</p>
          <p>Our Solvency 1 ratio has further improved by 29 points to 209% in the third quarter.  As you know, there is much variability in the components of Solvency 1 calculations throughout Europe.  We mark-to-market our bond portfolio which, as we have now a net gain position, increases the ratio by about six percentages points.  In addition, we calculate our solvency net of General Insurance deferred-acquisition costs, which would add 24 percentage points.</p>
          <p>I would just like to make some comments on Solvency 2 and the Swiss Solvency Test.  There has been a lot of market comments and concerns on the potential new regulations.  We are already in parallel test phase for Swiss Solvency Test, which is more rigorous than current Solvency 2 proposals and we are very comfortable with the outcome.</p>
          <p>Our actions to create a single E.U.-based General Insurance carrier were started in 2005 and are now well advanced.  We have already transferred most of our European global corporate and the U.K. European General Insurance business to Ireland and expect to transfer the business in Spain, Italy and Portugal on January 1, 2010.  Later in 2010 we plan to transfer most of our German business.</p>
          <p>As we previously announced, the transfer of the U.K. business allowed us a release of surplus to the group center of 1.3 billion and we hope to release further surpluses from future transfers.  These releases do not generate a surplus at a Group level as it is obviously neutral for our Group solvency, but improve the tangibility of the Group surplus.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our internal economic solvency model at the bottom part of the slide. Including the risk-efficiency actions already taken, the nine-months profits, capital actions and economic effects in the period, our economic solvency level recovered during the nine months to 139% on our internal AA-calibrated model.  This number does not include a dividend accrual.</p>
          <p>We have reviewed our targets on economic solvency.  We can confirm our intention to keep a buffer of between 10 and 20% over internal AA target to cover the effects of volatility.  At the same time we need to consider two current factors.  Volatility has been greater over the last 12 months than was expected.  We remain cautious on levels of volatility over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>The composition of our available financial resources has changed as we carry more senior debt and we have to also to consider the solvency position at a debtholder level.  The fact that we carry more senior debt in our economic model has three positive effects.  Economic solvency is higher, average cost of capital is lower and our ability to achieve the ROE target of 16% is not impaired by the higher solvency.</p>
          <p>Our dividend policy remains unchanged.  We aim to pay a competitive, sustainable dividend, bearing in mind the mid-term outlook.  For instance, we describe the payment of the  last dividend in February as a prudent decision relative to the economic environment at that time. The current solvency level would support an attractive dividend at the year end while keeping sufficient solvency for potential market opportunities as well as protecting against adverse market corrections.</p>
          <p>So summarizing, with our emphasis on operational and expense discipline, the business operating after tax ROE at 16.9% continues to be above target.  Our strategy of managing our risks, particularly underwriting and investment risk, in a balanced way has allowed us to continue to perform at solid levels of profitability through the recent market conditions.  Our operating businesses remain sound with good performances in difficult markets, achieving selected growth in those areas where we wanted to grow but also strengthened positions where appropriate.</p>
          <p>In our core businesses the General Insurance combined ratio was supported by the continued positive actions on rate and expense-saving actions taken within our lead-the-market program.  Also we saw profitable growth due to an increased weighting of Farmers contribution to the Group and good progress in executing the Life strategy.</p>
          <p>The capital base and solvency have been considerably strengthened by the actions we have taken to de-risk in some areas but also from the strengthening of reserves and provisions, as well as by the recovery of the investment market.  Our equity is only 300 million short of the historic high, which evidences all actions taken to restore the balance sheet and our high-quality investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our task is to continue to manage our business, aiming to deliver consistent high-quality earnings.  This put us in a strong position to be able to react quickly to any market upturn as well as to be able to withstand another market correction.</p>
          <p>And now we can move to the questions.</p>

          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Spencer Horgan, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Good morning.  Just three things please.  First thing is on the underlying loss ratio on Slide 12, I can see it's obviously improved by 0.5 point year-on-year on the nine months.  But if I look sequentially from the second quarter this year I think it's deteriorated by about three percentage points.  Is there anything particularly noteworthy in that?  Or would you describe that as normal quarter-to-quarter volatility?</p>
          <p>The second point is on the balance sheet and obviously you've reiterated the 10 to 20% buffer against your internal model long term and you seem to be implying that it will be a higher number short term.  Can you give us any numeric feel about where you think that number should be in the short term in terms of how we should think about dividends prospectively?  And then just a third quick one, there's obviously &#x2013; it looks like Royal Bank of Scotland is revisiting the sale of its insurance operations.  Is the &#x2013; does the strategic rationale for why you looked at those operations previously still exist?  And maybe if you could just give us your thoughts on that, or maybe M&amp;A more widely?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've been consistent for eight years.  We continue to look at all opportunities in the market and they have to meet our hurdle rates and strategy.  And if we were to look at something specific we would manage it the same way we did 21st Century in terms of how we would finance it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Spencer, to your other two questions.  There is indeed a cycle over the year in the loss ratio, therefore I think that it's hard to compare a second quarter with a third quarter.  I think always the previous-year comparison gives a much better view on what has happened.  Third quarter has actually usually higher loss ratios.  There's more motor claims, people are driving substantially more than in the other quarter.  There is also a lot of smaller weather-related events and it is usually the quarter where also the actuarial assumptions are revised as we then understand in which direction the year is going.  Therefore I think it should be always seen in a quarter-by-quarter comparison.  On your question with the economic solvency, well I cannot give you a precise outlook how this ratio will develop quarter-by-quarter over the next quarter.  But as I indicated in my speech, I think the solvency ratio is high enough that it will not influence the dividend decision, which means we can decide on a dividend which is attractive for shareholders and reflects our outlook for the company.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Hello there.  Couple of questions please.  The first one is on your internal capital adequacy requirements and I was just wondering how much senior debt you include in your internal solvency calculation?  And I was also wondering why you include a liquidity premium as a sort of capital when you don't include this in your V reporting?  Dieter, obviously the fact that you're now the Chairman of the CFO Forum may have something to do with this, but it does seem a little incongruous.</p>
          <p>And the second question is just in terms of overall capital adequacy, obviously you can't pay a dividend from a liquidity premium and while I'm sure you would rather not give us a number around what your real flexible capital is, I was wondering if you'd give us a sense of whether, for example, if you were to do a deal of the size of the U.S. personal lines business of AIG whether you'd be able to do that from internal resources as things stand today?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I comment on what we have been very clear on is, particularly in these volatile markets, we would look to the current capital for protection of the shareholders, returns to the shareholders and managing the business on organic growth.  As I said previously, if we were to do another transaction like that we would look to the external markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering if it had changed because obviously of what's happened in your equity base and your capital requirements and what have you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no.  I understood the question but I think when one looks at the volatility of the market and the fragility of the economic situation as it is today, I think our sense has been to protect the balance sheet in the best interest of our customers, our shareholders, and that's been our focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>James, I think I have here to differentiate my roles between the CFO Forum Chairman and the CFO of Zurich Financial Services.  If you look at our slide on the economic solvency, that was Page 22, we have only indicated in an at-if number when we would use liquidity premiums as other companies are doing.  That would add another eight percentage points to our economic solvency.  We are still distending from using liquidity premiums as this was a practice we explained earlier in the year and we are usually very consistent, maybe sometimes stubborn on our consequences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.  Sorry, I misread the slide.  And on the senior debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The senior debt is &#x2013; I think in the economic solvency we have now included 18%.  And that's the issued close to $2 billion I think back in April, therefore that's contributed, and I think we disclosed it in the second quarter, some seven, eight additional points to the economic solvency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hybrid is always included and that is &#x2013; well that is all of our senior debt which is included.  We use only the long-term senior debt, not short-term or operational leverage at the banking level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I'd like to ask the M&amp;A question from a slightly different angle.  Can you run us through your criteria to a degree?  Would you be more interested in expanding in cash-flow generating areas?  Or would you look at growth prospects?  And what's the weighting of the criteria, so to speak, if you look at it from a potential return on an investment angle as well as the future growth prospect of the business?</p>
          <p>My second question is then related to the Global Life business, have there been any particular promotions to drive up the top-line growth?  Have there been specific promotions to take market share during specific periods where others may have been distracted in terms of rebuilding the balance sheet?  And then thirdly, would Zurich be an early adopter of the revised draft of IS-39?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think I'm going to shed a lot more light on the M&amp;A question than we have in the past.  And I'd urge you to &#x2013; in February you could continue to ask that question to Martin.  But I'm not sure you're going to get much of a different answer.  Anyway, I think we've so embedded that in the culture.  But obviously we've outlined areas that we want to grow in there and now increasingly in the emerging markets.  We're looking at in the Life business as well but beyond that we've not articulated any additional criteria to that.  And I'm going to turn the other two questions over to Dieter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Marc, I think we could in particular benefit in Spain and Ireland I think from our brand positioning and special promotions.  When we did the acquisitions in Spain our expectation was to be the number two in the market but we are in 2009, with a clear distance actually, the largest Life company now in the Spanish market.  And that certainly has to do that the old number one also withdraw a bit from the market to focus their balance sheet on other topics. And in Ireland similar.  I think that was a market very much dominated by bancassurance and the Zurich brand, which is mainly selling through IFA/brokers, gained a lot of market share.</p>
          <p>On IS-39, that is a difficult question, because there is not yet the final exposure draft available.  It would not be a major issue for us to go for early adoption but also I'm not sure that it would create a lot of differences and really give our investors additional new insight and transparency.  And I think that it's mainly a question do you learn more from it and do you get a better view on our business model by this early adoption.  I think actually we would prefer that we could implement this parallel with the next phase of insurance accounting.  And that is certainly, and here I have to quote the CFO Forum again, where we are working on that we get the assets and liabilities being re-measured with the same effective date because that only allows then the insurance industry really to present the numbers in a consistent basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I come back one more time to the M&amp;A question and perhaps answer the question that's the elephant in the room and get to Spencer's point and perhaps yours.  I know we have in everyone's mind a fairly robust equity capital position and a very strong solvency position.  That is designed not for M&amp;A opportunities.  That is designed to protect us, given the current economic environment that we're involved in.  That's the focus of this.  That's why we refer to it in terms of protecting our customers, our shareholders.  It's also designed obviously, as Dieter outlined, relative to our dividending policy as well.  So any acquisition that we do look at will still have to achieve the hurdle rates and the prudence that we've set in the past when we've looked at acquisitions on a historical basis.  And then again as we said, we will come to the market and justify the financing of such acquisitions going forward.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Andrew Broadfield, Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning, all. A couple of things, I just want to return to the solvency thing, just very quickly to tie it into what the rating agencies' views are.  I had a quick flick through S&amp;P's last comments and their focus is really on the downside at least and the negative outlook was around the declining capital adequacy or quality of capital at that time.  And also the volatility of the business lines you're in.  It seems both of those have turned around a little bit at least.  I'd just be interested to know what your latest conversions with those people are?  Or at least your view on those issues?  And I guess just whether your interpretation of your solvency position is likely to have moved in the &#x2013; by the same amount in the same direction as the rating agencies?  Or whether perhaps there's things you take into account which they wouldn't which has helped you?  That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then the second question, just on the rate increases on the General Insurance business, if we were to look &#x2013; on the whole you're one of the few that's showing I think good rate increases across the board, but if you add that up versus claims inflation versus low reinvestment rates or new investment rates, how much do you think returns have come down or not over the last 12, 24 months?  And when do you think you might get, assuming interest rates and yields remain largely flat, what sort of rate increase do you think you need to get to, to get to parity?  On returns that is rather than just on combined ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Okay, Andrew, two very good questions.  Let me first answer the S&amp;P question.  I think there is &#x2013; on one hand we fully agree with S&amp;P what is important in 2009. I think it is really the balance sheet quality and that the profit outlook for GI in general is more difficult.  But the difference to S&amp;P is they look at it from a passive point of view as somebody who is analyzing the market.  We take this as a challenge and really provide active management against it.  And that is exactly what we do and our balance recovery is not only a lucky event based on market movements, there is also a lot of hard work and actions behind it, and the same our early focus on rate increases.</p>
          <p>And you are right and we published this in our Investor Day earlier this year, what 100 or 200 base points lost investment income mean for short-term and long-term business and profitability.  And I can tell you that we have pushed through all the investment yield decreases in our pricing assumptions and our portfolio continues to stay on average above the 100% technical price.  That means we achieve our target return on the policies as the world &#x2013; as the claims environment stays where it is.  There's of course every quarter volatility up and down but I think that is exactly the reason why we have taken all these actions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okays.  So just to be clear then, you're saying you're hitting your hurdle rates as it is right now with the rate increases?  But I guess that &#x2013; is that still a general decline on returns from the glory years of two years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well on &#x2013; actually if you look at this slide where we explain the compound effect of rate movements, I think that actually the industry had its, in particular the U.S., the most difficult time summer 2008.  And that was really that was the crucial point in time where we had to started to push for rate increases, worsened by the &#x2013; or aggravated by the fact that interest rates then stumbled after the fall of Lehman.  So I think that was right the turning point to make up for the starting tumbling profit margins and I think we keep it above the 16% long-term level what you want to achieve. Yes, certainly when you can achieve more than 20% that would be great, but we are not assuming that this is long term possible and we are sticking to our mid-term targets.</p>

          <p>That's great.  And sorry, just back on the solvency thing, you're reasonably comfortable that S&amp;P will directionally and probably in terms of quantum move in the same sort of direction that you have in this quarter in your interpretation of capital?</p>

          <p>The next question is from Stefan Sch&#xFC;rmann, Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.  I have two questions.  First one is on your asset-liability management.  Could you give us some flavor on the duration gap for both Life and non-Life operations?  And maybe the expectations for interest rate if you have any changes here from last quarter?  And then the second one is just a small one on impairments, could you maybe specify where the other 121 million of impairments happened in the end of third quarter, what exactly that was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a second, Stefan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We move the microphone to the experts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning, Stefan.  The first question on the duration is that I should stress &#x2013; this is Martin Senn by the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question on the duration, I should stress that in principle we look to match up some liabilities and that we tend to be rather long on the General Insurance business on duration and we tend to be short &#x2013; slightly short on the Life insurance business.  As it stands, the bulk portfolio had a duration of 5.3 years overall and I think that's very much bringing us to the situation where we are matched as of the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the second question you had on the impairments, let me just repeat and give you an overview of where the total impairments of 379 million come in.  100 million of that was in equities, 158 million was in debt securities and 121 million was in other categories.  The other categories, that's what you're referring to, has been predominantly related to our banking activities.  I think Dieter has referred to that and that's again the 121, 1,580 million in the Irish loan book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And maybe going back to the duration, can you change any outlook for the interest-rate environment from the last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, we all have the same crystal ball and the way we manage our portfolio is not in terms of trying to be smarter than the market is.  I think our strategy has been working very well by looking to match assets and liabilities.  We are not expecting or we have never expected to get a systematic return by sort of taking interest rate punts.  And I think continuing to add &#x2013; to match assets and liabilities and take as little interest rate raise as possible is the right strategy.  This is the right strategy in any economic cycle and we continue to pursue that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Brian Shea, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I have two questions, please.  First of all is on capital.  I think it's great that you're achieving your ROE target on your enlarged pot of equity capital but it just seems that given the ability to deploy capital on non-Life seems to be difficult now and likely will stay difficult, that it will get increasingly harder to generate that target ROE.</p>
          <p>I guess the question is about buybacks.  You historically have looked at this only once a year.  You're making very cautious comments now about capital and I'm just wondering what is the delay really in taking more aggressive capital action?  Is it really that it's your macro economic view, you want to see the macro economic view &#x2013; environment settle down?  Or is it more that you actually do hope to grow into your enlarged capital base?  Sorry, a poorly worded question, I hope you get the sense of what I'm trying to get at?</p>
          <p>And then the second one is a much more basic one.  The running investment yield has been gradually coming down, just from a purely mechanical standpoint is it reasonable to assume that, that process has not yet completed?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me try and deal a bit with the capital position and then let Dieter perhaps reiterate his statement around our return-to-shareholders position.  I think, Brian, and I don't think we're alone in this.  And I'd be interested in talking to some of your institutions if they have a different view of the economic outlook.  I think it's precarious at best.  It's hard for us to say that we're in a full recovery at this point in time.  I think it's prudent for us to have the capital and liquidity buffers that we have.  If the market were to turn and we didn't need that cushion, that would mean that, in the GI business specifically, that companies would start to expand again instead of contracting in construction, instead of contracting in the automotive sectors, more plants would come back on line and so the demand for insurance products would change.</p>
          <p>Interest rates and yields would increase, the pricing model would change.  What happens when one looks at predictions for unemployment rates rising in North America, potentially seeing difficulties in the commercial real estate markets in North America, I'd say these are precarious times and prudence in the capital position to protect against that is correct.  That does not mean, and you shouldn't dampen your exceptions, I think Dieter had a very clear statement of what we would expect on &#x2013; what you could manage to expect from the dividend standpoint.  If you'd like him to read it again, I'd ask him to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the solvency position really allows exactly to think about an attractive dividend and also that the question about share buyback is coming up.  It's not a surprise to us, and it is actually a great feeling that we get this question because some of you asked seven, eight months ago the opposite question whether the investors needs to put a new capital so it's actually a great question to have, but I'm not sure that it would be already the wise point in time to answer it ultimately, as Jim has explained.</p>
          <p>The markets are still going up and down in a very volatile basis.  On your question regarding the mechanics of the investment yield, you are right that there will be a still continued lowering of the average yield but at a much smaller speed because the biggest effect in year one was actually the reset of the short term interest yields.  Although we have most of our books of course in mid-term or long-term bonds, there is still a sizable amount of money in short-term cash and that is where you had the biggest setback in investment income, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Paul Goodhind, Redburn Partners.  Please go ahead, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much.  I have couple questions on the loan-loss insurance division.  On reserve releases, could you break down the reserve release number in the third quarter between North American corporate and other.  It does look as though you're not really seeing the amount of reserves that some of your U.S. domestic competitors are releasing.  So will you comment on that; that might be interesting?</p>
          <p>And secondly could you give the lapse rate on the North American corporate business and confirm that the combined ratio at the lapsed business is worse than the combined ratio of what you're renewing and perhaps quantify that differential because not renewing on profitable business, obviously helpful in terms of the combined ratio and mix going forward.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, you said something quite interesting on renewal pricing versus new business.  You said that the global corporate that new business pricing was above renewal pricing.  Are there any other parts of your portfolio where that is the case?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's, Paul, a very good and very technical question, so I'm not sure that I can really give numbers to all of your questions but our reserve releases from the U.S. and the overall reserve releases is very small.  That is a small number, and we don't see a lot of room for our U.S. domestic business to release reserves.  We have observed this that a lot of competitors are doing this, in particular, out of earlier accident years, and therefore I quoted what is now popular in some media is the treating years.</p>
          <p>I think if people believe that this years  are running so well, then they have to book their reserves according to their beliefs.  Our beliefs are different and our lapse rate, and we are for the rate actions quartiling our business  actually in our U.S. business much more than quartiling; it's actually a more refined segmentation of the pricing per capita, and we are achieving the best results in the least profitable business quarter, that means with the highest lapse rates and also the one we retain with the highest increases.  So therefore, actually from a portfolio effect, you are right.  You would expect a better impact on the loss ratio than what the rate increases are indicating; therefore we are making up also for loss inflation and all of this and really improved new business margin that goes beyond just the rate increase.  That was I think your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the question about the gap between new business and renewed business, global corporate, are there any other lines of business where your EBIT is higher than the renewed pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's in the commercial business close in personal lines that is traditionally lower in new business and renewal business because that is the way as the profit margins are earning and you usually increase then, in year two, rates for renewed business; therefore that is the way new business margins or new business prices are developing in personal lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Peter Testa, One Investments.  Please go ahead, gentleman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question.  I have couple of questions just extending on from our last point.  If you look at the rate increases and the pace that which those have been earned into results now, can you give some sort of sense as to whether you feel that we are seeing that now in Q3 or going forward and then looking at the rate increase as you're getting in the European General Insurance business, can you give a sense as to how you think those are balancing out versus in the loss trends that you mentioned individual markets when looking at European General Insurance overall.  Then just a question on, you talked about the seasonality factors in Q3.  There's also the quarter where there was some actuarial effects.  I was wondering if you could give some sort of view on the General Insurance business, how important some of the actuarial changes might have been in Q3 on the loss ratio in general insurance.  And then the last question is just on the Page 58 disclosure and hedge losses, can you please tell us whether this item, this 379 impairment issue is something which is taken in the BOP or below the line?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's a lot of technical questions.  The personal lines of business in Europe General Insurance needs more weighting actions going forward, and I quoted and Italian  example and we have already filed further rate increases in particular for the Italian market which will then come effective either October 1 and then the next round on January 1.  So in the third quarter, in particular, we reviewed our assumptions for our U.K. motor results and the credit hiring which is a very important and negative development in the market actually created additional losses for the quarter.  I would say if you take our increase we did in asbestosis which is more in the prior year development and U.K. motor and Italian motor, all three together probably make one percentage point in the loss ratio overall, of which then it's probably half and half then between prior year and attritional loss ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your hedge losses on Page 58, what was your...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a 379 impairment figure and just wondering whether that is an above the &#x2013; in the BOP or is shown below the BOP line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's below.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually &#x2013; it was actually probably a bit more difficult, that it's split between both categories depending on the type of loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you say about half is in the GI a little bit in life and the rest is in the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that is true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just going back on the rate increases, you talked about the pace at which these rate increases would start to get earned into the results and I'm just trying to understand if good two-year rate increase for that we should be effectively regarding these results as seeing the earned in effect of these rate increases now or whether that's something which you still would expect to see more of an impact going forward than so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the impact going forward is still bigger than the results we booked so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And if I can ask this one last question on all the changes of moving say the residence of business into Ireland of the General Insurance, whether you think that will have an impact on the tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will have only a very small impact on the tax rate because the businesses itself and the customers are still staying in the countries and according to the EU tax rules you pay taxes in the country where you deliver the services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that means we are still continue to be a U.K. tax payers and the people don't need to be concerned that they stop paying taxes anymore.</p>

With such strong operating results and capital levels reflecting, I have to say, years of hard work, I can hope you can understand my personal pride in the performance of this Group during this period.</p>
          <p>And I would be remiss, however, if I did not take this opportunity to speak to you prior to my retirement to thank the 60,000 Zurich employees who have made it possible for us to achieve such a strong market position.  Success on this scale doesn't happen without truly world-class organization.  It has been a sincere honor to work with them and for them over the past 7.5 years. I also want to take this opportunity to thank you, the analysts, the investors and media communities, for the professionalism and support you've shown me over the years.</p>
          <p>Many of us have gone through a lot together.  Some of it I would rather not remember, but through it all you kept setting the bar higher and higher and helping us to better understand and ultimately harness our true capabilities.  For that, I will always be grateful.</p>
          <p>Going forward, Martin Senn will have the honor to lead this great outstanding organization.  And I am confident that under his leadership, the Group will achieve even greater heights.  And all I ask of you is that you show him the same respect and passions that you showed me.</p>
          <p>So thank you once again for calling in and I really appreciate all your help and support.</p>
