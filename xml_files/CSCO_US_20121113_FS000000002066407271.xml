          <p>Welcome to Cisco Systems' First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. As the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Melissa Selcher, Senior Director, Analyst and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kim. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 91st quarterly conference call. This is Melissa Selcher and I'm joined by John Chambers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, President of Development and Sales; and Gary Moore, President and Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that we have corresponding webcast with slides on our website in the Investor Relations section. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the Investor Relations website. Click on the financial reporting section of the website to access these documents.</p>
          <p>Throughout this conference call we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons throughout this call will be on year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mel.</p>
          <p>As we open this call, I want to recognize the devastation in the Eastern Seaboard of the United States in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Knowing many on this call consider the impacted area home, we want to share our sincere condolences for all that has been lost. We remain committed to doing all we can to support and enable our employees, partners and customers, and the local governments, agencies, and support organizations who will work to rebuild and move forward.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to a discussion of our year-over-year performance in Q1 FY 2013, we delivered another strong quarter of record revenue with growth of 6% and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 with growth of 12% from an earnings per share perspective.</p>
          <p>As we continue to manage through a challenging macroeconomic environment, we continue to see the benefits of our focus on operational excellence, with only a 1% increase in non-GAAP operating expenses. Gary, nice job there, and strong non-GAAP gross margins of 62.7%. Rob, the teams are doing well in sales and engineering, yielding an 11% increase in net income and record non-GAAP operating income.</p>
          <p>In a world of many clouds, mobility, bring your own device and the internet literally connecting everything, the network has never played a more central role connecting people, process, data and things anywhere, anytime across any device. In this clouded mobile world, the challenges of scale, agility, security and resilience can only be addressed by an intelligent network and Cisco is uniquely positioned to help our customers meet the business requirements and drive this new growth.</p>
          <p>From my perspective, our strong results this quarter are proof that our vision for the evolution of this market and our strategy for Cisco's leadership role is playing out as we expected. My key takeaways from this quarter are the following.</p>
          <p>First, revenue growth of 6% in a very challenging market where many of our peers are reporting declines and bringing down future expectations.</p>
          <p>Second, profitability growth in double digits with solid expense management with gross operating margins exceeding our guidance.</p>
          <p>Third, our Service business continues to grow double digits as our customers ask Cisco to partner to build their technology and business architectures for the future.</p>
          <p>Fourth, $2.5 billion cash from operations generated this quarter with a more than 3% dividend yield to boot continuing to drive value for you, our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And fifth, while we continue to see very challenging order trends in Europe, we are pleased with our order growth in the U.S., where Enterprise grew 9% year-over-year, U.S. Service Provider grew 13% and U.S. Commercial, which does not include public sector, grew 5%.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver the innovation, quality and leadership our customers expect, and we are evolving the role we play in our customer accounts, moving from the top communications company to our goal of becoming the number one IT company.</p>
          <p>To provide additional detail on our Q1 FY 2013 results, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank. I will then walk through after, Frank, you're through, what we're seeing in the business and where we're focusing going forward. Frank will then come back with detailed guidance. Then we'll wrap up with Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Frank, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.</p>
          <p>In Q1 FY 2013, we executed consistent with our operating model of driving profits faster than revenue, contributing to our long-term profitable growth, driving operating leverage and increasing shareholder value. Total revenue for the first quarter was $11.9 billion, an increase of approximately 6%.</p>
          <p>From a geographic perspective, total revenue increased 7% for the Americas, 10% for Asia Pacific Japan, China with revenue for EMEA about flat. Total product book-to-bill for Q1 was slightly under one, similar to most prior Q1s.</p>
          <p>Total product revenue was $9.3 billion, up approximately 4% year-on-year. We believe our position in the industry at the convergence of the major transitions occurring in the market allows us to continue to drive solid financial performance despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. Total service revenue was $2.6 billion, up approximately 12%.</p>
          <p>We have seen strong growth in our Services business with a revenue compound annual growth rate of approximately 12% over the last decade, which has provided consistency to our financial results. Our Services business contributes to both long-term revenue growth as well as adding stability to our gross margins.</p>
          <p>Our Advanced Services business continues to perform well with growth over 20%. This business is a growing strategic asset where we are partnering with customers to build the architectures and end-to-end solutions to deliver business outcomes.</p>
          <p>Q1 FY 2013 total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.7%. That was up 0.8 percentage points quarter-over-quarter and also up 0.3 percentage points year-over-year. While we have variations in gross margins from quarter to quarter most often impacted by product mix driven by growth in several product areas, I am pleased with the benefits from the long &#x2013; of the strong focus that the entire company has had on gross margins.</p>
          <p>For product only, non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 61.5%, an increase of 1.1-percentage points quarter-over-quarter and also up 0.2 percentage points year-over-year. We saw strong execution in driving cost savings, lower overall manufacturing costs and improvements in our commodity pricing. We have invested and will continue to invest in value engineering, which has driven more stability of our product gross margins over these last multiple quarters.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP service margin for the first quarter was 66.9%, that was down from 67.1% last quarter and up from 66.8% in Q1 FY 2012. Our services gross margins continue to perform very well. We have driven productivity and cost improvements over time including, for example, increased automation in our service delivery and have delivered exceptionally high customer satisfaction results.</p>
          <p>Total gross margins by geographic region were 63.6% for the Americas, 63.3% for EMEA and 58.5% for APJC. Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $4.1 billion in Q1, up approximately $100 million when compared to Q4 FY 2012. The increase was due primarily to the addition of NDS operating expense in Q1 FY 2013. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 34.8% in the quarter, versus 34.4% in Q4. At the end of Q1, our head count totaled 72,360, and excluding the addition of approximately 5,750 NDS employees, our head count was slightly down from last quarter.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 27.9%, representing growth of 13%, which grew faster than our revenue. Our Q1 FY 2013 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 22%. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $2.6 billion, representing an increase of 11%. And as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 21.6%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter were $0.48 versus $0.43 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, which is a 12% increase.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income for the first quarter was $2.1 billion as compared to $1.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter were $0.39, versus $0.33 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2012.</p>
          <p>The total of cash, cash equivalents and investments at quarter end was $45 billion. That's down $3.7 billion from last quarter, due to the completion of our acquisition of NDS. Of this total balance, $7.5 billion was available within the U.S. at the end of Q1. The increase of $1.3 billion in our U.S. cash position from last quarter was driven by cash flows from operations as well as a distribution during the quarter of previously taxed earnings offset by cash we returned to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow from operations was approximately $2.5 billion. And we returned approximately $1 billion to our shareholders through the combination of a stock repurchase program as well as the quarterly dividend consistent with our capital allocation strategy that we discussed last quarter. We continue to closely manage our U.S. cash position, taking into consideration a number of variables including the dividend and the stock buy-back requirements, our operating cash flow, capital requirements, funding of our financing business and our acquisition strategy.</p>
          <p>In terms of our acquisition strategy, we closed several strategic acquisitions this quarter, including NDS, vCider and ThinkSmart and we expect to be active with acquisitions to drive our growth and value proposition with our customers.</p>
          <p>As we look forward, we continue to prefer small to medium sized deals that are a fit from a technology, strategy, culture and an ROIC perspective. We are pleased with the integration of NDS with the financial performance consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we provided at Q4 FY 2012 earnings call.</p>
          <p>Our results are reflective of the continued focus and execution around Operational Excellence. We have a number of initiatives that we are driving across the company including an enterprise-wide shared services organization that is delivering improved, global scalable capabilities and significant cost efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Over the last year and a half, we have been driving numerous operational initiatives and our expectations are to continue to deliver on these over the next three to five years. As we build a company that can be both innovative and disciplined, we will remain focused on achieving profitable growth where profits can grow faster than revenue over the long-term. We believe our strategy and financial model supports this goal and are confident in our ability to execute moving forward.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back over to John for more detail on our business lines and their trends. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank. I'll now provide a more detailed discussion of the market in our five foundational priority areas in terms of year-over-year revenue growth, followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of orders.</p>
          <p>First, our core business, Switching, revenues declined 2%. We saw solid growth in the Nexus data center Switching with the Nexus 2000, 5000 and 7000 lines, all growing in the high teens or better. We continued to see specific strength in massively scalable data centers. Macro challenges in the U.S. public sector and EMEA, that's our Europe, Middle East, and Africa operations, did have a negative impact on Switching revenues. I will remind you that Cisco's market share is disproportionately impacted by slowing in public sector and developed countries.</p>
          <p>Switching gross margins remain very stable, actually improving in Q1, and once again, versus 12 to 18 months ago back to where we were, Frank, at that time or above and just very solid progress across the company, Rob and Gary, nicely done. Our switching innovation across ASIC hardware and software is very strong and will drive our continued Switching leadership.</p>
          <p>Second, our NGN Routing portfolio remains strong, especially relative to our competitors. Our total revenue for NGN Routing declined 2%, driven primarily by weakness in EMEA, especially the service provider sector there and declines in optical networking due to product migration to faster speeds. We saw double-digit growth in total edge routing, with especially strong adoption of the ASR 9000, up approximately 80% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We continue to see strong momentum in SP Mobility where orders were up 86% year-over-year as SP addresses the capacity requirements associated with incremental global smartphone and tablet demand.</p>
          <p>Wireless continues to be one of our fastest growing businesses with revenue growth of 38%, the fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. We experienced strong growth throughout our portfolio, led by the 3600 series, outdoor access points and high-end controllers. We saw exceptional growth in APJC of approximately 45%. We are very well positioned for the explosion of mobility, BYOD, bring your own device, and SP Wi-Fi small cells and for example, SP Wi-Fi grew almost 100% year-over-year, granted off of a relatively small base at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Security grew 6% driven primarily by high-end and mid-range router, firewall platforms, growth in Web Security and strong adoption of our Identity Services engine. Transitions, like the move to cloud-based delivery models and BYOD, are fueling the growth and play to our strengths. We will continue to capitalize on the opportunities in the Security space.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Data Center, Data Center grew 61% fueled by our industry leadership, where we are delivering a unified data center strategy. Our unique ability to unify the physical and virtual while delivering on growing innovation around Unified Fabric, Unified Compute, and Unified Management, has helped solidify our position as a leader in next generation data centers.</p>
          <p>For the first time, we are starting to see our leadership in IT, especially the UCS pull through our communications products. This is especially important in terms of how CIOs are beginning to view Cisco not just as the leader in communications but view us as an IT player who also does communications. We saw a very good balance in Data Center globally. Growth was particularly strong in APJC, up 127% and in service providers up 102%. Enterprise grew 54% fueled by the rapid adoption of Romley-based servers.</p>
          <p>The innovation we've driven in UCS and the cloud, combined with our ability to drive the transition to a unified data center have enabled us to achieve the number two position in the x86 blade servers category in the U.S., and the number three position worldwide, a category we entered only three short years ago. We are also number four in the overall server market, a market few thought we could penetrate.</p>
          <p>We will drive the same level of innovation in the evolution of the unified data center that we drove in the compute market with the UCS. Cisco's strategy for enabling programmability of a network to drive application intelligence, focus on operational simplicity and cost effectiveness while leveraging the decades of existing network investments is what our customers are looking for. With an integrated software, plus software plus ASICs and hardware approach we believe Cisco alone can deliver the scale, resilience, investment protection and features customers demand in this evolution.</p>
          <p>Moving onto collaboration, collaboration declined 8% facing a difficult compare with Q1 FY'12, which is a record quarter for our collaboration products. We continued to drive our software momentum, and this quarter drove deployment of 2.2 million Jabber software clients. We continue to see challenges in our TelePresence business, down in the mid-teens and the U.S. Federal business, off more than 30% for TelePresence year-over-year.</p>
          <p>You will see us continue to pull together our TelePresence, Unified Communication and WebEx offerings into an integrated open architecture that enables communication of any device to any other, with consistent experience and unparalleled ease of use. We believe this strategy will position us well to address the evolving requirements for this market.</p>
          <p>We need to do a better job in fabrication and we'll continue to invest in collaboration and sales execution to capitalize on this very important market for us.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Video, total service provider Video revenue was up 30%, of which NDS contributed approximately 20%. As you'd expect, NDS had and is expected to continue to have a very positive impact on SP Video margins. Video, mobility, cloud, speed of service delivery and monetization of the network loads continue to be the top priorities of our Service Provider customers. Our unique ability to provide an integrated architectural approach is an area of major differentiation strength for Cisco to address in many, if not most all, of the Service Providers around the world.</p>
          <p>Finally, our architectural approach, built off of market transitions and focused on delivering solutions to our customers' top priorities is moving us from an IP communication provider to a strategic business partner, with many of our customers worldwide.</p>
          <p>One of the most strategic differentiations is our Services capability of Cisco and our partners. Our ability to integrate services, engineering, sales, provides speed to market and innovation. And it's an area of sustainable differentiation for Cisco and equally important, for our partners. A growing number of our opportunities are led by Services, delivered by both Cisco and our partners. This business has consistently grown in the low double digits with very strong gross margins and is a key growth area for Cisco. We anticipate you will see our Services businesses continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our total business. In summary, we are pleased with our performance across most of our priority areas.</p>
          <p>I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and customer segments growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders, unless specifically stated otherwise. In Q1, Cisco's total product orders were flat year-over-year. I would again remind you that we reported 13% growth in product orders in Q1 of last year, that is Q1 of fiscal year 2012, making for very challenging comparisons. Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, specifically the American region grew 2%, Latin America within the America region grew 3%, led by Brazil up 24% and Mexico up 11%. Canada was down approximately 12% with a very tough compare with last year's Q1 FY 2012 where growth was 34% again in Q1 of last year.</p>
          <p>As we discussed last quarter, we believe the U.S. must lead the global economic recovery. Looking at the U.S. we saw continued positive trends with U.S. Service Providers up 13% year-over-year; U.S. Enterprise up 9%; and U.S. Commercial, that is not including Public Sector, up 5%. The federal government was as tough as we expected. It was down 15% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The Asia Pacific, Japan and China region grew 7%. India had a very solid quarter with growth of over 50%. Japan grew in the mid-single digits and China was flat. China is very important to Cisco. We want Cisco to be very important to China's transformation. We have invested a lot of resources and innovation in China for the last 20 years and our commitment to China has not changed in any way.</p>
          <p>Our Europe, Middle East, Africa and Russian region declined by approximately 10% year-over-year. Europe continues to be as challenging as we expected. We have a very strong sales team there and we'll get our fair share of the business. Nice way of saying, Rob, I think Chris will get everything there is to get from our perspective.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to a customer market view where I will provide some additional details to quantify the impact of Europe so you will have a better understanding of the details of our global performance. In Europe, we saw Enterprise decrease in the mid-teens. Service Provider declined in the high-teens. Our Service Provider business grew in low-double-digits in both the Americas and Asia Pacific, Japan and China. However, when you add these three together, Service Provider, orders in total only grew 3%. Enterprise, excluding Europe, grew in the mid-single-digits led by the U.S. as stated earlier with growth of 9%. Commercial grew 1%. Public Sector declined 6% although it grew in Asia Pacific, Japan and China in mid-single-digits.</p>
          <p>While we feel very good about our performance and our opportunity, we all understand the uncertainty in the current macroeconomic environment. Specifically we are modeling Europe to get worse before it gets better.</p>
          <p>We see signs of improvement in the U.S. in both Enterprise, Service Provider and Commercial. Unfortunately, it's still too early to call this a trend, but we are continuing to see what we like and we feel good about our momentum in Asia Pacific, Japan and China and anticipate this region to continue to be our fastest growing region in the world.</p>
          <p>Now, Frank, let me turn it back over to you for our guidance for Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks again, John.</p>
          <p>Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook, our guidance for second quarter. First, let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements and you should review our recent SEC filings that identify the important risk factors and also understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>The guidance is based on current pipeline and our view of the business trends based upon the information we have available today and actual results could be above or below our guidance.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we are basing our guidance on neither a significant improvement nor deterioration in the global macroeconomic conditions in the near future. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.</p>
          <p>For Q2 FY 2013, we expect revenue growth be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. For the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, and our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the second quarter. Our Q2 FY 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range between $0.47 and $0.48 per share, and we anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q2 will be $0.08 to $0.11 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS. This range includes our typical differences as well as an impact of $0.01 as a result of anticipated restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>Other than those quantified items above, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or any other events, which may or may not be significant.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.</p>
          <p>Related to our July 2011 announcements on restructuring, we have incurred a total pre-tax charge of approximately $1.1 billion, which is consistent with our expectation. Any remaining charges that we expect will be incurred during the remainder of FY 2013 related to these actions are not expected to be significant.</p>
          <p>John, back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank.</p>
          <p>As I reflect on Q1 FY 2013, I am very pleased with our execution as a company. We delivered on our commitment to you, our shareholders, to our partners and to our customers. Each of us as Cisco employees takes pride in our revenue growth of 6%, non-GAAP gross margins of 62.7%, non-GAAP expense growth of only 1%, $2.5 billion in cash from operations and 12% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Our innovation, operational discipline and ongoing evolution is separating Cisco from many of our peers. Never in our past have we had so many growth opportunities in front of us. While the economy and emerging competitors will always present challenges and new technology transitions will always require Cisco to lead and adjust, we have an unparalleled track record of managing and evolving our businesses to emerge stronger. As I look ahead, I see the opportunities in the commercial marketplace, cloud, mobility and video driving our business today.</p>
          <p>I also see our plans to aggressively expand our Software and Services business, our emerging markets opportunity and our security architecture as an additional driver of our business going forward. Perhaps driving and contributing to all of these opportunities is the biggest market transition for us yet. The Internet of Everything as a platform, bringing together people, process data and things to connect the 99% of the world that is not connected today. We have an unprecedented ability to harness and turn the information that will flow across networks into new capabilities, richer experiences and unprecedented economic opportunities for the businesses, individuals and countries. The opportunity for Cisco in the intelligent network is clear and compelling.</p>
          <p>We expect to capitalize on these opportunities the same way we have done for almost three decades, bringing innovation to our customers' most important challenges and opportunities, leveraging our scale and reach in every market, every segment and capitalizing on our strong balance sheet to make the right moves for our business and for our customers.</p>

          <p>Just wanted to ask you a question on the environment. It was interesting to hear your commentary, and unless I missed it, without once mentioning any kind of impact from either the fiscal cliff or the financial services vertical, in fact you commented that the U.S. enterprise is improving so I would love to get your feedback on that in the context of the fiscal cliff.</p>
          <p>And then related to that as we look out into next year, I also didn't hear your comment much on your thoughts on the carrier CapEx environment in the wake of AT&amp;T's announcement and the SoftBank Sprint announcement. So I would love to get your thoughts into the opportunity for next year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Simona, since you're the first one I'll answer both questions and then, Mel, you'll keep us to one.</p>
          <p>If you look at the trend, we've believed for almost a year, unfortunately, that for the U.S. has to lead the total globe out of this economic slowdown. It's not going to come from Europe. And while we were all hopeful about emerging countries, they just aren't going to be strong enough to really drive us out of this slowdown.</p>
          <p>So we're watching very carefully the spending in the U.S. enterprise. Now those U.S. enterprises don't include the large global financials, Simona, in those numbers. And the U.S. enterprise has gone literally as you look over this last year in terms of the direction, a year ago, it was 15% growth. Then it was 5%, then 0%, then 5%, and then this quarter, 9% and the number of large deals, that Brian Marlier, who runs this operation, is seeing are up both in terms of the number and the size of those deals pretty solid.</p>
          <p>Service provider growth in the U.S. is another indication and it grew 13% this last quarter. While areas such as AT&amp;T have announced some pretty aggressive capital spending year-over-year, I think, Mel, it was 15% type of numbers? And we're obviously a beneficiary of that. And the Sprint SoftBank where we're very good customers with both companies and very strong relationships all the way up to Masa Son [Masayoshi Son] who was on my Board many years ago as well as Dan Hesse, who's a good friend as well. We've done a good job with both those accounts and would expect to get our fair share in those areas.</p>
          <p>The commercial marketplace hasn't turned up quite as much. The pipeline, Rob, is a little bit better in the commercial marketplace than Alison's [Alison Gleeson] territory in the U.S. We'd like to watch that a little bit longer. And we'd like to see the trends remain strong for another quarter before we'd say it's a given. But we like what we're seeing trend-wise in this category.</p>
          <p>Service provider spending, if their revenues are looking up, they're going spend more. And I think you are going to see a mixed spending environment on a global basis. Our Service Provider spending year-over-year in terms of our ability to benefit from it has been in the mid-single digits, I think, Rob, depending on the geography, to low-teens, consistently taking Europe out of the number. As I said unfortunately, Simona, Europe was down in Service Providers 19% year-over-year. That clearly has a huge impact on our revenue for router numbers as well as our Switching numbers when we look into it. So I think Service Provider spending is improving but again, the Service Provider customers are no different than my other enterprise customers, uncertainty in this market causes them to spend slower.</p>
          <p>I personally think the fiscal cliff, we're going to work through that probably with a little bit of saber rattling on both sides. We're looking more towards the tax policy and is government able to instill the confidence in business that allows them really to reinvest? If I were to look at one model, we ought to look at carefully around the world, it's Canada. The easiest place to do business. It doesn't matter which party is in power, even their provinces, i.e., their states, when the national government, Prime Minister Harper gets it. The leaders in Ottawa get it. They drive down through and make it very easy to do business there and you're going to see us grow our business there as well as invest overall.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's one of business confidence. I do think that is the wildcard that can make a difference whether we're going to grow GDP at a 2% give or take a little bit or get it back where it belongs at 3% plus. The companies do have the cash to spend if they have the confidence to invest.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John. Thanks very much for taking the question. It seems as though you all have put services in a much more prominent position in your script this time around. I'm &#x2013; can you help us understand what efforts you are undertaking to grow your Services business?</p>
          <p>And just in general a broader question, where would you like your recurring revenue percentage of sales to get to over an unspecified period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two questions that I think are very appropriate. You did read us right in terms of the issue on Services. Gary and I have believed for a while that we could, as the market moves to more of an architectural play and solving business problems and focusing on solutions, services both from Cisco and from our partners together could have a major uptake for us in differentiation versus our peers.</p>
          <p>When you sit down with the CEO of service provider or an enterprise account or a large commercial or government environment, we often sit down with services-led sales and implementation. With the change that we made putting Edzard Overbeek in charge of Services reporting to Gary was not subtle. We took one of our best global salespeople, who's a great General Manager, and combined him with a world-class services operation to say, how does engineering, sales and services work seamlessly together? So we would anticipate growth in Services looking out over the three to five year window to both grow absolutely, but also to grow as a percentage of our total revenues. Stay tuned, more to come in FAC coming up, in terms of our Financial Analyst Conference in December.</p>
          <p>In terms of recurring revenue, getting there is the difficult part. It would be very easy to take your current revenue and just recur it over next three years, and the people who replace the four of us would very much appreciate that. The key is how do you get over? Frank didn't smile at that. But the key is &#x2013; as we move into this, you're going watch us. It is easier on our shareholders but also easier on our business model to move to more and more recurring revenues.</p>
          <p>So as we do implementations in new areas, as we acquire new companies such as NDS, we will very much focus both on the recurring revenue stream, because they're new to Cisco, it makes it easier to introduce without a dramatic drop in terms of year-over-year revenue. And we're also going to focus more and more on the software content. So you're going to see us focus on all three of those areas. You read it pretty accurate in terms of reoccurring revenue and also our focus on the role of services increasing both in normal growth areas but also in terms of a percentage of our total sales. Obviously, we're all pleased with the gross margins in that area as well.</p>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>John, clearly, there are some parts of the business that are struggling right now, like collaboration that you mentioned. Is there a way you can kind of go area by area and tell us the areas where you truly believe that you are gaining share versus areas of challenges where you still think it's going to take some time before you balance out the business?</p>
          <p>One clarification from Frank, Frank, can you give us how much NDS revenue was in the quarter? And how you're thinking about it next? And kind of trying to understand the service provider service ex-NDS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. So in terms of &#x2013; now we're talking about areas of growth for collaboration and areas of challenge. Collaboration was down 8% year-over-year off of a very strong Q1 of last year, not only a record, but the growth numbers were well into double digits. In terms of what went well, Unified Communications continues to be our leader there. It is whether you use Gartner's four quadrant area, it's the number one play in Gartner's quadrant and what we're doing with Jabber I think is very, very solid.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately collaboration tends to be one of those areas, and several of our peers have seen this as well, that during tough economic times, the people just take their foot off the gas and watch. So you are seeing some of that. You're also seeing a requirement for us to tie together our WebEx portfolio including Jabber, including Unified Communications with TelePresence into a single call manager, which clearly we're going do. It's got to be easier to use. I keep using the words CEO idiot-proof in terms of the direction.</p>
          <p>In terms of areas that also saw the pressure on it, clearly we were impacted, a large percentage of our business, the federal government isn't just our biggest customer, it's the biggest by multiple factors and the spending was down in federal government pretty dramatically. Not just overall spending down 15% but obviously this area getting just really clobbered and Europe, Middle East, Africa, but especially Europe and the developing countries, was an area that we also got hit in.</p>
          <p>I don't want to, in any way, however say that we don't have to improve here. If you look at our five foundational building blocks overlaid by Security, Mobility and any-to-any, this is the area that I think you're going to see us focus on the most. Rob, both from the field perspective and, Gary, from a Services perspective and from an engineering with Martin's team and Roland [Roland Acra], who is a new addition to the team going forward.</p>
          <p>We needed to also get all these underneath a single engineering leadership and tightly tied to what we're doing in the field. It's a longwinded way of saying we're all over this, but we anticipate it being a tough battle, especially if we don't see the economy pick up from the present levels.</p>
          <p>Thanks, Ittai. And, Frank, on the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ittai, as far as NDS, so last quarter when we gave guidance for Q1, I said that we had approximately $200 million assumed in that guidance for NDS and as I said earlier on the call today, that we executed according to our expectations. So not only from a revenue perspective but we also executed on the margin as well as on the cost side with the inclusion of NDS plus certain costs that we added for some of the integration which we have already started. So things overall from an NDS perspective as of three months are going quite well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have a question on gross margin. Gross margin was above expectations. I'm wondering what is the combination of drivers this quarter Is it that existing products improved in their margins or is it just the mix that certain things grew faster than other things?</p>
          <p>And then you're guiding back to the same 61.5% gross margin for next quarter. So why do you expect things to reverse back to where they were in the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, Tal. Very fair question. Gary I'm going ask you to comment on the second on our overall focus on gross margins. If you look at it from a company perspective, we have put a lot of time into this, this last year and you have seen our dramatic improvement in switching, as an example, but also our improvement in areas such as collaboration where Martin's team has been all over it. That was before we added NDS, which obviously helps our gross margins as well. You're seeing us focus on, and you'll see programs in the field start to roll out with encouraging benefits and rewards for lower discounting in terms of the balance as well.</p>
          <p>If you watch what the engineering teams have done, they focus not only on not having redundancies, sharing common ASICs, etcetera, but it has been an ongoing process. Gary, let me have you take it the second step in terms of our focus here. And then Frank, I'm going to let you summarize with the answer to his question in terms of it being primarily a mix issue but level-setting his question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, Tal, the work that we've been doing and I think I said this a year ago, was that we're going to double down on the things that will drive margin, gross margins across the company. It's not just engineering. It's not just supply chain. And it's not just our selling ability. It's bringing all those things together in a constructive way so that we're driving component purchases. We're driving value design with shared components, shared ASICs across a broader set of platforms. And then taking that to market with a sales force and a channel organization that understands the pricing, understands the market much better, has better visibility and to drive our discounting in a way that we're not leaving money on the table.</p>
          <p>So it's all three of those things and the whole company continues to be focused on gross margins. And we believe we've done an excellent job. We told you that we felt we would be able to do this and we've executed to it. We've not given up. We're actually doubling down again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank? To answer the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Q1, the major driver, as Gary just mentioned, if you look at it is the cost improvements. It has been the biggest driver of the gross margin improvement quarter-on-quarter and it's across all the products, for all the initiatives that Gary just talked about with a strong focus on value engineering, commodity elements and things like that.</p>
          <p>Second, I would say is that our pricing and discount was within the typical range of the quarter. So there was no material change from a quarter-on-quarter standpoint. Then the other part is the mix in Q1, what had less of a negative impact than we saw in Q4. Primarily we had strength from a mix perspective with the NGN Routing. Then we also had less of an impact on the Data Center business within the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now moving forward into Q2 and the guidance we gave of 61% to 62%, the major delta from quarter-on-quarter is really the mix dynamics, and what we're assuming on a couple of the major segments that will have that kind of an impact, the SP Video, the data center as well as NGN routing from a mix standpoint.</p>
          <p>And then also what I would say is just looking at it from a transaction standpoint, we've actually done a lot of work in the pipeline looking at the transactions. We look at some of the transactions and taking the mix of those transactions is also a factor in looking at that range of 61% to 62%. If you go back and look at this past year, FY 2012, you'll see the margins do kind of vary a bit from quarter to quarter primarily because of mix and also because of some of the transactions. And so it's not something that's out of the ordinary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Frank, you mentioned that some of the U.S. cash balance today is a result of bringing over or distributing some overseas cash that seems to have been &#x2013; you had previously paid taxes on. I wonder how much more you have of that that you could bring over that we could be looking of your overseas cash that can come over kind of without penalty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. From time to time we do make distributions of our cash to the U.S. from foreign subsidiary earnings that have previously been taxed by the United States. And this quarter we had a higher amount. I mentioned this last quarter as well. We'll continue to have some from period to period, and that's one of the things that we've taken into consideration last quarter when we announced the capital allocation strategy going forward. So we're factoring that in, kind of looking at that as also one of the factors on the U.S. cash and then being able to support the dividend as well as the stock buy-back to be able to distribute the cash at least about 50% of free cash flow on an annual basis.</p>

          <p>I understand. On the &#x2013; so on routing, you made some interesting comments. The Service Provider edge routing business seemed to be growing double digits. Most people are thinking routing in general these days as a low single digit, almost an ex-growth kind of business. You didn't mention core routing, and I'm wondering is what you're seeing in core routing kind of offsetting edge routing so we are really looking at routing going forward as kind of a low single digit overall business? And is Service Provider edge routing sort of riding some sort of share gains or some kind of cycle that's going on right now? Although it seems to be hurt on the other side out of Europe, it appears that at a guess routing is doing weak in Europe as well? So as we look forward, can we be looking forward to routing being kind of a high single digit to maybe 10 percentage kind of market going forward? Or is it really &#x2013; how do we look at the different pieces of routing? Is that something you can be...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to stay away from long-term guidance in the conference call here. I never mind, Ehud, you asking. It's something we're going to focus on in the Financial Analyst Conference in December and our growth expectations by product category. But in terms of your specific question, let me answer it maybe in terms of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our edge routing tends to be very order centric. So for example, as I've said in the call, the revenue on the 9000 edge fixed router was up 80% year-over-year. The revenue on the 5000 was actually very low but the orders were by far and away the best orders we've seen, dramatically high book to bill with 80% growth there. So we didn't get much revenue growth. In fact, slightly down on the 5000 this quarter. You're seeing a huge pipeline go into next quarter. And the 9000 we did get very solid growth both on orders and balance. Now my experience has been you tend to grow in the core and then as you get that built out to handle the capacity, then you grow in the edge. Then you build out edge, and as it begins to hit loads then you go back into core. They tend to go back and forth on that.</p>
          <p>And there are a lot of different views on routing growth on it. We always get too pessimistic on it during the tough time and too optimistic on the good times. We'll address that a little bit. But I think it's fair to say mid-single digits is conceptually where the consensus comes out. There will be periods where it's low like this quarter and periods where it's high, hopefully, in the future as well. And we'll try to cover that, Ehud, in more detail in the financial conference coming up in December.</p>

          <p>Hi, John. Good to see the operational improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. We're doing well. Gary's doing a great job, so is Rob and Frank is all over us all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we turn to the investor focus that's really related to possible structural changes to the switching and routing market? John, we understand your view of intelligent networks. Yet what are the customers saying about the future of switching and routing and just kind of the division of labor between software and hardware?</p>
          <p>Also there's a recurrent theme to improved gross margins. Longer-term, the margins actually move higher, but should we be concerned about revenue growth actually moving lower? I'm trying to get a sense of how the dynamics change your financial model over the interim and longer-term, or is it rather just operational focus that just drives gross margins higher and higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a whole bunch of questions, let me start off with the 30,000-foot view try to land the plane very quickly. If you watch the growth of the Internet, we see it actually at the next stage of growth in an explosion there. The Internet of Everything isn't just a nice concept connecting 99% of the devices that aren't connected. It has huge implications for big data, huge implications of where you put processing and storage throughout the network, huge implications on security, programmability, flexibility, etcetera.</p>
          <p>So you are going to see the growth occur in multiple areas and we do see a number of both existing growth opportunities going well such as wireless, such as edge as you articulated and growth in the future in terms of the services, the software that we referred to, recurring revenue stream with our acquisitions and acquisitions will continue to add 1 to 2 points in terms of our objective in growth per year as we move forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of the customers, they're after how do you solve their problems. Those problems vary dramatically if you're an academic location versus a massively scalable data center versus somebody who is interested in cloud, versus Service Provider versus Enterprise and we're going to approach that, as you would expect us to do, with a multiple software and hardware level.</p>
          <p>To your indirect nudge, you are going to see us do more in software, both in terms of areas we're going to focus on in solutions, but also software in the stack. You'll see us do more strategic within this. Switching and routing are at the core. And we do not believe that it's just going to be a software world any more than it's going to be just a hardware world. We do believe that ASICs are going to play a much more predominant role than many people anticipate in this and putting software in ASICs, as we all know, if you really want fast performance, is one of the key ways you can differentiate yourself when you already have the scale and resiliency.</p>
          <p>So I like our cards. I like how we're positioned. We don't miss market transitions. You can give us a lot of grief about many things over the last 20 years, but we usually get it right ahead of people, i.e. the cloud and where we are today in the data center, or IP telephony or the role that business models are going to change in Service Provider or we very quickly adjust within it. And it's one that I know there are a lot of opinions on. You're going to see us all over this the next couple years. And we think we're positioned very well for the future.</p>
          <p>Rob, I'm going work you in on this one even though I've already given a long answer. Your thoughts a little bit about where we're going head in these areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think our message is getting out there that the whole construct of software separation of the control plane and the data plane means different things to different people. You touched on it. Large-scale controllers and agents need something quite different to a large-scale cloud provider or a very large enterprise customer. We've had a chance to review our roadmap in this area and our customers love it. They just want us to get there faster because we have what they're looking for. On the idea of overlay networks, where we actually are going to combine the construct of a virtual overlay with our significant footprint in physical networks, it's very clear that this migration that will go on over a decade in traditional data centers is going to require both. I think we will lead in the transition from physical to virtual with what we're doing with our Nexus 1000V and this family of network virtual services that we're leading with.</p>
          <p>Finally, the one we haven't talked about much, but could be the biggest impact for our customers is creating programmability to the operating systems they've relied on. XR, iOS XR in Service Provider, iOS, which is predominant across the enterprise. And when we start to touch the applications that our customers run, we start to touch the experience they can deliver to their clients. So the whole idea of software tied to ASICs and our very comprehensive platform is being understood by customers. And I think it's going to open a lot of opportunity for Cisco in the future.</p>

          <p>Hey, Brian.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John. So a question you talked a lot about the strength in your order book for the UCS or the evolved packet core, the 5K product line. Can you talk about what's driving that? Is that LTE? Can you give us a little geographic color? And given your role in the evolved packet core do you see and it's kind of role as a central nervous system of an LTE architecture, do you see getting into more of the access side of LTE as a company? And if so, how would you go about doing that? I'm talking about base stations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me say that all of those factors I agree with the first two. You're seeing an explosion for us in the data center, both taking share and for the first time, this is a key point, the CIOs are looking at us as an IT player that is suddenly starting to pull through communications. While that sounds basic, it is huge step for us in terms of the direction. There are many things feeding the packet core, LTE, and the explosion of 3G/4G. And in terms of base stations traditional, no.</p>
          <p>But in terms of the future, we're going where the market is where it can be the margins in architecture plays and that's around SP Wi-Fi which we grew at about 100% year-over-year and it isn't the growth rate because it's still a relatively small number, approaching 100 million. It's the number of SP Wi-Fi wins we've had. Then we're going to move into small cell and then we're going to combine small cell with SP Wi-Fi, with 3G, with 4G, with our architectural plays, with applications and programmability and flexibility, Rob referred to earlier. And then it gets exciting. So in traditional base stations, no. Base stations for the future, small cell in the home, top of pole capabilities, the answer would be yes, Brian.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It seems gross margin and OpEx as they translate into operating margin are key to your ability to maintain and grow your healthy 10 plus billion annual cash flow. I've got two questions, related questions. One, your OpEx is 34.8% as a percentage of revenue. I think 34.0% was your post-bubble best a couple quarters ago. I know you're running the company more towards a value bias now. Can you improve upon that 34% in terms of how much room you have to get OpEx lower as a percentage of revenue?</p>
          <p>Related to that, your gross margin has now run 62% to 63% in the last three quarters with your product margin running 61-plus in seven of the last eight quarters. I know you're not giving long-term guidance but it's been an impressive performance over the last two years after the big comedown from two years ago. How much stability can we expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going take the last question and give the OpEx question, which is much harder, Frank, to you. So if you'll take the first part I'll take the second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just, Paul, to put it in perspective on the OpEx standpoint, clearly the work that we've done over the last year and a half around some of the restructuring that we've done and also the focus on Operational Excellence has been critical to get to the point where we are right now. We do a tremendous amount of work both on the gross margin as well as on the OpEx in focusing on the portfolio.</p>
          <p>We've been able in the last year and a half to really drive a whole approach across the business and looking at return and making sure that we use that as a basis for making decisions and that has allowed us to be much more efficient in where we make our investments and also where we expect the payoff to be in the longer term. That's a factor that's not only for the current performance but also as we get into the long range model that we provided last year.</p>
          <p>So I would say that the 35% as a percentage of revenue is clearly a good number as we've seen in the last couple of quarters. We want to make sure as we go into the future through that portfolio approach we're making the right investments to drive innovation, to be able to kind of stay within the range of what we talked about a year ago and driving revenue growth in that 5 to 7 over longer period of time. And then continue to support the 7 to 9 of profit as a range of what we provided last year and we'll update that as we get continued new information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in the second part of the question, if you looked versus 18 or 24 months ago when the gross margins deteriorated we made the mistake of bringing out five new product lines in Switching at dramatically lower gross margins especially at the high end of the Switching product, the 7K all at one time. And before, we've not been as good on innovation or bringing them out as quick but we also weren't as effective in designing them to be able to improve their gross margins quickly.</p>
          <p>So first takeaway is, you won't see us announce five new products at the same time. Second key takeaway is that you'll see us design for higher gross margins and think more through the second and third moves within the gross margins as you do continuous price performance improvements and design for those.</p>
          <p>You will see us also drive through it what Gary said earlier, common ASICs, common sharing. We didn't need as many platforms. You'll see us do a better job on that. And instead of taking I don't know how long ago the Nexus 7K was announced but we're just getting it finally up to normal gross margins. So a compliment to the 7K team, we didn't design it with proper gross margins in mind, but you all have really done an amazing job of getting the gross margins back up to where we would expect.</p>
          <p>But to your point, Paul, I do not see something fundamental changing. I'm very much aware of the software issues some of you are looking at and other issues. I don't see a fundamental change on the horizon that if we execute right we won't play out where those gross margins feel pretty good in our core products.</p>
          <p>What I think is our mix and our mix issue when you're growing an area like UCS that is really becoming very material and we're in UCS not for growth reasons. It's control of the data center. It's ability to be the primary data center provider when you host an interface into all the hypervisors, when you look at processor power combined with the network, combined with storage, the ability to do that with an open architecture where almost every peer trusts us even if we might compete, is a unique opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>So I think it's going be more subject to mix and we clearly both hear the message, but secondly, we're focusing very aggressively even though it'll take us a couple years to do it, much more software, much more recurring revenue in terms of the approach.</p>
          <p>So I feel good about that. We're much tougher on designing products consistently at a given gross margins when they come out. And you won't see us announce a whole bunch at the same time but we're not seeing any abnormal pricing pressure.</p>
          <p>Rob, your thoughts?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wanted to see if you could comment on China both from a broad perspective as well as from a Huawei perspective particularly in light of the Congressional study that, I guess, probably brought more attention to the issue in the public domain and wonder how you think about the potential for either a trade war with China or competitive threats as Huawei currently stands &#x2013; whether that's changing for you? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first of all, I think it's very important that the issues involved here are not between countries. We take on a competitor like Huawei very aggressively. And if you were look back to what I think Paul alluded to earlier &#x2013; even 15 or 18 months ago a lot of people had concerns about that Juniper and HP and Huawei eating our lunch and how we were losing share and how they had a better architecture and better products. Fast forward 18 months later, we're beating them all. And that doesn't mean we will do it in the future but we know how to compete and we know how to compete very toughly.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Congressional study it's real important to know contrary to what was in the Washington Post we did not have anything to do with that, nor would we have done that. And that does put pressure on us in China. The nice thing about the Chinese leadership is they are developed very carefully both business and government through a study that makes the GE school in Crotonville look slow in terms of how they develop their leaders. And I think you'll see they'll do the right thing on a progressive basis both for their country and for the interface with the U.S.</p>
          <p>The two countries have to work very closely together. We're going to compete aggressively where appropriate versus our competitors overall. And so I think there'll be a little bit of give and take especially in our communications industry but I think you'll see the two sides work it out because it's in the best interest of the world to do that and both economies, and candidly in the best interest of the U.S. as well on it. So I see the probabilities of those issues, being a trade war, etcetera, being very low.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a clarification on the impact of China, particularly on the margins because you guys had guided in the FAC last year that margins were going to be impacted negatively. Do you think that this now &#x2013; if revenues do slow from China, which looks like they may, that margins actually &#x2013; you feel a tailwind from that?</p>
          <p>And then I guess I'd circle back around, Frank, to your commentary on the margin guidance. It still feels like it's awfully weak what you're guiding considering what you're delivering. It feels like the margin guidance really ought to be at least 50 basis points maybe a little bit higher. Because even if you ex out the NDS impacts we still get just under 62.5% on the gross margin this quarter which is pretty strong. So if you can just comment on that, it would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Couple thoughts. First on China. We are committed to China. We are invested full force. We will partner in China and we'll work through ups and downs in the China market. We do think with the challenges going on that we will be under pressure in China for the next couple quarters and we've modeled that into our business analysis. But as I alluded to earlier, the Chinese are very effective in government and business. They will do what's right for the long-term and candidly we will earn their trust and the ability to partner in the country. So I don't model that for a sustained issue. I see it a couple quarter issue in terms of how we move in that marketplace.</p>
          <p>In terms of the question on gross margins, the effect of emerging markets, we've got to do two things. What Gary and Rob are both focused on is how do we design products for emerging markets with the average selling price being something that market can afford, be it the business or the end-user/consumer in terms of buying the services from the business. And so you continue to see us focus on those areas. But I think in terms of mix of emerging countries on large deals, there will continue to be and I hope there are because that means there are a number of large deals, Frank, that will impact that. And that's incremental profit for us even though it's at lower margins, but its profit you either get or you don't.</p>
          <p>In terms of the guidance, just before I give Frank the comment on that. Frank, who would have thought 12 months ago we would be defending guidance being too weak at 61% to 62% and increasing? We ought to be more optimistic. So first a compliment to the three of you and then how do you answer the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Rod, the comment you mentioned about the China and emerging country transactions, clearly we had mentioned that a couple quarters ago, as John just said. We've had kind of some in a particular quarter and not in others. And so that's one of the variabilities that we look at, what I was referring to earlier, about some of the transactions that we have visibility to that we take into consideration when we give guidance.</p>
          <p>The key thing for us, as I said before, is to factor in that, plus look at the mix dynamics across the business as the data center growth has been impacted in one quarter the other as well as SP Video, which I factored in. Hopefully &#x2013; we're in a situation where the guidance is conservative and we can do better than that. But we want to make sure that we have a realistic view right now based on the information that we have. And that was taken into consideration the guidance that we gave of 61% to 62%.</p>

          <p>Thank you. My question is on the unified data center. John, you talked about it a few times. From a partnerships perspective, how do you see that progressing? There seems to be some pressure on your partnership with EMC with VMware's acquisition of Nicira. How do you see your other partnerships playing out and with some getting stronger and some getting weaker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First commenting on EMC and Nicira with VMware. I think Joe Tucci said it best earlier this week. And he basically said in one of their conferences that Cisco is their most strategic partner and will continue to be. But he was also very candid; the Nicira deal did clearly put pressure on us and them in terms of the relationship. Gary, you and Rob have been heading this for us for three or four years. They're going to continue to be our strongest partner and we're going to be very good there together. So you're going see us work together on VCE and other focus areas and continue to get very healthy growth there.</p>
          <p>In terms of opening up, however, the relationships, you are seeing us move with Citrix and you saw the first of a series of announcements there. You're going to see us get closer to players like NetApp and Red Hat, probably Microsoft, IBM if they'll have us. And you will see us do much what VMware's done in terms of an open approach to the market, supporting all four hypervisors, multiple players on the stack, etcetera. And more what we do best which is we will partner tightly with a few players, but we also are going to be able to empower the major transitions; overall they're going to the market. And after we work through this, actually, we think we're much stronger positioned now than we were at the time of the Nicira announcement and I think we're well positioned for the future.</p>
          <p>Rob, it's something that you've been heavily involved in and your thoughts?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, John, if we support any hypervisor, any orchestration and management layer, any storage partnership, and we do so with really tightly integrated solutions, we're solving the problem that customers are challenged with. We're going to combine the N1K, the Nexus 1000 V, with a series of virtualized services &#x2013; virtualized WAS, virtualized routing, virtualized security &#x2013; and map those to the physical networks that our customers have relied on across any hypervisor. That's actually what our customers want us to do. So I think our strategy here is what they're looking for. I think a unified data center is what they're asking for. And then combining the physical with the virtual in a way that only Cisco can is actually our strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. How are you? Wanted to kind of go back to the quarter and the real surprise here is the stability we're seeing in Americas growth rate. I think 7% growth this quarter, 7% growth last quarter, I think 7% growth last year. That's quite different than what we heard from some of the enterprise peers that reported their results in September. So could you, maybe, walk us through how much of the stability you're seeing in Americas is driven by Cisco's share gains versus the seasonal improvement that perhaps you had an extra month here in October that you benefited from, just tied to kind of traditional enterprise year end spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a series of questions. First, so I get all the numbers right for the people listening. The Americas in total grew 2%. We had some areas that did very well, some areas that did not grow as much. Within the U.S., it grew a total of 2% for the quarter, in terms of the bookings, it was hit pretty hard by federal which was down 15% year-over-year. But the enterprise segment of the U.S., and this is Brian's team, did move from 15% growth five quarters ago to five to zero to five to plus nine. And what you're seeing is, as I alluded to earlier, a consistency of more large deals and more deals in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>That piece feels good. We are not seeing that growth in what we call our global accounts, our top 24, they're largely financials. The financials are still spinning very slow. So some of you are getting your indication of growth rates from the financials you probably were surprised by how we grew this quarter because that segment of the market is continuing to stay a little bit tough.</p>
          <p>In terms of what I'd like to see, I'd like to see the enterprise continue and do it more consistently throughout the quarter. And then I'd like to see the commercial come up three or four points in terms of growth rates. If you see that and stability of Service Provider, then candidly the numbers are almost always indicative of economic growth. You see it first in CapEx, then you see it in job hiring.</p>
          <p>Now, to your indirect question. We did see both in Q1 a push at the end of the quarter, which you always see with real strong sales force, and we did see it again in Q4 of last year. So for the last two quarters, we closed hard and, Rob, it's a world class sales organization that really goes for everything and then we start off slow again the next month in the new quarter within that. So it was a little bit more back end loaded, both this quarter and the quarter before. But both of those numbers were good numbers in the last month or month and-a-half of the quarter.</p>
          <p>So I'd like to see it continue. But the balance was there. Part of that's market share but the trend is what you've got to watch. And we were probably gaining share earlier even when the trend was lower as well. So we very much appreciate you all's kind words about growing at mid-single digits when our peers are often shrinking in mid-single digits. But we think part of it's share, but I think we're in the right market at the right time. And mainly our customers are changing how the buy.</p>
          <p>They're buying architectures and they're buying the ability to help solve their solutions as opposed to pinpoint products. If the decision is on architecture and solving solutions, our win rate's extremely high. If it's a pinpoint product, asked to quote the best price, then our win rate isn't as high. I know that's an indirect question that I just answered and I tried to answer it with enough data to help you. But I think it's wait and see one more quarter before I'd feel as good as I'd like to on it.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to come back to the question on China and just to spin it around a little bit. Are you guys seeing any positive impact globally from this renewed focus on security issues around Huawei, ZTE and Chinese suppliers? Obviously, countries like China, countries like Australia, Canada, certainly the U.S., India, have all kind of raised the issue. Is there any market share capture you guys can get at the expense of the Chinese vendors in those kinds of places and elsewhere around the world? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We think we're doing very well on a global basis against all of our major competitors, almost without exception in the traditional networking and many of our related areas. And our competition still continues to be different competitors in each category.</p>
          <p>In terms of our opportunity, I think what you're seeing is with competitors like Huawei, we are getting very good at reminding people what they buy the company price point wise isn't what they pay a year or two or three years later. If you want innovation in an open architecture, there's some real challenges that go with that. And the ability really to bring the world class integration and the services and to help our customers achieve their goals, we're beginning to break away, which is a nice way of say we're competing much more effectively against a company like Huawei than we were 12 to 18 months ago.</p>
          <p>ZTE is not a major competitor. In fact, I look at them as much as a partner and would be very open to expanding that relationship as appropriate, George. But I think what you're seeing is we're just executing well. The more they're looking for a complete architectural play with security, that we don't give our code to anybody, not even our own government or anything else, is an advantage for us. It is that consistency, which I think is very key overall. But I think we're out-executing Huawei on many fronts at the same time and we are seeing that benefit.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks a lot. So, John, this was the fourth quarter in a row where the year-over-year order growth decelerated. But given the guidance, given the stabilization, given the easier comps, I don't know if you would care to comment on this, but do you think that we would see some order acceleration in terms of product order acceleration in the current quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on deferred revenues, it looks historically not unusual to have a drop like this in the fiscal first quarter but a big $300 million drop in deferred revenues. Can you just comment on that, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Deferred revenues, Frank, I'm going to let you handle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're correct, Michael. I mean it's not unusual to see that in the Q1 timeframe, primarily because of the strength that we have on the Services side in Q2 and Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a little bit longer answer to your question, Michael, but it is the last question and there aren't any more in the queue. We want your all's feedback in terms of, did you like this format, in terms of being crisp on our overall data and then spending most of our time on Q&amp;As or would you like to see a little bit more data given on the front end and a little bit less time on Q&amp;As. Mel, if you'll give us the feedback overall, I'd appreciate it.</p>
          <p>Let me just give you some numbers because when you get the numbers and then you think about them, you'll understand the answer to your question. Bookings over the last five quarters have gone 13% five quarters ago, 7% growth four quarters ago, 4%, 2% and 0%. And revenue, which you all have access to, five quarters ago was 5% growth, 11% growth, 7% growth, 4% and 6%. So clearly we're going to be on tough revenue quarters the next two quarters in terms of the comp.</p>
          <p>And just using next quarter as an example with 11% growth as your comparison where you only averaged 6% for the year and minus11 and we averaged 5%, the growth rate that we're putting out there is clearly an aggressive growth rate. What I now watch is actual sequential orders. So we know what our run rate of sequential orders will be at a bookings growth rate of 5%. We know what it would be at 3%. What it would be at 7%. So we're watching quarter-to-quarter booking growth rates.</p>
          <p>You are seeing us build backlog wherever possible and that candidly is the best way to run it. You ship what you got orders for in terms of the direction. It's a nice way of saying that if the next quarter plays out as we think it will, you'll begin to see the sequential growth and we'll report on it in terms of orders sequentially. Is it in the range that indicates that we have not only bottomed out but we're starting back up or not? But it's the sequential number that will give you the better indication of that or adjust your revenue numbers to have a consistency on revenue and look at the year-over-year revenue number or the year-over-year booking number with that sequence.</p>
          <p>I think, Mel, that summarizes it pretty well. I just want to walk away with, while we were pleased with the quarter it was clearly a very challenging market we're in. It was a very solid quarter. We thank you all for your support from the shareholders side. We are focused on getting you the best value for your investments. And that should be seen in almost everything we do. We're getting good balance in our product directions. We're very open on the areas we must improve that are under our control.</p>
          <p>We're also very candid in areas like Federal and Europe that are going to get tougher before they get better. We point out that we probably never had more new growth opportunities to go in and we'll talk about that more over the next couple months than we're seeing now. You will see us continue to evolve our model, focusing on both gross margins, reoccurring revenue, software services, etcetera, but that's a gradual process that you'll see going forward.</p>
          <p>Our major pressure while it's always possible and by mathematics sakes many people would say more than just possible, but our experience has been that we, once we really get focused on an item, we're able to hold it very well and that's what we see on our gross margin. So our gross margin issue is one of mix as opposed to otherwise.</p>
          <p>Bottom line, we're starting to become an IT player. It's an important aspirational goal for us to become the number one IT player. Time will tell if we can do that or not, but we like what we're seeing in the market overall. Mel, with that, let me turn it over to you.</p>
