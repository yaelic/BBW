          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Eni's Conference Call on its 2009 Third Quarter Results hosted by Alessandro Bernini, Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Now, I hand over to Mr. Bernini. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our third quarter result presentation. Here with me is Claudio Descalzi and Domenico Dispenza, and together we will be happy to answer to your questions at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>The market environment in the quarter continued to be challenging with hydrocarbons prices are sharply lower when compared to the same period of last year. Brent was down 41% and the <mark type="inaudible" /> price is down 61%. And European refining margin continuing to weaken, averaging $2.3 a barrel, down 63% year-on-year. The euro showed a depreciation of 5% versus the U.S. dollar averaging 1.43 during the quarter.</p>
          <p>As usual, I would like to remind you that the end results are affected by several issues, including the seasonality of demand for natural gas and petroleum products used for residential heating, the demand for which is highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter. Therefore, Eni's operating profit and change in net debt in the first nine months cannot be extrapolated for the full year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the results, adjusted operating profit in the third quarter amounted to &#x20AC;3.1 billion, down 50% year-on-year. These results reflected that the lower contribution of the exploration and production and the refining and marketing divisions.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net profit in the third quarter declined by 61% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion as a result of weaker operating performance, lower results reported by equity-accounted entities and the higher adjusted tax rate up 3.4 percentage point in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Hydrocarbon production in the third quarter decreased by 4.9% compared to the same period of 2008 averaging 1,678,000 of boe per day. The decrease is due to OPEC cuts, approximately 25,000 boe per day, continuing security issues in Nigeria, weaker European gas demand and mature field declines.</p>
          <p>These negatives were partially offset by the production ramp up and field start-ups in Congo, Kazakhstan, Norway, Venezuela and Gulf of Mexico as well as the positive impact of production sharing agreements.</p>
          <p>This quarter, adjusted operating profit &#x2013; third quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;2.4 billion, down 54% compared to the third quarter of 2008, mainly as a consequence of lower hydrocarbon realizations in dollars and the lower production sold. These negative elements were partially offset by the depreciation of the euro over the U.S. dollar and the lower exploration expenses.</p>
          <p>As for the Gas and Power division, overall gas volumes sold in the third quarter of 2009, including both consolidated and associated companies, increased by approximately 12% year-on-year, totaling 21.1 billion cubic meters. The higher international gas sales reflecting the Distrigas acquisitions and that the organic growth achieved in European target markets were partially offset by the lower volumes sold in Italy as a consequence of the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;721 million, up 23% over the same period of 2008. The increase is mainly due to the higher contribution from regulated businesses in Italy, benefiting from the new tariff mechanism from the Distribution business.</p>
          <p>It is worth saying that performers in the marketing segment benefited from the gains recorded on the settlement of certain non-hedging commodity derivatives amounting to &#x20AC;144 million, associated with the future sale of gas and electricity at fixed prices. Net of this effect, performance in the marketing segment would have declined as a result of the current weak gas trading environment. This factor is excluded in the EBITDA pro forma adjustment.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the third quarter of 2009 amounted to &#x20AC;703 million. This compares to &#x20AC;787 million in the third quarter of 2008. Our results in the marketing segment declined by 44% as a result of lower volumes sold in Italy due to the economic downturn and the weaker per quarter EBITDA contribution from associates. These elements were partially offset by the higher international direct sales.</p>
          <p>The regulated business generated &#x20AC;338 million, up 44% versus third quarter of 2008. The increase mainly reflects the higher contribution from distribution business as a result of the revision of the tariff mechanism in 2009, which has muted the seasonality of the business. Furthermore, the regulated business benefited from incentives provided on new investments in the transportation network, partially offset by lower volume transported due to the weaker gas demand.</p>
          <p>Finally, international transportation declined versus the third quarter of 2008 as a result of higher amortization charges and costs incurred to repair the TMPC pipeline, which was damaged in an accident last December.</p>
          <p>Turning now to refining and marketing, utilization rates declined by 12% year-on-year as a result of the weak trading environment and the higher maintenance activity. The third quarter recorded an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;110 million, compared to an operating profit of &#x20AC;227 million in the same period of 2008. These result reflect significantly weaker refining margins, mainly due to the narrowing of the differentials between light and heavy crude. This reduction was partially offset by the depreciation of the euro/dollar exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Marketing performance declined as a result of lower margins and volumes sold due to the economic downturn. In the third quarter of 2009, the Petrochemical business posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;65 million due to the weaker demand and high feedstock costs. In the engineering and construction sector, the third quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;267 million, substantially in line with last year. The other activities and Corporate showed an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;147 million versus a loss of &#x20AC;125 million in the same quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months of 2009, operating activities generated a cash flow of &#x20AC;9.7 billion. On top of this, the disposal of Gazprom Neft a 20% of stake in the marginal E&amp;P assets, as well as the Snam Rete Gas minority shareholder capital increase contributed around &#x20AC;5.1 billion bringing the overall cash generated to &#x20AC;14.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The cash flow generated financed CapEx of &#x20AC;9.8 billion, acquisition costs mainly related to Distrigas minorities of &#x20AC;2.3 billion and dividends paid in May and September totaling &#x20AC;4.2 billion. Other uses absorbed &#x20AC;700 million and brought the overall cash outflow to &#x20AC;17 billion. Net financial debt, as at the end of September, amounted to &#x20AC;20.5 billion and the debt-to-equity ratio increased to 0.42 when compared to 0.38 at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now together with Claudio Descalzi and Domenico Dispenza, I will be happy to answer any question you may have.</p>

          <p>Hi. I was wondering if you could update us on the guidance for what to expect for Gas &amp; Power in 2010? And also what to expect next year in terms of the Italian gas marketing margins given the falling domestic demand and increased competition from the re-gasification terminals? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know that we are in front of a consequence of the economic downturn, which means that there is a less demand for gas in Europe and there is additional gas coming from other sources. It will revenue factor on margins of course, so what we can expect for 2010 is a decrease on other sales, and a decrease in the margin and we cannot cross quantify also result, but the trend isn't clear for the moment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions. I just wonder if you could comment on where things stand in relation to your take-or-pay obligations and whether you expect to have to make a payment this year and how you might see that through the P&amp;L and the cash flow? And the second thing was, you've significantly moved up your view of second half oil prices, but the gearing guidance is basically the same as it was, and I just wondered if anything in particular had changed in your view about cash-in, cash-out in the second half between the second quarter and the third quarter results announcements? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all take-or-pay. I want to remind you first that take-or-pay is in fact a partial repayment or guess not taking a contract of minimum quantity. It is adjusted, it will be take and later pay into the difference. I want to expect that the impact on the 2009 accounts will be negligible if at all. And actually of course, we cannot give up to now a clear indication and it depends on the way which market will develop and depends of course in some negotiations, prevailing supplies to restore the competitivity of gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and gearing</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the gearing is concerned, we have already taken a number of measures like cost cutting, working capital optimization and the CapEx spending discipline in order to ensure the achievement of a ratio which support the company's current credit rating. So, we do not expect by the end of the year to have a gearing far from the level, which we had by the end of September.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Iain Reid from Macquarie. Mr. Reid, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Two questions please. I wonder if you could update us on the Perla discovery in Venezuela. I know you've drilled &#x2013; sorry you've tested that well now. So, maybe you could tell us a bit more about what you think the range of reserves could be and your initial thoughts about development?</p>
          <p>And I wonder, secondly, if you could also say something about some production expectations for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first Venezuela. Following the preliminary evaluation on the test, and we anticipate that &#x2013; we anticipate already a significant discovery. So the test confirmed the discovery that we press released one month ago. So we are talking about between six and eight tcf. We talk about wet gas. So now we have a confirmation that it is not only gas, but it is also some condensate associated, so that is a good news.</p>
          <p>And we plan to have a second appraisal well. So the structure is very big. And we think that we can dig on these reserves. And we are &#x2013; just to be clear for we are thinking already to a possible early production for domestic disposal and domestic disposal and general attempts not just it's for powers and also for the graders and also for they announce it for recovering the oil field. So that is in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>Talking about production for 2010, you know that we are elaborating the new plan, so for sure we are going to talk about 2010 and that's where our plan integrates, but just to give some view of the future, for sure the main issue is gas demand, that is going to impact on our growth. And we are elaborating a new plan more units of oil, oil there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I just follow up and just say even on conventional gas demand is one of reasons why gas production &#x2013; why overall production fell in the full quarter. How much was that in total in terms of numbers of barrels today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when I talked about the gas demand, the reason that was impacted, so the first stage is direct impact on Italian and Libyan production, and we can talk about something in the range between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels per day average here because we have to reduce our production, and that is what happened in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. Neil McMahon from Sanford Bernstein. Mr. McMahon, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a few questions. Just following up on in terms of production, in terms of fourth quarter and looking into next year, again, do we take that from what you made in your announcement that you are altering your guidance in terms of projects coming on as well this year?</p>
          <p>Obviously there is a seasonal effect of natural gas volumes coming through, but maybe you could just go into a bit more in terms of projects and timing of them coming on next year. And secondly, maybe you could give us a few comments around Iraq and given the earlier BP deal, I think there is a general feeling in the market that going into Iraq under the current terms is a bit crazy at $2 a barrel or there about. Maybe you could go into some details on your deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, about the projects. You are right, we talked about the gas demand, but also we have to talk about projects. What we can say that, that in February we promised 11 main projects in 2009 and we put in production 10 out of 11 that we promised and we are sure that the last project &#x2013; that is the Oyo project, offshore project in Nigeria we will be put in production mid-November. We had some delays on our projects &#x2013; that's reason, oil production in the third quarter has been impacted negatively by this effect.</p>
          <p>The main delay has been in Blacktip in Australia, Longhorn in Gulf of Mexico and Oyo in Nigeria and that is one of the reasons.</p>
          <p>So and then in the third quarter will be a new startup and build up of production for the total of 150,000 barrels per day and that will help us to keep an average production in line with 2008 and if adjusted, it grows up by the upper quota price with an increase of 1.2 &#x2013; 1.3 with respect to 2008.</p>
          <p>Talking about Iraq, we are in the same situation as BP in that we refused the $2 per barrel, they had said that, we refuse the $2 per barrel actually in July and now after two months of negotiation and of clarification meeting, we accepted $2 per barrel, because basically the fiscal terms are different now. I mean that, before the fiscality was on the total revenue, cost oil and profit oil, now the fiscality is just &#x2013; tax are just on profit oil and that changed drastically the result. And we can say that the $2 of today are comparable more or less with the $4.85 of yesterday, in terms of profit per barrel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Maybe just following up on that, maybe the best way to think about this is comparing it to maybe some of your Angolan PSA arrangements or PSAs elsewhere in the world. How would it compare overall from a profitability IRR point of view? And are you not concerned that it's going to dilute your overall net income per barrel metrics in your portfolio? Sure, lots of volume, but not so much margin relative to other assets you have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just to give you an answer to our internal rate of return &#x2013; about internal rate of return of the future projects, you know that we have about 30 projects in the next full year that will contribute to our growth. And the average, average internal rate of return of these projects is about 20 &#x2013; is 20%, without Kashagan, it's 30% and the our &#x2013; this new Iraqi project is not going to be used to reduce our average internal rate of return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. James Hubbard from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Hubbard, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. Hi. You had a press release on Block 15 Angola discovery this morning, could you give us any indication on what you think the scale now of your total discoveries in that block is and do you have a view on when you will start developing them?</p>
          <p>Second question would be, could you &#x2013; you mentioned mature field declines in Nigeria, which we've heard before. But could you just remind me of what percentage you see as your mature field decline rate, exploratory projects obviously, and what is the current impact of the Nigerian disruptions on your production?</p>
          <p>And then finally just following up on that last question, you said average IRR of 20% for 30 projects, next Kashagan 30%, are you saying that affects the CapEx, I didn't quite understand that. I mean, are you intentionally saying that Kashagan returns are very, very low or if I missed something there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First, Angola. Angola, we drilled four &#x2013; we drilled four wells, we discovered two hubs, I can say two good hubs and we talk about reserves, a drill reserve at the moment with the well we drilled, about more exceeding 100 million for one hub and the same for the other hub. And these hubs are close to existing facilities, network <mark type="inaudible" /> and so for that reason we are planning in a fast track. So, I think that the time to market would be about three, four years that for a deep offshore is a good time to market.</p>
          <p>We are going to use some existing facility and when I talk existing facility, I talk about existing FPSO. That is something that we are talking and we are planning with Sonangol and that is going to out pass, not only in term of staying to market, but also in term of the break even price. If you think that a deep offshore development worldwide in &#x2013; could be about 50, $60 per barrel in Angola, in this area that is we are very mature and we have a lots of synergy, we are between 40 and 45. So it's not good from a time-to-market point of view but also from internal rate of return of the project.</p>
          <p>So, up to now, the north part of the activity in <mark type="inaudible" /> is quite good. Now we are going to &#x2013; we are going this year &#x2013; next year sorry, to start drilling in the south part, that is little bit &#x2013; is more far &#x2013; it's far from that existing producing field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigeria &#x2013; Nigeria, we are &#x2013; as to Nigeria we have a mature field in production since 1975 and 80, 85 and in the last two years, three years we were not able to make production of the optimization project that normally we do in Nigeria especially in the oil field to find the depletion. The depletion in the oil field in Nigeria is more or less 10%.</p>
          <p>Normally, with a production optimization, we go to 3% depletion where we can and with the new project, we can go in a positive area and internal growth. So, that is the reason. In Nigeria, we change &#x2013; we change our strategy because we reduce the gas project that are mainly onshore. We increase our effort in the offshore, that's our oil production. And also because we have a different contract, we have a PSA contract in the offshore and we have a concession contract in the onshore. So we have more project like <mark type="inaudible" /> oil, OML 119, we have also then Monga south west.</p>
          <p>So, we are increasing not only Eni, but also the other co-ventures and the other operators. We are more and we are increasing our investment in the offshore. Talking of the last question was about Kashagan, you are right that it's something that we stated last year that Kashagan at the moment has a good internal return with respect to the our order rate. But it is less, their internal rate of return is less than our average internal rate of return.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions please. The first, in the downstream business, you don't seem to be making any sequential sort of improvement which perhaps &#x2013; from other competitors we have seen a bit of a pickup. I wonder what self-help measures you were taking to try and restore profitability to your funding and marketing business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of refining, we have already planned and we are realizing some initiatives in particular addressed to improve the efficiency and in order to achieve some cost of savings. We have been already succeeded in obtaining good results in the first part of the year and this program will continue also over the next year.</p>
          <p>Then, as far as marketing is concerned, we are concentrating in maintaining our market stake in particular in Italy, where we succeeded in maintaining and improving our market share, since in the first nine months of 2009, we, despite the general economical condition, we succeeded in improving by 1% our market share and at the same time maintaining a profit &#x2013; a unit profit in line with the past. So, all in all, we expect in 2009, in particular in the rest of the year notwithstanding the refining margin, which are extremely depressed and we expect that they will remain depressed also for the remaining part of 2009, we'll be able to slightly recover the losses that we have incurred so far.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that a lower level of loss or do you actually expect to be back in profit for the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe that overall it will be a great success in reducing and maintaining a low level of loss. We do not expect that the present market condition in terms of refining margin will allow ourself to realize profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And perhaps the second question then, I was going to talk on the dividend policy, and yes -- if we could have some follow through from through the decision made at the second quarter stage you know what &#x2013; what was the catalyst behind the reduction there and what we should be looking for going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as things sustained currently, we see no reason why the second half dividend should not be at least equal to the interim dividend paid in September.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. My first question is on your disposal process, if you can give us an update in particular on the E&amp;P domestic assets? The second question is on the take-or-pay contract, if you could elaborate a little bit more on what are you asking &#x2013; what are you asking for to your counterparts, I mean, in terms of volumes or pricing or advanced payments. And the third question is an updated guidance on the tax rate for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first with the M&amp;A on E&amp;P &#x2013; on E&amp;P assets. You know that, as we said before, we addressing the market also in non-strategic assets, non-operating asset in U.K. and we'll &#x2013; that in order to optimize our portfolio and be able to in the future to have assets with different regional well with better time to market and low cost. By November, we will be in the position to know if that is possible in term of value because it's sure that we have our target value and we are not in the need as we basically want to lose money and if the offer would be correct, we will add otherwise. It's not a process that we would want to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On take-or-pay, I wonder is evident for everybody that starting since October last year, the confidence of the economic crisis both decrease in gas consumption above Europe. Another estimate of the decrease, it could be in the older as you define saying that, of around 10% market. So 10% is also <mark type="inaudible" />. It means that, they are on the market 50 billion <mark type="inaudible" /> that adding a buyer.</p>
          <p>If you add to this, that their additional import capacity all over Europe include expansion of the lines to bring gas from Russia and from Algeria. New LNG terminal like <mark type="inaudible" /> and other additional import capacity of LNG in U.K. You may understand that the quantity of gas ready for sale brought a big difference between the stock prices, they've not impacted Europe and the price of oil link of the contractor. Because of all these, there is a big difference should be in some way reduce the risk of getting either two in season demand that we hopefully expect in next future or look to an addition of the price you have with your suppliers.</p>
          <p>So, what we are doing is we are discussing with some of our suppliers to not to open with all of the countries the link to these and battle the requirement of addition we have with them asking to the restore, the competitivity of the gas &#x2013; of the private gas and oil. They are the two of the supporters, I don't know what would be the result to become <mark type="inaudible" /> discussions and negotiations are normally quite difficult to decide and if the competitivity in the restored, of course, given the problem with take or pay is solved.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as '09 tax rate is concerned, we expect that it will be at year end a little bit higher compared to 2008 since presently we, it is expected to be around 55%.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Alastair Syme from Nomura. Mr. Syme, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I just wanted to get a sense on CapEx, how you are thinking it from, given with the gearing is at the end of the third quarter and you put in negative statements on the outlook on gas, whether we should be expecting some fairly dramatic CapEx growth as we head into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start talking about CapEx and striding on the extremes, you know that we expect &#x2013; we expect some good catch at the beginning of the year with a very low energy scenario and due to the rapid improvement of the price scenario, we are spending only a limited amount of saving now on the upstream cost for 2009 in the order of 300 and &#x20AC;200 million. So, with the &#x2013; at the end of the day, we are being in the same range of what capital investment of 2008. So, I mean 3% less to 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my question was, as you look ahead, and &#x2013; I don't know you sound like you are hinting it revisiting many of the gas projects that you think about in the next few years,0 does that translates into something on the CapEx front, that's materially different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From talking about the next &#x2013; the next year, we here talk about the shedding of the 5 billion, so now we for sure we can keep at least 50% of these saving for the contract and for the operation we've already done. And I think that so we are going to save 60% on what we plan at the very beginning of the, with a very low energy scenario, 40, $40 per barrel, 35, $40 per barrel.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Neill Morton from MF Global. Mr. Morton, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A couple of questions please. Firstly, I was intrigued by your recent statement that you've found them to a couple of blocks in Ghana, the petrol blocks. I understand you found a lot of gas there. Firstly, what you are planning to do with that gas? Can you -- and perhaps secondly, can you update us on your future drilling plans and what you've done so far? And then just secondly, I'm circling back to Lucy's question, on the R&amp;M loss in Q3, I mean &#x20AC;110 million loss, could you perhaps just split that into refining versus marketing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I started talking about Ghana. Ghana, we enter this year or early this year. We are -- with &#x2013; we have the first well in the first block. We have two blocks. And we discovered a good amount our reserves, with gas condensate and oil, we found some oil. And we are still elaborating and studying on these blocks because we're just entering and we have to drill &#x2013; we have to drill a second well in the second block in 2010.</p>
          <p>And going back <mark type="inaudible" /> in the price though was the geological model and the assessment of the first block has been finished. We already start talking about the gas utilization with the government because in many case they need gas for power and also for other industries. So, for sure, we are going to put together the oil development and the gas development with investment in the domestic sector. But it's really, we are in the early stage. So it's I think that's premature to talk about future development. I think that in 2010, our view will be more clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as the results of the third quarter for refining and marketing, more or less the results of the third quarter generated by the refining activity was in the region of &#x20AC;200 million negative and, of course, their marketing activity contributed with a profit in the region of &#x20AC;90 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I actually be greedy and just ask for a similar split for Q3 last year, just to get &#x2013; give us a feel for how these two divisions, sub-divisions have moved year-on-year with the 185 million last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in the third quarter of last year, refining activity were, prevailing conditions were a little bit different. In the third quarter we have realized &#x2013; of last year, we have realized an EBIT of positive results of &#x20AC;70 million, compared to a positive result resulting from marketing activity in the region of &#x20AC;160 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. So plus 70 and plus 160?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, I thought last year that was 185, am I missing something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it the continuity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I must have mistaken, I thought Q3 last year total EBIT for the division was 185 million. So, is there something else in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the adjusted operating profit that was realized in the third quarter of 2008 by refining and marketing was &#x20AC;227 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, with the breakdown that I have provided you before, I mean, more or less &#x20AC;160 million positive from marketing activity and the 70 million from refining activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. There I'm not sure if you are able to answer this as such. But, is there an element of your debt aimed at covering the worst case outcome of legal proceedings? And if so, should the best case scenario happen where you get negotiated settlement, so and then no legal obligations could we expect a short turnaround in that debt?</p>

          <p>Well, you know, the situation of our most important litigation had been fully disclosed in our half year report which was published by the end of July early August. And as reported in our press release, no significant, no material developments have occurred since then. So, presently, we do not believe that in 2009 something will affect our results, nor our cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is there a timing when we could expect an impact if there were to be one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course these litigations are ongoing, some of them are expected to be finalized in the first half of 2010, and then the remaining in particular those relating to the environmental litigation which the litigation's process is extremely long. So it is not foreseeable at present when the final outcome could arise from this kind of litigation.</p>
