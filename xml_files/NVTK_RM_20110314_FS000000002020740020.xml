        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Oleg. Good evening and welcome to our full-year and fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this evening, and again extend our sincere attitude to Troika-Dialog for organizing and hosting this important conference call.</p>
          <p>As customary before we begin with the specific conference call details, I would like to refer you to our disclaimer statement.

We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our regulatory filings as well as any of our earnings press releases for more descriptions of the risks that may influence our results.</p>
          <p>Joining me this evening is Mr. Leonid Mikhelson, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Management Board, who will be available to take questions during the Q&amp;A session as well as provide some additional clarity on some recent events. By focusing our discussions on the key highlights, tonight's conference call format will allow for more time for questions and answers and hopefully a more interactive dialogue with our investors.</p>
          <p>2010 was another exceptional year for the company, as we grew our core operations in terms of production and reserves as well as complemented our existing portfolio of assets with value accretive transactions. During the year, we also addressed a series of key issues involved in our LNG project, which were critical in moving forward the discussion with potential strategic partners.</p>
          <p>So to begin tonight's discussion, I would like to talk about the recent announcement regarding the selection of a strategic partner, the Yamal LNG Project and some brief comments on TOTAL's equities stake in NOVATEK. The Yamal LNG Project is a transforming project for NOVATEK as it provides a global perspective to complement our core of Russian natural gas operations.</p>
          <p>In order to undertake a project at a scale however, we saw strategic partners who can provide technical and commercial expertise on the operations and marketing of LNG along with a strong balance sheet for financing at a project. After completing the initial tender process, we determine that an optimum mix of partners providing key skills and experience throughout the LNG value chain would enhance the success and viability of project. As a result, we felt that a combination of partners comprising one major strategic partner as well as other project partners would enter the project at a combined stake of 49% with NOVATEK retaining the majority stake of 51%.</p>
          <p>This structure is suitable for our project at its nature and corresponds to the expectations of the marketplace. On the 2nd of March 2011, we formally signed a memorandum of cooperation announcing that TOTAL is selected as a strategic partner in the Yamal LNG Project and accordingly they will acquire an equity stake of 20% in the project. To complete this transaction, NOVATEK will execute its original option to purchase 23.9% on existing shareholders and then sell a 20% equity stake to TOTAL.</p>
          <p>After a considerable amount of review, we felt that TOTAL met all the criteria outlined in the tender process and possessed the requisite technical and commercial expertise and commercialized and large-scale LNG projects as well as maintaining a significant presence in the global LNG markets.</p>
          <p>All transaction documents are expect to be finalized by the 1st of July 2011 and upon completion of this process we plan to conduct a conference call to specifically address the details of this transaction.</p>
          <p>Simultaneously, TOTAL announced that they would purchase a direct equity stake of 12% in NOVATEK after the <mark type="inaudible" /> market close on the MICEX and that the share purchase transaction is expected to be close on or before the 1st of April.</p>
          <p>In their press release, TOTAL announced that they will &#x2013; they would like to increase their equity stake in NOVATEK to 15% within 12 months and 19.4% within three years. I have been informed by our core shareholders that in principal they accepted TOTAL's expressed interest to increase their direct equity stake in the company where presently there are no formal or binding obligations to do so at this time. The 12% equity stake does not abide TOTAL with any management positions within the company but it does accord them one director seat on the board.</p>
          <p>The majority of the 12% equity stake will initially be purchased from our two core shareholders, Mr. Mikhelson and Mr. Timchenko. However upon the execution of the 9.4% auction held by Hibridge Ventures Limited, both Mr. Mikhelson and Mr. Timchenko will restore their respective holdings in NOVATEK. Moreover as far as we know and understand, Gazprom does not intend to sell its 10% equity stake in the company. Therefore, TOTAL is paying to increase their direct stake in NOVATEK to 19.4% with three &#x2013; within three years does not imply that they will purchase either additional shares from Gazprom as has been speculated in the market.</p>
          <p>Returning back to the LNG project, in June 2010 we executed an agency agreement between Gazprom export and Yamal LNG whereby Gazprom export will act as an agent for export sales of LNG between Yamal LNG and Yamal LNG's fully owned international sales subsidiary. The signing of this agency agreement removed the significant question as to the marketing of the LNG as well as addressed one of the key issues raised by potential strategic partners during the tender process. In addition in December 2010, there's an executive order signed by Prime Minister Putin announcing a series of tax concessions for the development of LNG on the Yamal Peninsula.</p>
          <p>In summary, the tax concession stipulate zero mineral extraction tax, zero export duty, zero property taxes on LNG production and related facilities and reduction in profits tax to 15.5%. The tax concessions stipulate a maximum period of 12 years and/or quantities of up to 250 billion cubic meters of cumulative volumes after the start of LNG production whichever comes first and are only applicable if LNG is produced. The complete details of a tax concession can be found on the Russian government's website.</p>
          <p>In our view, the proposed tax concessions clearly demonstrate the government's commitment to the Yamal LNG Project as well as the importance of this project to the overall Russian gas industry. Moreover, the tax concessions provide additional clarity on the project fiscal regime as well as it enhances the project's economic viability.</p>
          <p>We also completed the pre-FEED study conducted by CB&amp;I Lummus and are ready to begin front-end engineering design or FEED work phase of a project. Based on the initial estimates, the project's capital expenditure range between $15 billion and $20 billion excluding the tanker fleet and we believe the capital expenditure estimates will be further refined during the FEED phase. We expect to launch the first of three trains of LNG comprising 5 to 5.5 million tonnes by 2012 &#x2013; excuse me by 2016, sorry about that. Pre-FEED is expected to be announced by the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>In a related corporate development, we expect to execute an option arrangement to purchase the remaining 25.1% in Yamal LNG in the nearest timeframe. The combined shares inclusive of the equity stake acquired as part of the new option arrangement and the remaining shares from the execution of the first option arrangement, will eventually will be sold to the other partners in the project.</p>
          <p>Detailed discussions are presently underway with a number of companies interested in taking an equity stake in the project and we believe that an announcement of the two or three possible partners forming the LNG consortium will most likely be made by the end of 2011. As previously mentioned, NOVATEK will retain 51% of the project and a consortium of partners, the remaining 49%.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter of 2010 we announced two key strategic acquisitions. Our proportional equity stake of 25.5% in SeverEnergia purchased through our 50/50 joint venture with Yamal Development, which was completed in November; and our direct equity stake of 51% in Sibneftegaz, which was completed in December.</p>
          <p>We had been studying the opportunity to acquire certain assets and expand our operational footprint in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region for quite some time. By completing these acquisitions, we have managed to complement our existing portfolio of assets with a range of quality mid-term exploration and development opportunities. Moreover, the acquired fields and license areas are in close proximity to our existing asset base, which affords us the opportunity to achieve additional synergies by optimizing the utilization of our present condensate processing and transport facilities.</p>
          <p>To finance the acquisitions we utilized a $600 million bridge loan facility and other credit facilities, thus increasing our present debt position, as well as utilizing a portion of our existing cash balances.</p>
          <p>In February 2011, we successfully issued our dual tranches debut Eurobonds in the amount of $1.25 billion, which was used to repay the bridge loan facility ahead of its maturity schedule and partially finance the outstanding balance due on the Sibneftegaz transactions. We expect the complete full payment on this transaction during the month of March through the use of our own internal cash balances, thus reducing the overall acquisition price by approximately $30 million.</p>
          <p>SeverEnergia is comprised of three legal entities: RB Gas, Urengoy Oil and Neftegazteknologiya. We are presently in a process of verifying all the geological and geophysical data, conducting geological work and devising a new plan for field development. Thus, it is still too early to make any meaningful comments on capital requirements, production profiles, et cetera.</p>
          <p>However, we do expect significant future production contributions from the overall development of these fields and license areas. More specifically, the Samborsky field owned by RB Gas is the most advanced in terms of its development stage, and we will concentrate our initial efforts on developing the northern portion of the field.</p>
          <p>It is anticipated that initial production will commence during the upcoming winter period and we have not planned any significant capital expenditures to initially launch production because of the existing equipment and infrastructure in place.</p>
          <p>In terms of marketing, we will sell the natural gas produced ex-<mark type="inaudible" /> to Gazprom, which we consider to be a profitable contractual arrangement, and the unstable gas condensate will be processed and sold through NOVATEK's marketing channels. We are presently negotiating with our joint venture partners the terms and conditions for utilizing our transport and processing facilities.</p>
          <p>Sibneftegaz holds four exploration and production licenses in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, which are also located in close proximity to our existing fields and infrastructure. The largest of the four licensed areas is the Beregovoye field, which is presently producing dry gas and is already connected to the UGSS pipeline network.</p>
          <p>Natural gas produced in this field does not require further processing for commercial suitability. Since the Beregovoye field is already a producing entity, it requires limited capital expenditure to maintain its current production rate, producing approximately 9 billion cubic meters in 2010. Effective the 1st of January, we began to market our proportionate share of dry gas produced in the field of approximately 14 million cubic meters per day.</p>
          <p>Sibneftegaz also produces small quantities of natural gas from the Pyreinoye field, which has completed 12 development wells, some treatment facilities and is presently connected to the UGSS via a 36-kilometer pipeline. For 2011, we have budgeted approximately RUB200 billion of total capital expenditures at Sibneftegaz. In conjunction with the acquisition, we refinanced 51% of Sibneftegaz's total debt by providing a loan facility in the amount of RUB11 billion for approximately $361 million at year-end exchange rates.</p>
          <p>With the marketing arrangements, NOVATEK is considered the profit center for Sibneftegaz and our contractual arrangements provide that we pay the entity a sufficient purchase price to service the existing debt over the next four years as well as cover our ongoing operating expenses. Presently, Sibneftegaz is free cash flow positive.</p>
          <p>Since both acquisitions were completed towards the end of 2010, there were no material effects to our fourth quarter financial statements except for the increase in our debt position as discussed.</p>
          <p>I have been receiving many questions regarding NOVATEK's plans for additional acquisitions or our participation in upcoming license tenders and auctions. To make it absolutely clear, it is our intention to continue reviewing any and all potential acquisition opportunities that meet our strategic objectives of expanding our production capabilities and our hydrocarbon resource base, especially if the potential opportunities are located in close proximity to our existing core fields and infrastructure and processing facilities.</p>
          <p>You should assume that the review and study of potential opportunities are within the normal scope of our business activities. As for the Kovykta field, which was recently auctioned as part of the RUSSIA Petroleum's bankruptcy proceedings, we do not participate in the auction process and we are not in any current negotiations regarding this particular field. As for the upcoming tenders mentioned by Prime Minister Putin, we will actively participate in this open tender process due to the proximity of these licenses to our Yamal LNG project.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, we will submit our intent to participate in this tender by mid-April, which will be followed by the requirements and time schedules of the tender. We anticipate that a final decision on the winner of this tender process will be announced by the end of June.</p>
          <p>Demand for natural gas in the Russian domestic market continues to show signs of recovering to post-crisis levels as previously mentioned and continues to be aided by growth in GDP and weather conditions. This past year, we produced approximately 37.2 billion cubic meters of natural gas from our core three fields representing a 15% year-on-year growth or an absolute growth of 4.9 billion cubic meters.</p>
          <p>Our production growth was accomplished on the back of a 6.3% increase in our natural gas production in 2009 despite the negative effects of the economic crisis, which effectively means we had real year-on-year growth rather than a recovery of production.</p>
          <p>Since our IPO in 2005, we have managed to increase our overall production of natural gas by 89% for a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10%. The main driver of our growth has been the successful development and exploitation of the Yurkharovskoye field, which represented about two-thirds of our natural gas production for the year and has almost tripled since the IPO.</p>
          <p>We completed and launched into production 15 new wells at the Yurkharovskoye field during the year, which represented the majority of work activities for the second and third stages of the field's second phase development program.</p>
          <p>In 2010, production of natural gas from Yurkharovskoye field increased by 37.5%, reaching volumes of 24.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas. During the fourth quarter, the Yurkharovskoye field represented 7.1 billion cubic meters out of the total of 10.7 billion cubic meters that we produced, with the planned launching of the third stage of phase two in October 2010.</p>
          <p>As compared to the third quarter of 2010, we increased our natural gas production by 2.4 billion cubic meters or by 28.3% reaching the new milestone for production.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we plan to increase the field's production to approximately 32 billion cubic meters by completing the field's planned development program, which effectively means that we will be transitioning into maintenance capital expenditure mode by mid to late 2012.</p>
          <p>For the year, we continue to reduce the level of gas output from the East-Tarkosalinskoye field at the expense of maximizing wet gas production at the Yurkharovskoye field. On several of my conference calls, I explained that we enhanced the overall company's revenues by optimizing the core production mix to capture more economic value from the wet gas stream. This essentially means we're able to continue to growing both our natural gas and liquids production, while at the same time maximizing the revenue per barrel of oil equivalent produced through our export channels.</p>
          <p>Our total natural gas daily output for 2010 averaged approximately 103 million cubic meters or 3.7 billion cubic feet per day. Since the beginning of 2011, we have been producing at a rate of approximately 150 million cubic meters to 155 million cubic meters per day during the months of January and February; and recently reduced our daily volumes to approximately 140 million cubic meters per day, with the warmimg temperatures. This represents a year-on-year growth and our daily average gas production from our core fields excluding the daily production contribution from our proportionate share of Sibneftegas' production of approximately 32%.</p>
          <p>As a result of the strong start to the year, we have been fielding a series of inquires lately regarding our production forecast for 2011. I would like to reiterate what has already been communicated to the market. For 2011 we are forecasting similar production growth from our core producing fields as that as we achieved in 2010 meaning roughly a 15% year-on-year growth.</p>
          <p>This has been revised upwards from the preliminary forecast of 12%, which was provided to the market on our last two conference calls. If we combine our proportionate share of production from Sibneftegas, with the expected growth in our core producing fields mainly from the Yurkharovskoye field, we are looking at a combined growth of approximately 30% a natural gas production for 2011. These forecasts are predicated on the assumptions of continued economic recovery in the Russian domestic market as well as normal seasonal weather patterns.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the liquid side of our business, during 2010, we increased our total production of liquid hydrocarbons by 579,000 tons or by 19.1% driven primarily by continued strong production growth of 41.4% as the Yurkharovskoye field. Unstable gas production increased by 615,000 tons year-on-year at the Yurkharovskoye field with the launch of the third stage in October and the completion of the 326 kilometer pipeline connecting the fields at Purovsky Processing Plant in September.</p>
          <p>With the increase in wet gas production at the Yurkharovskoye field of 7.1 billion cubic meters in the fourth quarter, as previously mentioned, the correspondent quarter-on-quarter growth in unstable gas condensate was 623,000 tons representing roughly 17.2% of the total 2010 production.</p>
          <p>The growth in the Yurkharovskoye field has offset declines in our other fields. Most notably, we haven't experienced the natural declines in our liquid production from the East-Tarkosalinskoye field over the past several years, due mainly to decrease in field reservoir pressures. The eventual decline in reservoir pressures as a natural phenomenon of the field's reservoir characteristics. And we fully account for this eventuality in our future development and capital expenditure plans.</p>
          <p>The future planned development of SeverEnergia should more than offset the expected liquid hydrocarbon declines in our core fields. The continued expansion of our liquid production and a further penetration of new markets is a key element to our corporate strategy.</p>
          <p>During 2010, we successfully navigated the first large tanker of stable gas condensate through the Arctic Ocean's Northern Sea Route, which essentially provides us with market and delivery operations when the Sea Route is inevitable. Thus, we planned to take further advantage of this commercial opportunity in 2011.</p>
          <p>The next market opportunity for us is the eventual launching of the Ust-Luga gas fractionation complex in late 2012. Essentially, we plan to construct a new 6 million ton capacity gas fractionation unit in terminal facility at the port of Ust-Luga on the Baltic Sea, which will be used to fractionate our stable gas condensate and to constitute higher value products like light and heavy naphtha, jet fuels, diesels and other refine products.</p>
          <p>We plan to launch the first phase of the project comprising 3 million tons per annum by the end of 2010, which also means that we will significantly increase the potential number of our customers to our products as well as enhanced our risk adjusted margins for our liquid products. The total capital expenditures construct a 6 million ton capacity plant and related terminal facilities is estimated between RUB20 billion and RUB21 billion and we plan to expand approximately RUB8.5 billion in 2011 and RUB5 billion in 2012 inclusive of VAT to complete the first stage launch.</p>
          <p>The overall project once completed it is expected to have a maximum payback period of approximately four years. We will continue to provide periodic updates on the Ust-Luga project on future conference calls.</p>
          <p>Speaking of our capital expenditures, I would like to say a few words about our plans for 2011 and highlight some of the key results for the past year. During 2010, we invested approximately RUB26.1 billion in capital expenditures, representing a 46.1% increase over the correspondent 2009 period, of which RUB15.4 billion was spent on the Yurkharovskoye infrastructure and the second phase development activities.</p>
          <p>Of the RUB6.6 billion of capital expenditure program which was incurred in the fourth quarter, approximately one-third related to the Yurkharovskoye field development activities. Besides completing and launching 15 new operating wells at the field, we also completed a series of infrastructure-related activities aimed at enhancing the efficiencies of our operations.</p>
          <p>We completed and launched a 40,000 ton methanol plant at the Yurkharovskoye field thus increasing the methanol capacity at the field to 52,000 tons providing enough methanol production to all of our core field operations.</p>
          <p>We will transport to produce methanol via our 326 kilometer unstable gas pipeline to the Purovsky Processing Plant, where it will be separated and transferred onwards to be used at the East-Tarkosalinskoye field. We also completed and launched a 3 million ton de-ethanization unit, which allowed us to construct a smaller diameter pipeline to transport unstable gas condensate on the Yurkharovskoye field for the Purovsky Plant.</p>
          <p>The utilization of our own facility allows us to optimize the production of unstable gas condensate relative to de-ethanized gas at the field, while minimizing historical process and output <mark type="inaudible" /> losses as a result of use in third-party facilities.</p>
          <p>Other capital-related projects during the period included completing the compressor booster installation at the East-Tarkosalinskoye field to maintain current production levels of gas and gas condensate in the <mark type="inaudible" /> layer, the construction of a 10,000 cubic meter storage facility at the Purovsky Plant to store raw materials for de-ethanized gas condensate, ongoing land preparation activities and design work at the Ust-Luga facility as well as ancillary infrastructure activities at Yamal LNG.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we plan to expand approximately RUB31 billion, excluding VAT on a series of capital related projects with the primary spending projected at the Yurkharovskoye field of RUB11.7 billion, the Ust-Luga project RUB7.2 billion, the South-Tambeyskoye field RUB2.9 billion, and the East-Tarkosalinskoye field of RUB1.8 billion amongst other projects. The majority of our activities are essentially ongoing development work or the continuation of construction and infrastructure projects.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we completed our first exploratory well at the El Arish concession block in the Arab Republic of Egypt, and determined that there was not sufficient commercial production. Therefore, we decided to write off the cost of the exploration well in the fourth quarter, which significantly increased our exploration expenses by approximately RUB1.766 billion year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter respectively.</p>
          <p>We are presently discussing the current political and economic situation in the region, as well as reviewing all the geological and geophysical data we possess with our joint ventures partners. We will take a decision sometime in the second quarter to determine whether or not we will continue with exploration work or abandon the project. I will update everyone on the situation on our first quarter conference call. In addition, we also wrote off an exploration well on the <mark type="inaudible" /> license area during the period. The aggregate right off of the two exploration wells during the period was approximately RUB821 million.</p>
          <p>Operationally, we managed to increase our proven gas reserves by 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to approximately 8.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent under the SEC reserve methodology, representing 551% reserve replacement rate for the year and 567% reserve replacement over the three year average. We have managed to add approximately 3.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent over the past two years from the combination of organic growth through the drill bit and timely and accretive acquisitions. These accomplishments were achieved when most oil and gas companies are still struggling to maintain, let alone grow, their resource base.</p>
          <p>Based on our proven gas reserves, NOVATEK is the largest independent gas company in the world and ranks equally amongst many of the so-called super majors in this respect.</p>
          <p>We continue to produce some of the best statistics in the global oil and gas industry relating to efficiency of capital deployment, the corresponding flow rates from <mark type="inaudible" /> wells and the attractive reserve acquisition multiples.</p>
          <p>Collectively, the combination of these factors along with our prolific reserves base has consistently ranked NOVATEK as one of the lowest cost producers in the industry. We are very proud of this unique distinction and it demonstrates the quality of our resource base, the efficient design of our field development program, and the close attention we pay to controlling costs throughout our operations.</p>
          <p>Strategically, our goal is to continue undertaking projects to grow our gas and gas condensate production, as well as expand our process in the market capabilities. The ability to achieve this strategic goal through joint development of oil, gas and gas condensate projects or singularly through the continued development of our existing licensed areas will ultimately achieve our stated aim.</p>
          <p>The ability to improve the overall operational efficiency and utilization of the Purovsky processing plant, as well as expand its capacity when required and eventually launch in the new gas condensate fractionation and terminal facility at Ust-Luga wanted as completed, is completely consistent with our strategic objective of enhancing downstream markets in our liquid value chain.</p>
          <p>I believe the move towards building our commercial activities throughout our hydrocarbon value chain will enhance the margins we achieved for our products as well as solidify and expand our position in the market. I will continue to provide more update on these important activities on future conference calls.</p>
          <p>Our natural gas business remained robust in 2010. For the year, we increased our sales of natural gas by 32.5%. These stellar results were achieved on a back of strong growth and year-on-year sales volumes of 12.7% combined with a 17.5% increase in our average natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>For the year, our sales mix of volumes sold to end customers versus wholesale traders were 64% and 36% respectively.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we achieved a record volume sold of approximately 11 billion cubic meters, representing 2.1 billion cubic more than the prior-year period. Specifically, we increased our year-on-year volume sold to end customers by approximately 171 million cubic meters or by 2.7% and to our wholesale traders by 1.9 billion cubic meters or by 70%. However during the fourth quarter 2010, our percentage of end customer sales decreased year-on-year to 58% as compared to 70% in 2009. The reason for this shift in sales mix during the quarter comprise of the couple factors.</p>
          <p>As you recall, we ceased deliveries to traders in remote points effective the first of January 2010, which effectively distorts the comparability of our overall customer sales mix between the corresponding years. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we reduced the volumes sold to end customers by 17% largely to compensate for the reduction in volumes sold to the wholesale traders during the hot summer months.</p>
          <p>During this past summer, we sold more volumes of natural gas directly to our power generation consumers due to the increased consumption of power during the heat wave. As a result, we did not meet all of our contractual obligation to wholesale traders. This explains why the volumes sold to wholesale traders increased by 126% during the fourth quarter, which essentially represents the make-up of contractual volumes to this customer segment. Therefore our quarter-on-quarter sales mix comprised 58% sold to end customers and 42% sold to wholesale customers versus 75%/25% split in the third quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter average end customer realized prices and netbacks increased by approximately 17% and 12% respectively over the corresponding 2009 period. The primary difference between the reporting periods was a geographical shift in our deliveries, which effectively increased our average transport distance by 174 kilometers or by 9%.</p>
          <p>Our quarter-on-quarter end customer netbacks were relatively unchanged where <mark type="inaudible" /> prices decreased marginally explained by the change in customers mix between periods.</p>
          <p>During 2010, our largest sales markets remained the Perm and <mark type="inaudible" /> regions supporting our decisions to establish direct marketing presence in those particular regions. We withdrew approximately 268 million cubic meters from underground storage to meet contractual obligations during the quarter. Our inventory balance in underground storage at the 31st of December stood at approximately 790 million cubic meters as compared to 1.1 billion cubic meters as of the 30th of September 2010 and 744 million cubic meters as of the 31st of December 2009.</p>
          <p>We continued to demonstrate strong growth in our liquid business by increasing our full year revenues by 32.5%. The increase in revenues <mark type="inaudible" /> was driven by growth in our sales volume of 8.7% and strong commodity prices throughout the year.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2010, we increased our total liquid sales revenues by 18% primarily due to higher average product prices across all of our product ranges. Although our year-on-year sales volumes remain relatively unchanged largely due to 153,000 ton increase and our stable gas condensate inventory balances at year end.</p>
          <p>In comparison to the third quarter 2010, we decreased the volume of stable gas condensate sold by 67,000 tons largely due to a 58,000 ton increase in our stable gas volumes in transit.</p>
          <p>For the full year of 2010, we dispatched 41 tankers from the port of Vitino versus 35 tankers in 2009, recognizing 39 tankers have sales versus 36 tankers in the respective periods. During the fourth quarter, we dispatched 12 tankers carrying approximately 716,000 tons to international markets and recognized sales during the period 11 tankers or approximately 656,000 tons inclusive of one tanker which was dispatched in the third quarter to the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, our Purovsky processing plant operated at 75% of its rated capacity, with total plant output reaching 933,000 tons. Our export netbacks on a U.S. dollar basis for stable gas condensate and LPG volume sold increased year-on-year by approximately 16% and 36% respectively despite the increases in both export duties and average transportation expenses.</p>
          <p>Turing our attention to the expense side of the income statement, our total operating expenses increased in 2010 relative to 2009 by 22.1%, which corresponds to a growth in our core business operations as well as an increase in our oil and gas revenues.</p>
          <p>Looking at the quarterly changes, our total operating expenses increased year-on-year by 19.9% and quarter-on-quarter by 9.6%, which again correlates to the growth in our core oil and gas revenues. The increase in our non-controllable expenses was primarily due to changes in taxes and other income, which increased in line with our production growth during the quarter.</p>
          <p>For transportation expenses, the overall increase was somewhat lower due to the shift in our natural gas sales mix between the respective quarters as previously explained, but it did reflect higher average transport tariffs due to the increase in the average distance to market as well as a relative increase in end-customer volumes.</p>
          <p>Our general and admin expenses increased quarter-on-quarter by 19.4% largely due to the accrual of bonuses and the recognition of share-based compensation, which affects our employee compensation and an increase in legal services related to the two recent acquisitions and ongoing legal work on the Yamal LNG projects. These expenses were offset by a reduction in charitable contributions, which tend to fluctuate period-on-period dependent on funding requirements.</p>
          <p>The year-on-year increase in employee compensation was primarily due to the 10% salary indexation effective July 2010, an increase in bonuses reflecting the financial results achieved in 2010 and the cost associated with the share-based compensation plan, which was initiated in the second quarter of 2010. The quarter-on-quarter increase was due to an increase in bonus accruals at year-end as well as a continued recognition of share-based compensation. Our employee expenses were offset by a reduction in headcounts in the fourth quarter primarily due to the disposal of NOVATEK-Polymer.</p>
          <p>The year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter decrease in material services and other expenses was mainly due to the decrease in materials and supplies and tolling and processing fees. With the disposal of NOVATEK-Polymer in the third quarter 2010, we significantly reduced our purchase of raw materials for the production of polymer and insulation tape. During the same periods, our tolling and processing fees decreased by approximately RUB152 million and RUB95 million respectively due to the launch of our own de-ethanization facilities allowing us to discontinue using third party facilities to de-ethanize our stable gas condensate.</p>
          <p>We also had an impairment expense during the period of approximately &#x2013; increase of approximately RUB293 million and RUB198 million respectively due to the accident at their <mark type="inaudible" /> field in the fourth quarter 2010. As a result of these factors enumerated above, our EBITDA and net profits continue to remain strong and consistent with our financial guidance throughout each of the respective periods.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet and liquidity position continue to remain strong throughout the fourth quarter, although we increased our debt position relative to our year-end and third quarter balances due to the bridge finance and facility, another debt we obtained to complete the acquisitions in November and December.</p>
          <p>Post balance sheet, we successfully issued the dual-tranche Eurobonds which were used to repay the bridge loan facility and a large portion of the outstanding liability to complete the Sibneftegaz transaction. We will continue to service our debt facilities as they become mature. And finally, we continue to remain positive free cash flow during the fourth quarter and the full year of 2010.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the past year was a very busy year for the company and one that we believe provides a platform for future growth opportunities. It was also another successful year of demonstrating to our investors that we possess the necessary capabilities to grow in market our hydrocarbon products. We will continue to invest the necessary capital to further enhance our abilities to penetrate new markets.</p>
          <p>The next couple of years will be challenging ones for the company as we begin to transform our operations with the development of Yamal LNG, the construction and launch of <mark type="inaudible" /> complex and the integration of the assets we acquired in the fourth quarter. We were up to these challenges and senior management is fully committed to providing the resources and personnel to achieve our strategic objectives and goals.</p>
          <p>The financial and operational results achieved during 2010 solidifies our position as one of premier companies operating in the oil and gas industry, and continues to reflect positively on the strategic and operating decisions entrusted to management to create sustainable shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Our hard work and the collective efforts of all of our people, combined with the technical excellence we strive to achieve in our operational performance has been instrumental in leading to these extraordinary results and driven our impressive shareholder returns. It has been five years since we went public and the story outline then remains firmly intact today.</p>
          <p>We continue to remain highly confident in the future prospects in NOVATEK and the growth strategy that we have adopted. Our goal is to transform NOVATEK into a world-class company competing not only in the Russian domestic market but in the global markets. The foundation that we have built will be the cornerstone for our future success.</p>
          <p>I would like to end our portion of the conference call and now open the session to questions and answers. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark and congratulations for the strong results. Two questions from me. One on Sibneftegaz CapEx, did I understand correctly that the budget provides only for $7 million of CapEx for Sibneftegaz? And the second question on Yamal LNG, do you expect NOVATEK to be at least partially carried on CapEx by TOTAL or by other future partners? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, on the first question your answer is what I &#x2013; I said that the total CapEx expected for 2011 on Sibneftegaz is approximately 200 million rubles. On the second question, I will let Leonid to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian] As Mark has already mentioned, we are going to finalize Total's role in this deal by July 1. And the current memorandum of cooperation, which has been signed by the two companies and is already legally binding does provide for unproportionate &#x2013; disproportionate contribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well, spasibo. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Lev Snykov of VTB Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello, thank you. I have two questions, first about the share of end customer business. So should we expect it to revert back to the 60%, 65% range in Q1 given Mark what you've said regarding the trends in Q4 and during 2010? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lev, yeah, if you had modeled the company, I would say that you're modeling about two-thirds roughly end customers, one-third wholesale traders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question is more of a longer-term nature, on let's say at three year horizon, how would you expect the dividend payments to evolve given that you have significant step-down in Yurkharovskoye on the one hand and significant &#x2013; potentially some incremental topics due to Yamal LNG on the other hand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I understand your question Lev, but I actually think it's somewhat of the wrong view to look at it from that perspective. I mean first of all, I mean the company has historically been increasing its dividend payouts on an annual basis based on our financial results. And I expect that we will continue to do that in line with the financial results that we achieved in the next three years as you referred.</p>
          <p>But I think it's a mistake to assume that we'll be generating all this excess cash because the aim of our operation is to reinvest that cash back into the SeverEnergia, the Ust-Luga Project and any of our cash contributions that we need to make for the development of Yamal LNG. So I would stick with the numbers that we give you right now. As I mentioned, we're anticipating about RUB 31 billion in CapEx. You are right to say that the intensity of capital at <mark type="inaudible" /> will go down, but that money will be reinvested in other growth opportunities as I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you very much for presentation. I have a question. First of all, as I understand Total said that they are going to increase their stake to 15% within one year and to 19% within three years taking NOVATEK. So the question is if of course it gets public is it &#x2013; if they are going to buy from the markets or from two main &#x2013; major shareholders? As you've said that it will be not from Gazprom for sure, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian] As Mark has correctly pointed out, we are in nearing closure of this 12% transaction with Total and they have indicated their interest in increasing their share over 19% over three years. However, they are under no obligation to do so. After these rumors in the market started spreading that Gazprom was considering to decrease its 10% stake in NOVATEK, all we can tell you is that we have not heard that and we can't give you any guidance whatsoever at this stage where these shares will be bought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And the other question is about Kazakhstan. Mark mentioned that <mark type="inaudible" /> is estimated at around $15 billion to $20 billion excluding tanker fleets and that the first price would be down at 5 million tons to 5.5 million tons by 2016. Can you please tell us for how many years those Kazakhstan $15 billion to $20 billion is expected to dispense like five years, seven, ten and about the volumes 5 million tons to 5.5 million tons by 2016. If it means that in 2019 we will see like doubling of the Kazak &#x2013; thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian] So that's premature now to tell you exactly what's the CapEx is going to be. As Mark has correctly pointed out, we're still in the precede stage now and that's why Mark has given such a broad range of $15 billion to $20 billion. We believe that in 12 months' time fleet will be complete then we'll have some much clearer picture of how much is going to cost us. But in many case the amounts you've heard from Mark corresponds to total production capacity of 15 million tons to 16 million tons that is going to come from three trains, the first of which is expected to be completed by late 2016 or 2018 the latest. So as soon as it goes on stream, it will start generating revenue of its own that is going to be used to support implementation of train two and train three.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from William <mark type="inaudible" /> of Flex. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions if I may. First of all will this be a standard LNG project? In other words you will line up say 80% of the capacity on long term contracts before you commit to the final investment decision. And second if you please &#x2013; what do you think is going to happen with the marketing of the gas will be mainly done by Total, will Gazprom have a role in this? I know these fields still have export monopoly, can you just explain how that's going to work out in the future. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian] As far as just going to the funds, it's primarily for project finance which means that we do need to produce some guarantees that a significant portion of the produce will be effectively sold; that offtake is essentially guaranteed. And it is also part and parcel of our contract with Total. You've mentioned a number of 80% and I agree that this is a very sensible number to go for, as we will need to raise and repay debt.</p>
          <p>As regards other participants, all I can say at this stage is that we are negotiating with a multitude of different companies and their numbers have swollen, since Prime Minster promised such huge support for the project.</p>
          <p>We believe that a lot will be done in 2011, but most importantly we have attracted a major and although we believe that we will find other strategic partners in 2011, we don't consider it critical. Now that we have a major, we can safely move ahead and take some time to find other strategics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also I just want to add to, as I'd mentioned in the &#x2013; in my commentary, that we have already dealt with that export issue by signing the agency agreement with Gazprom Export. So I believe the structure that is in place will satisfy that requirement of the law and export rights.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. [Russian] So we have three questions coming from Nadia Kazakova. The first is dealing with CapEx for 2010 and 2011 and this is needed to know there's a comparison data for [inaudible] CapEx for Sibneftegaz. The second question deals with the Gazprom option for NOVATEK shares. What's the sale price of this public data, and when are you going to execute it. And the final question deals with the speculation that there could be some other state supports going beyond the tax cuts, is there anything you can tell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian] I'm not sure everyone understand your first question, because two of the major fields owned by Sibneftegaz, that's Beregovoy and Pyreinoye, have been in operation for over a year, which means that CapEx in 2010 there was negligible and it will be negligible this year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Russian] The results of the [inaudible] layer in the Yurkharovskoye field, which hasn't been penetrated yet, we're going to re-assess its potential this year. And it will involve a bit of CapEx, which will drive our revenue and production as well.</p>

The state is going to commit some funds to infrastructural development programs in the Yamal region and Yamal LNG is going to benefit from this program just like there are many other parties operating there. And we believe that there will be other projects in the Yamal peninsula for example other projects in hydrocarbon production or processing a liquid section that will also benefit from the same infrastructural development program.</p>
