        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for waiting. We would like to welcome everyone to Ambev's Second Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Today with us, we have Mr. Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, CEO for Ambev; and Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer.</p>
          <p>We would like to inform you that this event is being recorded and all participants will be in listen-only mode during the company's presentation. After Ambev's remarks are completed, there will be a question-and-answer section. At that time, further instructions will be given. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Ambev's management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions because they relate to future events and, therefore, depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of Ambev and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>I would also like to remind everyone that, as usual, the percentage changes that will be discussed during today's call are both organic and normalized in nature and, unless otherwise stated, percentage changes refer to comparisons with Q2 2011 results. Normalized figures refer to performance measures before special items, which are either income or expenses that do not occur regularly as part of Ambev's normal activities. As normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, the company discloses the consolidated profit, EPS, EBIT and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in the earnings release.</p>
          <p>I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Jamel, you may begin your conference.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maureen. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our 2012 second quarter results conference call.</p>
          <p>As usual, I'll begin by sharing with you some highlights of our second quarter performance and then Jo&#xE3;o will take over to cover in greater detail the operational results of our Brazil, HILA-ex, Latin America South and Canada business units. And before we take your questions, I'll wrap up things up with a summary of our financial figures.</p>
          <p>So let's get started. In the second quarter, our consolidated EBITDA performance improved, growing 9.3% organically and reaching almost R$3 billion. Consolidated EBITDA margin was 43.6%.</p>
          <p>If we take a look at our divisional performance, Brazil delivered double-digit EBITDA growth of 12.2% organically with EBITDA margin of 47.8%. Net revenues increased 11.5%, thanks to a 3.9% volume growth and 7.4% net revenue per hectoliter growth.</p>
          <p>Latin America South EBITDA rose 7.8%, and EBITDA margin was 38.1%, with volumes declining 0.9% but net revenues 15% higher than the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Canada saw a 2.1% decline EBITDA, combined with EBITDA margin of 31.1%. Organic volumes were 0.3% lower than Q2, while net revenues grew 2% thanks to a 2.4% increase net revenue per hectoliter.</p>
          <p>Now for HILA-ex which seems to me also includes as a scope the results of Cervecer&#xED;a Nacional Dominicana, as we discuss later on this call, our team delivered positive EBITDA of R$37.2 million.</p>
          <p>Our normalized profit for the second quarter reached nearly R$2 billion, a 6.6% improvement versus same period last year. Normalized EPS grew 6.1%.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand it over to Jo&#xE3;o, so he can walk you through our financial performance and comments on the outlook for the reminder of the year. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jamel, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back at the second quarter, this was a quarter in which a myriad of questions surfaced around the short-term strength of the Brazilian economy and the state of the consumer, the possible headwinds arising from the announced increase in federal excise tax in Brazil for this year and beyond, as well as the concerns about the Argentinean economy.</p>
          <p>I will come back to each of those topics later as they are surely important to understand the quarter's performance as well as the prospects for our business going forward. But I want to begin by saying that our team held its ground and managed to answer with a better overall performance than the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And here's why. First, we were able to improve our top line performance by increasing the Ambev consolidated net revenue 10.4% with 3.9% volume growth and 7.4% net revenue per hectoliter growth in Brazil being the main highlights.</p>
          <p>Second, our COGS per hectoliter grew below inflation once more at 3.4% versus the second quarter of 2011, driven mostly by very limited growth out of Brazil, only 0.8%. And third, our HILA-ex division began a whole new chapter performance-wise given the closing of our strategic alliance in the Caribbean and delivered positive EBITDA results of R$37.2 million.</p>
          <p>That said, we experienced volume decline in Latin America South and Canada, albeit less than 1% and SG&amp;A spend ended up being 18.7% higher than the Q2 in part because of the timing of bonus accrual in Brazil, higher distribution costs also in Brazil and as well as in Latin America South, but also because of higher sales and marketing spend in Canada and LAS, which we view as the right thing to do in those two markets to support our innovation platform for the moment being. In the end, we delivered 9.3% EBITDA growth, which we view as a good result all things considered.</p>
          <p>So let's take a closer look at each of our business units, starting with Beer Brazil. Volumes rose 2.8%, which was nearly in line with the industry growth, giving us an average of 68.8% for the second quarter. Our main focus was to make steady progress on the action plans for our four commercial priorities, namely: innovation, premium, the North and the Northeast, as well as the pack price strategy with returnables.</p>
          <p>On innovation, our volumes expanded significantly, mainly due to the cycling growth of Antarctica Sub-Zero as well as the Skol 360&#xB0;, and distribution for these brands increasing during the course of last year.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, volumes for our premium brands grew approximately 16% in the quarter, led by our domestic premium brand, Original, and Stella Artois as well as Budweiser from our international premium portfolio. Budweiser, by the way, continues to gain ground in the country through increased distribution. And during Q2 2012, we gave it an extra push by launching our first major TV and digital ad campaign for the brand with Anderson Silva, the Brazilian mixed martial arts fighter, and Steven Seagal. The campaign was recognized by advertising age as the second biggest digital campaign in the world at that time with 11.4 million viewers on the YouTube in eight days which was also the third most viewed video for Brazil on YouTube ever.</p>
          <p>There's still a long way to go, but we're satisfied with results thus far. As for Bohemia, the leading premium brand in Brazil during the second quarter, we re-opened the Bohemia brewery in the City of Petr&#xF3;polis in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The brewery will produce line extension of the Bohemia family in long neck bottles in certain limited-edition Bohemia brewmaster creation. More importantly, the brewery is now home to a complete brewing experience open for visitation, one of the large and more complete in the world in order to celebrate beer heritage since the Sumerians and beer culture styles to Brazil, dating back to Bohemia's launch in 1853 at the very same time. The brewery is a must visit for anyone coming to Brazil and is also an important pillar for building the beer category image.</p>
          <p>Turning to the North and Northeast strategy. As you know, these two regions have been on top of our agenda for a while now. In the second quarter, our volumes there grew more than three times faster than the rest of the country with further market share gains. Events were once again important volume drivers for us with strong brand activation for Skol and Antarctica during the summer growth, distributed in the Northeast as well as the first time sponsorship of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (09:27) festival in the state of Amazonas. We launched a limited edition Skol decorated can just for the festival, even painted the brand color code for the first time to honor the cultural heritage of the event.</p>
          <p>Best revenue performance in the region came from Brahma, which we believe is beginning to benefit from certain of our initiatives for the brand in the region, such as what we call our soccer platform. Accordingly, we have established partnership with nine local teams in the region and set up fan's page on Facebook in order to find new ways to constantly and consistently engage with the fan base, enabling us to build more and more loyalty over time.</p>
          <p>As for pack price strategy, we've focused on returnables. Volumes for our returnable packs in Q2 2012 grew ahead of our one-way presentations for mainly two reasons. First, we cycled last year rollout and increased distribution of the one-liter glass bottle. And second, we continue increasing distribution of the 300-milliliter returnable glass bottle in the Southeast as well as beginning to take it beyond this region. This strategy has been also supported by the launch of a TV ad campaign to remind consumers that returnables are making their way back to supermarkets, giving them their favorite brands at more attractive price points for different needs or occasions.</p>
          <p>With respect to net revenues, following a first quarter marked by tough comps, higher taxes, changes to our promotional calendar, our net revenues per hectoliter actually increased 7.2% this time around. A relevant portion of this performance is explained by the carryover from last year price increase in the fourth quarter as well as the scaling back on promotional activity from Q1 2012 and hiking of the federal excise tax increase from April of last year. But we also benefit from increased rate of direct distribution as well as the premiumization of our mix.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the cost side, our COGS per hectoliter in Brazil Beer grew 3.4%, mainly as a consequence of higher depreciation of our industrial assets, while the product of the execution of our hedging policy was currency gains partially offsetting pressure coming from malt.</p>
          <p>On other hand, SG&amp;A rose 18% against a very tough comp in Q2 2011, which actually decreased 1.2% at the time. A few comments here, first, the spike in admin expenses primarily results from the fact that in the second quarter of 2012 there were lower accruals from variable compensation. Second, our distribution expenses were higher given volume growth, greater weight of direct distribution and general inflation, particularly weight. And third, as you may remember, our sales and marketing investments were higher in the first quarter of 2012 because of the effort to concentrate more spending in the beginning of the year due to the Carnival strategy. As a result, our commercial spend increased considerably less in Q2. When you add it all up, our Brazil Beer normalized EBITDA improved by growing 9.5% with 110 basis point of gross margin expansion but 30 bps of EBITDA margin contraction.</p>
          <p>Turning to Brazil soft drinks and non-alcoholic non-carbonated business, which had an outstanding quarter. Our volumes were 6.9% better than Q2 2011, while market share according to Nielsen was stable at 17.8%. Guaran&#xE1; Antarctica continued to show impressive performance during the quarter volume wise and in terms of market share. I believe Guaran&#xE1; Antarctica's performance illustrate well what we're trying to accomplish with Brazil soft drinks business.</p>
          <p>For a more strategic point of view, first, we continue to reinforce our presence in more profitable single-serve packaging, 237-milliliter PET bottle and the 350-milliliter can. Second, our pack price strategy for multi-serve packages ranging from the one-liter to the 3.3 has kept working. And third, we further developed our returnable packaging by continue to grow the one-liter glass bottle.</p>
          <p>On the innovation front, Antarctica Citrus has been delivering promising results. Fusion Energy Drink has increased distribution in general and can be found in major Brazilian cities around the country in both the on and the off-trade. And in late May, we launched in S&#xE3;o Paulo our zero-calorie grape flavored H2OH! Frutas. We joined the orange and the citrus favor launches this year with major success.</p>
          <p>On the pricing side, net revenues per hectoliter delivered 10.9% growth against the same period last year, driven mainly by the carryover of our price increase of late last year and also favored by an easier comparison with the second quarter of 2011 when federal excise taxes went up.</p>
          <p>Our COGS per hectoliter, as anticipated during last quarter's call, declined considerably by 6.9%, thanks to gain in currency hedging and lower raw materials and packaging costs overall. We do not expect to repeat that performance during the second half of the year, so one should expect COGS per hectoliter to increase going forward, but our guidance of growing COGS per hectoliter in Brazil, meaning soft drinks and beer, below inflation still stands.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation and amortization, escalated by 53%. In this case, we had an even tougher SG&amp;A comparison than in Brazil Beer. As in the second quarter of last year, we saw a decline of 16.6% in addition to the previously mentioned low comparison base due to the timing of bonus. We also had a different phasing of commercial spend, which general inflation and greater distribution costs driven by labor related expenses and more volume growth had a relevant impact as well. But all in all, our Brazil CSD &amp; NANC EBITDA rose 26.5% with expansion in EBITDA margin of 300 basis points giving us 48.7% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about our new and improved HILA-ex division. As Nelson pointed out earlier, in May, we closed a strategic alliance with the Le&#xF3;n family, controlling shareholders of Cervecer&#xED;a Nacional Dominicana, or simply CND. They now own approximately 51% of the company.</p>
          <p>So the next four quarters we'll present synergy results together with the performance of our subsidiary called AmbevDominicana in the scope column of our HILA-ex division, while organic variations will only include the other countries.</p>
          <p>Our focus during the second quarter was in kicking off and begin full speed implementation of our integration plan for both companies. The integration plan has been detailed with a series of top line and bottom line opportunities duly mapped, and the team is committed to delivering our guidance of generating by May 2013 approximately $190 million of EBITDA from combined operations. Our partnership with the Le&#xF3;n family has surely started off on the right foot. I believe that in the next quarter, I will be able to begin sharing some more detailed figures.</p>
          <p>Heading now to Latin America South, this was the first quarter of single-digit EBITDA growth since the second quarter of 2012. EBITDA was up 7.8%, while our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 38.1%.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we experienced volume loss in Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, mainly driven by a decline in the industry in each of these countries, which internally is explained by a slowdown in the economic activity altogether.</p>
          <p>This was definitely the main blow to our business as beer volume decreased 1.7%. The good news is that if we zoom in on Argentina, for instance, which is our largest operation in the region, we grew 70 basis points of market share reaching an all-time high, the average of 77.7 for the quarter, with Quilmes, Stella Artois, and Brahma, our top three brands in the country, all delivering positive market share performance.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we remain active in the marketplace when it comes to innovation with the launch in May of a domestic premium brand called Quilmes 1890 which is the year of the brewery foundation. And a new one-liter returnable glass bottle for Quilmes Cristal in its line extension which has a more modern outlook and feel to it.</p>
          <p>Also net revenues per hectoliter for beer grew 15% organically as a result of price increase to keep up with inflation, also helped by the continued increase rate of premium, notably Stella Artois, in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>With respect to CSD/NANC top line results in the region, in spite of market contracts in Argentina, our volumes improved by 0.3%, driven by market share growth in the country and H2OH!, Paso de los Toros and Twister volume performance.</p>
          <p>Net revenue per hectoliter grew 19.8%, mostly due to price increase to keep up with inflation. For total Latin America South, net revenues per hectoliter were 16% above the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to costs. During the second quarter, Latin America South costs per hectoliter grew 15.6% with relevant cost pressure coming mainly from higher costs related to malt, aluminum and bottles as well as labor.</p>
          <p>Increasing weights impacting distribution cost were yet again among the main causes for further pressure in SG&amp;A, along with the different phasing related through our sales and marketing expense to support our innovation losses in the quarter, for example.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A grew 27.1% for Latin America South in the second quarter. Looking ahead, though we continue to expect a tougher macroeconomic environment to remain a reality, especially in Argentina and Paraguay, we still believe we can deliver double-digit EBITDA growth for the year.</p>
          <p>So let's finish with Canada. The second quarter delivered performance in line with our expectations. Total volumes declined 0.3% but with domestic volumes increasing 0.2% and net revenue per hectoliter growing 2.4%, while SG&amp;A increased by 6.7% largely driven by higher marketing investment behind our innovation launches and Budweiser hockey programming.</p>
          <p>COGS per hectoliter decreased by 1% versus last year, driven by hiking of depreciated assets offsetting escalation from commodities. The net result was a decline in EBITDA of 2.1% versus Q2 2011 while maintaining growth of 1.1% year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Talking about our top line performance in a bit more detail, the Canadian beer industry was stable as compared to the same period last year, showing an improvement versus the trend over the previous year. We lost 20 bps market share in the quarter last year, but Bud Light continued to deliver its strong market share performance, and Budweiser brand helped continue its positive evolution.</p>
          <p>Innovation continues to be one of our top line levers, as we strive to keep striking the right balance of price and market share to further increase profitability. During this quarter, we launched Alexander Keith's Cider in Ontario along with Michelob ULTRA and Bud Light Lime Mojito nationally, all of which had positive initial results.</p>
          <p>Before turning it over to Nelson, I would like to go back to my opening remarks around the Brazilian economy and the federal excise tax increase and share with you how they impact our outlook for the second half of the year. We still expect beer volume in Brazil to resume growth for the full year, with a better balance between volume and price as compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>The Brazilian federal government continues to take measures to stimulate the Brazilian economy, which give us some degree of confidence that such measures will eventually begin changing our macroeconomic environment for the better during in the second half of the year. Besides our confidence in the medium and long-term prospects for the Brazilian economy remains unaffected.</p>
          <p>In the cold beverage industry through its industry associations have continued to seek a reversal of the announced tax increase in some shape or form though, at this stage, no assurance can be given if they will succeed. If the industry does not succeed, the more likely outcome is a real increase in consumer price, followed by some impact on volume. Our intent will be to minimize volume and share loss, leveraging the stronger portfolio we have nowadays, not only in terms of brands but also <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:40) and packages, not to mention our sales execution capabilities. Yes, it will be anything but easy, but this is the challenge we have to overcome in order to have at least a good year. We have done our homework since June, and now it's time to execute.</p>
          <p>Back to you, Nelson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o. In this final part of the call, I will walk you through the main items between our normalized EBIT of over R$2.5 billion and profit of close to R$2 billion, as you can find on page three of our release.</p>
          <p>Adding special items, we had an expense of R$26.8 million during the second quarter, nearly all of which related to fees and expense incurred with respect to the signing and closing of our strategic alliance with Caribbean CND.</p>
          <p>Our net financial results were a negative R$168 million, R$143 million worse than the second quarter of 2011. The main cause behind this variation is the impact of the real devaluation on certain intercompany transactions, generating unrealized foreign exchange translation losses on intercompany payables and loans. This impact, however, is economically offset by the foreign exchange translation gains on offshore companies that are registered in equity.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate was 16.8% for the quarter against 16.3% in Q2 2011. Included tax benefits coming from greater interest on own capital payments were more than offset by a higher taxable base. Keep in mind that we face a very tough comp in this regard because last year we benefited from certain one-time tax credit, as you may recall. Year-to-date, our effective tax rate is 18.5% compared to 19.5% last year.</p>
          <p>And finally, we ended the second quarter with a net cash position of about R$1 billion, down more than R$3.1 billion since December 31, 2011, which is fairly consistent before we return to the  levels we had prior to end of last year. Approximately R$3.8 billion has been distributed to shareholders through July 2012 as dividends and interest on capital which is about R$2 billion more than last year during the same period.</p>
          <p>Back to Jo&#xE3;o for a quick announcement about the leadership change in Canada and Latin America South.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jamel. After nearly three years leading our Canada team, Bary Benun will be moving to China effective January 1, 2013, to become the new President of AB InBev in that country. The new BU President for Labatt will be Carlos Lisboa, who currently heads our operations for Bolivia Paraguay, Chile and Uruguay in Latin America South. Lisboa takes to Canada over 19 years of experience at Ambev, the majority of which in marketing related roles where he was responsible for Skol marketing strategy for 2001 until 2004, and later served as Ambev's Marketing VP for 2005 until 2010. I'd like to congratulate both on their appointments, thank them for their contributions to date and wish them the best of success in their new roles.</p>
          <p>With that, let's now take your questions. Maureen?</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is Lore Serra, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Can I ask just to clarify, the guidance you've given of price at least above or at least with inflation as well as volumes better than last year, is the underlying assumption there that the excise tax for October goes through? I understand you're still fighting it or discussing it, but is the assumption in that guidance that it goes through in October?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, definitely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you give us a sense of how you see &#x2013; I mean I guess the improvement in revenue per hectoliters here had to do with the fact that taxation was a bit less &#x2013; earlier front-end loaded this year and the pricing stock, and your market share looks solid but down a little bit. Can you talk about any market dynamics that you need to think about if you think about that second half pricing environment and that guidance? I guess I'm a little bit surprised that you're taking the guidance up in terms of the pricing outlook given the trends we're seeing in terms of volumes and share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Lore, this is Jo&#xE3;o. We continue to feel very confident about the commercial strategy. I think first &#x2013; I mean as I mentioned in the opening statement, I think the combination of liquid innovation with Sub-Zero and 360&#xB0; give us &#x2013; continue to give us tools to fight in different regions of the country.</p>
          <p>Then, of course, the pack price strategy with more returnable bottles now being able to go from three plants &#x2013; by the end of the year, we have seven plants able to produce 300 ml. So, that combination of liquid and pack price strategy being more widely available continues to give us a lot of confidence in the commercial strategy from that standpoint.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we now have newly enhanced trade programs such as also the soccer platform that I also mentioned in the opening statement which has proved to be, together with the digital strategy, a great way to connect with our consumers.</p>
          <p>That combination of commercial flexibility from liquid and packaging as well as in trade as our marketing strategy also connecting consumers, we feel that we continue to build new options as well as exercising them as we go along.</p>
          <p>On top of that, premiumization continues to work. Having the four brands, the two domestic, Original and Budweiser, Original and Bohemia, but also Budweiser and Stella international growing sometimes three to four times or five times ahead of the average gives us also better tools to fight, as well as premiumization of the net sales per hectoliter. That also helped coupled with the direct distribution.</p>
          <p>When you put this whole thing together in giving the 68.8% share that we have, which is still the second or third best for a second quarter in the last nine or 10 years, we feel that we can go into the second half having a lot of tools and actions to be taken regarding competition, which seems to be also fighting their own fights in terms of profitability but also to face the tax increase.</p>
          <p>What we wanted to do really in the first half, especially since April or May when we knew about the tax increase, was to get ready for October. I think what is yet to be seen is what exactly will be the impact on volumes for the fourth quarter of this tax increase. I think this is the part on which &#x2013; of course, we have the demand model to help us see where it is.</p>
          <p>We feel confident on the guidance that we have of having growth resume, as we saw in the first as well as in the second quarter. We'll see that also in the third quarter, but we have to see what will be the effects on the volumes of the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Great. Well, I mean, that's really helpful color. But I guess what I'm not understanding is since the second quarter &#x2013; I'm sorry, the first quarter was released, you had the excise tax amount. So that's changed. I mean, a lot of what you talked about was there already. So what's changed that your pricing outlook is more favorable now than it was when you announced the first quarter? Is it that the market environment is more favorable than you thought? I'm just not understanding why the guidance changed in light of the fact that taxation went up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the in line to the at least, let's say, the subtle change was really to show our confidence. The reason I started really to highlight once again the commercial strategy, the combination of sales execution strategy, the marketing strategy, together with the premiumization of the portfolio with our distribution. That whole combination make us feel that we can now be not just at least, not just in line but be at least above right inflation.</p>
          <p>It's really the combo, it's not one super bullet that made the difference but the whole combination as we see what's coming in terms of tax increase, but also how the market has also reacted for the pricing environment of whatever happened this year so far. That combination of internal commercial strategy as well as how the market has responded so far this year, we feel we can make that subtle change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't open that in detail, Bob. But mainly I mean it has been for about two years, we're talking about one-third, two-third on average, okay. From the early 2000 until, let's say, late 2009, every year, can grew a little bit. A little bit, we're talking 20 bps, 30 bps.</p>
          <p>In 2009, when we launched the strong returnable strategy that has &#x2013; the growth has first diminished. Then actually the participation decreased, okay. So I think that's -- I think that's the detail. So one-third, two-thirds on average, we had from 2000, 2008 growing and then 2009 starting to flattish, and 2010, 2011 starting to decrease.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's very helpful. And then we were very impressed with the pricing in CSDs, particularly given the big push in returnables, a lot more multi-serves. Can you comment a little bit about how you're getting the pricing in soft drinks and the outlook that you have, given the bigger tax increases in CSDs, particularly for some of your rivals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think a couple of things are happening in CSD. And to be quite honest, we're really harvesting some of the things we have seeded during the last two, three years. I think we mentioned that while we learned a lot from the pack price in CSD to beer, we also have learned a lot from beer into CSD on flavor innovation and innovation as a whole. So we launched in the first quarter of last year five important CSDs in terms of the one-liter returnable, of course, and the pack price. That 237 was a big push in the last 18 to 24 months, now being one of the most important SKUs that we have. So we have a very profitable single-serve packing, which gives you greater net revenues per hectoliter growth, more than compensating, let's say, for the eventual &#x2013; potentially less on the net sales per hectoliter on the one-liter returns, which gives you greater share positioning.</p>
          <p>Combined with that, I mentioned the citrus favor, the energy drink, also new package for Gatorade, that combo and coupling the CSD programs many times working better with the beer programs from an execution standpoint give us a much better situation at the marketplace against our competitors, either the main competitor but I think also the other brands. I think Coke had had a lot of success in the past taking share over from the B brands. That's also happening now also for Ambev.</p>
          <p>So this quarter I think is the first time we're able to show this great combination of volume and price on a very strong manner, not that they have not shown that before. And I think also the market is feeling the pressure from the tax increase that will come later on the year. And I think the whole market is protecting the profitability going forward either for 2012. But I think this will certainly have an impact on 2013 and beyond, which from a profitability standpoint I think is good news. Not that I like the tax increase but I think it will force the market to adjust in terms of its pricing strategy.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, Jo&#xE3;o, and everyone. I wanted to ask about Argentina because you're saying in the release that the soft drink industry was also down, but it's not really borne out by the numbers. Because I'm sure as you looked at the Coca-Cola, bottler results out of Argentina have been much better than what's happening in beer, and so if you can help me understand what's happening there?</p>
          <p>It sounds like you're gaining share in Argentina soft drinks &#x2013; sorry, that you're losing share in Argentina soft drinks and you're also gaining share in beer because if you talk on the CCU numbers, you don't want to exclude their lack of shipments of Budweiser to Paraguay. Their volumes were still down about 7%, and it sounds like even though we don't have the disclosure, it sounds like your Argentina volumes were not down anywhere near that 7%. So, any color on Argentina would help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Jose, this is Jo&#xE3;o. You are right, I mean this is &#x2013; as you know, let me first tell you a small disclaimer that you know, but I think it's always good to remind people from time to time. The Nielsen coverage numbers that we use for any &#x2013; most of the countries where are, it's Nielsen; in some countries, it's CCR; in other countries, a few others provide us when Nielsen is not in place &#x2013; their coverage goes anywhere from 55% to 75%, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing. And in the markets where we have our competition numbers open to the manner we have, when we feel there is a big discrepancy, of course, we go back to them to try to understand.</p>
          <p>And you are right, this quarter is a quarter on &#x2013; in some cases, there's a big discrepancy, especially in Argentina when you look beer, us against our main competitor, and also soft drinks when you include <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:31). But to be quite honest, that's also true for soft drinks Brazil, where also there was a big discrepancy where our share is shown as flat, but we're growing more than our main competitor, okay.</p>
          <p>If we look at the difference between <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:45) and Ambev, it's &#x2013; when you say CSD volume and not total volume because you always said, there's a small discrepancy when sometimes people are adding flavored water or not, it's not that big, the 7.6 against a 6.5. If you want to &#x2013; when you look on a region-by-regional basis, because Argentina has one region, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:05) has another region. So you are right, there are discrepancies. But I think the direction is the right one, which means our commercial strategy in Argentina <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:18) for beer working very well. I mean you're seeing our results for the quarter or for the year doing both very well from a market standpoint and in CSD after a few quarters where we had, let's say, a tougher comparison. Although it's also tough in this quarter. I think the launch of Twister during the last year as well has strengthened some of the things we are doing with Paso de los Toros and H2OH!. We are now getting very close from a volume perspective against our competitors.</p>
          <p>So we &#x2013; I feel that we are on the right track despite we're not satisfied at all with, let's say, the EBITDA result of the quarter. We feel that we will have a good year from a Latin America South perspective, and this quarter does not reflect what we hope for the year on an EBITDA basis. Volume is &#x2013; it is what it is. We'll recover the profitability, but we are pretty confident on the share front both in beer and in soft drinks going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just follow up real quick, you sound like into the third quarter and the July numbers do not appear to be either stabilizing or getting a little better or less negative than what happened in the second quarter. Is that right directionally? Is that statement correct or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think I said that. I think what I think is &#x2013; I think what I tried to portray was more our &#x2013; in another manner, we're talking along this year on this balance between volume and price for Brazil coming from a certain macro condition. I think the macro conditions of Argentina and the other countries in Latin America South are slightly different, not totally but slightly different from Brazil. What I was trying to convey, we also use our market position to have the right balance also between volume and price.</p>
          <p>I think what's good in Argentina specifically is the very strong market share position we have conquered in the last two quarters, which again gives us a better base from which to take decisions on the third and the fourth.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, and thank you for the question. This is Pedro Leduc, representing Alan Alanis's team from JPMorgan. And our question is specifically regarding the 17% total SG&amp;A rise seen in Beer Brazil, which is basically almost twice as fast at the top line growth base, and you did mention that it's related to bonus payments and increased distribution expenses. But could you please elaborate a little more on each of these two drivers, and then as well as provide us some guidance of what we should see here for this line for the remaining of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Pedro, it's Nelson here. So as we tried to explain in our release and I'll try to give some more color on this, but the first point &#x2013; important point to  highlight that we had a very tough comp in Q2 2011. Our SG&amp;A actually, it was down versus 2010 while for the full year last year, it grew mid-single digit, so it was really a tough comp. And the main effect for this was the timing of bonus accruals and reported out also in the release last year that that was the main reason. But we also had &#x2013; to start with, we also had some incremental sales and marketing expenses at high single-digit growth in the quarter to support our commercial initiatives and that was particularly the case for CSD in this quarter, not really for beer.</p>
          <p>Logistics costs they also grew double digits and that was affected in first place by volume growth, a high weight of direct distribution, some increase of wages primarily because truck drivers and helpers are linked to minimum wage which grew 14% this year. We also comment on that in the beginning of the year in the first quarter results announcement. And as well as to a certain extent, product shipping costs that from one <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:45) man are benefiting from our improved footprint particularly in the Northeast and North regions.</p>
          <p>But on the other side, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:55) a forward innovation such as Budweiser, which we opened to major cities throughout the country but it's still produced in one single location, and mainly our returnable glass bottles 300-milliliter was an important commercial initiative for this year, which at this stage is only produced in three plants but by year end, we're going to have an another four plants, so in total seven plants with this product being produced. So that is a way logistic costs will rise throughout the year as incremental CapEx plan.</p>
          <p>So in a nutshell, say, with logistic costs growth getting smaller, easing in connection with CapEx, also considering a more normalized bonus accrual, say, for the year to grow overall SG&amp;A growth in the second half should for sure help us deliver a stronger EBITDA performance. I think that's the view there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. You already touched upon this, I think, on several occasions but the whole idea of getting this more balanced top line growth this year, I was just curious, obviously, you'll hit that target relative to what you did last year. But when you made that comment earlier this year and I guess I'm focusing on Brazil, did you expect volume growth to potentially pace faster than it has looking for more recovery than we've seen, or did you just take more pricing opportunities which impacted volume because they were there to take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lauren, if I understood correctly your question, you are asking comparing to what we said in the beginning of the year, you were expecting more volume than price, is that what's your &#x2013; was that your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was just wondering if you were initially guiding to more balanced volume and pricing growth, as far as getting them more even rather than more heavily weighted to pricing growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. Well, right now, I mean more of a coincidence but if you look at the combination of the two Brazilian business on a year-to-date it's like a 4.4% growth in price and a 4.4% growth in volume. So this sounds pretty balanced, right. I think what we are trying to say is that when we said a more balanced approach than last year in the beginning of the year, we were not considering the sort of tax increase that was announced later in May, right.</p>
          <p>So with the announcement of the tax increase and our desire to protect our profitability, we have changed the guidance slightly on the pricing front, right, by saying in line to at least. This I think shows somewhat of a balance which will be still more balanced than last year but with similar color on the pricing side and on the volume in order to pass on the tax increase to price. I mean that's a subtle thing, but very important question and very important to understand what I'm trying to convey. So far, it was very balanced. Tax increase was announced in May. From now until the end of the year, pricing will take a somewhat more important role than it did in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So can I infer from that, that the consumer in Brazil as far as what you were expecting &#x2013; as far as firming up from what we saw last year is on track, and those types of growth rate just coming from the consumer environment is improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, no doubt. I think when we look at our volumes in both beer and soft drinks, it's true. I think when we look more now in terms of what people expect in terms of consensus of GDP growth, there is an acceleration expected for the third quarter and especially for the fourth quarter. I think the difference from other consumer goods is that our fourth quarter will be impacted &#x2013; will be positively impacted for this GDP growth that will most certainly come in the fourth quarter, but will be negatively impacted by the tax our price increase given that and, therefore, it's somewhat stall in volume.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Hi, everybody. The question relates really to this focus on the North and Northeast, and clearly the volume growth in the region for both beer and soft drinks have an outsized impact on the overall volume growth in the country.</p>
          <p>You talk about that growth being three times the national average. I just wanted to get a sense there. I mean, is that kind of three times certain pockets of the region, or is it really for the North and Northeast region as a whole? But really more specifically, are we looking at kind of stable this level of outsized growth &#x2013; is it stable, is it decelerating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. It is &#x2013; hi, Alex. This is Jo&#xE3;o. Thanks for the question. I mean, when I look today at our decision a few years back to focus on that region of the country, I think it was a very good one because we changed our footprint, we did new launches. We're getting closer to consumer. And when we mean three times, it's really three times. I mean it's &#x2013; if the country is growing three, it's growing nine. I mean, it's as simple as that.</p>
          <p>It's happening for both beer and soft drinks, and it's happening in both the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:56) and in the North, okay. So good thing &#x2013; we were there in a market visits several times this year, and we continue to view the market being firm and a lot of potential going forward. We continue to be happy with the strategic decision and happy with the volume results on a quarter-by-quarter basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. No. I mean, the second part of that question was just &#x2013; so with this growth outlook, do you feel that the production footprint is right-sized with a kind of 12-month, 18-month view? And as we think about this region vis-&#xE0;-vis the profitability in the country, I guess, is it fair for us to assume that probably because of the low density population or maybe lower pricing that the margin from this beverage business in this part of the country is lower than your national average, but that that gap is narrowing and at some point, it gets to close the national level? I mean, how should we think about this region as it becomes more of a meaningful impact on your national profitability level? That would be great to hear your comments on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, I think there is two sides to the question. I start with the first one. In the last two and a half years, the CapEx investment was "disproportional" to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:40). So let say that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:43) is &#x2013; I'm just going to give numerical examples. They are not exact numbers, okay. But let's say if <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:49) was 18% or 20% of our volumes, the CapEx that we did in the last five years was 35%, okay.</p>
          <p>So we almost doubled the participation on the capital investment in relation to what is the current volume, because we didn't have the right footprint and, of course, because this is growing three times faster than the rest of the region.</p>
          <p>At one point in time, which we're getting closer to as we speak, we will not need to spend two times the percentage of the CapEx in that region. We're not there yet, so we still have some disproportional. Going forward, we will not be as disproportional as it was in the past, so if this was 35% in the last 2.5 years, probably next year would be 26%, 27%. And then maybe one or two years down the road, this would go to the average of the rest of the country.</p>
          <p>So that's the first part of the question, there's still some to do but a lot has been done already, which is I think the good news because it gives us flexibility and also means that we're getting closer to our footprint, and it is today. Of course, when you launch a new product as you do for new premium brands, you may want to do more footprint capacity also to be able to respond to those. But for whatever we have today, we're getting closer.</p>
          <p>From a profitability, let's say, EBITDA standpoint, it changes. There are times &#x2013; well, first of all, let me say, first of all, it's not significantly different. Although it's different but not significantly. And from time to time, this gap has been closing, okay. So the gap was wider back in 2009. It is less today. And therefore, at a point in time, it could get closer. But I think here it's good to have the option to balance because sometimes you may want to have a profitability that could be from a per hectoliter standpoint slightly lower, but more than compensated from a volume standpoint which gives you much greater absolute EBITDA growth. So that's the balance also that we keep an eye between the per hectoliter basis but also on the total, not to be making the wrong decisions. And so far, I think we're taking the right decisions and results are showing that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have two questions. The first one, in the ABI call, you mentioned that you already have 500 pit stop stores. I imagine in the most important supermarket chains and hypermarket chains in the country. Could you please give an idea of at what stage of your rollout you are in these stores? And also, what is the incremental contribution that you are seeing in these stores that you're adding the pit stop stores to your total sales in that store? And if you already have a view on the approach and whether it is the returnabilities increasing substantially in these pit stop stores or whether you are having a negative impact in the higher inventory that you usually have to carry because of that? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Gustavo, very good question. Of course, you ask a lot of competitor sensitive information that we'll be not &#x2013; we're not able to give it out. But I mean the number of pit stops are increasing every month. We are actually very happy with the results, and that's why we keep increasing. I think we are probably at 25% of where we can get in terms of number of stores covered by that, so it's a long way to go.</p>
          <p>Very positive results from volume growth picking up, returnables growing, so I would say very positive growth, that's why we continue to be working very hard. It's a reality already. It's not a pilot anymore because, I mean, it's running 500 stores. So it's a matter of really implementation, executing, accelerating the speed, because <mark type="audio gap" /> (55:27-55:35). You mentioned you had a second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question is related a lot about the bonus accruing, how was the impact that actually they're having in the quarter? You mentioned the logistics costs, they went up &#x2013; there was double-digit growth in the quarter. I was trying to understand when we project the numbers for the second half, whether the bonus accruals were actually going to be below average to compensate for the probably above average accrual in the first half? I think the question is then the magnitude of the impact in the second quarter and whether the normalization will be actually below the average in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gustavo, it's Nelson here. I mean regarding bonus accrual, it's a function of how we perform versus our own target, our budget and &#x2013; so it may have quite a different range in terms of accruals on a quarter-by-quarter basis even for the full year depending on how we finish the year. And as you know, Q4 is a very important one, so many times we make &#x2013; it makes a difference in terms of how it performs versus our budget.</p>
          <p>But I think the key takeaway for you is that if you think of, let's say, administrative costs, it should grow single digits, right? I mean there is no reason with this rate of inflation environment and all the productivity and efficiency needed that we had in place. I mean we shouldn't see a double-digit item in cost growth, so that's more or less a controlled expense.</p>
          <p>And regarding our logistics, that's the one that's really growing double digits but should get better as we get to the second semester based on the CapEx investments we are doing. And also depend on volume outlook, but there's a strong correlation. The stronger is our volume, the stronger it would be. It's just a statement of logistics and also some of the commercial expense we have. So at this stage, I'd say, bonus we should have a little accrual in the second semester. All the rest equal, but again, it also depends on how we achieve &#x2013; how we perform the solid targets and logistics was the other important one here to look at and should get better.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Gabriel Lima, Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Just initially want to confirm what something Jo&#xE3;o said in the opening remarks. COGS per hectoliter going into the second half should increase, you're near but still below inflation for the full year. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Gabriel, it's Jo&#xE3;o here. That's correct. We are keeping our guidance that for the full year, we're going to have COGS in Brazil for both beer and soft drinks below inflation. Q2 was our best quarter for us in terms of currency hedge. When I compare year-over-year, that was the major upside we would get. For most of the commodities, it was also the best quarter, so &#x2013; especially in soft drinks, as you may have noticed. So in the end of the day, we should have the COGS per hectoliter growing above what we saw in Q2, but still having the year below inflation as we guided since the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. That's clear enough. Thanks. And just a follow-up, you guys talked about government initiatives and going to the second half, so just wanted to better understand how you expect your specific consumer responding to those initiatives mainly in light of the consumer leverage that your main peers, consumer peers, have been recently mentioning?</p>
          <p>And also if you could touch a little bit on weather conditions, at least here in the South there has been a very warm weather, so I just want to understand if you're seeing this for the country and if you're benefiting to that in light also the economic conditions? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, the reason for mentioning good consumer environment, it varies of course from industry to industry. But if you think that we have pretty much the same pricing conditions of last year, volume is probably much better. So, that's one of the ways we look into to &#x2013; look at this to be able to answer or to say this.</p>
          <p>Weather to be quite honest has been very volatile. I mean, we have had some great weeks in terms of weather, but then the week after, it's so-so. So it's pretty much on average in terms of weather.</p>
          <p>If we look at the second quarter in particular, temperature was several degrees higher on average, but rain was 3% higher, so almost like one thing compensating the other. But it hasn't been bad, but it hasn't been specifically great. So, it's been more on the neutral side, therefore, not been talked so much to explain either a spike or a slowdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Jo&#xE3;o. And just a quick one, effective tax rate, do you have a guidance for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we don't have a specific guidance, right? I mean what we consistently have is an effective tax rate that is lower, of course, than the corporate tax rate given the benefits from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:01:26), amortization and all the rest. The outlook we think is going to be &#x2013; is likely below last year's rate, which was 2.4%. Although again, it may vary on a quarterly basis. We had an easy comp in Q1, this one was a little bit tougher. But for the balance of the year, it should be in line or slightly better than last year. No major surprise there.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Jo&#xE3;o and Nelson. Just two quick questions. Just wanted to get more color on your strategy to keep &#x2013; on soft drinks to keep the profitability of share heading towards the end the year, given that you probably have a disadvantage in terms of impact on the taxation. So is you plan really to pass through all the prices and keep margins or maybe use beer to get back some of the margins loss in the soft drinks? How you think about your strategy for soft drinks in this &#x2013; given the recurring scenario of potential higher taxes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, our idea and approach is straightforward for both beer and soft drinks. Our idea is once it's certain, the tax increase, which we are considering certain but are working to try to revert some of that, showing that we don't think this is the best win-win approach for both the industry and the government. Of course, in any projection we're assuming what is in there is what's going happen.</p>
          <p>Our idea, as we mentioned, is to pass on the tax increase to prices for both beer and soft drinks. Of course, in beer we are the leader and so our decision is taken. In soft drinks, we are not, so I used to do that and we will do that. But of course, it's the market leader. If we read somewhat later, if we don't see that happening, we may have to change but our idea for both business is definitely to pass tax into the prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up on the beer related to the same subject. You plan maybe to start increasing prices gradually before maybe similar to what some players are doing to soft drinks markets for beer since you are the leader, or are you still waiting for October?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if you're referring to comments in other conference calls from some of the soft drinks players, but I think when you look year-to-date, both businesses have had not so different price increase. So actually, I don't see much difference between the two right now and we're not planning to do anything right now in advance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Final question on Argentina, are you anyhow concerned about FX controls, or has it impacted so far anything in your operations, maybe acquisition of raw materials or maybe payback of dividends, if you're concerned, if this has affected your operation so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Miguel, this question actually is obviously &#x2013; concern has been following the development closely, right. I mean to date, we have not experienced any material impact on our day-to-day operations, if you will, I mean as a result of  tax and FX regulation and control. We have a very low level of import and actually we are a net exporter in Argentina so, given our multiple facilities in country, which export to the countries in Latin America, mainly Brazil. The biggest challenge indeed has been to obtain government approval to repatriate funds via dividend. This has become increasingly more difficult in recent months but, at this stage, so far we haven't had major issues with that.</p>
