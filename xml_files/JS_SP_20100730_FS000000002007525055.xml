          <p>Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our 2010 Interim Results Presentation. My colleagues are now well known to most of you here. Jim Rush, our Group Finance Director; this will be Jim's last presentation before he steps down from the Board on the 6th of August, before returning to Australia with his family shortly thereafter. Simon Mawson, our new Finance Director has already joined us and he's here today, so Simon would you perhaps stand up. Thank you very much. Simon will be formally appointed Group Finance Director on the 6th of August. Next to him is Mark Drummond-Brady who is our International Chairman of our Risk &amp; Insurance activities. And next to him is William Nabarro, the Group's Commercial Director. William will also leave us on the 30th of August, having made the decision to leave the city to pursue a new career in teaching in the North of England. Before starting the presentation, I'd like to thank both Jim and William. Each has made a considerable contribution to JLT.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to be able to present a strong set of results today. Driving our underlying revenue has been market leading organic growth of 6%. This follows growth of 5% in 2009 and 6% in 2008. These results are commendable and a commendable achievement when set against the weak global economic environment, plus further softening of insurance rates in the second quarter and the continued low levels of investment income earned due to very low interest rates.</p>
          <p>During the first half of the year, we made good progress integrating our two recent Employee Benefits acquisitions, the HSBC Actuaries and Consultants Limited, which I shall refer to as HACL and iimia, our wealth management business. Our Business Transformation Programme is on track, and benefits are starting to flow through as anticipated with incremental saving in the full 2010 year now projected at &#xA3;8 million. We continue to add power to the JLT International brand. This includes a number of important initiatives; the expansion of JLT's international network which we announced earlier this week; the global rollout of our industry specialisms; the establishment of the Thistle operations overseas; and the internationalization of our Employee Benefits business, each of which I should cover in more detail later.</p>
          <p>JLT's standing, an established strategic position, as the leading specialty broker is enabling us to continue to retain and attract top best talent to the organization. The momentum continues to build at JLT. The group achieved 21% increase in total revenues or 13% at constant rates of exchange. Underlying EPS increased by 22%, a pleasing performance in absolute term, and underlines how the business is winning market share and seeing the benefits come through from the investments made. The growth was complemented by positive exchange rate movements, but also from the contribution from a strong organic growth of 6%.</p>
          <p>As I outlined in March, we are now including investments income within our total revenue number. This is in response to the market's desire for comparison between brokers. Our revenue growth is made up of four key components; underlying organic growth, growth from acquisitions, the impact of currency and investment income. Whilst we have not shown all of these components in the main body of our presentation, if you turn to the supplementary slides you'll see all of these numbers set out to you for each of our business areas.</p>
          <p>Organic revenue growth is the principal metric we track because it shows the real underlying growth of the business. I'm pleased to say that in the first six months we delivered organic growth of 6%. Underlying trading profit was up 22% actual from 57.8 million in 2009 to 70.7 million. Growth on a CRE basis was 3%. This low rate of growth was due in part to the recent investments in key hires, acquisitions and systems developments. We have been successfully recruiting senior professionals across the whole group from Sydney to S&#xE3;o Paolo to London and throughout our specialist segments, including Aerospace, Financial Risks, Mining to Oil &amp; Gas, through to Employee benefits and Thistle. We anticipate the benefit of these investments coming through the second half of 2010 and more fully in 2011. Underlying EPS was up 23.6p, up 22% from 19.3p in 2009. Our reported EPS was higher at 27p. This reflects the benefits of a number of exceptional and non-recurring items, including a tax credit of &#xA3;11 million. Jim will go into this in more detail later. The interim dividend is 8.8p.</p>
          <p>Our retail business around the world combined to deliver 24% revenue increase with organic growth of 9%. Our London Market businesses performed well with an 11% increase in revenues, and organic growth of 5%.In our Employee Benefits business revenues, increased by 50%, due primarily to the acquisition of HACL at the end of 2009 and iimia in early 2010.The organic growth rate achieved was 4% for the period. We are reporting the results for Thistle Insurance Services separately for the first time, reflecting the important strategic shift we are making with regard to our non-advisory business. This growing underwriting operation includes insurantz.com, our online businesses, the SME-focused operations, and the Ingham acquisition acquired in July 2009. In the first half of the year, Thistle has performed in line with our expectations at what is a formative stage, and I shall talk more about this development shortly.</p>
          <p>Retail operations; Australasia continues to perform strongly, producing a trading profit margin of some 31%. The normal first half, second half balance of this business means that trading margins will fall back in the second half of the year. Asia delivered strong revenue growth of some 14% with organic growth of 11%. LatAm continues to trade impressively with good results from Columbia, Peru and Brazil, producing organic growth of 22%. In May, we announced that we had restructured our representation in Mexico and reinforced our relationship with LMS, our long-term partner. As a consequence of this change, our Mexican operations are being reported in the associates line from June this year.</p>
          <p>Canada saw an improved performance in the first half of 2010, producing 7% organic growth and much improved profitability. Continental Europe performed well. This business area no longer includes our U.K. retail businesses, following the transfer of its advisory business into JLT Limited and its non-advisory business into Thistle. The 2009 figures have been amended to reflect these changes.</p>
          <p>London Market operations; Jardine Lloyd Thompson Limited achieved revenue growth of 10% including organic growth of 6%. As I just mentioned, these results include the contribution from the advisory U.K. retail operations which transferred into JLT Limited from the beginning of 2010. The integration of the business has been completed and a strategy is being implemented to increase earnings based on promoting JLT Limited's specialist capabilities throughout the U.K. In previous years, JLT Limited's margin has fallen back in the second half of the year. We do not expect this to be so pronounced in 2010. We anticipate that JLT Limited will be able to achieve its target of 20% trading profit margin in 2010, one year earlier than we had indicated.</p>
          <p>Lloyd &amp; Partners revenues grew by 12% with organic growth of 4%. The business is being supported by growth in two areas; firstly, energy, where we have seen significant new business. We began to see some hardening of rate at the end of the first half from Gulf-exposed risks as capacity has reduced following the Deepwater Horizon disaster; and secondly, cargo, which has benefited from rising commodity prices and new business wins.</p>
          <p>At JLT Re, which is comprised of our reinsurance broking and Aerospace business, total revenue increased by 12%, with organic growth of 5%. Our non-marine reinsurance book continues to make progress in both the U.K. and in the U.S. However, we saw this is partly offset by a decline in our energy book, which has suffered due to cedents purchasing less reinsurance for Gulf of Mexico wind exposures. In our Aerospace business, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the plan we launched in the spring of 2009 to become one of the leading brokers in the sector. During the last 15 months, we have had some 23 additional Aerospace professionals. To date, we have received appointments from 30-plus new clients spread throughout Asia, Europe and the Americas. A number of these new appointments do not attach until the second half of the year. We have not yet seen the full benefits in our results. Nonetheless, our U.K. Aerospace business reported organic growth of 14% for the half year.</p>
          <p>Employee Benefits; our Employee Benefit business delivered a 50% increase in revenues. This was substantially as a result of the acquisitions of HACL and iimia, plus organic growth of 4%. The trading margin has fallen back from 15% to 14%. This is in line with our expectations, as we integrated HACL and iimia which have been re-branded and are trading as projected. The integration is on track, and we believe it will be substantially completed by the end of the year, with further benefits to the bottom line starting to show through in the second half of 2010 and more fully in 2011. The Employee Benefits market continues to be focused on de-risking defined benefit pension schemes and developing defined contribution arrangements for the future. BenPal has now been commissioned by 30 clients, including Esure and Commerzbank. We believe further progress will be made by BenPal over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Thistle, the group's MGU, is an underwriting and distribution company which markets products on a non-advisory basis. Its activities focus on writing small-ticket, high-volume business. It is a marketing-led organization focusing on the distribution of a broad range of insurance products, including Thistle-branded products. It distributes direct through affiliates, via third party brokers and online, and provides end-to-end service from design, underwriting, quotation and marketing through to claims. It includes JLT Online and Insurantz.com. As previously highlighted, we do not use the group's balance sheet to underwrite risk.</p>
          <p>The formation of Thistle has led to a restructuring of our non-advisory business in the U.K., with significant investment and an underwriting capability with specialist personnel, new technology and the development of a major service center in Gloucester which will provide call center and online service capability. We have re-valued Thistle's existing relationship with insurers that provide capacity for its products and the terms on which that capacity is provided. As was previously highlighted, our earnings model will see the relative importance of our percentage share in underwriting profit progressively increasing by comparison to the initial fees and commissions. This should result in an overall increase in earnings, but we anticipate the increase will come through later as underwriting profits are recognized. Thistle has retained underwriting integrity despite extremely aggressive competition amongst the major composites, and we believe that our strategy will produce superior returns over time. This is a segment which is gaining momentum as we continue to build out its offerings, underwriting capabilities and means of distribution. It is too early to give meaningful guidance on the future potential of this business other than to say we remain very excited by the Thistle initiative.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand you over to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Dominic, and good morning. The group achieved good growth in the first half with all businesses meeting or exceeding our expectations. Group underlying trading profit was up 12.9 million to 70.7 million, representing a 22% increase. Similarly, underlying PBT increased by 13.9 million to 73.6 million, an increase of 23%. Net exceptional costs were 3.6 million, primarily relating to our Business Transformation Programme and acquisition integration costs. After deducting these exceptional items, PBT increased by 8.7 million to 70 million.</p>
          <p>Underlying tax expense was 20.4 million, representing an underlying tax rate of 27.8. This was partly offset by a non-recurring tax credit of 11 million, primarily relating to a successful resolution with tax authorities of various tax matters which go back over a number of years. Due to the material size of the 11 million tax credit, it is disclosed separately as a non-recurring item.</p>
          <p>Profit after tax and minorities increased by 16.1 million to 58.6 million, resulting in a diluted earnings per share of 27p. Excluding the net exceptional costs and non-recurring tax credit, underlying profit after tax and minorities increased by 10.1 million to 51.2 million. This represents an increase in the underlying diluted earnings per share to 23.6p. The Board has decided to increase the 2010 interim dividend to 8.8p per share from 8.5p in 2009. The full-year 2010 dividend will be recommended by the Board in March 2011 in view of the full year's financial performance and outlook.</p>
          <p>Our Business Transformation Programme is on track. There are no material changes to the guidance provided in March, being total forecast recurring cost savings of 14 million by 2011, resulting from cumulative one-off costs of 18 million. Due to the material size of this non-recurring expenditure, we are treating the project costs as exceptional. The benefit of this program will be efficiency gains and the opportunity to continue to enhance the services we provide to our clients. We are achieving this by freeing up client facing professionals whose time has been absorbed by processing that can be more readily handled by other colleagues. To achieve this, we are making use of our Mumbai office where we now have over 400 staff. In 2010, the additional cost savings are forecast to be 8 million. The one-off costs in 2010 are also forecast to be 8 million, comprising of 3 million in the first half and 5 million in the second half.</p>
          <p>The operating cost ratio continues to improve, with a decrease from 82.4% to 81.8% in the first half.</p>
          <p>Now, this needs to be seen in the context of the HACL acquisition, where it was only in the second quarter of this year that we were able to bring to bear a fresh commercial approach to the HACL business and start to reengineer the cost base of the combined business. As Dominic mentioned, we continue to recruit leading market practitioners right across all our businesses, and we have had a notable number of new joiners in the first half. We would expect to see further progress in bringing down the operating cost ratio in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Total operating costs increased by 52 million to 307 million, an increase of 20%, or 16% at constant rates of exchange. The most significant change occurred within employee benefits, reflecting the impact of the acquisition of HACL in December 2009 and iimia in January 2010. Central costs increased by 7 million to 13 million, including increased litigation and E&amp;O costs expensed and settled in the first half of 2010. Net exceptional costs comprise of 2.9 million for the Business Transformation Programme and 2.7 million for the integration of HACL and iimia, and this was offset by 2 million of net exceptional gains. The non-recurring tax credit in the first half of 11 million comprises of 10.3 million for the tax settlement credit and 0.7 million tax saving impact on net exceptional costs.</p>
          <p>Our London Market businesses benefited from a stronger dollar. The achieved blended rate after hedging was improved at $1.54 compared to $1.72 in 2009. Based on U.S. dollar revenue in the first half of approximately $135 million, the year-on-year increase in revenue was some &#xA3;10 million in the first half. We continue to have a prudent U.S. dollar hedging program to smooth out the volatility caused by a changing exchange rate on U.S. dollar revenue earned in our London Market businesses. This means our achieved rate is significantly less volatile than the market rate. As a guide, one &#x2013; each one cent movement in our achieved rate has a revenue impact of approximately &#xA3;1 million and a corresponding impact on trading profit of approximately 65% of the revenue change. Based on prevailing exchange rates and estimated full-year U.S. revenue of $260 million, we expect that our achieved rate for 2010 will be approximately $1.55, resulting in &#xA3;16 million of additional revenue in 2010 compared to 2009. Our latest currency positions are; 85% hedged for 2010 at a rate of $1.55; 80% hedged for 2011 at $1.51; and 70% hedged for 2012 at $1.53. We have also commenced hedging for 2013 and are 40% hedged at $1.51.</p>
          <p>There was a net cash outflow of 60 million in the first half of 2010.This was in line with expectations, and is consistent with the usual first-half trend of outflows caused by significant increases in working capital to be followed by decreases in the second half as cash is collected from the second quarter revenues. Normal capital expenditure increased by 4 million to 14 million as we continue to invest in IT, upgrading our infrastructure using smarter technology to become more automated and location-independent.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet shows that JLT is in a strong financial position. In line with previous years, net working capital materially increased in the first half to 93 million. This was largely due to increased receivables on the back of higher fees and brokerage. It is pleasing that the aging profile of uncollected brokerage and fees as of 30 June, 2010 has improved on last year, despite fees and brokerage income increasing by some 21%. The net pension deficit after tax is higher at 83 million, primarily due to the discount rate used on the value of U.K. pension liabilities moving from 5.7% as of 31st of December, 2009 to 5.36% as of 30 June, 2010. We continue to work closely with the trustees to investigate ways to further mitigate the risks.</p>
          <p>The pension assets returned 4% in the first half of 2010, with 65% of the assets invested in long-term AA corporate bonds. Net debt is 102 million, reflecting the acquisitions made in Employee Benefits business. The group has committed bank facilities equivalent to 258 million to December 2011. We benefit from strong banking relationships and are continually reviewing our committed long-term debt facilities, which we are confident will be successfully refinanced well ahead of expiry, with new maturities going out at least five years. Group net assets representing total equity increased in the six months to 30 June, 2010 by a further 21 million to 260 million.</p>
          <p>Before stepping down as Group Finance Director and returning to Australia with my family, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders at JLT, particularly Dominic and my other work colleagues. JLT has a distinctive winning culture and I will miss it along with life in the U.K. I'm very pleased to leave the group finances in the experienced hands of Simon Mawson, and I wish Simon, Dominic and the group all the very best.</p>
          <p>And I hand you back to Dominic.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. I'd now like to spend a couple of minutes talking to you about how we are taking a number of important strategic actions to add power to JLT's international brand. I spoke earlier about the restructuring of the U.K. retail insurance broking activities that used to be undertaken by JLT UK IB and the integration of the advisory broking activity into the specialist disciplines of JLT Limited. The early signs are that the combination is proving very successful. JLT Limited's industry specialist strength adds an additional dimension to our traditional U.K. retail broking businesses. It is a valuable point of differentiation in a marketplace where the offering is increasingly seen as a commodity and decisions made on price alone. By taking advantage of JLT Limited's deep-rooted knowledge of the client industries on which we concentrate, our colleagues who have moved into JLT Limited are better equipped to address the needs of our clients. And they take pride in being part of a world-leading, international, specialist broking firm.</p>
          <p>A similar development is now underway in our other retail broking businesses around the world. No longer will JLT have operations that could be characterized as generic mid-market broking. Since the preliminary results announcement in March, structural changes have been set in motion in Australasia, Canada and more recently, in Asia. Our businesses are no longer managed and reported city-by-city in these regions. Instead, all activities which involve the provision of full advisory broking services are structured according to the client industry served and are operated nation or region-wide.</p>
          <p>The consequence is to raise the professional standing of our operations and to open up new sales opportunities supporting further strong organic growth in the future. In addition, without distracting in any way from the group-wide organizational principle that management is by country and regional units, this industry specialist focus is facilitating more open, extensive and timely coordination between our internationally-spread retail operations and our core specialist teams, which are for the most part located in London or Singapore. This ready collaboration between brokers on the ground and members of our specialist teams operating worldwide is what enables JLT to offer an optimal service to our clients. It is no accident that some of the industries in which our specialist teams are strongest such as construction, oil and gas, are also particularly important in the Australasian, Asian and Canadian economies and to our retail businesses located there.</p>
          <p>The other half of JLT UK's retail insurance broking activities, being the non-advisory operations, engaged in the sale of insurance products often with a low unit price and sold to individuals or small businesses, has been combined with Thistle. Again, our intention is to progressively establish Thistle operations in all the other parts of the world in which JLT operates as a retailer. Work is already underway towards that objective in Australia and in Canada. The Thistle businesses in these countries will continue to form part of their local management units. However, the processes, operating platforms and underwriting procedures and disciplines that Thistle has established in the U.K. will provide a professional framework for developments internationally.</p>
          <p>The emergence of JLT as an international Employee Benefits consultancy is progressing, and a further example of JLT adding power to its international brand. Firstly, our BenPal, our online Employee Benefits software platform, is well suited for deployment in many countries all around the world and in particular, to meet the requirements of multinational companies looking for information control in relation to their Employee Benefits programs operated by their subsidiaries around the world. Secondly, across many parts of the world we have a strong and extensive range of capabilities in health cover provided through the employee/employer relationship. The opportunity for JLT is to ensure that we position our Employee Benefits operations internationally to derive full benefit from our strength in this field.</p>
          <p>You would have seen earlier this week we announced our investment in a 20% holding in GrECo, the leading Austrian-based broker with strong representation in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and our further development with GrECo, Ecclesia in Germany and SIACI Saint Honor&#xE9; in France, of the JLT International Network. Each of our partners is a leading independent broker in their respective countries of operation. We have all agreed to a branding and exclusive trading relationship, far more extensive than those characteristics of traditional broker associations. We have no doubt that this further development of the JLT International Network will add markedly to JLT's ability to deploy our industry specialist skills to serve clients in regions where our partners are strongly represented and have well-established relationships with leading companies. It will also enhance the value of the international JLT retail proposition to multinational companies and to U.S. independent brokers with multinational clients. With this development in Europe at the heart of the JLT International Network, our positioning as the distinctive alternative to the big three brokers uniquely able to provide multinational corporations wherever headquartered with retail services, specialist expertise and access to international insurance markets is considerably enhanced.</p>
          <p>At the time of our interim management statement in April, we stated that we were seeing an increasingly soft insurance rating environment across most sectors. We highlighted that the U.S. domestic insurance market for general property and casualty risks was the softest we had seen since the event of the 11th of September, 2001. Today, the situation remains very similar with excess capacity still chasing market share in the commercial property and casualty market. There seems little likelihood of the situation changing in the foreseeable future. As I mentioned earlier, the one exception to this is the offshore energy market, which is seeing upward pressure on rates following the Deepwater Horizon disaster where rates on onshore energy &#x2013; offshore energy have increased in the region of 10 to 50%.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to contingent commissions; recently there has been considerable debate amongst the global brokers around the reintroduction of contingent commissions in different guises as an additional source of revenue. At JLT, our primary focus will always remain on our clients. It is through our continued success at winning and retaining business that we see the greatest opportunity to continue JLT's track record of delivering market leading rates of organic growth. We will of course continue to observe, monitor and analyze the ongoing debate.</p>
          <p>Much has been achieved in the first half of 2010. Across our group, our trading has been consistently in line with our expectations, and our strong track record of delivering good organic growth is continuing. We are successfully integrating acquisitions, which have added materially to our Employee Benefits capabilities. Our Business Transformation Programme is on track and delivering the expected benefits, with more to come. We have taken positive steps to further enhance our JLT International Network. And today, JLT's standing and strategic positioning and enabling it to retain and attract leading professionals across all the disciplines of the JLT group. The momentum at JLT is continuing to build. Trading activity in the first half of 2010 was encouraging, and this coupled with the increasing benefits from the broad range of investments being made gives us confidence that we will continue to make financial progress for the full year.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and we'll now take questions.</p>

          <p>Good morning; Nick Johnson from Numis Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Nick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With dividends growing, I can't ask my normal question, but on market share, on organic growth, obviously that's been achieved this half in a backdrop of economic downturn and softening rates. So as you perhaps commented, market share growth is key and also growth in your specialist sectors. Can you possibly just comment a bit about the current environment with regard to market growth and the sort of underlying growth in your specialist sectors? And then second question is on contingents. Can you just comment a bit more about how you see that impacting the competitive landscape? And specifically, are you seeing mandate pitches being fought on lower commissions at the front end on the basis that brokers are getting it back &#x2013; at the back end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly. I'll take the first question, perhaps have a comment or two on the second, and then ask Mark to come in as well. Organic growth of course, just to ensure everybody's aware, is the rate of growth stripping out all currency and acquisitions. One of the reasons why I think we have continued to have the market leading rates of organic growth is that our attention of our existing clients is very high indeed. So as we continue to make progress, we're continuing nonetheless to look after our existing clients, and I think that is a significant factor behind this. But also it's because we're executing on our strategy. Our business all around the world have consistent management teams. They know what their strategies are, they have the business plans; we're executing on it, with client focus, and I think that sets them up in terms of continuance. Mark, why don't you just open up that and I'll finish it after you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just to address your specific question, Nick, about are we seeing tenders fought on low front-end fees, yes, we are. But I think Dominic's comments made just now should extent this subject as well. Our client retention is based on the all-around service that we provide. And that goes to the fees that we negotiate to be paid by our clients. So, we don't necessarily compete always on having the cheapest fee or having some kind of arrangement where we get paid by insurers for services rendered. So, we said consistently in our Annual Report that the contingents &#x2013; we always announce what element of our turnover is based on contingents. 2009 was less than 1%. We continue to watch the debate. We don't accept that we need to look for growth by getting more revenues from the markets in the same way as our competitors would be appearing to do through work transfer fees and the like. We focus on our clients and we focus on being paid for the work we do for our clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>And I think it's also &#x2013; JLT, we apply a litmus test to our stakeholders; our stakeholders, our clients, our staff, our shareholders and the insurance markets in which we trade. And we've tried to set all our decisions around strategy and our actions against those four stakeholders. I think we're very comfortable with the progress we're making on how we treat our stakeholders. I think contingent commissions does not to me seem to be in balance with that relationship with your clients and your underwriting markets. And I question those organizations who seek to derive significant new earnings from contingent commissions as to where their balance lies. We'll look after ourselves.</p>

          <p>Hi, Ben Cohen with Collins Stewart. Two things, please; on the margins at JLT Limited, you said that they would get to their target a year ahead of plan. I was wondering if you could say something as to how you see those margins going forward. What are sort of medium-term targets from now? And secondly, on the acquisition of the associate or the minority shareholding you're buying in Austria, what is the sort of profit dynamics of that business? And could you say how much of their business into London you're already placing and how much uplift you would expect from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, I'll take the first question, ask William to comment on the second and Mark, I think you should also comment on the second question. We don't want to necessarily set a target margin &#x2013; trading profit margin for Limited. When you look back at the journey that, that business has made since 2006 when its trading margins were a low 7%, not only has the management team of that business improved the profitability but it's also had very impressive growth, and if you think that its growth in 2009 was 10% organic growth, unbelievably high number set against our competitors, and this year produced 6%. The strategic direction in which that business is traveling in building out its specialist capabilities is very impressive, and I have encouraged the management team to continue with that. And they are taking a number of important strategic initiatives, recruiting more and more leading professionals into that business, and long may that continue. So, we've not set margins in the long term for that. What we were looking to achieve is higher rates of organic growth that are market leading, and I'm very confident that that business will achieve that. Will, would you like to pick up the question on GrECo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. GrECo is the largest broker in Austria where it has a very well established business generating high profit margins but perhaps reflecting the fact that Austria is not the largest or the fastest growing economy in Europe. It has sought in recent years to expand and &#x2013; expand its activities in areas that offer growth potential in the medium term. So it has now the &#x2013; I think arguably the best representation right across East and Southeastern Europe in the CIS of any broking firm, with representation in I think 15 countries across those regions. And that's obviously a potential area of considerable excitement for us and them working together. And it also has made significant investments in online activities, which have some potential cross-fertilization with our online investments. Mark, do you want to talk about the &#x2013; London...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just to pick up the London Market business; we are not doing a significant amount for them in the London market. Remember, they are coming out of a rival network and that rival network London player has benefited from their London Market business. That business will now accrue to the JLT operations in London. So, we expect some uplift there. However, I think the real benefit for the London Market businesses is for what we can achieve together in the future. William mentioned their Eastern European deployment. They have taken actual management control of these businesses from EOS RISQ, the holding operation, only about two years ago. So, they are very much in building mode although they are already the biggest and most diversely spread broker in the region, single-branded broker in the region. They will carry the JLT brand jointly with their own in the region going forward, and the potential for growth for our specialist businesses in London is significant based on targets that we've already identified and which we are already going after.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Tom Dorner, Oriel Securities. A couple of questions. Firstly, on organic growth; I mean given your comments should we be expecting similar levels of organic growth in 2011, so around 5%, 6%? And then on the agreements with the independent European brokers, I think you've said in the past that you're planning to set these up elsewhere. Also, do you have a sense of where that might be and how soon you might be able to set up similar exclusive arrangements?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, on Thistle, I think you said that it was too early to give guidance, but I wondered if the business is likely to be relatively short-tail and the profits emerge quite quickly? Shouldn't we expect the positive impact on profits to come through relatively soon? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. I haven't yet done the budgets for 2011, but I would imagine that I'd be looking to achieve similar rates of organic growth. Why would we be less ambitious than we have been to date? So yes, we are confident in our ability to continue to win market share. We are confident to continue to provide the services that our clients require in these difficult times. So, I am confident of our ability to retain our clients. So organic growth rate will be what it ultimately is, but we will be ambitious about our ability to continue to win market share.</p>
          <p>We are very excited about our JLT network development in Europe, and I believe that will add substantially to JLT over many years to come as that region of the world develops. And those areas in which we have very strong specialist capabilities are well suited to that region, infrastructure, telecommunications, construction and the like. We do want to continue to build our operations in all parts of the world. LatAm is an extremely exciting place in the world for JLT, and we see further opportunities in Latin America to build out our network. We'll continue to focus and would be optimistic that we've got &#x2013; we maybe have further news in the many months to come.</p>
          <p>Asia continues to be an exciting part of the world. We achieved an operating license in Vietnam last year and we continue to build up that operation. China continues to be an area of exciting potential whilst always difficult. So we'll continue to build out our existing operation, but in terms of a new region of the world I think we're broadly everywhere we want to be today.</p>
          <p>In terms of Thistle, Will, why don't you comment in terms of the structuring of the profit share arrangements we've got and how they're spread over the timeframe they are. We &#x2013; yes, why don't you do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the business at Thistle is &#x2013; it's writing is various, so some of it is very short-tail, some of it has more of a casualty aspect of it and the underwriting result will emerge over a longer period. Generally, we look to realize the underwriting result, to reflect that in our P&amp;L over a four-year period from the date of it being written.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would hope to be able to give you better guidance. I'm not committing to do that, but we would hope to give you some better guidance perhaps at the time of our prelims beginning of March next year. <mark type="inaudible" />? These will be for you, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not all of them, actually; just three. I think the first one is probably &#x2013; perhaps a bit of a request as well. Just going back to contingent commissions, given that the subject is clearly in the spotlight at the moment. I just wondered, given that your topline is growing so much at the moment and the comment that contingent commission is less than 1%, I wonder if you might be able to perhaps identify a bit more &#x2013; with more clarity what that figure might be and maybe whether or not you could release it just so that we could see how it grows. A bit more transparency on that, given the topline growth.</p>
          <p>Second one is in respect of Aon. I think Aon recently announced the fact that they're no longer going to use third parties to wholesale business into London. I'm just wondering if there's going to be any impact on your wholesale operations.</p>
          <p>And the last one is I think it's been written up that there's been a large settlement in terms of a poaching of staff case.  And I just wondered if you could clarify either how much that was, if it's included in H1, and also given the importance, the fact you've been recruiting new staff, as you say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (50;10), thank you for all three questions. I would not anticipate contingent commissions to materially move from a 1% or less number at JLT. We are not going to pursue a market-type agreement of the likes of Aon and Marsh. I'm confused what relative spent is. Perhaps you might be able to help me on that. One moment they say they're not for it  and the next minute they seem to be, so that's again not for us.</p>
          <p>I don't believe that we will take a position to achieve an overall market position on contingents. So, I think we will continue to disclose what it is, but I would imagine it will remain tracking at 1% or below our revenues. Aon's move to reduce their use of independent brokers is a very interesting move. I thought we act for our clients. We don't dictate to clients, so we'll see what that achieves for them in due course. For us, we regard it as a non-event.</p>
          <p>Aon's settlement is a matter of confidentiality. What I can disclose to you is that the full cost of that has been exposed in the first half results, which we have just presented to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Joanna Parsons from RBS; couple of questions. On Thistle, you've mentioned about reviewing the agreements with underwriters; could you give us a little bit more color on what's been going on there and who the underwriters are now? I think originally it was just Brit, but have you expanded that?</p>
          <p>The key hires &#x2013; forgive me if I didn't get it all noted down. Could you give us a bit more color again on where you've been hiring and how many people have come through on the various departments? And historically, one would argue with brokers that it was an 18-month lead-in time to profitability. Would that still be an appropriate assumption to make in terms of individuals coming through the door? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joanna. Thistle is an enlarged business model, as I sought to explain this morning. Brit is the principal capital provider for us. We are thinking about other capital providers. And who knows, at some point in the future we may even look to perhaps looking at the Lloyd's market and the Lloyd's syndicate. But we are not intending to take balance sheet risk in relation to this. So, I think you can feel comfortable and relaxed about that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the key hire question, we haven't actually specified a number because the total head count of JLT continues to grow quite significantly. We have approaching 6,500 employees today. We have a growing operation in Mumbai which is a knowledge-based business, which is JLT operated, they're JLT employees. There are now some 430 staff at the end of July. We don't necessarily want to get into the game of disclosing how many key hires this month and then last month and last quarter and so on. What I can say is there is significant recruitment all around the group, in every part of the group. And that is something that we're very actively pursuing because the opportunity today for JLT is to attract talent, the likes of which we've never been able to attract before.</p>
          <p>Perhaps we have bred an awful lot of talent in this organization and we still do, we still maintain that is absolutely at the core of what we want to do, but if we can supplement our capabilities by recruiting targeted individuals that we believe can fit into the DNA and the culture of JLT, that's vitally important, then we will do so.</p>
          <p>As to 18 months, we are not patient enough to wait 18 months. So, I think we'd rather like the revenues to arrive before the people and on occasions we're successful in achieving that. But I don't think we model it on 18 months. That's &#x2013; we're a little bit more ambitious than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What I'm trying to get I suppose is &#x2013; well, one of the things is, in terms of the expenses, if you've been taking on a lot of people, so obviously the cost of salaries, all of that coming through, and how much that may be changing the structure of the expense ratio in the first half versus the full year; and then obviously, we're looking to say, well, if you've brought these &#x2013; all these fabulous people onboard and there are no more court cases...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't guarantee you that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you know...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're going to try to manage this business by looking at its underwriting cost ratio. Obviously, we want margin expansion, but at the same time we want the growth. And so, we will always &#x2013; and I encourage our businesses all around the group to continue to invest in systems, in people, in training, in all the various guises that we need to do to make this business a better and a stronger business.</p>
          <p>So, I'm not going to be in &#x2013; I'm not going to set internal barriers around operating margins to do that. And I think my predecessor, in Ken Carter, I remember listening to him saying the very same words because it's vitally important for us to continue to provide the skills that are needed by our clients as they continue in their own development. And we need to match that requirement, and therefore we are in an expansive growth stage of our history and that's something that I think we are very capable executing on, indeed are executing on, and I believe we will be able to execute in the short and medium term. And indeed why not the long term? I think you're going to get as much as you're going to get on that one.</p>

          <p>Thanks. William Hawkins from KBW. Just to come back to the Continental European transactions you've announced recently and the agreements, can you just flag for us whether we should be expecting any restructuring or integration costs associated to those in the second half of this year?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thank you. And then secondly, for Thistle, could you give us an indication of what were the premiums Thistle wrote in the first half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you the premium spread in the first &#x2013; is Adrian Girling here? I don't think he is. We're anticipating to write in the year gross written premium of around about 70 million, so if it was split evenly, it would have been around 35 million gross written premium in the first half. But I can't say that is the figure.</p>
          <p>Are there &#x2013; one more question; no, as many questions as you'd like to ask, but the gentleman in the front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Will Hardcastle, Macquarie. I was just looking at the trading margins in retail, mostly looking very strong. I saw a decline in Asia compared with a strong increase in LatAm. Can we just get a bit more color on both of those segments as to why the trading margins have moved around so much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Asia is a very diverse part of the world. We operate in 11 countries and the two territories of Hong Kong and Macau. We are in a very positive growth stage in that business, and its underlying organic growth rate was 11%. And if you &#x2013; you don't have to go very far back to see that places like Singapore had very significant negative GDP output in 2009 whilst impressive GDP in the first half of 2010; there is some lag.</p>
          <p>We have also been making significant investment in people. That was part of the court case that one of the questions a moment or two was upon. So, there'd been a significant cost increase in the first half. and I think I was quite clear in my presentation about saying that we anticipated the benefits to start coming through in the second half of 2010 and more fully in 2011. And so, I think that is really it. I think there's also been a timing issue in Asia where some revenues shifted from first to second half. That business is trending very well and very strongly. But there's a significant difference between Latin America and Asia because of the diversity of Asia and our need to grow a stronger and more dynamic business in territories such as Japan and China, building out Vietnam. These operations are very much in a formative stage for JLT, where in Peru and Colombia they're very more mature businesses. Now, Brazil is also in a formative stage of growth, and we continue to make investment in Brazil. Both are very exciting regions in the world for JLT to be operating in right now.</p>
