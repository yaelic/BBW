          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Linde Group Half Year Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instruction].</p>
          <p>I would now like to handover to the Chairperson and CFO, Mr. Georg Denoke. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Maria. Hello, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for dialing into our first half 2008 results call. I have today with me around the table as usual my both colleagues, Aldo Belloni, as well as Harry Roegner and Thomas Eisenlohr, from Communications and Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Let me start with some highlights of our first half year figures on page three. Group sales for the first six months increased, excluding currency effects by 12.9% to &#x20AC;6.256 billion. On the same basis group operating profit in the first half year improved by 15.4% to &#x20AC;1.258 billion.</p>
          <p>Our business performance has thus been very strong in spite of the economic challenges, you are all aware of. On a quarterly basis, this currency adjusted increases of 18.1% in sales and 19.9% in operating profit, our year-on-year growth even accelerated in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Supported by the lower interest charges resulting from our de-leveraging process adjusted EPS for the first six months of the year was up by 24.8% from 2.18 to &#x20AC;2.72. Our operating cash flow reached &#x20AC;816 million current of June, driven by stable growth in the Gases business and the ongoing strong order intake in Engineering, we have hence generated &#x20AC;392 million of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we confirm all of our short and mid-term guidance. I will go more into details of our outlook later in my presentation.</p>
          <p>On slide four, you find as usual the split of our sales' growth by division. In the chart on the left, you see the reported numbers, with Gases sales reaching &#x20AC;4.709 billion in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>The key figure is probably the underlying growth in our Gases business. Excluding currency effects, the natural gas price impact and consolidation changes, the comparable growth of the Gases division was a strong 8.5%. And this number would actually rise to 12.8% if you would include bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>As we will see later &#x2013; sales growth in the Gases division was driven by all regions. Price and volume effects were positive in all our operating segments.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in the Engineering division strongly accelerated in the quarter two. For the six months period sales are 24.4% higher than last year. As you know, this is the more lumpy business, so as usual, the reminder not to overemphasize any quarterly patterns. Overall, the good demand we continue to see supports our expectations for sales growth in our Engineering division of 8 to 10% in 2008 and the mid-term.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the divisional split of our operating profit on page five. With the reported 8.6% increase to &#x20AC;1.258 billion, Group profit again outpaced sales growth. Our operating margin hence gained 40 basis points year-on-year despite the energy price increase and the higher share of the Engineering division within this sales mix.</p>
          <p>The Gases division contributed with another strong performance. Operating profit indeed advanced 12.7% on a currency-adjusted basis to &#x20AC;1.194 billion. The operating margin in the Gases business improved by 70 basis points to 25.4%. I think this is the best proof that we are coping well with the increases we see in our cost base.</p>
          <p>I would also like to remind you that part of the underlying margin improvement is not visible in the reported figures, because of the mathematical dilution from the natural gas price increases. Pass-through clauses on this cost item indeed boosted sales by close to &#x20AC;100 million in the first six months of the year. If you do the calculation, you will see that without the dilution of this automatic pass-through, margins would have been 15 basis points higher.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering division, operating profit increased by 28.6% to &#x20AC;126 million. We managed to maintain a high-level of project execution in a tight market environment. At 8.9%, margin was very strong.</p>
          <p>Going into the details of our Gases results, you'll see our usual sales bridge on page six. As I mentioned earlier, the key figure of comparable growth stands at a strong 8.5% for the six months period. This means that the underlying growth even accelerated in the second quarter compared with the 7.5% increase in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The currency effect was again significant, at minus 6.7%. As you know key exposures for us are towards the U.S. Dollar, the British Pound and the South African Rand, and their combined effect, even slightly worsened during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The consolidation effect was broadly neutral at minus 0.6% after six months. This reflects that our US disposals closed during the first half of 2007 are roughly netted by the contribution of the bolt-on acquisitions we did, mainly in the emerging markets. Again, you will see later that on a regional basis, consolidation effects have a more significant effect on reported numbers.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, the increase of the natural gas price contributed close to &#x20AC;100 million, so 2.2% to the Gases top line growth. Once again, this is a pure pass-through item. We pass on this cost increase to our long-term customers, but do obviously not generate additional operating profit from this contract feature.</p>
          <p>Getting into the sales overview of the operating segments, we give you some more flavor on the development of the Gases business in our four core segments starting with Western Europe on page 7. Growth in this more mature region was quite good with sales increasing 6.4% on a comparable basis to &#x20AC;2.083 billion. All major countries posted a good performance. We have seen the high level of activity in Germany and U.K., especially for specialty gases as well as in the cylinder and healthcare product areas.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the region Western Europe was up 6.3% to &#x20AC;575 million. The operating margin was with 27.6% even slightly up from the already high level of the previous year. This reflects the ongoing collection of merger synergies and operational efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Looking at our operating segment, Americas on page 8. You can clearly see the impact of the weakening dollar and the consolidation effect from the disposals done in the first half of 2007.</p>
          <p>On an underlying basis, business in this operating segment continues to do well. Sales of &#x20AC;1.082 billion are up 9.2% on a comparable basis. The pricing trend has been very positive especially, throughout South America and the U.S. bulk business. The ramp up of several hydrogen schemes in North America is moreover supporting growth on the volume side.</p>
          <p>With hydrogen being an important market segment, margins remain below group average in this region. The natural gas price pass-through is obviously diluting our underlying improvements here, but margins are still up 20 basis points year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Sales in the operating segment, Asia and Eastern Europe, has increased by 32.7% to &#x20AC;945 million. Reported figures are boosted by the new consolidations in Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and a comparable 10.4% increase in the underlying business.</p>
          <p>Demand has remained strong across all markets. In South and East Asia we have seen particularly high activity in India, South Korea and Singapore. Growth in Greater China is also unabated. And in Eastern Europe also the bigger and most developed markets like Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic are still seeing strong pricing and volume trends. The operating profit improved by 36% to &#x20AC;269 million. The operating margin increased significantly by 70 basis points to 28.5%. I think this shows quite well that our expansion into the emerging markets regions is a profitable growth strategy.</p>
          <p>We have moreover in the last quarter achieved two important strategic milestones in order to add another growth region to our global Gases footprint. The production capacities decided within the Elixier joint venture with ADNOC, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and the signing of the acquisition of the SIGAS business in Saudi Arabia, will give us indeed exposure to the promising industrial development in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to page 10 and to our operating segment South Pacific and Africa, where we posted the strongest comparable growth with an increase of 14.5%. Sales of &#x20AC;632 million are however only up 4.3% on a reported basis, given the strong decline in the South African rand.</p>
          <p>The cylinder business with significant price and volume increases for LPG, favorable hardware sales and positive rental business in Australia was the main driver for the increase in the countries of this operating segment.</p>
          <p>Due to the currency effect the operating profit of &#x20AC;144 million was inline with the previous year level. Adjusted for currency effects, the operating profit grew by close to 10%.</p>
          <p>The operating margin was impacted by the delayed startup of our welding wire production in South Africa. We also expect already announced price increases to come through in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, you find the usual split between the four product areas of our Gases division, as in the first quarter on a consolidated basis. Please note that the growth rates mentioned are on a comparable basis means adjusted for currency natural gas price and consolidation effects.</p>
          <p>Since the start of the year, we have seen the strongest growth in the cylinder business, our largest product area. Growth after six months reached a very strong 11.1%. Besides solid activity levels in the core markets, this growth was in particular supported by the strong demand from the operating segment South Pacific and Africa as well as gases usage for new applications.</p>
          <p>The development of new gases applications is, in particular, driving the demand for specialty gases. Given the markets for these products are quite tight, growth is more over linked to a positive pricing trend. Sales of liquid gases, the byproduct area, increased by 6.4%. This was driven by good pricing and further volume growth.</p>
          <p>Healthcare remains a very stable growth contributor with a comparable sales increase of 8.2% in the first six months of this year. Structural trends are driving a stable demand increase in this market. Year-to-date the strongest growth rates were reached in the operating segment Asia and Eastern Europe. However, the biggest absolute contribution still came from our established healthcare businesses in the operating segment Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Sales in the tonnage business, our second largest product area grew by 6.5% to &#x20AC;1.181 billion. Thereby activity levels on our customer side have remained high across all regions. Growth is furthermore supported by the continuous ramp-up of newly installed schemes. However, tonnage growth in the quarter two was held back by a planned turnaround of a major facility in Italy. With this review now finished and further startups to come growth in this business segment should see an acceleration of growth in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Speaking of our pipeline of major project startup, you can find the update of the split by region and compositioning date on page 12. Project activity remains on a very high level with emerging markets and new applications in the energy sector being the two most important growth drivers. You know that we can build on our local presence as well as the business synergy with our engineering activity to drive successful project development here.</p>
          <p>Let me single out our project with ArcelorMittal in Romania. We are turning an existing captive gases supplier run by the customer into a new tonnage scheme. So we will already see a sales contribution from this project in the second half of 2008. This agreement seals the long-term future of our partnership with an important customer and confirms our leading market position in Eastern Europe. Since March, when we first showed this map, we have signed seven new projects.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that all projects mentioned here have an investment size of at least &#x20AC;10 million. These new schemes will come on stream by 2010. Taking the total number of startups for the period 2008 to 2010 to 55 projects. To round up the overview of the Gases business, let me have a look at our joint ventures on page 13. You know that we do not recognize the sales of these joint ventures in our group P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>So these are figures for your backup information. Proportionate sales in our joint ventures increased 4.9% to &#x20AC;302 million. Be aware that the first half year figure of the previous year contained one time sales of tonnage schemes treated as Embedded Finance Lease under IFRIC 4 correcting for this accounting item, the strong underlying sales growth has been 32.5%.</p>
          <p>Our share of net income from joint venture was stable at &#x20AC;25 million in the first six months of the year. As you know net income is always a more volatile figure especially on a quarterly basis and we had some higher tax payments here in quarter two.</p>
          <p>Moving over to the Engineering business on page 14, sales of &#x20AC;1.411 billion and operating profit of 126 million are both up more than 20%. Once again, this is not a business to be looked at on a quarterly basis. This quarter's margin was 9.1%. Amongst others it was positively impacted by the markup disposal. Therefore, please do not change the margin assumptions for our business. We stick to our target margin of 8%, which reflects a leading performance in this kind of industry.</p>
          <p>As we indicated in our last call, we recognize the big air separation unit order for the enhanced gas recovery scheme in Abu Dhabi, in the order intake in the second quarter. This explains an overweight of the air separation unit segment and the regions Middle East in the segment and regional split of the order intake.</p>
          <p>Total order intake for the first six months was hence at &#x20AC;1.557 billion, again broadly inline with the high levels seen in the first half of 2007. Supported by a range of new energy applications and technologies, demand remains strong. As we indicated earlier, we expect order intake for 2008 to be close to &#x20AC;3 billion mark we have achieved in the last three years.</p>
          <p>Order backlog remains about 4 billion standing at &#x20AC;4.347 billion at the end of June 2008.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, we have as usual outlined the key elements of our cash flow statement. Cash flow from operating activities increased by 9.5%, from &#x20AC;745 million to &#x20AC;860 million. Cash generation improved quarter-on-quarter as we had indicated in our quarter one conference call. This is based on the strong operational performance. As you can see, net investment activities increased by 15% year-on-year to &#x20AC;539 million. This is another signal of the good project situation in the Gases business and our commitment to further invest in our growth pipeline.</p>
          <p>Looking forward today, we want to reconfirm our confidence in our short and mid-term guidance. You'll find this on page 16. We are aware of the economic environment and monitor this and our business development very closely. As the figures in the first half year show, our two divisions are faring very well also in the current environment.</p>
          <p>The Gases division is serving a very stable and strongly diversified customer base. The extension of our geographic reach has given us a balanced global footprint, with better access to new growth regions. And in combination with the engineering division, we have a very good setup to serve the structural needs for cleaner and sustainable energy solutions.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we therefore continue to expect an increase in sales and an over-proportionate increase in operating profit. For 2010, we reiterate our mid-term target of an above &#x20AC;3 billion operating profit and feel very comfortable to see consensus figures reflecting our ambition.</p>
          <p>We are also committed to our return on capital employed increase, towards at least 13% by 2010. This will be supported by our synergy program for which we set the target, which is unsafe &#x2013; unchanged at &#x20AC;250 million fully effective in 2009.</p>
          <p>For the Gases business, we want to increase sales above market growth and achieve an over-proportionate increase of operating profit. The mid-term annual average CapEx sales ratio in the Gases division is expected to be 13%. Let me reiterate that we are ready to invest above this 13% mark if attractive opportunities that fulfill our investment criteria would allow us to do so.</p>
          <p>I already touched upon the good market environment in the Engineering division. Based on the expected scheduled processing of our order backlog, we expect this business to post annual growth of 8 to 10% going forward, which is also the guidance for the whole year of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our target margin of 8% is an industry leading number for our &#x2013; for this kind of project based engineering business. Based on our strong first half-year numbers, and the signals we get from inside our business we are thus confident on our outlook for 2008 and beyond. Our setup of the global leading Gases business coupled to a very strong engineering expertise is very stable and well positioned for the business opportunities developing around the world.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation for today. I handover now to the operator, and we are very happy to take your questions now. Maria, please.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from Peter Testa. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name and city location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Peter Testa from One Investments in Lugano. Can you please talk about the prospects following the strong order in the Mid-East in terms of other potential prospects that you see out there? Any bidding or tender procedures? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In that area, as you are aware of, we have set up many new activities. I think the most important one was the just mentioned Elixier joint venture with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. We have here now two projects in this joint ventures. One air separation project for the petrochemical industry announced end of last year and now the enhanced gas recovery scheme for in gas condensate fields of ADNOC, and I think that is the basis for further development.</p>
          <p>You also have to know that we have access to 100% of the liquid product of these first plant, which I mentioned and with this we will develop the merchant market development of that region. For this reason, we have signed an acquisition to acquire 51% of the SIGAS business in Saudi Arabia, and therefore we are looking confident into that region.</p>
          <p>I think it would be too early now to talk about further current prospects, but we can tell you, and that is not only true for the Middle East, that our onsite and tonnage pipeline is one of the busiest prospect lists we have ever seen. And also from an engineering perspective, this business area in the Middle East is developing in an attractive view. On the other hand, I think more important is to understand that we have shifted that now into potential and future gases growth. I think that's very important to understand. Up to now, it was only an engineering area more or less and now it's also in gas region in our footprint.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Laurent Favre. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name and city location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's UBS in London, Georg. I got actually four questions if I can. First question on margin in gas, if we look at the net gas pass through impact on margin, I think it was 30 basis points in Q, 50 basis points in H1. I think it added maybe 70 basis points is not a bad guess for the second quarter. Does it mean that actually your margin in gas in the second quarter was flat sequentially? You can comment on that at last. I was just also wondering if the corporate cost that was more or less flat sequentially. The margin in Gas was more or less underlying flat sequentially. Could you please quantify the impact from incremental cost savings in the quarter? That's my second question. Third question in the cylinders business, again very strong growth 8% in Q1, 11% in H1, and maybe 14% in Q2. Could you maybe give us an outlook especially for Germany for both volumes and prices? And is there &#x2013; and if you don't have any concern that there might be a slowdown in the cylinders business? And then maybe a fourth question, I'll try my luck it's for the afternoon. In the Q1 conference call, you talked about, you walked us through the different potentials for incremental synergies, and you didn't at the time, well, you walked us through all the different areas. I was just wondering if you could quantify the synergies in terms of both target and in terms of care. Just trying my luck, here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, four questions at one point of time. I think regarding the margin development, its definitely visible, the natural gas price impact which was in the second quarter two times as big as in the first quarter. Therefore, you have this number of 100 million, around 100 million in the first half year. I think, that is dilution &#x2013; it is a dilution, of course, in the reported margin and, let's say, is stealing away a little bit the visibility of the improvement of our margin development. When we look into the cost saving program and the synergy program, we definitely can see the bottom up number being exactly on the line or slightly above the line of what we have planned when we were talking about the 250 million expected bottom line synergies achieving in 2009. And I think, we are definitely supporting that and we see these accelerating in the second half of this year. So, overall, I think, it is with the natural gas price impact a little bit higher than our reported figures. So, I try to answer a little bit the second question which was your incremental cost saving how is this? And we definitely were starting into the year within &#x2013; around a rough cost saving level of 125 million as we have reported in our year-end. And we are now moving up to a year-end figure of a ramp up of 250 million. And then you draw a line between these two numbers, we are on that line. So, the average cost saving of 2008 will be below, of course, of the year-end ramp up level of 250 million that we then fully achieved the expected cost saving in 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding the cylinder business in Germany, I hand over to Aldo Belloni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are very satisfied about this outstanding performance of our cylinder business in general. You asked specifically about Germany, and Germany is definitely no exception to this trend. It is coming, I would say, 50/50 from pricing and volume. Our customers have still full order books customers in the manufacturing industry especially, but also customers for spec gases in industries where there is calibration gases, petrochemicals, mining et cetera. So I &#x2013; you can take Germany as, they've been in conformity to the numbers which we have given on the overall performance of cylinders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry to interrupt, but that 14% run rate for Q2, are you comfortable with sort of run rate for the rest of the year, or you think that actually it is an exceptional performance, especially in an environment that is slowing down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the moment, we don't see any slowdown. It's a sustainable performance.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Rhian Tucker. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company and city location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Rhian Tucker from Credit Suisse in London. I'm going to ask three questions. On Engineering, first of all, you have had a large order in the air separation business. Can you give us a rough split of your order book as it stands at the moment? And how you see your order book developing through the year? Have you had a slowdown in orders for other businesses such as LNG? And can you talk a little bit about the impact of your LNG business of your projects in Norway the Statoil project. On Gases, can you just &#x2013; and just to get the figures right, we had 9.5% underlying growth in Gases in Q2. You're saying that, that was actually a little bit slow because of a shutdown in your large industries, in your tonnage business? Are we expecting then a higher rate of underlying growth in the second half, if the Cylinder business stays as high as it is, if healthcare business stays as high as it is. Actually, I'll ask four questions. The first question is on acquisitions and disposals, can you just take us through the timing a little bit of the &#x2013; of what's happening in the second half with year-on-year comparisons of the perimeter effect? Obviously, that you get, the US business isn't so strongly impacted, but what do you think the acquisition effect will be in the second half? And then finally in Q2, your interest actually went up a little bit. I know it went down on a half year basis, but it went up a little bit in Q2. Is there anything significant behind that? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you for your question, Rhian. I think I start with the Gases and these are P&amp;L questions and then I hand over regarding the Engineering part to Aldo. First of all, on the quarter growth 9.5%. As I said in my presentation, we definitely expect a positive impact of the development of the growth rate in onsite in the second half of the year. One, effect, comes out of also the new signed contact with ArcelorMittal, example in Romania, which is an &#x2013; it was a captive customer plant, which we turned now into an onsite scheme. And there we will have an additional air separation unit after a period of &#x2013; up to two years, so we are getting here additional sales in the second half of the year. So your assumption is right. Regarding acquisitions and disposals the impact, now in the second half year is from what we disposed, regarding or during the, let's say, post closing DUC activities the impact will be zero. The third quarter of 2008 will be the first quarter where we have no disposal impact out of that period of time. And the last point on interest payments, I mean as we always were mentioning, we have a portion of fixed interest rates and floating interest rates. And this slight increase is driven by the portion of the floating interest level. So now I hand over to Aldo.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think you are very correct in your appreciation that the order intake for air separation plant in the first half of the year dwarfing all other product lines in virtue of this big, big order intake. Not only the one in Abu Dhabi, but also in other geographies like the project, which Georg just mentioned in Romania, which is a very significant air separation project. We have in this first half of the year where there is no new award worldwide for instance ethylene steam cracker plants or LNG baseload plants. As a matter of fact, the LNG baseload business in 2006 &#x2013; 2007-2008 has been so far very slow I would say. But what we are recording is the release of orders for mid-size LNG plants. LNG plants in the order of let's say size of 0.5 million tons per year, that means some one-tenth or 20% of the baseload project and we are very, very well in the market in this segment, which has also some relevance for our so-called merchant LNG business, which we are targeting in Gas division of Linde. We have significant order intakes in the hydrogen business for instance in the India. We have good order intake in our subsidiary in North America for refining third-party customers. But as you correctly pointed out, the first half of 2008 was definitely air separation market and still the pipeline of the project is very large. However, we are developing very attractive ethylene steam cracker projects again in the Middle East, but also in India and in Latin America.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Merrill Lynch, London. Three questions, please. Firstly, on the Chinese region I've seen recently comments from China on new initiatives on energy prices. They were put through in June in Praxa, followed very quickly with a 10% price increase, I'm just wondering what your thoughts on a lag there between getting prices up and seeing increased costs in your business in China, also if there are any potential Q3 issues regarding some plant outages around the Olympics. Looking more longer term, the Engineering guidance of 8 to 10% I mean, considering you've just done 24% for the first half and considering what you are saying about leads. I'm really struggling with that 8 to 10, so I am just wondering how you get to that. And then my third question is back to an earlier point on cylinder. The acceleration in Q2 is clearly counterintuitive. I'm just wondering how much prices played a part in that 14% number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrew for your questions. Let's start with the Engineering forecast 8 to 10%, if I pointed out you should not look quarterly into that business or even on a half year's basis. So overall what we said at the beginning of the year is still true, the 8 to 10% growth is what we see. I know that you are looking into the second half of 2007 in Engineering service, which was a very strong year or half of the year in 2007. Nevertheless we stick to the 8 to 10% also for 2008. I think that is driven by the percentage of completion method in this business segment, and I think and 10% growth after &#x2013; and 40% growth in last year is definitely what we can see here.</p>
          <p>And as I always said 2007 was the steepest ramp up you will ever see in that business in the &#x2013; let's say, ratios we have placed to you which an order backlog of about 4 billion and in 2007 with a starting point of below 2 billion. So we want to stick to our mid-term guidance of 8 to 10%. Regarding the cylinder business, I think it is, of course, driven a little bit by the impact also of the LPG business in the regions of the southern hemisphere.</p>
          <p>I think that is something you should always take into consideration when you see the winter times in that region and winter is in these days a little bit stronger in Australia and in South Africa than in the year before, so a little bit is cyclicality here, driven by the winter times. When you want to split into volumes and prices definitely we were able to catch up in prices and when I have to do here an assumption, I would say, it's probably half-half. For the energy price development and Chinese business development, I hand over to Aldo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, as you well know the majority of our business in Greater China is Tonnage business. So you have &#x2013; while this on-site contract with the energy pass through provision, which Georg has mentioned many times in his presentation. We do have power business in China and definitely for products like argon, for instance, we have enacted to the same extent as our competitors price increases with a good or satisfactory yield in terms of price increase achievement. With regard to plant outages, well, our geography in China as you know is primarily in the region of around Shanghai, Fujian Province, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, so it's far away from the Olympic Games, and we are not experiencing any forced outage of our plants.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Can I just come back on one small item on Engineering, Georg? You know, clearly haven't disclosed the one-off gain from the sale of the valves business. If I guess somewhere in the range of 15 to 20 million, would that be sensible?</p>

          <p>Andrew, I think you know that in a way we have answered that as &#x2013; we want to answer this, and as you know, from other minor deals, we do not disclose these capital gains, but I think you are a little bit high on that expectation.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Neil Taylor. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name and city location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good Afternoon, JPMorgan in London. A few question, mostly pretty quick, actually. Just to confirm, that you said that Germany was a good representation of the cylinder business overall. Is that fair then to assume that overall of the 14% Q2, it's roughly half price, half volume, in which case I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about what is driving the volumes, roughly more than double the rates of global GDP in that business?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you talk a little bit about &#x2013; I know you don't disclose margins and I understand that on a business-by-business unit, but sequentially how the margin in cylinders has developed over the past 12 months or so and whether the prices are sufficient to hold onto the margin? Then, in tonnage, whether you'd be willing to give us any idea of what the impact of the outage on the first half growth rate was, and just a couple more.</p>
          <p>The JV sales, am I right in thinking that the way you've disclosed it, basically they're up 30%-odd year-on-year, if we look at them on a proportion of consolidation basis? Is that the right way to interpret your slide number 13?</p>
          <p>And, finally, just any guidance you can give on the net financials line for the full-year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Neil for these questions. I think when we split the cylinder business across the regions, then I would give you the following explanation, as I said earlier. I think in the southern hemisphere there's a little bit more volume growth than price growth, because of the LPG business and the pickup of the LPG business on the cost side here. And, as I said in my presentation, we expect that price increases, for example, in South Africa, will come through in the second half of the year, because it was at the late end of that quarter and half year.</p>
          <p>The other important part, which is influencing positively the cylinder business, is definitely also the specialty gases development, and rare gases development, where we have significant price increases, including helium, argon, krypton, xenon, which are very favorable to us, and that is driving also the cylinder business on the price side across all regions. Of course, you can assume that the more mature countries do have more and deeper application development from an application viewpoint in the cylinder business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry, just to interrupt, that price increase in the specialty gases and rare gases, it's not cost driven, it's over and above that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's definitely price driven -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the market development of our product areas, as you know, the product areas are embedded within the region and the nature of the gases business is a local business, so we do not disclose the margin development, because we believe that this will drive additional explanations which are in a way very different from the local markets. I mean, when you have set up an air separation plant in and to develop site business and then you further develop the cylinder business, then you have allocation of cost into these businesses and then you do this different, we have different margins. That's the reason why we are not disclosing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. Okay. I understand that. Perhaps then, looking at it slightly different, what I'm trying to get to is the overall Gases operating margin improvement more than just a mix effect? Is there an underlying improvement there, or is it just been a &#x2013; the fact that the higher-margin cylinder business is growing more quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is, of course, an effect. One is driven by our synergy program. You see in the margin of the Gases business, not in the same way in all the operating segments, you see here a positive impact. And on the other hand, of course, as I explained earlier, there is definitely a price impact, for example, in the specialty gases area, which is incomparable to previous years, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

You are right, the growth in joint ventures is on a comparable basis excluding, or adjusting for the embedded finance fees. It's above 30%.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I think, most of my questions have been answered, but can you just give us the magnitude of the, if you like, the pipeline that &#x2013; you said 55 projects are the big stuff, but the total, if you like, tonnage pipeline that you've got. Just give us a bit of visibility and how that will lead through to CapEx over the next couple of years? And can I just confirm that the above 3 billion of EBITDA, or operating profit, as you like to call it, for 2010, excludes any further acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So two questions, Andrew, thank you for that. Let's start with the last one. Yes, this is &#x2013; we reconfirm the above 3 billion under the scenario you explained. It's the same sharp in a way. Of course, as you know, we are always very accurate in pointing out the impact and any disposal impact or acquisition impact, and we will stick to do so also in the future.</p>
          <p>Regarding the development of the tonnage pipeline, I think these are projects, as I mentioned, above 10 million CapEx amount. When we do a CapEx split, then of course it is with more than 20 projects in 2008. You will see &#x2013; I think we will see a ramp up of the CapEx in the second half of this year, 2007, and then a high level of 2008.</p>
          <p>And at that point of time we see a, let's say, decline then in 2009 and 2010 when we look into the CapEx figure, but we stick really to our 13% average CapEx sales ratio. The other issue is when you want to talk about the P&amp;L impact of the additional sales, I think you have to understand that some of these projects are within joint ventures and you have no top-line visibility. Therefore, we do not disclose this at that point of time.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Peter Clark, Soc Gen, in London. I'll restrain myself to two. First of all, I'm more interested actually in the U.K. looking forward than Germany, particularly, on the cylinder side. I mean, they're even closing pubs here, so that must have some impact, perhaps on the hospitality business. I'm just wondering how you see the U.K. developing, because it was one of the areas you said that did particularly well in the second quarter. Presumably the specialty gas is helping there on the hospital side.</p>
          <p>And then the second question, intrigued on your comments, suggesting that CapEx might come down next year. I would have thought next year we might see a peak on the Gases side? And I am just wondering what you think, where you stand today, you think that Gas's CapEx to sales could peak, given your average is 13%. And I ask that bearing in mind that Praxa and their products obviously have been pushing up by CapEx projections, they are sort of suggesting 15% CapEx to sales in gases, and of course Air Liquide is spending a lot more money than that. So those were the two questions. Thanks you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, I'll start with your second question to be more accurate, yeah, I think there is a misunderstanding. I said, we will see a ramp up in the second half of 2008, and then in high level in 2009. And then when we look into the list at this point of point of time, there will be a slightly change. Of course, the other half is very important. When we talk about the joint venture impact, for example, of the AS operation unit with ADNOC as our partner, that is not visible in our CapEx figure. Therefore, I think we have really to compare here the right things. So when you would include all the additional joint venture CapEx, probably we also see a really strong, strong development overall.</p>

You asked specifically about the hospitality, what we in the U.K. call our Sureserve business line, which is actually gaining market share. They're very strong and we don't see a sign of decline there. The hospital business is also quite good in the U.K.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. This is Natixis Securities in Paris. I have quite a few questions on the growth side. Last year, you used to give us some splits between the regions like South America versus Northern America, and also it's different between Eastern Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>I would like to have just an idea of the trends between these different regions and have an idea of the level of sales you reached in Q2, or in H1, as you like. In Americas, as well world, I would be very happy to have the split between the FX negative impact and the disposal negative impacts, which explain the difference between your underlying growth and reporting growth. And on a more <mark type="inaudible" />, on a more prospective point of view, in your report, you say that there is no sign that a decline in global economic growth might have a negative impact on your perspectives, given that and then this is rewarding. You may cushion this over a certain period of time.</p>
          <p>I get that at the time of the BOC acquisition, you think that was on black or worst scenarios and worst case scenarios of economic slowdown, including in emerging countries. Would you be prepared to share with us some color on what could be this hypothesis and to which extent you indeed expect your group to be very resilient in the case of very &#x2013; of large global slowdown, and referring here to your wording of a certain period of time, certain period? Thank you.</p>
          <p>Maybe, if I may, a last one. I would be very interested to know the capacity of the plant you switched to gas contracting in Romania. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think when we say &#x2013; or when we come to your first question, you first should have in mind when you say something positive about our disclosure of additional information, we are since the beginning of the year reporting profitability numbers in the operating segment, so you have the first time operating profit for each of the operating segments.</p>
          <p>I think I explained South and North America on a qualitative basis, and I think I want to stick to this, because this would extend here the time. On the FX impact, I think you should look from a global perspective, first of all, to improve that development, and we have here in our presentation pack the bridge of currency development that was in the gases business, and that is the main part of currency development, minus 6.7%, so that was -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>7.6% in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the first half of the year, overall, so if you double that effect, you see it from a total perspective from the year. If we would assume let's say the currency rates will remain the same, we know that currency rates deteriorated when we the first time gave an indication. This was at our year-end communication of 2007. Here, currency further deteriorated, so the average of the dollar, for example, at the end of the first &#x2013; or in the first quarter was 1.50 in a way, and now it's 1.53. The same with UK pound, it was in the first quarter average 0.76, and now it's 0.78. So if we assume that this is the level which we will see in the future, I would double that number and then you would be &#x2013; on the sales level, you would be around &#x2013; I give you here a range -- around 550 to 600 million currency impact across all geographies, mainly driven by U.S. dollar, pounds and South African rand. I think these are main currencies. No disclosure on currency impact, only on U.S. dollar. You could do this on your own if you want, based on the 2007 numbers.</p>
          <p>Slowdown is of course a very difficult question, how we see economical development. Overall, I think we see two important pieces. And if there is some slowdown, at one point of time it will impact us. I think that's fair to say. The counterbalances I think we have in place since the acquisition of BOC is our broader global footprint and a much better position in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>I think this is &#x2013; that could be shifted a little bit, the one or the other effect on the timeline. And the other positive thing we are seeing, of course, is the energy-related stuff from a new business development, as the enhanced gas-recovery schemes, for example, in the Middle East. So with the increase in energy prices, we also see an increase in new business applications, which has been true for engineering and also for gas schemes.</p>
          <p>I don't got your fourth question. I think it was related to the contract in Romania?</p>

          <p>Well, first of all, we are acquiring the existing gas operation park, which consists primarily of Russian-built gas operation units. There are six of them.

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, the impact of the second half of the year of 2008 is because we are taking over the former captive operations, and then we will replace these plants by a new plant during the year of 2010.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. It's &#x2013; I think it's me, it's John Radgil,  can you hear me?</p>

          <p>We hear you very well, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay. I think I will do like the others, ask several questions, if I can. Engineering, obviously, you're guiding us for flat sales in the second half of this year, despite the fact you still have a strong backlog. I'm just wondering, how good is your visibility on that? Are you taking any provision for further delays on some projects, or due to the normal timing of development of these projects and the percentage of completion accounting, you're pretty sure that you will realize the guidance you've given us?</p>
          <p>Second question, still in Engineering, if you take about the 1.5 order intake in the second half and the guidance in sales, you will have a book-to-bill at the end of '08 of about one time. It's the lowest book-to-bill since quite some time, and yet you're guiding us for a mid-term growth of 8% to 10%.</p>
          <p>So I guess, beyond that, you need to have a significant &#x2013;  you need to have a rebound of order intake next year. I would really appreciate if you can pass through the portfolio of discussion you have, particularly in ethylene, oxygen and hydrogen, to see whether you are still gaining &#x2013; a growing portfolio of projects that give you a lot of comfort that indeed you will have more than 3 billion order intake in 2009.</p>
          <p>The third question is more a clarification on a question that has been asked many times on this call, about the cylinders price to volume splits. And I understand that in the first half, it's about a 50-50 split. I understand from your answer, Georg, that you see price increases going through in the second half, which makes sense, given the high oil price. Would that be fair to assume, that the contribution in the second half, will be of more pricing and less volumes?</p>
          <p>And the very last one, on cash flow, I mean, the cash interest payment, it was pretty high in Q2. I'm wondering if there is any explanation there. And, very lastly, I mean, in previous calls, you have been kind to give us a net debt guidance. I don't know if you want to do that again for a net debt guidance for the end of this year. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean, again, thank you for your questions. I'm asking myself if you want to move to the Engineering business. I assume that is not the case.</p>
          <p>I think, first of all, regarding the 3 billion or 8 to 10% growth for this year, you are right. At that point of time, we had a very strong second half 2007 and with the recognition of sales because of BOC in that quarter, it seems to be quite flat in the second half of the year. So we stick to that guidance of an 8 to 10% growth.</p>
          <p>Overall, I think you should have in mind that the order backlog at that point of time is still clearly about 4 billion. You should include that into your numbers. And then the further outlook underpins the 8% to 10% overall. I think that is the short answer on the development. I don't know if Aldo wants to add a little bit to the prospect of what we are doing in Engineering, but overall I think, as I said earlier, energy-related applications are really increasing opportunities for Engineering.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Energy and petrochemical. As I mentioned at the beginning, there has been a &#x2013; let's say a wait phase also in the building for new ethylene capacity, but I see that this will come to a positive investment decision very soon and that's why I'm not concerned at all that we will fall back in the backlog of Engineering anytime soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other part of your question, yes, it's right, I think on the cylinder business, second half of the year, more pricing, less volumes. I think I would underpin this, on the cash flow, rightly find out from you, this is related to the payments for our benchmark bonds in the second quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the supply/demand, I can tell you that we are facing tighter times, just went through the reviews very recently. We are aiming, however, to commission our new plant in Australia, in Darwin, mid of next year, which should relieve the situation a little bit. We are seeing a ramp up of the Qatar facility, where we also source a part of our products. So it's tighter, but it's manageable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, again. It's still JPMorgan in London. Just sorry to really labor this point on the growth in cylinders, but I just want to make sure I understand it fully in terms of the sequential progression. The roughly 600 basis point improvement over the recent run rate of the last 12 months or so, you're saying that's pretty much all, or the vast majority of it, an acceleration in pricing? That's all. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil, as I tried to explain, I think it's a mixed impact here, or effect, half &#x2013; half overall pricing-volume wise. And then I pointed out that in the southern hemisphere, I think, we have the cyclical impact of the colder winter time, which has been related to the LPG part in the cylinder business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. This is Norbert Barth from WestLB in Frankfurt. Three questions. First of all, the first one, regarding a figure. You have your special items impact positively of 59 million in the first half year. Can you tell us what is the taxes on it? I believe that it's perhaps mainly tax free, therefore the tax ratio is quite low, it's nearly 25%. I saw that you guided till 30%, but I wanted to check only if that's still continuing because of this effect, or what was the reason for the low tax rate?</p>
          <p>And, thirdly, if you looked on your clients from the different segments, do you really in no client segments see any decline at the moment, for example, in electrical business or in steel business or something? So can you tell us a little bit more, if there is some hints for being something going weaker in the next part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your first question, it's the special items. It's related to the disposal of the Colombian business. We were mentioning this over a period of time that this was already deconsolidated. Then we got quite late in the process after the BOC transaction, the antitrust obligation to sell that business. So it comes with a lower tax rate. That's true. So that is impacting the tax rate in the positive development, but we stick to our overall full-year guidance of around 30%, which is, compared to the guidance we have given in 2007, two percentage points less. I think that's important to understand.</p>
          <p>Regarding the decline overall, I think we have not seen from a customer segmentation perspective overall a decline when we were talking about Arcelor Mittal, for example, and the new plant there in Romania. You see that the steel business is doing overall quite well. On the buy side, as I said in the call of the first quarter, in the U.S., we had seen some declines regarding automotive industry and textile industry, but the core industries you were referring to we don't see a decline and are looking into hopefully a good development in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That also holds true for electronically in the Asian market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The electronic business, I think here you have overall a very positive impact, which will be driven by photovoltaic overall. That will hopefully overcompensate if there is any decline in other segments. But at this point of time we don't see in the core business of electronics a decline, also not in the Asian markets.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry, again me. A couple of quantifications, if I can. You mentioned the headwind on the reported margins in America, due to the size of hydrogen. I wonder if you can quantify the size of your hydrogen business in America. Secondly, on the strength of the cylinders business, you have highlighted the strength of pricing and volume in specialty gases. Same question, can you just quantify what's the size of specialty gases at this stage?</p>
          <p>And, lastly, you have seen &#x2013; we have seen some acquisition last year in emerging markets. You have announced one in Saudi Arabia. Just wonder if you could give us any indication of consolidation effect in the next two quarters. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Jean, we are not prepared really to disclose more details on the businesses, regarding the acquisitions. I think it's important to understand we have communicated and signing of the acquisition. The SIGAS acquisition is not closed yet. This is a majority acquisition of 51%, with a business which is owned by, I think, roughly more than 40 families in Saudi Arabia. So we are looking forward to the closing, hopefully, in the fourth quarter, but it takes some time, because situation is very different there. Therefore, I'm not seeing at this point of time an impact for 2008 year, if any then in the fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Hello. This is Lars Hechley speaking from Metland, Frankfurt. I've got a question regarding your order backlog in Engineering. As far as I know, we're seeing very high cancellation rates in other industries and other Engineering businesses right now, and my question would be, do you have something like that here at Linde, any cancellations here in the order backlog?</p>
          <p>And the other thing is, is there anything in your contract to prevent customers from doing this, like high cancellation fees or something like that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, luckily we are not affected by any cancellations, as we speak. We are focusing all our contracts that are in the termination process, one of the terminations could be termination for convenience by the customer and of course then there will be sufficient compensation, not only for the cost incurred, but also for the loss of profit or anticipated profit. But, as I say, for the time being, we are spared from this painful type of development. All our contracts are proceeding and we are not facing this type of problems.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Okay. Well, we cannot give you numbers. I can tell you that the renewable business at Linde is primarily in the gas business. In the engineering business, we are primarily working on fossil energy, energy sources. So in the solar business we have been exceedingly successful acquiring the gas supply to the thin-film type of solar cell manufacturing. We are very active and very successful in countries like Germany, first of all and Spain, Italy, and then in Asia, I think, in India and China. There is a very large backlog of contracts, but these are factories which are going to be commissioned starting &#x2013; well, as we speak, we have two startups in India at the moment, which are generating sales, but we will see the ramp up in the course of 2009, we've many, many accounts we will start to generate sales.</p>
