        <plist>
          <p>Good morning &#x2013; ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I can't start this conversation today without thinking of what's going on in Japan, and I would like to express my sincere and deepest condolences and solidarities to the Japanese people who is proving its <mark type="indiscernible" />, its resilience, its ability to withstand apocalypse that are seen coming through the images on TV, and most of all our friends and colleagues who are working desperately to avoid major problems in the nuclear plant. Amongst all of this, I start speaking about our results, and I welcome you to the presentation of our 2010 Results and Financial, Operational Strategy Presentation.</p>
          <p>We are together with Luigi Ferraris who is going to elaborate on the year passed results and numbers. And we will see shortly that in five years in a row we have been able to beat the expectations, we have been able to overcome the targets and delivering growing profitability, delivering solidity, delivering high returns to our shareholders. After Luigi's presentation, I will take you through the key points of our 2011-2015 strategic plan, which will focus on Endesa and Green Power, as you might expect, and those would be presented by Andrea Brentan and Francesco Starace that are sitting here on the left. I would also like to introduce most of our people here; our Chairman, Piero Gnudi; Endesa's Chairman, Borja Prado, lot of our group's directors and a lot of colleagues that might be able to take on and answer any of your questions.</p>
          <p>Now let me start my presentation for addressing what I personally consider to be the two important elements and factors of all of our strategic plans that we've been delivering so far, reliability and performance. If I can move &#x2013; should I move it? Okay. The past three years represented a transformational period for Enel. The company has successfully developed an outstanding international portfolio and it's opening up two new platforms of growth. In particular, 2010 has been a significant year due to the further integration with Endesa, completion of our disposal program and the successful IPO of Enel Green Power.</p>
          <p>At the same time, this period has been a challenging one for the energy markets, characterized by significant declines in demand, in particular during the recession in 2009. Despite these broader market challenges, I am proud to underline that Enel has achieved a 22% increase in EBITDA since 2008. Furthermore, Enel has consistently beaten the targets indicated to the market each year since 2005. Also we have taken a disciplined approach to the expansion of our business, maintaining the soundness of our balance sheet. In fact, as you can see in the right-hand chart &#x2013; right-hand side of the chart, we improved the group's solidity position with a constant focus of return for our shareholders. Our consistent growth and track record of delivery against our goals confirm the strength of our strategy and the robustness of our business model. Next?</p>
          <p>This is what we mean when we claim to be a reliable and performing company. Let's now have a look at the key success factors of our strategy, which we still consider as priorities for our future. Over the next few years, we intend to strengthen our leading position and achieve best-in-class standards across all of our businesses by focusing on the following. First; we'll confirm our leadership position in our core markets in Italy and Iberia. That will continue to provide us with a broad and stable base to support our organic growth strategy. Second; we will strengthen our scale in worldwide renewables, placing us at the forefront of an increasingly important sector in the energy industry. Moreover, we will continue to leverage our multiple platforms to enhance organic growth in LatAm, Russia and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Third; flexibility, savings and efficiencies while maintaining high quality operational standards across the businesses, and this will remain a key driver of our strategy. Fourth, we strongly believe that innovation is a hallmark of our strategy and we'll continue to develop and promote the use of new more efficient and cleaner technologies. All of this will grant a strong operational performance while ensuring Enel's financial stability. We will continue to target at least an A class credit rating through strong cash flow generation, selective investments and assets optimization.</p>
          <p>I will now speak of the relevant key priorities, starting with leadership in core markets. In Italy, as far as the generation activities are concerned, our major investment will be in gas midstream with the <mark type="indiscernible" />, our reconversion program into clean coal of Porto Tolle and some initial nuclear activities to prepare the ground for our new cycle and to reinforce our energy mix as the most competitive one in the Italian energy arena. In Iberia, we'll focus our strategy mainly on new pumping surge opportunities and then completing the upgrades of our generation fleet. This together was strengthening our midstream presence in gas interconnection capacity such as met gas, as well as our ongoing efficiency projects will help make Endesa a balanced energy player generating solid profit throughout the planned period. Moreover, both in Italy and Iberia we will keep on investing in high value-added services, digital meters, smart grids, dual energy offerings, to support the quality of our relationship with the final customers. Overall, we will inject into Italy and Iberia cumulative CapEx closed to &#x20AC;18 billion over the next five years.</p>
          <p>Moving on to analyze our multiple platforms for organic growth, let me start with our renewable activities worldwide, and let me remind you that Enel Green Power represents a unique example among worldwide renewable players in terms of its geographical and technological diversification mix, lower dependence on subsidies and capability of generating a growing cash flow throughout the years of the plan. Enel Green Power CapEx for the planned period will be &#x20AC;2.4 billion in Italy and Iberia, already accounted in the figure chart, and &#x20AC;4 billion in other areas where EGP is present. With regards to LatAm, the region's economies have proven to be robust. Inside this positive scenario, our unique business, our ongoing efficiency projects as well as clear and stable regulatory framework position us to take advantage from the growth expected in their region, where we have strongly committed to invest &#x20AC;4.8 billion in the five-year planned period to support our organic growth strategy, both in generation &#x2013; mainly hydro and distribution.</p>
          <p>Russia is also a fast-growing economy that has reacted robustly to the recent economic downturn. Its market fundamentals today are promising. All of these contribute to the favorable long-term economic outlook, making this country a strategic market for Enel where we will be investing about &#x20AC;900 million over the planned period. In Slovakia, our total CapEx will account for &#x20AC;2.7 billion in total up to 2015. Finally, in Romania we will invest &#x20AC;800 million towards the five-year plan, mainly focusing our strategy on improving efficiency and increasing the number of customers.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk about the third key priority of our plan, which is consolidation, integration and operational excellence. First, few words on our investment program; you've just heard me illustrating our major CapEx program in our key geographical areas. Let me just underline here that this CapEx program has been structured with the flexibility to enable our group to capture further potential organic growth, in particular in the second stage of the plan. We will achieve this without losing what we consider to be a key pillar of our strategy, preservation of the financial stability, which will allow us to maintain our A class rating throughout the planned period.</p>
          <p>Let me now give an update on our synergies and efficiency program, which represent a key driver to enhance group performance. Starting with synergies, as you can see in this chart, we continue to deliver above our targets. In 2010, the combined action of Enel and Endesa recorded &#x20AC;886 million of synergies. On top of this Endesa's own Zenith program has delivered further &#x20AC;108 million for a total amount of approximately &#x20AC;1 billion, &#x20AC;994 million <mark type="ph" /> of this. With the strong set of results now being achieved, we are again raising our combined synergies target as we did in 2008, 2009 and 2010, aiming at obtaining in 2012 more than &#x20AC;1.2 billion in synergies. Once again, I want to stress that this integration program with Endesa is very significant and represent a leading European example in terms of speed of execution and total benefits achieved, both at Enel and Endesa. Thanks to this program, Enel Endesa now operates as one company on a worldwide basis.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to the important efficiency program called Zenith. Enel is continually making progress in maximizing cash flows. On this chart, I would like to draw your attention to our 2010 savings contribution to EBITDA improvement, in particular &#x20AC;750 million of savings, which represents about 50% of the EBITDA improvement in 2010 versus 2009. This together with what we have achieved in terms of working capital and CapEx optimization amounts to a natural global savings figure equal to &#x20AC;3.5 billion versus 2008, which is 30% higher than the original target. In other words, we succeeded in reaching the target one year ahead of time versus the original schedule. On top of these numbers, we are already working on a new efficiency program aimed at optimizing across the group's staff and services. As usual, we will keep you updated on the progress of this project starting from June 2011 results.</p>
          <p>Let me now illustrate the four  key priority of our strategic plan, which is leadership in innovation. We are strongly committed to invest about &#x20AC;1 billion gross of any capital grants and subsidies to support initiatives such as the development of all technologies connected to the CO2 capture and storage, high efficiency coal plants, hydrogen generation in our Fusina plant and thermo-dynamic solar at our Archimede project. The future will be implementation of smart grids on a global base; digital meters in Iberia and LatAm, which is <mark type="indiscernible" />; distributed generation and power storage; development of the third generation nuclear smart cities and electric mobility, all supporting the development of course of a cleaner and more sustainable world. I'm proud to say that our group is the only energy group worldwide, which combines and brings together all of these initiatives.</p>
          <p>And finally, a few words on financial stability; combined activities <mark type="indiscernible" /> and I presented to you this morning will contribute a cumulative consolidated cash flow of about &#x20AC;73 billion throughout 2015. This cash flow will support our CapEx program, servicing the debt and dividends paid to the Enel shareholders and group's minorities. In terms of dividend, let me confirm that we will continue to distribute 60% of our group's net income &#x2013; net ordinary income. All of this will generate positive cumulative cash flow of about &#x20AC;9 billion at the end of the period. This positive balance will give us flexibilities that strategically move towards enhancing our organic growth while maintaining our A plus credit rating, which I repeat, and will remain central to our strategy.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand it over to Luigi for the 2010 results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fulvio, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, thank you. Before going into 2010 numbers in detail, let me underline not only the robustness and resilience of our results but also the strong and active management undertaken during 2010 focused on cash flow optimization and net debt reduction.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a look at the numbers. First, I'm going to give you some financial highlights. Then I will take you through the 2010 division of financial results, ending with our group's net debt evolution. Now turning to financials, let me highlight that 2009 has been restated to account for the change on IFRIC-18 international accounting principle and higher depreciation and amortization related to the Endesa purchase price allocation completion.</p>
          <p>Group EBITDA increased by about 7%, mainly driven by Iberia and Latin America, Enel Green Power and the International division among others. Net of non-recurring items, the increase was about 9%. Group net ordinary income increased by 5% totaling &#x20AC;4.4 billion. In this regard, taking into account the dividend policy already mentioned by <mark type="ph" /> Fulvio, the Board of Directors has decided to propose to the AGM a total dividend of &#x20AC;0.28 per share, of which &#x20AC;10 per share has been paid as an interim dividend in November and &#x20AC;18 per share will be paid in June of this year. Net debt decreased by about 12% to &#x20AC;44.9 billion. Excluding accounting translation effects on foreign currency, long-term &#x2013; net debt stands at &#x20AC;43.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to the following slide, EBIT increased by 2% versus last year, thanks to higher EBITDA, which was partially offset by higher D&amp;A, mainly related to Endesa. Our net financial charges stands at &#x20AC;3.2 billion, registering an increase of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. The variation is the net effect of the following. First, higher interest charges of &#x20AC;196 million, mainly due to the full consolidation of Endesa. Second, a decrease of &#x20AC;970 million in financial income, due to Acciona's put option exercised in 2009. Third, an increase of &#x20AC;291 million in other interest charges, mainly due to the result of a one-off regularization effect of the accrual in financial revenues from previous years related to the Spanish tariff deficit. You will find more information about this in the annexes. Let me also remind you that our normalized annual average cost of debt remain in the area of 5%. The group's tax rate increased from 28% in 2009 to about 30% in 2010. On a normalized basis, our annualized tax rate is 31 &#x2013; 32%, slightly below the level of 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's continue with an update on forward sales activities on the following charts. In Italy, we have hedged 9% of our 2011 production at an average base load price of about &#x20AC;71 per megawatt hour and 50% of 2012, of which 25% hedged at an average price of &#x20AC;74 per megawatt hour and the other 25% as a result of the customer portfolio rollover with automatic renewable at premium price against market condition. In Spain, we are fully hedged for 2011 and 25%, 30% when it comes to 2012 with an average price of &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour in 2011 and &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour to &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour in 2012. In Latin America, as usual we are 70%, 75% hedged for 2011 and 65%, 70% for 2012. Finally, in Slovakia we are 100% hedged when it comes to 2011 and about 36% when it comes to 2012. The average price is in the region of &#x20AC;52.3 per megawatt hour. All of this helps to explain our EBITDA evolution on chart number 17, which gives an overview of all our operation.</p>
          <p>I will now go through the EBITDA of each of our division in more detail, starting with Generation and Energy Management Italy. The overall EBITDA declined by &#x20AC;632 million, in line with our expectation. This was mainly the results of a slight decline in the generation margin of &#x20AC;24 million, mainly caused by lower prices in thermal volumes; a reduction of &#x20AC;133 million in trading and gas margins, mainly due to favorable gas sourcing which had positively affected 2009; a reduction of &#x20AC;151 million in the fair value of commodities; and a &#x20AC;253 million decline in other, mainly due to the termination of the Nigerian Gas stranding cost and other non-recurring revenues. Also, thanks to forward sales and commodity hedging activities, the unit margin in the domestic thermal generation, net of ancillary services, was &#x20AC;25 per megawatt hour, substantially in line with the previous year, without considering the contribution of the Nigerian stranding cost.</p>
          <p>The overall generation margin, net of ancillary services, is about &#x20AC;44 per megawatt hour, in line with the previous year and net of course of the above-mentioned Nigerian stranding cost. In the annexes, you will find the details of the EBITDA evolution of our Market division and our Service and Holding division.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the following slides on domestic Infrastructure and Network, EBITDA amounted to &#x20AC;3.8 billion. Bear in mind that in 2009, we recorded a capital gain of &#x20AC;295 million from the sale of the high voltage grid to Terna. Taking this factor into account, on a like-for-like basis, EBITDA increased by 2.4% versus last year. On top of this, we recorded the improvement of &#x20AC;293 million in the energy margin, mainly thanks to positive price components on the tariff and higher volumes distributed; lower connection fees of &#x20AC;14 million. And other items were &#x20AC;188 million, mainly due to lower parameter effect on the previously mentioned asset sold last year and higher provisions versus 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving to the following slide on International operations, EBITDA increased by &#x20AC;68 million versus 2009. This is the cumulative effects of the following. In the Central region, Slovensk&#xE9; elektr&#xE1;rne recorded a decrease of &#x20AC;114 million, mainly due to lower unit margin where the decline in prices have been partially compensated for by an increasing volume effect. Romania and Bulgaria recorded an increase of &#x20AC;30 million in the period. France recorded a reduction of &#x20AC;23 million, due to lower prices which were partially offset by higher volumes. Russia contributed with an increase of &#x20AC;181 million, split between generation and supply activities, which accounted for &#x20AC;151 million and &#x20AC;83 million respectively. This was partially compensated for by the upstream gas disposal recorded in the third quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Before moving to analyzing the remaining division, I would like to address your attention on our Russian generation activities on the following chart. OGK-5 reported 2010 EBITDA of about &#x20AC;334 million or 36% up versus last year on a like-for-like basis. This was the result of the following: an increase of 10% in total production, thanks to the general economy recovery and favorable weather conditions, higher availability ratio of our plants, and higher power sales and efficiency. All of this translated into a 25% increase in unitary prices, mainly driven by the day-ahead market price.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the Endesa results. First, let me remind you that for the sake of a comparison, 2009 figures have been reported assuming 100% consolidation for the year, taking into &#x2013; also into account the result of the application of Enel Group's accounting principles. The Iberian division has recorded an EBITDA increase of about &#x20AC;292 million. This has been the outcome of better results from the liberalized business for &#x20AC;43 million, mainly related to our currency policy of forward selling to the final clients; an increase of &#x20AC;274 million in the regulated business, mainly due to the implementation of international accounting principle related to new connection fees; and the new distribution remuneration scheme among other factors. An increase of &#x20AC;173 million, thanks to lower provision on workforce voluntary exit, lower OpEx and higher capital gains, partially compensated for by the provision on energy efficiency saving scheme Royal Decree for the period 2011-2013. All of this has been negatively affected by an impact on renewables of &#x20AC;198 million, due to the change of the perimeter of the assets sold to Acciona during 2009 and to EGP, Enel Green Power, during 2010.</p>
          <p>The Latin American division has recorded an EBITDA increase of &#x20AC;221 million. This has been mainly the result of the following: generation business recorded an increase of &#x20AC;22 million, mainly due to higher margins in Brazil, thanks to higher volumes and prices; the Distribution business increased by &#x20AC;166 million, mainly thanks to a general increase in volumes in all the areas of presence.</p>
          <p>Let's now have a quick look at our Renewable Operation. EBITDA total &#x20AC;1.3 billion, representing a 11.2% increase on 2009. Taking into account the one-off effect of a tax partnership in North America for an amount of minus &#x20AC;31 million recorded in Enel's consolidated group numbers in 2009, EBITDA is up 8.4% versus last year. This is mainly due to the following; a decline of &#x20AC;20 million in Italy &#x2013; in Europe, mainly due to the negative impact of the <mark type="ph" /> Chip 6 incentive, partially compensated for by higher volume among others; an increase of &#x20AC;124 million in Iberia and Latin America, mainly attributable to the consolidation of ECyR division of &#x2013; the renewable division of Enel Green Power of Endesa; and higher volumes growth which has more than offset the fall in Spanish power prices. And finally, an increase of &#x20AC;23 million in North America, mainly thanks to the above mentioned one-off tax and higher volumes, partially compensated for by lower prices and higher cost.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt is concerned, you see that our cash flow from operations in the period has enabled us to cover CapEx, debt services, taxes and dividend payment, leaving us with extra cash from ordinary activities available for debt reduction. This jointly with the delivery of our disposal and efficiency program has allowed us to achieve a net debt position at year-end of less than &#x20AC;45 billion. Our liquidity position is supported by the availability of committed credit lines aiming at servicing &#x2013; serving management of working capital. Also taking into account cash and cash equivalents, liquidity at group level amounts to about &#x20AC;25 billion and allow us to cover about 12, 18 months of maturities. Please refer to the annexes for further details. Finally, <mark type="indiscernible" /> the tariff deficit securitization started in January is further strengthening our consolidated liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now, let me hand over to Fulvio Conti for the strategic plan 2011-2015.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luigi. Let me give you some specific regional guidance on our strategic plan. Let me start with probably &#x2013; let me start with guidance on the divisional targets, which will be complemented of course by Andreas and Francesco later on, and starting with the assumptions &#x2013; the micro assumptions that we have used. No change &#x2013; basically no change from what you've been seeing from us in the past. As for 2011, the general consensus demand growth is about 1% for Italy and 1.5% for Spain. The compounded average growth is here for you to review.</p>
          <p>Let me now move into our strategy for the Italian operations. Starting with the relevant market drivers, we've seen a steady recovery in the energy demand in 2010 after the drop in 2009. As for the future, we expect demand for gas and power to both grow at a steady rate of 1/2% per year. Within this scenario, the Italian generation mix is characterized by the use of expensive technologies with no nuclear and limited coal presence. Since 2000, about 30 gigawatts of new CCGT have been built in Italy and in total, it accounts for about 50% of the Italian production. In short, the Italian mix drives up generation cost well above the average European level.</p>
          <p>Coming to the gas market, you can see that it continues to be featured by the presence of long-term supply contracts linked to oil price and by poor spot market liquidity, less than 10% <mark type="ph" /> as a matter, therefore ensuring a premium price for the Italian gas market compared with other European countries. This together with expected demand recovery will lead to increase the room for thermal generation in the medium, long-term, delivering more stable and robust market condition, which sustain Italian power prices.</p>
          <p>Let me focus on the competitive advantage that Enel has in the Italian market in terms of generation mix. Enel manages a competitive power fleet with a significant cost advantage compared to the gas marginal Italian mix. In this regard, a clean coal plant can deliver output at a cost advantage of around &#x20AC;20 per megawatt hour compared to the recently build CCGT plant that will continue to work as a mid merit capacity. Torre Nord power plant represents a good example of this. In this general framework, we confirm our strategy of improving the quality and the competitiveness of our field mix, investing in new clean coal capacity in Porto Tolle, about 2,000 megawatts, which will be finalized by 2015, 2016; and of course the LNG terminal in Porto Empedocle, about 8 billion cubic meters, will be finalized after 2015.</p>
          <p>Regarding our activities in the free retail market, our strategic focus will be to increase our customer base by about 1 million customers per year, leveraging residential clients, small, medium enterprise and dual energy sales, which provides both resilience and margin protection. All of this will be achieved thanks to ongoing improvements in the quality and efficiency of our operations. For our Italian networks operations, we don't expect major deviation in tariffs for the forthcoming regulatory period. We will keep our focus on operational excellence, reducing cash cost for customer mainly through initiatives relating to the supply chain management, process reengineering and reorganization of local activities. All of these translate into following targets for our Italian operations.</p>
          <p>Our major investment projects in the five-year period will include about &#x20AC;2 billion for the clean coal reconversion portfolio, about &#x20AC;500 million for the LNG terminal at Porto Empedocle, about &#x20AC;1.2 billion spent on maintenance and performance upgrading of our generation fleet. The balance of up to &#x20AC;9.7 billion would be represented by our ongoing investments and distribution for the maintenance of our high quality standards and some initial nuclear activities. All of this will support our leadership position in the area, maintaining our current strong EBITDA levels.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to our International operations. Our core geographies continue to be Russia, Slovakia, Romania and France, and these countries will remain key in the deployment of our overall CapEx program. In the following charts, I will give you more detail on Russia and Slovakia. In France, we will continue to expand our nuclear activities by participating in the EPR project, the EDF, allocating a total investment of &#x20AC;300 million during the period. In addition, thanks to the new regulatory framework, <mark type="indiscernible" /> that is, we will continue to increase our market share in supply with the aim of selling 25 terawatt hour by 2015. In Romania, we will continue to invest to improve the electricity grid as well as customer service quality, maintaining our focus on customer satisfaction and best practice sharing.</p>
          <p>Let's look at Russia in more detail, starting with the relevant market drivers, let me remark that Russia is the fourth largest power market in the world in terms of installed capacity, which is largely represented by open gas cycle and co-generation power plants being this &#x2013; the marginal technology. Moreover, this capacity presents a limited residual life, therefore causing a gradual reduction of reserve margins. From this point of view, gas price evolution becomes essential to support profitability of the system. Let me also underline that the new capacity payment mechanism and free retail market evolution represents the major pillars of what we considered to be a favorable regulatory framework. Under this scenario we'll invest in following major projects; the improvement of our generation mix through the building of two new CCGT plants with a total net capacity of 800 megawatts. We should benefit from gas supplies of SeverEnergia, our own gas plant.</p>
          <p>We expect our first gas delivery to take place during this year and to ramp our production of equity gas up to 6 billion cubic meters at the peak regime. The revamping of our Reftinskaya plant, replacing the old inefficient coal technology with brand new coal technology, the operational improvements and investments aimed at improving safety and obtaining environmental compliance, these will allow us to complement our growing margin in the country and therefore capture further opportunities.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on Slovakia. Starting with the market drivers, Slovakia is at the center of the region Centrel, which includes Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. This region is characterized by high level of interconnection capacity with Germany and the Balkans by increasing capacity constraints as well as homogenous regulatory framework. Additionally we, expect increasing demand in Slovakia to increase at an average rate of 1.9% after 2015. Under this scenario, in 2010 we have completed the upgrading program of units 3, 4 of Bohunice plant, increasing capacity to above 1000 megawatts. On top of this investment for the completion of units 3 and 4 at Mochovce plant, continue to be a key priority. We expect the first 440 megawatt at unit 3 to become available by the end of 2012 and the remaining 440 megawatt in unit 4 during 2013.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will continue to reduce outages and optimizing maintenance to maximize the competitiveness of our generation fleet. All in all, we will seek to execute an optimal hedging strategy, benefiting also from our increasing retail client portfolio in Czech Republic and in Poland. All of these translate into the following international overall targets. The number reported in this chart are the results of all the action I just outlined. In conclusion, our International division represents one of the three key growth pillars of the group, together with LatAm and Renewables.</p>
          <p>So then, let me hand it over to Andrea Brentan and Francesco Starace who will be focusing on their respective responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Fulvio; good morning, everyone. Now, let me give you some information regarding Endesa business plan in Iberia and Latin America for the period 2011-2015. Let's start with Iberia. First of all, I'd like to summarize the market scenario there. After the strong decline in 2009 and the bounce-back in 2010, energy demand in Mainland Spain is expected to consolidate its recovery growing at a 1.7% compound annual rate during the period. Wholesale electricity price should reach levels of &#x20AC;55 and &#x20AC;61 per megawatt-hour in 2013 and 2015 respectively. This increase in price will be mainly due to the expected upward trend in fuel cost and to a reduction of some 10 percentage points of the system reserve margin.</p>
          <p>Expected demand growth will be covered essentially by renewables <mark type="indiscernible" /> and thermal capacity will maintain a reduced load factor, but it will be even more fundamental as a backup for renewables. This situation we believe is clearly understood by regulators and represents the base for the new availability and capacity payment scheme for thermal power plants, which we believe will be put in place.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our strategic guidelines in Iberia; in order to successfully address the market Endesa plans to focus on profitability and leadership consolidation through the following strategic guidelines. One, synergies with Enel and efficiency programs; as we have seen before, we are very well on track on synergies and with our own Zenith plan. Our target for 2012 amounts to more than &#x20AC;1 billion annual savings. Two, operational excellence through different programs with a target of achieving best-in-class levels in distribution efficiency, nuclear availability and customer relationship. Three, regulatory management. Important improvements have been achieved in Spain and there is a number now of milestones ahead, which &#x2013; I will discuss all of this later on. Four, concerning the liberalized business in generation we will focus on developing and implementing new pumped storage projects in Spain and Iberia.</p>
          <p>On the islands, we aim at maintaining our leadership by adding new capacity according to the expected growth in demand. And also, we have to manage the implementation of the new European Emission Directive over the period. Supply, our objective is to confirm our market leadership without compromising profitability, maintaining our overall market share of some 40%. As far as energy management is concerned, we will continue with our proven strategy of optimizing our own production with wholesale energy purchases. And lastly, in the gas Spanish market we aim at consolidating our position as the number two player.</p>
          <p>And let's now turn to our Operational Excellence Projects. I will give you some more details on this. In distribution, we continue working on simplifying and streamlining our organization and optimizing our business processes. We are well on track to achieve our cash cost per client target, which is a reduction from &#x20AC;105 per customer in 2010 to below &#x20AC;90 per customer in 2015. We target to put in into operation in Spain over 13 million digital meters by the end of 2015. As of today, we have already some 150,000 digital meters operating and all this puts us in a leading position in Spain. While doing all this, we will maintain our high level of quality and distribution.</p>
          <p>We are well on track, as shown in results of 2010, in our nuclear Operational Excellence Program based on selected investments, new recruitment and operational process optimization. As a result of our plan, we aim while being best-in-class in security at increasing our plant availability to 91% by 2015. Lastly, we aim at consolidating our leadership in the Iberian supply market, including the reinforcement of our number two position in Portugal through an improved portfolio of value-added products and services, focusing on client quality perception.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to regulation. As I said before, significant improvements have been achieved the last months, which include a new scheme in distribution which links remuneration to investments. It includes also corrections to certain incentive inconsistencies in renewables and remuneration, the clear understanding by regulators, the thermal power plants are definitively needed to back up the increasing amount of renewables in an isolated market, clear understanding by regulators that tariffs need to reflect cost also in order to comply with new caps of the deficit and avoid, as put in the Royal Decree, any creation of new deficit starting January 1, 2013. Also, we've seen the starting at a very good progress of tariff deficit securitization with more than &#x20AC;2 billion already cashed in by Endesa so far in 2011. All these decisions represent a major improvement, and together with the end of the sector cost review process bringing higher stability to the sector.</p>
          <p>Of course, we have a number of milestones ahead, mainly the tariff increases due to <mark type="indiscernible" /> deficit caps, implementation of a new availability and capacity payment scheme for thermal power plants and the confirmation of the nuclear role in the long-term mix. Overall, as I said, decisions made by the government are in the right direction over solving the major issues of this sector and bringing stability to the regulatory framework. We're confident that the further measures will take place as expected.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the liberalized business. In Iberia where we aim at consolidating our leadership through the following lines in ordinary regime by adding new capacity through the following main projects; the Moralets pumped storage plant, 400 megawatts, starting operations in 2014; and also during the period the start of the construction of two additional pumped storage schemes; in 2010, the Almaraz repowering by some 19 megawatts. In the Islands, we're going to add over the period some &#x2013; slightly more than 300 megawatts of new generation capacity to serve the expected growth in demand. And in Portugal, just reminding you that we have just put into commercial operation the Tejo II combined cycle plant. In the supply market, we aim at consolidating our current market share overall of some 40% in the electricity supply market and consolidating our number two position in the gas supply business, preserving leadership in the liberalized dual fuel supply of gas and electricity. These targets will be achieved by leveraging on our consolidating know-how; supply; improving the offer of value-added product and services; and reinforcing our commitment to client quality perception.</p>
          <p>Finally, for Iberia, let me now focus on our energy management optimization strategy where Endesa will maintain its proven forward sale, own generation production and energy purchases integrated strategy with a strict process of forward sale of electricity to final customers, closing positions and monitoring risk exposure. We expect to sell in the Mainland liberalized market, you can see on the chart, around 75 terawatt hours in 2011 and 81 terawatt hours in 2015. Our own production share will increase from 59%, as you can see, in 2011 to some 67% in 2015. This is also due to the fact that in 2011 we do not include in this percentage our production out of domestic coal because with the Royal Decree as a matter of fact it is now for a number of years a regulated activity. Our strategy together with our high quality asset mix and commercial capabilities will continue to create value through margin optimization and stabilization.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to Latin America, which represents the second most dynamic growing region in the world in terms of energy needs. According to the International Energy Agency, power and gas demand in Latin America is expected to increase at an annual average rate of around 2.5% up to 2020. You can appreciate that Endesa within this very promising region is brilliantly positioned, thanks to a Tier 1 country profile in terms of GDP, expected growth, country risk in terms of rating. GDP forecast for 2011 are very encouraging, reaching levels of around 5% growth in all countries where Endesa operates. In the same vein, the country risk measured by Standard and Poor's show that Chile, Brazil, Columbia and Peru have a lower level of risk than the average in the region and their ratings range from BBB minus to A plus in Chile. All in all, America &#x2013; Latin America represents for Endesa and for the entire Enel Group a unique platform to grow.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to our strategic guidelines here. We will in Latin America prioritize growth and operational excellence. We will continue working on our successful synergy program for the group and our own Zenith plan. In terms of operational excellence, we are working on several initiatives. Let me just mention a very important one, which is aiming at developing a solid &#x2013; even more solid generation project pipeline through fully dedicated high level professionals, fostering business development activities and fostering our activities through securing environmental permits. Regarding our pursuit of growing opportunities in generation, we plan to build over the period some 1,000 megawatts of new greenfield capacity. Distribution, we'll be leveraging on organic growth to add slightly less than 2 million new customers. Our target is to consolidate our leadership position in Chile, Columbia and Peru. Brazil, we'll take advantage of the strong organic growth and we will look at other potential growth alternatives that may arise. In Argentina, we'll benefit from market growth. In the country, we'll continue to manage our upside potential there. Concerning regulation of course, we will concentrate over the period on actively managing the distribution tariff reviews which will take place.</p>
          <p>Now, to give you some more details of the Andean region; Chile, Columbia and Peru, the market will be characterized by strong increase in demand with a compound annual growth rate of 4.8% by a reduction in reserve margins in Chile and in Columbia. In the next 10 to 15 years, Chile alone will need some 14,500 megawatts of new capacity. Endesa is clearly the first player in the region. There we will focus on organic growth and efficiencies to reaffirm our current leadership. Endesa has already a significant generation project pipeline, which includes the 317 megawatt coal plant of Bocamina II in Chile which is under construction, which is due to come on-stream at the end of this year; the 400 megawatt El Quimbo hydro plant in Colombia which is also under construction and which is due to come partially on stream by the end of 2014; the 200 megawatt Talara thermal power plant in Peru which is due to come on stream sometime mid-2013. And also, the pipeline includes a number of other mainly hydro major projects which are under development, mentioning the Hydro Ays&#xE9;n project and Los C&#xF3;ndores and Neltume in Chile, also hydro; Curibamba in Peru also a hydro project. Distribution, we'll focus on organic growth where we expect to add close to 900,000 new customers and we'll focus also on operational efficiency by reducing the level of losses.</p>
          <p>Focusing on Brazil, the market contact there will be characterized by a solid increase in demand with an annual growth rate of roughly 5% year-over period and by low dry reserve margin. Distribution will benefit from a strong organic growth. We'll expect to add by 2015 some 900,000 new customers organically. And we will also focus on reduction of network losses over the period by some 0.4%. In generation, we're working to develop a strong project pipeline. And moreover, as I mentioned before, to enhance our development in this attractive high growth market we'll pay close attention to any different opportunities that may arise over there.</p>
          <p>Let's focusing now &#x2013; let's now focus on Argentina where the market contact is also characterized by an increasing demand and by reduction in dry reserve margin. Endesa is the market leader there with a market share in generation of 22% and distribution 20%. In distribution, we expect to add over the period something more than 100,000 new customers organically and reduce our network losses by 0.5%. With regards to regulation in Argentina, let me remark that during 2010 some improvements have been implemented in generation and in particular the high &#x2013; higher capacity payments and higher O&amp;M remuneration for thermal power plants. We are presently working in generation in Argentina on a so-called <mark type="indiscernible" /> scheme in our thermal power plant of Costanera, which will enable significant plant availability improvements. In distribution, we need to optimize investments to increase quality of services and keep on working towards tariff increase.</p>
          <p>Finally, our overall target for Endesa &#x2013; will finish my presentation by giving you an overview of the investment and EBITDA guidance figures. The investment plan has been tailored to presently expect a demand increase and will be characterized by flexibility to potential changes in market conditions. We have set our investments for the next five years at the level of &#x20AC;10.3 billion with the following breakdown; from a geographical point of view 54% of these investments will be in Iberia and 46% in Latin America. From a destination point of view, Endesa will invest 36% of the investment program in expansion and the remaining 64% will be assigned to maintenance CapEx. With regard to EBITDA guidance, Endesa EBITDA will grow to &#x20AC;8.1 billion in 2013 and &#x20AC;8.2 billion in 2015, with an increasing contribution from regulated business.</p>
          <p>Now, I shall hand it over to Francesco Starace.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrea. Before we get into the details of our 2011-'15 plan, I would like to highlight that after a very good 2009, 2010 showed also a solid growth in the renewable industry despite a continuing challenging environment. The results we have shown for 2010 confirmed the full achievement of all our targets. We're in line with the development that we had announced at the time of our listing and also have laid the foundation for a very robust 2011. We have further more addressed a considerable portion of 2010/2014 development targets. This is paving the way for a new plan that I am going to illustrate in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>First, let me substantiate on the industry scenario. In 2010, renewable energy added about 84 gigawatts of capacity growing worldwide in all technologies with an investment worth of about &#x20AC;180 billion. Such continued growth illustrates very well the solidity of the industry. This is even the more so in developing countries where renewable growth is associated to economic development and not just to environmental compliance. Growth is recorded in all technologies and in all geographies, and this is increasingly a new theme, a new pattern in the renewable energy development worldwide.</p>
          <p>Now a quick recap on where we stand in terms of execution of additional capacities. In 2010, we have added 904 megawatts through the acquisition of ECyR. We have installed additionally 392 megawatts organically from &#x2013; this has brought us to an overall installed base of 6.1 gigawatts. We have entered 2011, so this year, with 1.5 gigawatts of projects in execution, of which approximately 800 megawatts will be delivered within this year. The organic growth delivered in 2010 plus the projects in execution have addressed more than half of our 3.5 gigawatts growth target of during the first year of the plan. This leaves us only 1.6 gigawatts residual capacity to be added in the next years.</p>
          <p>At the end of December, our pipeline had 29.2 gigawatts across different geographies and technologies. I want to underline that this pipeline includes a net pipeline of 8.4 gigawatts up to 2015 and more interestingly 2.9 gigawatts highly confident projects. This has allowed us to develop and accelerated plan, and you will see clearly this in the following charts. The new plan foresees an overall increase in CapEx of &#x20AC;1.2 billion. This increase is coupled with a rebalancing. By technology, we will have more hydro, more geothermal and more solar renewable energy where Enel Green Power can leverage on our unique skills. On geography, we will factor in the higher development rates in areas like rest of Europe and Latin America, and the relative maturity of some European markets. We have been able to do all this, thanks to our capability to allocate investment in a very flexible and return-oriented way and leveraging on our geographical diversification and the presence in four different technologies. At the same time, of course we will continue to manage OpEx in the planned performance optimization programs that will make sure that the planned growth will be coupled with the strict operational discipline.</p>
          <p>Let's see how this growth is now articulated. Today we are announcing a 2011-2015 plan with investments at &#x20AC;6.4 billion. In terms of geographies, we have less Italy and less Spain. Specifically, in Spain, we will focus only on the projects included in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> since there is so far no visibility beyond 2013. In Italy, we will invest in those projects, which based on their fundamentals, that is the availability of resource, will be able to meet the strict investment criteria also in worst case scenarios. On the opposite, we have increased our CapEx allocation in rest of Europe and Latin America, where we reiterate a very positive view. Honestly, in fact renewable demand in this area relies on abundance of resources and stems from an overall rising need of energy at an affordable cost rather than from pure environmental compliance criteria. We are convinced that this is very sound and very sustainable development pattern that will be rapidly adopted in many different areas of the world. Finally, we confirm our previous plan in North America with a minor rebalancing on the technology. We maintain a really prudent and realistic approach to the U.S. market that is today confirmed by the current priorities of the U.S. Administration.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the articulation of this growth in thermal technology. The new plant relies less on wind, fostering our move to technology approach also for growth, more specifically on hydro. On hydro, we will add new megawatts investing in Central Latin America. On geo, we will almost double our previous growth targets, leveraging on resources discovered in North America and Latin America. In wind, we have re-qualified our investment program, reducing its contribution to growth without jeopardizing its share in overall production. This is resulting &#x2013; is the result of a larger focus on higher wind capacity areas. In solar, we have strengthened our CapEx. This is built around our strategic position along the entire value chain, from manufacturing to retail PV business. In terms of manufacturing, we confirm the <mark type="indiscernible" /> factory. This is the joint venture with Sharp and STMicroelectronics. This will deliver its first megawatts in production in the market by the end of 2011 with a throughput capacity which will start with 160 megawatt per year.</p>
          <p>This &#x2013; and with respect to the IPP business, we target all the relevant markets in our footprint, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Italy, Rest of Europe and also North America, through in-house development and through our joint venture with Sharp, ESSE, with a clear assignment of the areas between the two development vehicles. Last but not least, we are very focused on the very good performance of <mark type="ph" /> NLC. We expect Italy to be one of the first markets to reach repaying green parity in the world. We do all this while keeping an eye on our distinctive operating KPIs, which you see in this chart. The load factor will continue to be one of the highest in the industry. This is thanks to our diversified mix.</p>
          <p>The average revenue from energies is based on a prudent &#x2013; is growing at a prudent 3% compound annual growth rate. We expect dependence on incentives to remain stable and also one of the lowest in the industry. Finally, the operational efficiency measured as a total OpEx per megawatt will decrease at a 3% compound annual growth rate, thanks to the OpEx plant performance optimization program, which will bring our cost of megawatt hour at approximately &#x20AC;23.2.</p>
          <p>Just a little summary of the targets; we invest &#x20AC;6.4 billion between 2011 and 2015, which is an increase of 23% versus the previous plan. We will reach 10.4 gigawatts installed base in 2015. That is an increase of 70% of the 2010 installed capacity. All this translates into a &#x20AC;2 billion EBITDA in 2013, &#x20AC;2.4 billion in 2015. This data demonstrates the robustness of this strategic approach, multi-technology and multi-geography. We are capturing the additional growth opportunities that the market offers at interesting IRR perspectives in a very complex transition which the renewable energy is undergoing at this very moment. This is maximizing the return of our shareholders. They will continue to enjoy a dividend policy based on a minimum 30% payout.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Francesco. Let me finish, let me conclude. It's long and a hopefully complete presentation that we give you. There are some with final remarks on the last chart. Strong performance; strong performance in 2010 combined with strategic advantages I think is demonstrating the group's potential for growth and for additional beneficial results to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we have significantly upgraded our forecast for 2011 to reflect the progress that we have achieved in the last 12 months. Of course, we're targeting EBITDA of &#x20AC;17.4 billion for this year after disposals and up to &#x20AC;20 billion in 2015. Ordinary net income as well is anticipated to grow by about 7% per annum rising to about &#x20AC;6 billion in 2015, with &#x2013; and 60% payout policy, this demonstrating that we're indeed delivering increasing dividends and returns to our shareholders. Financial stability underpins the strategy, and over the coming years will enhance the flexibility of the group. As you can see, our targeted net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio will decrease to 1.8 times by 2015.</p>
          <p>We're confident and excited about Enel's future. As already said last year, at Enel we're used to a track record which performs better than targets. I think the best way to conclude this presentation is to reconfirm our strong commitment of continuing to pursue our strategy with focus and determination.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much for your attention, and we're now happy to take questions from you.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As usual, we will be starting collecting question here in this room from all of you, and I remind that we have also a huge number of people connected by our website. So we will be able to collect question also from them, if any. So we can start from here, questions.</p>
          <p>Yes, Alberto Gandolfi here. Can you please stand up Alberto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. It's Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. I have three questions, please. The first one is on your perimeter, and you have hinted about integration. But could you elaborate a little bit more on a five-year view, what's on your mind, particularly when it comes to Endesa and LatAm? It seems that these areas are the most under-geared parts of your business and where &#x2013; particularly LatAm, you have most of the growth opportunities. So why not integrating more and lower the minorities over there, and what are you thinking in this sense?</p>
          <p>The other two questions, a little bit more smaller picture. First of all, you present a net ordinary income of &#x20AC;4.4 billion for 2010. If I am not mistaken, are you adjusting for all the restructuring one-off costs in Endesa, which were almost &#x20AC;400 million in 2010? What are you doing with impairment in Ireland? What I am trying to get to, it seems that for 2010 your earnings power is already much higher than &#x20AC;4.4 billion. So I am trying to assess the earnings risk for your 2013 targets and beyond. And the last question is, could you kindly tell us, in 2013 and '15, what is the percentage of EBITDA coming from Italian power generation? Again, here, just trying to see the power price risk in Italy. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alberto. On the first question &#x2013; then I'll ask the colleagues to answer your more detailed questions, two and three. On the first question to us, no doubt that we are working on the further simplification of our strategy in Latin America, slowly progressing on that. We'll continue to do that on a regular basis. We are not in a hurry. As you've seen, we are, in the presence of &#x2013; well, performing companies and therefore we will be continuing to slowly &#x2013; progressively trying to increase the rapidity of the cash flow, dividends flow back into Endesa and finally into Enel. And it's one of top priorities that we will be working on. I think this concept of being under-geared is something that should be &#x2013; we should be aware and you are aware that in the consolidated numbers for the Spanish companies, we also have Enel Energy Europe on top, is sitting on &#x20AC;18 billion of debt financing. So, when I see it, the way I see it, it's not under-geared, it's well geared and obviously have enough ammunition in terms of cash flow for fostering additional growth, as Andrea has explained to you.</p>
          <p>Now on the second question, <mark type="indiscernible" /> will answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second question regarding the net ordinary income, the reconciliation versus the net income reported. In 2010, we have considered as one-off item, there's the capital gain that we have recorded coming from the sales of the high voltage grid and the gas distribution business at Enel consolidated level. We are talking about &#x20AC;80 million, something like that in total, versus a reduction in value of the &#x2013; our investment in Ireland, the region of 100 million plus.</p>
          <p>So the net ordinary income is simply the result of these two items, the just net result of capital gain and investment reduction in value. There are no items regarding the accrual, which are parts of the EBITDA. Therefore, of course, we have accrued, as I said during the presentation, for instance, when it comes to Spain or when it comes to Italy, all the value necessary to support the efficiency program and to support some regulatory items, the impact on 2012-'13, for instance, the energy efficiency that will be charged in Endesa by the regulators. So those items are already in the numbers, but at the EBITDA level and not at the net ordinary income level.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the level of EBITDA of Generation Energy Management, the value during the plan is between &#x20AC;2.1 billion, &#x20AC;2.3 billion. In percentage, we move from, say, 12%, 13% on a total group EBITDA of 2013, down to something very close to 10%. So at the end of the plan, we are projecting &#x20AC;2.2 billion EBITDA in Generation Energy Management versus &#x20AC;20 billion Group EBITDA. So in the end we are talking about something very close to 10%.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning. It's <mark type="ph" /> Chris Moore from Hammer Partners. I have two questions, please. There's a lot of CapEx going on, a lot of business &#x2013; lot of new information this morning. I think you have &#x20AC;98 billion of capital employed today.. Can you give us a feel for what that figure would look like at the end of the plan, 2015, how does that break down between Italy, Iberia, National LatAm durables? That's the first question. Second question is, I think &#x2013; Mr. Conti, I think, your mandate is due to end fairly shortly. I think it's fair to say that Enel who has changed radically under your last term. Can you give us any first thoughts if your mandate is renewed, as to what unfinished business you see at the group and what changes you'd like to see within that framework? Thank you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question, <mark type="ph" /> Chris, but I must admit I must have failed in setting out a plan if you're still asking what lies beyond today. What we have presented to you in terms of drivers and key priorities are going to be the mission to complete and fulfill for the next mandates, whoever comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> or whatever. The decision who is going to run the company depends on the shareholders. I'm not going to elaborate on that.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the capital employed, of course, we're investing. We're investing because we're seeking growth, we're seeking to grow our &#x20AC;17 billion of EBITDA, &#x20AC;17.5 billion to over &#x20AC;20 billion, and all of this growth is posted by organic growth. So consolidating our presence in markets where we are already today leader, and we leverage on that with capacity. Of course, we also depreciate and amortize our investments. So the overall capital employed together with the cash flow generation and the dividend flows coming from this will continue to sound like we have been proven to you over the last five years, a company that is able to deliver growth while maintaining financial stability and while delivering good results to our shareholders, it will not be different five years from now.</p>

          <p>Good morning. This is <mark type="ph" /> Manuel Geoffpat, Morgan Staley, with a question really focused on CapEx, please. When you look at your budget to 2013, 2015, how much of that CapEx figure is identified project-by-project, how much is still discretionary, i.e., indicated to CapEx, but it's a generic CapEx. And the question really is how much is fully committed CapEx that you've signed off and how much you still need to give management green light? Secondly, when we look out to 2013, 2015, how much of CapEx will stand on your balance sheet, but the assets will still be in the process of being beyond i.e. not contributing to EBITDA, how much power would you still have at that point? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's an interesting question. Of course, each year you're raising the same question, how flexible we are on CapEx and this is one of the major factor that we monitor. Flexibility stands on a point, what you have at the moment up and running in terms of expansion, in terms of the government, in terms of the engineering. You can't stop it. It doesn't make any sense to stop it. And there are several projects that we cannot stop, which will make no sense to stop it, because they are providing additional growth path to us.</p>
          <p>Then there are projects that you have to start. There are projects that we have here, must for Italy, Iberia, LatAm that can be started, or in Russia whatever &#x2013; can be started and it will be started depending on the conditions of the market, or it can be slowed down if the market conditions are not there or it can effectively cancel it whatever threatening menace one might present. These are the swinging factors. We &#x2013; you can estimate the swinging factor on this CapEx programs to be in excess of &#x20AC;3 billion to &#x20AC;4 billion that you can play with.</p>
          <p>Our assumption here is that we're facing a period without a notion on what is happening in Japan today actually, but we're facing a period of slow recovery of the economies. So <mark type="indiscernible" /> we're taking on the growth of the demand of the power, electricity and gas. Therefore we have to accompany that with CapEx, it makes make sense. It's our blood for future body circulation. But the swinging factor is &#x20AC;3 billion, &#x20AC;4 billion and the name of the projects are identified one-by-one, believe me.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, this is Javier Suarez of Unicredit. Three questions, the first one is a big picture one is, I would like to know Mr. Conti's opinion about what has changed after the tragedy in Japan on the global energy market. How do you see government willing to expand new nuclear generation in the next 10 years, the acceleration of renewables, gas prices, commodity prices, global environment, and if you think that what has happened recently in Japan is changing something in your CapEx for the next 10 years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I had difficulties in hearing the second and third question. But when it comes to Japan, let me put it this way. Definitely, you've seen yourself the apocalypse that these poor families and poor people have been passing. Good solid portion of the economy might be suffering from that. On a short term, no doubt, this will have a major blip on the GDP of Japan. We have recently experienced the same even though on a smaller scale, but it was, relatively speaking, very hard to tackle in Chile, for instance, a major disruption in Chile. They were able to overcome that very rapidly and economy picked up again.</p>
          <p>Japan, after the same quality of organization and people's ability to overcome difficulties that have been proven in the past and I am pretty sure that they will be able to overcome this very severe tragic event that they have been passing through.</p>
          <p>In terms of energy impact, in terms of CapEx, we will not change our CapEx definitely. My assumption, this is my personal assumption, I might be wrong, but definitely the paradox of this situation in Japan and their need to stop their nuclear activities to check on all this platform of nuclear plants, would definitely increase demand for commodities such as LNG, such as gas, such as coal.</p>
          <p>They will need additional commodities to overcome the need for more power. So while we'll have a short-term dip on their overall economy because they will have to stop production, on the other hand, you will see a surge in demand of the major commodities in a very short term. Midterm, there are many months, years, possibly months, you will see a recovery in that situation. When it comes to our business here in &#x2013; from Eastern Europe down to South America, I will not see a major impact on our plans and our programs, and we will continue to develop the presented CapEx program that we have filed with you this morning.</p>
          <p>I'm sorry your voice is echoing, sound very -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me now? I have a second question which is company specific, I think that when compared with a previous CapEx plan that the company presented a year ago, we have seen an increase of CapEx of &#x20AC;3 billion, that is roughly speaking plus &#x20AC;1 billion in 2012, '13, and '14. Can you explain us the reason why you're increasing CapEx, in which areas, and in which countries? And what does your company is different from other companies because the trend that we see in your competitors is general decrease in dividend and a gloomy outlook for the next few years, what does your company different from other European players? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may be a little bit more specific, if we compare the current business plan versus the previous one, there is a difference of &#x20AC;1 billion &#x2013; &#x20AC;1.1 billion. &#x20AC;500 million, &#x20AC;600 million of this is referred to a fewer accountancy issue which regards the capitalization of the interest charges to the single project. This is something that you see deployed during the plan. The remaining portion is basically coming from the increase in CapEx in the renewable business that you've seen before.</p>
          <p>With regards to the projects inside the current business plan, they are basically the same, as we have seen last year. So it's just a matter of different timing, but we have not changed any or added any specific project. It's in line with the previous plan, the only major difference is belonging to the renewables and to this accountancy issue.</p>

          <p>On the third question &#x2013; on the third question, I thought you should have been telling me, you are the analyst; I'm focused on working on my own company. So I will be looking for a reading from you what you consider to be the difference. But let me tell you right from here, the difference you said over here is our people, our focus, our geographical mix, our let me say, technological mix, and the ability to promote efficiencies, cost savings, programs, and we've done this ahead of time. We've done this when the boom was available to everybody. We started cutting cost, started being more efficient, started being more innovative ahead of time, and I think we are reaping the benefits today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. <mark type="indiscernible" /> Can you hear me? Okay, before going on to the room, there are couple of questions coming from the website. A lot of people is asking about full-year 2010 EBITDA, if you can give more granularity on the part, on the portion of this EBITDA which is generated by our nuclear activities? And second, there is another interesting question related to the post 2012 CO2 scenarios, and if &#x2013; an overview of this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question is about the nuclear components, I think you will be in the region of &#x20AC;0.9 billion together, ranging from the Spanish, Slovakia and further contribution of income benefits from the marketing of the small components of the French nuclear where we participate. So it's sizable, &#x20AC;900 million, that's important. It's not decisive. It's not the one that might create us problem. And we don't anticipate as a matter of fact, that this might suffer for any problem in the future. When it comes to the CO2, you guys you want to answer it. <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to CO2, of course, we are &#x2013; it has been planned according to the presently known, let's say rules, which is that after 2012, there will be no national plan allocation of CO2 rights for free. But until that point, that is in 2011 and 2012, we have national allocation of approximately 17 million tons and you probably know that we are using not all of that. We are using in the range of 12 million tons to 15 million tons, so &#x2013; or 4.5 million tons to something that together with unified central unit at Enel, we have a strategy to make the most out of that. In addition to that also we &#x2013; in Endesa, there is a large pipeline of, let's say, <mark type="ph" /> NDL projects, also now fully, let's say, coordinated at the level of Enel Group &#x2013; of Enel Group to maximize the efficiency of all that.</p>
          <p>And we believe that out of all the projects, which we have over there, we have something between 60 million to 65 million, let's say, tons of projects, which will actually materialize, these projects can be used up to the level of 42% even before 2012 or after 2012. That's part which has not been used to fulfill the 42%. And for the rest can be sold to other sectors. And so, we have planned to use a large part of this in the year 2013 to make up for the fact that the national allocation will not be there anymore, but we have a certain freedom and then depending on the market conditions this will be actually used.</p>

          <p>Let me ask Luigi to give you a consolidated answer to all of the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Where do we stand at a group level including Endesa and Enel, of course. So when it comes to our position in 2013, we can say that we are substantially covered through the certificates that we are developing and the <mark type="ph" /> airways that we have built.</p>
          <p>If we go beyond in 2014 and '15, of course assuming reallocation, we have included a factor in our numbers in assumption of CO2 cost in the region of &#x20AC;23, &#x20AC;25 per ton or if you want something very close to &#x20AC;19 per megawatt hour. And we have assumed to incorporate that into our final price to the final customer as a sort of pass-through. So we are not assuming to make any <mark type="ph" /> mining date, but we are assuming to charge or to translate this charge to the final customer. This is beyond or starting from 2014, up to that date we are fully covered in terms of certificates and portfolio of <mark type="ph" /> of airways.</p>

          <p>Roberto Letizia from Equita SIM. One question on the working capital because it seems that one of the major driver for the debt improvement has been the capital &#x2013; the working capital recovery, so if you can share with us your assumption or what the level of working capital that you assume during the strategy plans in terms of working capital on sales, for example. Then what is the expected contribution to the EBITDA from the nuclear at Mochovce 3 and 4, please if you can share these numbers with us? And again few numbers, few questions on the nuclear, but you have a strong increase in the load factor expectation for the nuclear as projected. So what's the CapEx associated with that?</p>
          <p>And finally, on the nuclear that general &#x2013; I'm sorry, sir; if I go back with a more specific question, but do you see any risk to see additional CapEx required on the security standards from the nuclear for what happened in Japan, or if there is anything that can be done on the nuclear to improve security standards that are already very high? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Well, the colleagues will answer the specific question, and let me take your last remarks on the safety standards. Of course, it is good practice and it's also a mandatory requirement to exchange information about the level of accidents that are occurring in any single plant in the world. And today, we see the accident happening in Japan being developed before our very eyes, and it's difficult to jump to conclusion right now. We have to give all our colleagues working on this a moment to avert a major problem in the Fukushima plant before we can draw conclusion.</p>
          <p>My only remark is that, in Japan there are 52 reactors, 51 are shut down <mark type="ph" /> as climate very well, one unfortunately because of the tsunami was subject to major difficulties that are being tendered by our colleagues of TEPCO. The result of all of these efforts will be translated into analysis and will be considered by the remaining authorities, the World Association, the European Regulatory, and by our engineers, of course.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the &#x2013; to our current ability of running our shop and definitely we are observing that we have all of the active and passive requirements that are meant to be available for any emergency case. As you know, besides before this event and considering Chernobyl as a matter of fact, all the nuclear reactors have been working for 14,000 years consecutive functioning without major results &#x2013; major disruption. So we have to wait. We have to analyze definitely. I don't anticipate it for the time being any specific incremental capital requirements because we think we have a solid and a reliable and guaranteed system of protection for our plants. You want to add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, there was a question in terms of what were the investment  order as an element to increase availability of the power plants. As a matter of fact that was a program which was started back in 2009. Investments are only a part because also we have been reviewing the business processes injecting new &#x2013; hiring new and training new people. But anyway, the investment in 2010 overall for the portion of the property of the ownership belongs to Endesa have been of the order of &#x20AC;160 million. For this year, the plan is of around &#x20AC;175 million overall and then it will oscillate between &#x20AC;160 million and &#x20AC;170 million approximately over the period.</p>

          <p>Yes. Well, the uptime before the starting of &#x2013; the year before the starting of this plant was below 75%. At the end of 2010, it has been 89%, but we have to take into account that it has been one year of very low recharge down time. And therefore this year we &#x2013; where we have a number actually, we have recharges in all our plants. In Spain, we expect to have 85% approximately of availability towards over 90% at the end of the period.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. I think you're right. At the end of 2010, we've made major efforts to reduce our working capital through some specific action. And by the way we have reduced the net working capital more than &#x20AC;1.7 billion. Now we expect for the future to be able to maintain the current level of net working capital. Therefore, this means that we're going to work in order to maintain at the current level of all the day of sales <mark type="ph" /> standing, all the items that we've worked on. So we do not expect further improvement, but we think we're already in line.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the EBITDA contribution of Mochovce 3 and 4, once it's in operation,  the assumption that we have in the plan is that Mochovce 3 and 4 is going to contribute for more than &#x20AC;200 million of EBITDA or to our Group EBITDA.</p>

          <p>Barclays Capital. Just a couple of questions. First of all, if you can elaborate more on your expectation on the new regulatory framework for Enel Distribuzione? And also more in the long run on the gas market, do you see any challenge on the current dynamics of the gas market and the national oil linked price that you discussed at the beginning of the presentation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the distribution, and already here we have the engineer Giulio who can pick up any remaining curiosity, we don't see major difficulties in maintaining a solidity of our regulation system we have enjoyed over the last 12 years. There is a new agency for the energy and gas that will obviously have to familiarize with the regulations probably &#x2013; is in existence, but we don't suspect. We have no reason to believe that there will be major changes to the structure of the regulation, which will have benefited the final consumer. I wish to remind you that in the period of the last ten years, our Distribuzione in Italy has been able to reduce the costs significantly of distribution by the tune of about 30%, which will be transferred over to the final consumer in terms of lower component of the distribution tariff to benefit all the clients. And there is no reason why they have to change of such an active and working infrastructural system of tariff settings.</p>
          <p>For gas, it's the question, it has been before this tragic event in Japan was the most favorite question, what's going to happen to  the gas market in Italy? It's the structure of the business that today we see for many different reasons including the recent events in North Africa that we continue to believe what we have presented to you this morning, Susanna, that the thermal utilization which is one of the largest utilization factor of the gas, we will continue to see long-term gas contracts functioning with coupled to the oil as a base. There are no other major infrastructures available to use different sourcing and the spot gas price, even though it's been as we've seen it lower, influenced by additional capacity of LNG available around the Atlantic Basin is not reaching our shores because there is no facility beyond the 8 billion cubic meters of Porto Empedocle.</p>
          <p>And again, the other point I'd like to make, anybody willing to invest, as we've seen 30 gigawatts of new capacity in combined cycle plant that's been built in Italy, anyone willing to invest in a combined cycle plant, who is willing to bet on the spot market price to support his investment would be a bit of an adventurer. So this will continue to be the case and you need long time contracts, you need steady system of supplies to guarantee the functioning of a combined cycle plant. And what we see today is a continuation of that policy. So, again, combined cycle, long-term gas contract coupled to oil, indexed to oil will continue to be a factor for the Italian market in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Anna Maria Scaglia from Credit Suisse. A few questions if I may. The first one to Enel Green Power, I'd like to understand and if you can provide us visibility on the CapEx increases. I see you have a quite significant capacity addition in solar. We have seen returns being cut in lots of geographies. Can you please help us to understand where this capacity is coming from and maybe the same on hydro and geothermal?</p>
          <p>For Endesa, can you please confirm that the increase in EBITDA you expect from Latin America relative to the previous plan is not connected to ForEx? And maybe if you can give us some visibility between distribution and generation in Spain in the long term, and if you can confirm then the fracing practice around &#x20AC;400 million, so the number of Endesa plan will be some &#x20AC;400 million lower than the plan presented by Enel. And finally, on margins in Italy, are you keeping the same assumptions and before in terms of generation margins and can you share them with us? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I believe these are questions for my colleagues, so I can &#x2013; perhaps,  Francesco, can you start with renewables?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Truly there is a reconsideration of entities that own  solar in all the world not only in Italy. Our solar plan has growth, which has to do with a part of the joint venture which we have with Sharp which is called ESSE. This joint venture as a target has Europe, Middle East and Africa. Most of the growth of this joint venture happens outside of Italy, namely in markets that are Europe and Africa at this time. There is very little in the Middle East within the horizon of the plan. In Italy alone, we have about 140 megawatts of installed capacity in this new plant of which 60 are already under construction, so they will not be affected by any change in the regulatory evolution that we foresee.</p>
          <p>The others are already planned assuming strong cuts in the subsidies that are at this time and the discussion, which we have assumed in the plan to be in the range of those cuts that happen in Germany. This is &#x2013; at this point the situation. I think there was a part of the question on geothermal energy, if I don't recall wrongly. We have doubled the CapEx associated with geothermal energy, thanks to the fact that we have confirm resources in Chile and North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, concerning Latin America, yes, there is a contribution, let's say, from ForEx if you compare the plan of last year and the plan of this year, I would say that per year the difference between the two plans is in favor of this plan of about something like &#x20AC;300 million. So there is a contribution there. Concerning distribution there is overall an increase in distribution, let's say, percentage within the EBITDA, which is both in Spain and in Latin America. And overall this goes, let's say, from a 48% of overall EBITDA in 2010 to something like 55% in 2015, I believe, similarly in both divisions.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes, sure. Well, in terms of EBITDA, we've said before, we see an EBITDA in the region of between &#x20AC;2.2 billion to &#x20AC;2.1 billion. If we look at the spot spread that we're assuming in this projection, we are in the region of &#x20AC;14, &#x20AC;15 per megawatt hour.</p>

          <p>Yes, one single question. Looking at your projections, you're looking for &#x20AC;9 billion of free cash flow generation in the next five years. I know that it is too early, but do you think in the next two to three years, where would be your preferred usage of that cash flow? <mark type="indiscernible" /> what to do with the &#x20AC;9 billion? Will you go for incremental growth in Enel Green Power? Will you go for incremental dividend distribution? Or you simply feel that you need to cut net debt to the extent that you're showing in your plan to 1.8 times net-debt-to-EBITDA? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I generally appreciate your question. I sincerely appreciate, you raised the point that we have been under gear. We've been on gear. We have been rumor to be ended &#x2013; going under gearing again. We never beat the fashion of you guys looking at the way we run our city place, our strategies and deliver fundamentals, which is my main concern. The &#x20AC;9 billion would be, of course, a nice problem to have. We have some debt to repay and we also have opportunities. The pendulum will swing from one to the next depending on which is best for our long-term strategy. So, we will be tackling that problem as an opportunity when it will be achieved.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a lot of changes in the regulation, especially in Italy, when we discussed about the returns on the renewables in the past meetings, you mentioned something in the region of an IRR of 10% &#x2013; 10.5%, I remember this number, but considering what is happening and the changes, can you explain me why the renewable preceding incentive should earn anything more than what any other regulated segment does in terms of maybe not more than 1% or 2% premium above <mark type="ph" /> wac. So I am wondering whether you are still assuming internal rate of return projects, I mean some levered returns is still 10.5% on the asset that gets incentives, or you are reducing that expectation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, these two gentlemen on my right may give you the detailed answer to that. But let me give you my personal comment on this situation. Of course, most of the current renewables technologies, they are at development stage, will need support of some incentives for them to be invested. Now what I think is something that we should be focusing on as the industry that &#x2013; most of all as regulators and governments, is whether each country in Europe should go on its own, instigating packages on incentives as opposed to seeking the best resorts available, and go quicker into get grid parity through technological development and best utilization of resources. This is a question open for me to be debated in Europe, it's a specific question.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the actual investment, of course, if you have governments giving you incentives which are juicy for the investors, who <mark type="indiscernible" /> invest and contribute with their investment to the developmental technologies. And that's what we are seeking now in most of the photovoltaic development for instance. We are investing. We are investing &#x2013; and Francesco has mentioned to you in a new factory to generate advanced state-of-the-art photovoltaic panels, and of course, we are supporting that development. And we do expect to earn a lot of profits out of this. Doesn't mean that we have to think about Germany as being the heralding champion of photovoltaic versus other countries, the question is should we pursue a European policy to favor the usage of the best resource available as opposed to allow each country to use their own incentives and having customers paying the bills at the end. That's the question remaining.</p>
          <p>Now on the detailed question of the <mark type="ph" /> wac and returns, Francesco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the sustainability of having returns in excess of 10%, 11%, 12% on the long term with or without incentive, the debate is open. Our view is this; incentives are a transient for certain technologies. They should follow quickly the curve of cost improvements that the industry is able to deliver. If the industry is unable to deliver, they should be cut and the industry should move elsewhere. This is what is happening on wind industry and in the world; parts of the world today develop wind without recurring to incentivation, thanks to a combination of good cost cutting from the industry standpoint, excellent wind conditions, need for energy. This is a very sustainable combination. This is where we focus. This yields a 10%, 11% return without relying on incentives.</p>
          <p>Other parts of the world push different technologies and have to recur  to incentivation for that, solar is a part of that. We've seen incentives been cut, and growth continue, which is a proof that cost cutting is going at the same pace at least. Overall, we believe 10 years from now, five years from now, we will cover the here discussing incentivation on marine technology, and wave technology, on current technology and no more on solar and wind. It's just a transit; overall we are not in the search for incentives, we're trying to find the space for growth, where incentives are not needed. This is more sustainable, and it's a proof that we can give a 10%, 11% return in those conditions, and that space is very, very large.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, any other &#x2013; maybe one final question if any. So the last one.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> This is Miriam Heir from Royal Bank of Canada; two questions. One Mr. Conti, you mentioned your credit rating at the start of the presentation. Can you confirm that the Group is still targeting a strong single A rating, or indeed if you plan to upgrade that target given your plan's reduction in average?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you did have a year-end 2011 net debt target of &#x20AC;41 billion, I believe, from your new leverage targets, it would imply net debt at year end 2011 of &#x20AC;43.5 billion. Perhaps, if you could confirm, if this is merely a ForEx difference, or if there is another reason behind it, we would appreciate the color? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I do confirm to you that it's one of our pillar, one of our strategic fundamental priority to maintain a single A rating. And even in answering the previous question that was raised by Javier Garrido about the potential de-leveraging or under gearing of our company, we would seek, of course, whatever we would decide at that time to maintain single A rating parameters, and that's the reason why we're meeting with Agency on a regular basis to prove the point that we are adamant on maintaining that single A rating.</p>
          <p>And that will be applicable to all of our year-end targets throughout here and till 2015. So even the one for 2011, 2012, 2013 will have to be built on the basis of we achieving that result and for achieving that result means not only having a certain ratios on net debt to EBITDA, but also free funds on total debt, free funds from our interest coverage, all of these parameters will need to be complied. This is the essential target we focus on. Then the individual numbers, what is &#x20AC;41 billion, &#x20AC;42 billion, &#x20AC;43 billion, it doesn't apply of course, but it's not the key element or factor of decision to maintain single-A rating.</p>
          <p>Am I answering to your question? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Okay. Before concluding, let me say that our next initiatives review will be on top of the quarterly results for 2011. We will be announcing soon the dates of two Investor Days, one dedicated to Enel Green Power, which will be held in Rome and another one dedicated to Endesa, which will be held in Madrid. We will be giving you the dates very soon and in the meantime please refer to the Investor Relations office for any further inquiries. Thank you very much.</p>
