      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="ph" /> Matthew (00:39). Good morning everybody. Happy to be with you this morning to discuss the AXA 2011 earnings, which are robust in an environment which has been quite difficult.</p>
          <p>Why do I think that the earnings are robust and showing the resilience of the business model in an environment which has not been particularly favorable to say the least? Well first, underlying earnings are progressing even if it's modestly, they are progressing moving to &#x20AC;3.9 billion. If you look at where they come from, you then see first, diversification of the business model, which is something which is strengthening the group.</p>
          <p>Second, the fact that these earnings are progressing in two of the key areas of the group businesses, property casualty, where clearly we had a very good 2011 very much in line or slightly ahead of the Ambition AXA goals. Second, in the Protection &amp; Health segment of the business, where earnings are up 8%. The place where the business has been more challenging in 2011 is the savings and asset management portion of the business. We all know what the volatility has been in the market, what the decline in long-term interest rates has been, what the evolution of the equity markets has been. There, earnings are contracting, but we think that we have there also solid business model.</p>
          <p>The other elements I would like to highlight are the fact that operating cash flows are up significantly. They are up 14%. It's one of the points you and us have been looking at very, very closely. It reflects, I think, the soundness of the model. This &#x20AC;4.2 billion, they are too very much in line or slightly ahead of what we were expecting within Ambition AXA.</p>
          <p>Financial strength of the group, I'm not going to insist too much on the Solvency I ratio, even if it is still the current regulatory model, but it's at 188, so very strong and solid position. I'd like to focus more on both the gearing and the Solvency II ratio. The gearing has come down to 26%. It's one of the goals of Ambition AXA to bring it down to 25% in 2015. You see that we are well advanced there. This is the outcome of both the earnings situation and the capital management we have had in 2011.</p>
          <p>Solvency II ratio, clearly, has been affected by the market turbulences, but remains at a very solid level. We were at 148% at the end of last year, has been affected by the decline in interest rates by the enlargement of spreads, but remains at a very significant and solid level way higher than where it was back in 2008. And today, of course, it would be significantly above these levels. So it's something we are comfortable too even if Solvency II is not the current regulatory regime. We think it's the regime of the future. We hope that there is going to be clarity on this regime soon in Europe, and we are very well prepared to operate within it.</p>
          <p>So the resilience of the business model, the very strong operating free cash flows and the solidity of the balance sheet allow us to maintain the dividend at &#x20AC;0.69. It's a payout ratio of 49%. You will remember that we have integrated for years a payout range of 40% to 50%. Usually, we were closer to the low end of the limit at 40%. Adjusted earnings this year, and Denis will speak about it, have been affected by some exceptional elements like the Greek write-down, which leads us to move within the payout range. We are at 49%. The dividend is maintained. It's a dividend yield of 7%. We think this is the right decision in the current circumstances.</p>
          <p>If we look at where are were when compared to our ambitions to what we have said to the market back in June, you will remember what are the three key initiatives within Ambition AXA; selectivity in the mature markets, acceleration in the emerging ones, increased efficiency efforts everywhere. We are delivering on these three pillars. Even if the financial performance has been affected by market conditions, the delivery on operational initiatives is there. And I will say a few words about it.</p>
          <p>I have already mentioned the evolution of the underlying earnings. On a comparable basis, underlying earnings are growing by 4%. It's below the long-term rates we want to see, but we think that given the market circumstances, it's a notable performance. In terms of return on equity, we've been affected this year by some exceptional elements, but we remain targeted on the objective of 15% of 2015. And we think that we will reach it. Operating cash flow, which is a point of attention because we have said we would deliver &#x20AC;24 billion over the period. We think we are well aligned with the long-term goals. And on the debt gearing, I already say that we were very close to the long-term ambition.</p>
          <p>Beyond these numbers, I think it's important to look at the operational initiatives, and I'd like to highlight three of them, which are important: reshaping our Life and Savings business, fostering the P&amp;C profitability, and improving the Assets Management picture. 2011 is a year where we have progressed on all of these three fronts.</p>
          <p>If you look at the segmentation of the Life &amp; Savings business, you will see that we have done what we had said we would do. We are more selective in the generation of the business, in the generation of the revenues. We want to focus on the Health &amp; Protection business. The APEs in this business are growing 13%. Why do we want to focus on these businesses? Because it's a place where the margins, the new business margins are high, the new business value there. The new business value margin there are 47%.</p>
          <p>It's a growing business with high margins. We want to concentrate the Savings business more on unit-linked. There, I would say the performance is mixed, but nevertheless solid in a very difficult year. You know what the performance of the equity market has been. We are satisfied to see that the Unit-linked business was in terms of volumes more or less stable despite the low risk appetite of declines, despite the turbulence of the markets. Because the fact that it's stable means in the Savings business, its proportion in the total of sales is progressing and at a very significant level. It's a business where the margins on the new business are 23%, so a very profitable business. It's good to see it resisting well despite the turbulences.</p>
          <p>The place where the business has been contracting is General Account. Why so? Well, because it's less attractive for the clients, for &#x2013; with the decline in interest rates, it's also less attractive for us because it's a place where the new business margins are negative given the current level of interest rates. So we try to be selective. Therefore, we do not push these businesses. And you see that the overall picture, therefore, in the Life and Savings business, is well aligned with the long-term goals. It's working. The selectivity is working.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C side, 2011 has been a very strong year. We had said that the current year combined ratio would be below 100%. We are even slightly ahead of the plans we had. We had said that the total combined ratio would be below 98. And below last year, it is where it had to be with a reserve situation, which is a very, very strong one. And we are confident that on the P&amp;C side, the efforts we've been doing will continue to bear fruit. And it's a business which is largely independent from the market evolution.</p>
          <p>In Assets Management, it's a more contrasted picture, but nevertheless, we think moving in the right direction, even if the year has been more difficult than what you could have anticipated at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Flows at AXA IM have moved from being negative in 2010, largely affected, or very much affected by the difficult Rosenberg situation, to a situation today where they are at the end of last year, more or less break even. AXA IM had a very good year in term of investment performance in most of its products, a very strong one. And the situation in terms of flows is now much more favorable. More contrasted picture at AllianceBernstein, where even if the flows are less negative than what they were, they are still significantly negative, mostly and Denis will detail that, in the Equity segment of the business. The segments which have been developed in the recent years and fixed income are for themselves positive.</p>
          <p>Beyond the operational initiatives in these three business lines, capital allocation has been an area where we have been pretty active and I would say more active than most of our peers. This capital management has led us to dispose of business for a total value of &#x20AC;4.1 billion this year. And this &#x20AC;4.1 billion have been affected either to acquisitions in high-growth markets, what we have done with the buyout of the minority interests in Asia or smaller operation buying distribution in Turkey, as an example. For a large proportion of the disposals, three quarters of them and one quarter has been affected, one-fourth, has been affected to the deleveraging of the balance sheet, which has enabled us to bring the gearing ratio to 26%.</p>
          <p>If you look at it, was it the right thing to do? Yes, we think it was the right thing to do. You will see on this chart that Asia Life, AXA Japan, is now representing 23% of the group new business value. So a significant proportion of our business. And it's a growing part of our business because there, the business is growing at a double-digit rate. So it's really very well aligned with the long-term plans, reallocating capital in the areas where we have double-digit growth mostly emerging markets, but it can also &#x2013; of course, also be product segments of distributions in the major markets, which are generating high margins and significant growth.</p>
          <p>The high-growth markets are also an area of development on the P&amp;C side. If you look at what our two growth engines there are representing, you have to add the direct business, where we are a very, very strong player on a worldwide basis, and the high growth market P&amp;C exposure. It's representing 20% of the group. So something which now is comparable to what we had, or what we have on the Life side. And there the revenue growth is double-digit, or close to double-digit. Emerging countries have been growing at 16%. The direct business has been growing at 8%. And the direct business is a very solid performer because you have simultaneously a significant growth in revenues and a significant improvement of the profitability. Picture the efforts we've made to develop these businesses over the years are now really bearing fruit.</p>
          <p>One word about the third pillar of the Ambition AXA initiatives, efficiency everywhere. You have there a very simple chart. We have forecasted to save &#x20AC;1.5 billion between now and 2015. &#x20AC;300 million have been achieved in 2011. So we remain with &#x20AC;1.2 billion to save between now and 2015. So you see that these efforts are really well advanced and well documented. Out of these &#x20AC;300 million, &#x20AC;200 million have been achieved by reducing the P&amp;C and Life and Savings administrative costs. And &#x20AC;100 million have been achieved in reducing the acquisition expense ratio on the P&amp;C side. The efforts are working there.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to leave the floor to Denis for a more detailed explanation of the evolution of the profitability in the various business segments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I will now go into the detailed presentation of the earnings before leaving the floor to G&#xE9;rald who will talk to you about the balance sheet. So let's start with the group earnings. The group earnings, as Henri told you, have grown by 2% on a comparable basis. I will not comment this slide in detail and I will comment to the next slide, which shows you a waterfall of what happened in the 2011.</p>
          <p>Starting with the earnings of 2010, we take out the earnings from Canada because, as you know, we sold our Canadian business in September. And the earnings of Canada being a discontinued business in 2011, are reported in the net income. So we start from &#x20AC;3.7 billion restated earnings for 2010 and you see a contrasted picture, as Henri told you. The P&amp;C earnings have grown by 16%, and I will comment later in detail. And asset management earnings have grown by 20%, whereas on the Life side, we have the combination of the change in scope with the sale of the Australian business and the sale of the UK Life business on one hand. And also, a negative impact coming from the U.S. GMxB technical margin, which is a topic that will be commented later as well.</p>
          <p>Moving to the adjusted earnings. Our adjusted earnings went down 15% to &#x20AC;3.6 billion. And this is really a function of the net realized capital losses that we incurred in 2011 of &#x20AC;312 million against the gain last year of &#x20AC;400 million. And here we had both impairments on the equity side, the biggest one being on participation of 4% in the Monte Paschi Bank and a significant impairment on the fixed income side, mostly related to Greece where we marked down our Greek exposure to 22% of par and its impairment of &#x20AC;387 million. So those are the main impacts on the adjusted earnings.</p>
          <p>Now the net income picture is also a contrasted one. Net income increased by 49%, which is a very good results, but it's really two different stories here. The first one is a significant goodwill impairment on the U.S. And let me pause on this one and give you more explanation. As you know, since 2008, the U.S. business has been a source of concern to us and to you. We were overexposed to the variable annuities. We made a significant loss in 2008 and that has strengthened our capital by $3 billion. Since then as you know, ahead of the markets, we have significantly de-risked our variable annuities, improved our hedging, and diversified our product portfolio.</p>
          <p>Whilst this diversification has been successful, 2011 was another bad year for our U.S. business, with hedging losses that where half of what we incurred in 2008, but still too high. With the fall in U.S. long-term interest rates as well as a reduction in lapses in variable annuities with living or death benefits, we have concluded that the reduction of our U.S. life goodwill was necessary. We have impaired 37% of the goodwill or &#x20AC;943 million, which roughly corresponds to the Accumulator product line. As our lapses on VAs were coming down, we've also brought our lapse assumptions in line with our current experience. In doing all of this, we believe that we are making the right decisions and positioning the business for the future. Mark will tell you more about our plans for the U.S. business later.</p>
          <p>So that's the negative. On the positive side, we have the capital gains made on our Australian and New Zealand disposal. A capital gain on the disposal of our Taikang Life shares, and the sale of our Canadian operations. So the disposals represented a capital gain of &#x20AC;2.3 billion. And finally, we had a loss of around &#x20AC;200 million on our Hungarian bank operations with the impact of legislation and the discontinuation of lending activities. You know that the Hungarian government, after having in 2010 nationalized the pension system, in 2011 decided that the banks would have to accept a conversion rate for the loans made in Swiss franc at the rate of the Swiss franc against the Hungarian florins of 2008. So that's a significant loss for all the banks in Hungary.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the Life and Savings business and starting with the new business picture. Our new business on an APE business went down 1% in 2011. And this is a contrasted picture with minus 1% in mature markets. Only plus 2% in high growth market because even though Asia was up 16% as Henri mentioned earlier, in Central and Eastern Europe because of the &#x2013; what happened to the pension markets in Poland and Hungary in 2010, we saw a significant decline of 23% of our new business there.</p>
          <p>New business margins have progressed significantly from 22% to 25%. And this progression is both visible in mature markets and in high growth market. And I will comment that in more detail in the next slides.</p>
          <p>Looking at the breakdown of our new business, this is something that Henri has commented earlier. You see that in Protection, we have a growth of 13% thanks to strong sales in the U.S., in France, in Switzerland on the Group Life side, and in Germany with a favorable change in regulation on their Health side. So a very good picture with 13% growth of APE and 47% of the new business margin.</p>
          <p>General Account Savings were down 20% and we have a negative margin of four points because of the very low interest rates in which we are operating. And we have been disciplined in our production there and saw a significant decline in France, Italy, and Belgium.</p>
          <p>On the Unit-linked side, where our margins have been stable at 23%, our production was down 3%. And this is a contrasted picture with strong performance in France, Italy, and the U.S., and Asia, and lower performance in Germany where we reduced the sales of our variable annuity products, and in the UK where we are moving to mutual fund rather than Unit-linked. On the mutual fund side, you see a growth of 10%. When you look at the figures, you are surprised that we have plus 10% when the actual number is lower. With the disposal of Australia, we look at it from a &#x2013; on a comparable basis. And here, the main point to notice is a significant progress in the U.K. thanks to the success of our Elevate platform. Stable margins at 5%. We are happy with margins of 5% because as you know, this is our products have a very low capital consumption.</p>
          <p>Moving to a more detailed look at the new business margin. You see that our new business margin should have been affected by the very low level of interest rates. And this has a 1.8 points negative impact, but we have more than offset that with three elements; positive country mix, positive business mix, which I have commented earlier with the improvement of the share of protection and health, and scope impacts by buying out the minorities in Asia. We are gaining higher margin markets than what we lost with the disposal of Australia.</p>
          <p>On the General Account side, we are not giving up. We still believe that there is a future for General Account products both when we mix them in a hybrid format with Unit-linked products, which is what we are doing in countries like France with a minimum of 25% for a large &#x2013; a vast number of our sales. And in the case of fewer General Account products with an elimination of the guarantees moving to terminal bonuses as we are doing in Italy or reducing the guarantees that have been existing in the past on those types of products.</p>
          <p>And finally, I would say that we are in line with what we announced last June. We said that we would invest additional capital between 2011 and 2015 essentially in Protection &amp; Health, and to a lower extent, in Unit-linked. We would not invest additional capital on GA savings. We have &#x2013; we are in line with that commitment. We have invested roughly &#x20AC;400 million of new capital during the year, mostly in the Protection &amp; Health business.</p>
          <p>Moving to the detailed analysis of our underlying earnings on the Life side. I have commented earlier on the scope effects. You see that we had a significant decline of our U.S. contribution of &#x20AC;155 million, which was partly offset by an increase in average asset base, an increase in the &#x2013; an improvement in the mix. The other negative was the &#x2013; on the technical margin where the impact of change in regulation in France, the &#x2013; what is called the CMU levy, and the increase in the retirement age had a negative impact, as well as the negative impact of &#x20AC;64 million of the Japan earthquake and tsunami. So again a contrasted picture, but better investment margin, better Unit-linked fees, lower technical margin, and lower U.S. contribution.</p>
          <p>Looking at the earnings by sub-segment within the Life business. You see an improvement of the earnings of &#x2013; on the pre-tax basis of protection by 8%, an improvement of the earnings on the Savings side, General Account savings side, of 18% thanks in part to the better claims experience in Switzerland. But even without that, the earnings would have improved by 5%. A slight improvement of the earnings in the unit-linked business, excluding the U.S. VAs, and the loss of $383 million on the U.S. VAs, coming both from a negative hedging results and results strengthening on the lapse assumptions, which I have mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Property and Casualty. As we have indicated at the beginning of the year, our property casualty revenues increased by 3.5%. This is the case, both in personal lines, with an increase in 3.6%, and in commercial lines. Personal lines first, we had an average price increase of 4.8 points. And there was also an increase in volume, with a 1.5 million net inflows of both house, car, and motor and households, more than offset by lower average premium because people are insuring less pricey cars. They are reducing their guarantees given the low growth that we are incurring right now in Europe. On the commercial side, average price increase of 2.3%, and a more favorable business mix.</p>
          <p>We present each year to you, the &#x2013; each half year to you, the situation on the pricing side, and you see a very green picture, very favorable picture here, with price increasing across the board in personal lines and commercial lines. And in the past years, you are seeing that our price increases were sticking on the personal lines, but we were losing exposures on the commercial lines.</p>
          <p>Here, you see that we are &#x2013; our price increasing are sticking both in personal lines and commercial lines. We are increasing prices and we have gained exposures on both sides. This is with the exception of Switzerland, where we see a slight price decrease and possibly a continuation of that trend in 2012, but our combined ratio there is below 90%.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2012, market pricing trends, you see that's &#x2013; pricing trends are oriented positively in most markets, which bodes well for 2012 and the P&amp;C side and that's good to know.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side on P&amp;C, you will notice that we saw a slight increase of our revenues in mature markets, strong increase that are recommended in high-growth markets close to 16%. A good increase in direct at 8.2%.</p>
          <p>Currency combined ratio at 99.6%, an improvement of 2.9 points, so we are below our commitment of 100%. Our current year combined improved by 3.3 points in mature and 4.2 points in direct. We see a slight deterioration in high-growth, which relates to both the Thailand floods and also bad underwriting year in health in Mexico, but the situation remains solid with a combined &#x2013; currency combined at 100%.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the reasons for the improvement in the combined ratio, so you see that earnings improved by 16%. Improvement of the combined ratio has been coming from the combination of factors, price increases, lower net cut costs. The natural catastrophes costed us 0.7% of combined ratio against 1.7 points last year. We believe a normal year would be 1%, so the year was slightly favorable. Cost savings, that's &#x2013;  V&#xE9;ronique will comment on later, lower frequency and increasing severity. So all in all a good year on the currency combined.</p>
          <p>We had favorable developments in prior years, less favorable than last year, only 1.7 points of favorable development, leading to a 97.9% whole year combined ratio and improvement of 1.8 points. On the investment side, our investment income was stable at &#x20AC;2 billion in spite of declining interest rates.</p>
          <p>Moving now to asset management, our average AUM were down 2% and revenues were flat. And you see on the net flows that at AXA IM, we had a continuation at a much more modest space of the outflows at AXA Rosenberg with negative flows of &#x20AC;5 billion, but positive flows of &#x20AC;4 billion in all the other expertise. As Henri indicated to you earlier, we had very good investment performance across the board at AXA IM.</p>
          <p>At AllianceBernstein, negative flows of &#x20AC;28 billion. But this is again a contrasted picture with negative flows of &#x20AC;54 billion on the equity side, and positive flows of &#x20AC;4 billion on fixed income, where the investment performance has continued to be very good. And &#x20AC;22 billion of net flows in alternatives, in liability-driven strategies, and other, &#x20AC;22 billion, which is a significant number.</p>
          <p>When you look at AllianceBernstein, we continue to have significant outflows, but the gross flows have been quite good, at &#x20AC;60 billion per annum. And I believe this bodes well for the future.</p>
          <p>On the earnings side, on the Asset Management, we see that we have a growth of earnings of 20%. At AB, the earnings have declined by 23% because of lower revenues and lower assets under management. AXA IM saw a rebound of its earnings of 69%, thanks to the non-repeat of the AXA Rosenberg coding error last year, and higher revenues and performance fees.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to hand over to G&#xE9;rald Harlin for the balance sheets. And thank you very much for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Denis. Good morning. Let's start with the shareholders' equity. Shareholders' equity decreased from &#x20AC;49.7 billion to &#x20AC;48.6 billion, i.e. minus &#x20AC;1.1 billion. The main drivers of this change are, first, net income for the period, up at plus &#x20AC;4.3 billion, then we had the goodwill deduction. You remember, I mentioned this already at the &#x2013; for the H1 presentation that correspond to the Asian minority buyout where we had to deduct, according to the IFRS rule, the goodwill from the shareholders' equity, explaining a negative of &#x20AC;2.5 billion. Then we had the 2010 dividend and a decrease in net unrealized capital gains of &#x20AC;1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now at Solvency I. Solvency I is very strong, close to historical high levels. As you can see, we are at 188% and explained by positives and mostly coming from a strong underlying earnings performance. Also, it's offset by some movements from the markets.</p>
          <p>Economic solvency ratio now, our economic solvency ratio is at 148%, compared with 178%, i.e. a decline of 30%. It's quite resilient. It's in line with the level we mentioned to you at the end of September. As already mentioned by Henri, we would be above 150% at the end of January. I would like to remind you that we are comfortable with this level. The main differences are &#x2013; the main changes are, first, a negative 15 points coming from credit and government bonds spread, net of liquidity premium. And second, the sharp decline in interest rates explains minus 20. As you can see on the bottom right, the two main sensitivities are coming from interest rates and corporate spreads.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a look at the debt gearing. Debt gearing went down from 28% to 26%, close to our 2015 target, which is at 25 points. The debt declined from &#x20AC;15.2 billion to &#x20AC;13.4 billion, i.e., a decline of &#x20AC;1.8 billion. &#x20AC;0.9 billion is explained by the net cash proceeds from disposal and acquisitions, as already presented by Henri. And the rest comes from higher dividends that are coming from &#x2013; that went upstream from our operational entities. You can see that the &#x2013; we have an improved interest coverage, from 8.5 times last year to 9.1 times this year.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now to general account investments and the invested assets. First start, let me explain the difference between those total insurance invested assets, which were at &#x20AC;441 billion last year, &#x20AC;467 billion. Where is this difference coming from? First, from the positive net inflows. Second, from accrued interest rates. We have a positive ForEx effects and we can say that, more or less, the other markets impact are quite neutral.</p>
          <p>As you can see, fixed income remain the most important asset class, at 82 points [percent]. Just to &#x2013; let's notice that corporate bonds slightly declined. It's not due to dis-investment. It's due to the spread widening.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the unrealized capital gains. Unrealized capital gains moved down from &#x20AC;6.6 billion to &#x20AC;5.1 billion. And these are the capital gains which are booked in &#x2013; on our balance sheet, in OCI.</p>
          <p>First, equities. Equities declined from &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;0.9 billion. It's important to notice that the &#x20AC;0.9 billion, we are still positive at the end of the year. That this &#x20AC;0.9 billion unrealized capital gains compared to a net equity exposure, you have this in your appendix, of &#x20AC;6 billion. So that's quite substantial.</p>
          <p>Corporate bonds unrealized gains slightly decreased, and the government bonds increased from &#x20AC;2.3 billion to &#x20AC;3.1 billion. And at the bottom of the graph, you can see that, for sure, in the Eurozone peripheral countries we're at minus &#x20AC;0.7 billion. So that means that we have an unrealized capital loss position of minus &#x20AC;0.7 billion, but we are in an unrealized gains position in all other countries.</p>
          <p>Last, off balance sheet unrealized capital gains corresponding to real estate and loans, we went up from &#x20AC;2.9 billion to &#x20AC;3.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's focus on peripheral country exposure now. So first, it represents 5% only of our invested assets. Second, you can see in the last column on the left, you have the gross market value at the end of January. And you can see that, with the recovery of the market, roughly speaking, we are not very far, for Italian spend, from the level at the &#x2013; of mid-2011.</p>
          <p>Next is the Greek government bond. It's been explained by Denis. So we have an impairment &#x2013; we have booked an impairment on the net basis, net of tax, net of BV, of &#x20AC;387 million. It's following a &#x20AC;92 million impairment in the first half. So it's &#x20AC;295 million for the second half. So that means that all our maturities are now impaired. So we impaired the totality, and this correspond to a 78% haircut.</p>
          <p>Last, the breakdown. We have a breakdown here between domestic versus non-domestic holders of bonds in the peripheral countries. And you can see that the non-domestic represents 55%. 93% of this non-domestic exposure is concentrated in AXA France, on Germany, and on Belgium. So the question is what is the ALM impact in a stressed situation. And that's what we explain in the following slides.</p>
          <p>So let's imagine an extreme theoretical scenario where the Eurozone peripheral sovereign debt market value would be reduced to zero. In such a case, we would have the flexibility to realize the 6.4% that you have on the left, which corresponds to the gross unrealized capital gains. And you can see that this would mostly offset &#x2013; more than offset the 5.5% of peripheral country sovereign debt exposure. And as a consequence, when realized, our reinvestment yield would be lower and would be at 3.9%, where the current investment yield is at 4.4%. But even after in such a stressed scenario, we can notice that our reinvestment yield at 3.9 points would be above the average inforce guaranteed rate of 2%, which means that we have this flexibility to absorb potential losses.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the investment margins now. On the investment margins, they went down from 76 to 73 basis points. Quite resilient. And as you can see, that's why our earnings contribution from the traditional savings business is extremely resilient as well, and is up. The spread with guaranteed rates, you can notice as I explained last year that we were expecting a decline in the investment income in Life from 4 to 3.9, so minus 10 basis points. And you can see as well, that the average guaranteed rates dropped by 10 basis points as well. So we have a comfortable 180 basis points global margin, gross margin on the investment business.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the &#x2013; now at 2011. So reinvestment rate, the average reinvestment rate, which is mentioned on the top right, has been 3.5 points, 3.5%, of which Eurozone has been 3.9%. And now, at the bottom right, you have the current investment policies for the group on fixed income. As you can see, we have still investment in government bonds, 25% this exclude &#x2013; there is no more investment in peripheral countries, but the vast majority and those of present condition, are corporate bonds and secured financial bonds. Because on a risk-adjusted basis, there is &#x2013; that's a type of investment where we get the most important value.</p>
          <p>As an example in the Eurozone, presently the average fixed income investment yield is at 3.7%. And at the same time, 3.7% compared with 3.9% last year. We are dealing with a very long duration, which means that there should be low impact in 2012 investment income.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the embedded value now. Embedded value is &#x2013; drops slightly from &#x20AC;34.2 billion to &#x20AC;31.5 billion. You can notice that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:34) is slightly up from &#x20AC;14.1 to &#x20AC;14.5 billion. The operating return, &#x20AC;6.3 billion, you have the three key drivers on the right. &#x20AC;6.3 billion that correspond to a good operating return of 19% explained by the strong Life unwind of the existing Life EEV at &#x20AC;3.3 billion, which is higher than last year. &#x20AC;1.4 billion of NBV and &#x20AC;1.6 billion other than Life underlying the earnings.</p>
          <p>Investment experience on the reverse is strongly negative, minus 8. And it's explained by the decrease of rates, of the widening of the spreads on both sovereign and on corporate bonds, lower equity level. And that's of course net of the liquidity premium. As a whole, group EEV per share, that's &#x20AC;13.5 per share.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the free cash flows now. As mentioned already by Henri, we have a strong plus 14% increase on both Life and Savings that I'll explain on the next slide and on P&amp;C. Let me explain on P&amp;C, we are moving from 2 to 2.1. That's explained by the higher underlying earnings, a lower combined ratio and a strong and the realized capital gains net of the required capital.</p>
          <p>The real cash coming at the bottom line, at bottom Life, you have the real cash coming from entities at plus 19% from 2.7 to 3.2 so that the cash which is upstream from the entities, which means that strong improvement. And the remittance ratio went up from 75% to 76%.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now at the Life operating free cash flow. Life operating free cash flow is composed of the expected in software generation, which is higher from 3.6 to 3.9. As you can see the &#x2013; we have a stable new business investment with improve business mix. That means that we have the same capital requirements, you can notice, minus 2.2. That means that also we improved our business mix in line with our commitment and we also, Ambition AXA commitment, nevertheless, the capital requirement are quite stable. You can see that there is an improvement in the profitability, IRR moving up from 10.9 to 11.5 in line with our NBV improvement.</p>
          <p>Now I hand over to Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Mark Pearson. And I took over management of the U.S. business just one year ago.</p>
          <p>G&#xE9;rald and Denis have already mentioned some of our business metrix. In summary, the year shows strong operating performance, offset by a small number of adverse market-driven items affecting our year-end results. We're pleased with the progress on sales. Volumes as measured by APE are up 7% in the year. These volumes, the improving mix of business and lower expenses helped offset lower interest rates and drove new business value up 15% in the year.</p>
          <p>Underlying earnings is really a story of two halves in 2011. At the first half year, we reported strong results on the back of benign investment markets, but severe market volatility and low interest rates in the second half reversed these gains and held back earnings. The underlying earnings of $433 million for the year includes net losses of $661 million for market-related items, and the impact of strengthening of reserves for lapses in line with current experience. Net income for the year was a negative $475 million, reflecting the impact of a goodwill reduction of $1.3 billion, which I will cover later.</p>
          <p>Due to these notable one-off items, I'd like to stress that our reported earnings for 2011 are not indicative of our expected run rate for earnings going forward. On the expense side, some success here. Our efficiency programs are delivering productivity improvements and our cost base is down 11% for the year, largely reflecting reductions in head count.</p>
          <p>Okay, let me look into some of these numbers. Firstly, on the sales side, we had a good year. This slide shows the breakdown of our new business for Life and Savings. Our Life business is rebounding, with very strong growth of 40% year-on-year, principally through increases on our third-party channel, and success in distributing our indexed Universal Life product. We are also very pleased that our Retirement Cornerstone product, which is a variable annuity with a variable rate guarantee tied to the 10-year treasury, has grown 24% in the year. This is a real good achievement for this new category product in the market. You can see we have lower accumulation sales, as we have reduced features and lowered policyholder benefits on this product. Overall, a good mix, as well as volumes increasing on Life and Savings by 14%. Against this, gross expenses down 11% to just around $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>We are well positioned to continue to pursue these growth opportunities, as we have the benefit of multi-distribution, distribution, multi-channel distribution. And it's pleasing to see that AXA Advisors, our line channel, is now generating two thirds of our APE, and that's up from just over 40% in 2007. That's a good number because it offers us stability moving forward.</p>
          <p>Product innovation continues to be a critical competence in this competitive and risky environment, and our newly launched Life and Annuity products which have lower risk and better margins, now represent over 40% of last year's sales. And as I mentioned on the efficiency side, we have good progress here including a 27% reduction in head count in the company since the peak in 2007. So overall, strong momentum on the operating side. And our strategy to diversify and improve the efficiency is delivering results.</p>
          <p>Despite the harsh investment environment adversely impacting results, pre-tax underlying earnings held up well at $415 million, although down on the $740 million we reported one year ago. Stripping out the impact of investment markets on our hedging result and the results in lower policyholder lapses, earnings would have grown on a pre-tax basis by 10% in the year from $1.162 billion to $1.278 billion.</p>
          <p>With lower interest rates in the year, net interest margin has been squeezed and fell by $17 million in the year. Fees in revenues and other technical margins grew by $153 million principally through increased Unit-linked fee revenues. Expense savings offset by higher commissions related to asset-base compensation contributed an additional $79 million to earnings.</p>
          <p>On the DAC side, net amortization excluding the activity to GMxB attribution was $99 million higher in 2011 than in previous year. So pre-tax growth of 10% for the year, excluding these one offs arising from adverse invested market.</p>
          <p>For 2011, these totaled $863 million post-tax and pre-tax, of which $538 million was as a result of strengthening of reserves for lower policyholder lapses and a balance $325 million arising mainly from charges for higher volatility.</p>
          <p>In summary, our underlying earnings picture reflects good performance from our core operations, offset by the adverse impact of the deterioration in investment markets in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier by Denis, net income for the year was a negative $475 million, reflecting a goodwill reduction of $1.3 billion. Firstly, a reminder. The goodwill we hold at the AXA Financial level totals $3.5 billion, and results primarily from the 2000 purchase of the minority shareholders of AXA Financial. While we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the business, we need to be realistic about how current market conditions impact our value, particularly the value of our Accumulator franchise. So we have concluded that it is appropriate at this stage to take a reduction of part of the goodwill that we are holding.</p>
          <p>This reduction is a prudent decision at this time as it represents today's economic climate and leaves us with a goodwill assets that is supportable for the foreseeable future across a wide range of different scenarios. We have moved very strongly to de-risk and reduce volumes on our GMxB portfolio for better margins. We believe that this is the right move in these conditions. For example, for the Accumulator series sold in 2007, we would have needed 7.8% of any initial dollar investment of capital backing, whereas for Accumulator 2011, because of the actions we have taken on the less risky asset allocation and less rich features, the initial capital has fallen to 0.2%. This also translates into the reactivity or statutory capital to the movements in the markets. And we can see from the slide for a 100 basis point drop in interest rates, the impact on capital for accumulate at 7, would've been 12.1% versus 1.6% for today's retirement cornerstone and 0.2% for accumulate to 2011. And you can see the same trend for any four in equity markets.</p>
          <p>So what are we doing here, well, we're clearly trading volume for margin and profitability. And we are also writing much less risky business today. And we believe that moving forward, this is going to continue to drive value and reduce risks for shareholders.</p>
          <p>One final point here. As goodwill is a non-cash item, there's no impact on our statutory financials. Risk-based capital ratios for our U.S. business remain healthy at just under 500% as at the end of December.</p>
          <p>I would like to give some detail on the charge of $211 million net of taxes and net of debt relating to strengthening of reserves for lapses on our GMxB business. Firstly, and this is most importantly, reserve assumptions are now in line with 2011 experience. In view of the fallen interest rates and the announcement that the Fed will continue its policy for maintaining low interest rates for the next two years, we have moved our reserves from a three-year smoothing average, to now reflect actual lapse experience in the year. As such, the $211 million impact has a one-off element in it rather than a signal of worsening policy hold behavior in the year.</p>
          <p>Reserves will continue to be based on the projections of different market conditions with different lapse rates according to the In-the-moneyness and policy duration. In terms of sensitivity, if lapse rates decline by 0.5% permanently and beyond what is already projected, the impact on net underlying earnings would be around $160 million net.</p>
          <p>The other factor on policyholder behavior is, of course, the rates of annuitization. Actual experience to date is significantly below our reserve assumptions. And we do have conservative assumptions here. And we have no evidence on experience to date of any increase in annuitization rates. There's also a natural hedge between our GMIB, the income benefit we pay, and the GMDB, the death benefit we pay, as of course, policyholders aren't able to elect both.</p>
          <p>And just to give you some sensitivity here, if our annuitization reserve assumptions, not the actual experience, but the assumptions themselves doubled, we estimate the net impact of underlying earnings after this offset, this natural hedge, would be about $150 million.</p>
          <p>Still staying with the GMxB, we continue to take steps to better manage the risk of our in force portfolio. In the last quarter, we are the first insurer still in a new business market to stop the practice of allowing additional contributions in the legacy accumulated business.</p>
          <p>We've introduced the AXA Tactical Manager and the Asset Transfer Program Tools to better manage volatility both within the funds at a policy level for investors, but also as a means to protect the balance sheet for shareholders. And as a result of a program we've been running for a few years now, we have 65% of account values in passive funds compared to less than 5% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Our GMxB hedging program was 89% effective in 2011. And we also continue to take opportunities to pre-hedge volatility, which has the potential to improve the effectiveness moving forward.</p>
          <p>We do adopt a very transparent and prudent accounting for our hedging. It is important to remember when comparing us to other insurance companies in the U.S., we do not use non-performance risk adjustment, or what's known as NPR. This is permitted under U.S. GAAP, and effectively reduces the amount of reserves for GMxB business by applying the company's own credit spread to the discount rate. And also on the DB and the IB side, most competitors use U.S. GAAP SOP 0301, which is based on stochastic, historical and not mark-to-market scenarios, and hence, offers a degree of smoothing in falling markets.</p>
          <p>And finally, we are alone in reflecting our attribution result in underlying earnings rather than in net income. You can see on the chart in the bottom of this page, I've given you the full five-year position. One thing worthy of note, you'll see the change to earnings in financial year 2008 as a result of the basis risk. And this has been well managed since as a result of the actions I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, I do believe we are very well positioned for growth, and they're very happy with the progress, particularly on our mix of business. As you can see on the Variable Annuity side, 40% of sales now come from newly launched products. We have expanded our VA platform through these new products, and are capable of meeting the needs of a wider client base.</p>
          <p>Our Retirement Cornerstone is getting some traction now, accounting for about one third of our business at the expense of the fixed rate Accumulator-type business. On the Life side, in addition to us recording 40% growth in the year, the mix is improving. You'll see that we still do offer term business, which is low margin in the U.S. And it's used by us as a door opener and a way to maintain relationships with our main distributors, and it has now fallen to only 17% of sales.</p>
          <p>A big success for us has been Indexed UL, which has grown from 5% in the year, to 41%, principally through third-party distribution. As a result of all of this, the new business margin for the year, reflecting the improved mix has improved one percentage point over last year, to 13%. So we have decent margins on our business. We have the benefit of align distribution. AXA Advisors now accounts for two thirds of our new business, and some good momentum with us. We are well positioned for growth.</p>
          <p>So in summary, in line with our objective to deliver sustainable earnings and free cash flows, we continue to enjoy a strong presence in the U.S., the world's largest profit pool for life insurance. Through our multi-distribution platforms and our large inforce client bank, we are well positioned to grow. We have very strong and disciplined risk management capabilities, both on our inforce and new product development. We are all seeing strong momentum, particularly sales of our Life business. And our objective remains to increase earnings and increase free cash flows.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, I will now pass on to V&#xE9;ronique.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I would like to update you on where we are at the end of 2011 on our expense savings. As Henri mentioned earlier, we are on track with our efficiency program. And I would like to give you two messages. The first one, is that we have the right governance to monitor this plan. And the second one, is that the entities are executing the plan.</p>
          <p>Now, let me underline what are the key figures of Ambition AXA. On the efficiency program, we communicated in June that we would achieve in mature countries &#x20AC;1.5 billion of savings, &#x20AC;0.1 billion on P&amp;C and Life and Savings administrative costs and &#x20AC;0.4 billion in P&amp;C in acquisition costs ratio.</p>
          <p>Where are we now in 2012? Our targets in 2011 and 2013 was &#x20AC;600 million. We have achieved at the end of 2011, &#x20AC;200 million. On the P&amp;C acquisition costs, our target is &#x20AC;400 million and we have achieved already &#x20AC;100 million in 2011. So &#x20AC;2,000 million in administrative costs and &#x20AC;100 million on acquisition costs.</p>
          <p>Now, how have we achieved these numbers in 2011 and what we will do in 2012? If you remember, we announced in June that we will keep our administrative cost flat beating both volume growth and inflation. To achieve this &#x20AC;200 million of savings, we have used the three levers that we identified back in June; operational performance, external spend, and IT.</p>
          <p>On operational performance, this will represent 62% of our savings, which is around &#x20AC;150 million. What we have here is we have done several things. We have deployed lean management in France and in Belgium. Lean management is about process improvement and savings, but also this includes and involves all the middle management and the various staff in the departments.</p>
          <p>The second thing is we have achieved productivity initiatives in the U.K., in the U.S., in Germany, in MedLA and in France. And third, our offshoring planned in France continues as expected. These three initiatives: lean management, productivity and offshoring, allowed us to reduce globally our FTEs by 1,300 people.</p>
          <p>On external spend, we are using two levers, which is commercial lever and also challenging the demand. On commercial levers, we are renegotiating the pricing with our vendors by globalizing our volume. The second one is we are challenging the demand in order to reduce the volume that we purchase. This allowed us to reduce our external expense and we achieved &#x20AC;50 million, which is 22% of the &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>On the technology side, you remember that we said that we want to protect our investments. We're still investing in 2011, &#x20AC;1.1 billion. At the same time, what we have done is we have reviewed very slowly our infrastructure expenses. We have benchmarked ourselves against a world-class IT provider on the market. And we have looked at the opportunity to do a full outsourcing deal. We didn't want, finally, after due diligence to do it, because we believe we can do it well internally. We can do it well with selective outsourcing to create good competition among our key vendors. And also, what we wanted to do is we wanted to keep the knowledge and the control of our infrastructure. But we have designed a plan that we have started to implement.</p>
          <p>What is the outlook of 2012? We will continue lean management program in France and in Belgium with new ways in the various entities. We will also &#x2013; we also have started the same process in Japan, in Germany, in Italy, and in AXA Technology Services, and that will continue to deliver results.</p>
          <p>The second point on the external spend, we will be using the same levers, commercial levers and challenging the demand. And we will apply that at four main areas: IT software, IT and professional services, and real estate.</p>
          <p>On the infrastructure side, or on the IT side first, we will continue to invest as we have invested in 2011 in our businesses. We will start to deliver on our infrastructure and transformation plan by really using four different levers: mainframe consolidation, server virtualization, desktop &#x2013; new desktop technology, and network.</p>
          <p>This is what we have done in 2011, which mean that we have kept our administrative costs flat, beating both volume and inflation. And we achieved &#x20AC;200 million of savings.</p>
          <p>What have we done on the P&amp;C and acquisition ratio? What we have achieved in 2011 is a decrease of the acquisition ratio by 0.5%, which takes us from 18.2% to 17.7%. How did we do it? We did it using three main levers. The first one is the commission renegotiation. And we have done that in the UK with the brokers and in Spain with the agents. And that lead us to achieve 0.3% of the acquisition ratio decrease, which was the equivalent of &#x20AC;60 million.</p>
          <p>The second point is, also we have been able to contain our distribution expense <mark type="ph" /> slots (69:13) in the U.K. and in Germany, while volumes were increasing. This led us to a 0.2% decrease of the acquisition ratio, which is around &#x20AC;40 million. And we also worked on our product mix in Belgium and in Germany in order &#x2013; and with a greater focus on business with lower commission rates. &#x20AC;110 million of savings through acquisition cost, and we have used three levers; commission renegotiation, optimizing the sales and marketing cost, and also changing our product mix.</p>
          <p>Now, in summary, I want to give you three messages. The first one is we have, as we told in June, a clear plan. We know how to execute it. We are in implementation mode and we have generate good savings in 2011. We have also good prospect for 2012.</p>
          <p>The second point is that we have the right tools in place to monitor the implementation of the plan on a quarterly basis and take corrective actions if necessary. And the third point, but I think you heard it through the various presentation, AXA is fully mobilized to deliver this Ambition AXA efficiency program under the leadership of the CEOs.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And I will now leave the floor to Henri, who will conclude the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, V&#xE9;ronique. A few concluding remarks. On 2011 first, I think the two key messages are very simple. The resilience of the business model enables us to maintain the dividend. The resilience of the business model is built on the results, the cash flows, the strength of the balance sheet. First message.</p>
          <p>Second message, we are delivering on the operational initiatives from Ambition AXA. This is reflected through improved margins, both in Life and in Property Casualty. We have demonstrated the ability to manage the capital with agility. We have repositioned very substantial amounts over the last year.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, as V&#xE9;ronique has just explained, we are very well-aligned with the efficiency efforts. It's demonstrated in 2011. And this enables us to look at the future with a reasonable degree of optimism in this very uncertain world. But before all to be convinced, that we have focused on the right things to develop the business in this uncertain environment.</p>
          <p>So going forward, what are we going to do? We are going to continue to implement what we had decided to do within the Ambition AXA framework. We want to maintain the agility which has characterized the last two years. And this is going to be aligned along the three big pillars of Ambition AXA, selectivity. And what do we win by that? We want to grow Protection &amp; Health. We want to extract more value from the Life &amp; Savings business by managing the inforce books, which are very big, more actively. And we want to foster growth in the Direct business. Acceleration &#x2013; we want to foster growth in the Direct business and accelerate in the emerging markets further. Last but not least, efficiency. We are going to continue to deliver on cost savings.</p>
          <p>So this is for the operational side: more selectivity, better use of capital, more acceleration in the places where you have a combination of volumes and margins, and reduction of costs. Of course, we will continue to maintain a very close eye on the balance sheet and the cash flows, because this is essential in these uncertain times. Overall, what we think is that the strategy is well suited for the current environment, and that this is going to enable us to grow the operating profit going forward as we think we can grow it. That's what I wanted to share with you as a conclusion. And we are now going to answer the questions. We will have questions both in the room and through the net.</p>
          <p>I'll take first some questions in the room. If you could raise your hands, introduce yourself, and ask your question. Emmanuelle Cales?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Ladies first. Emmanuelle Cales from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Two or three questions, please. The first one maybe on the U.S. on the lapse rate, page 53, you mention the sensitivities of underlying earnings if the trends end up straight, but what I did miss, what is the lapse rate current <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:15:14) to the &#x2013; I could not find it in the slides. What is currently the lapse rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, do you want to answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We don't give out a single figure lapse rate, because it is &#x2013; our reserving is done on a dynamic basis, and it depends on duration of the policy. It depends on In-the-moneyness and where interest rates are. So it is dynamically moving. So we've given you there a couple of key messages. Firstly, we have moved our reserve assumption to actual experiences this year, as against the three-year moving average. So the charge of $211 million, which is roughly in line with $150 million guidance we gave in quarter three last year, reflects the actual expenditure and a one-off element for the catch-up. And then a rough movement of 50 basis points permanently below that, below the dynamic assumptions, would move it by $160 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question is on the BNP shares, you say you hedge BNP shares. Are you currently hedging end of January, February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Denis or G&#xE9;rald, do you want to answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the BNP shares are concerned, like all shares, we have some hedging, but we don't have a full hedging. And it could be for, we have, in accordance with Solvency II today, it's &#x2013; we see economy capital of interest is to &#x2013; in order to limit the capital, is to have some hedging-like protections, put protection and so on. Yes, we have, but it's not at all fully hedged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on a related question, on your equity hedging, you &#x2013; as far as I understand, you made a loss in H2 because you had a loss of &#x20AC;100 million in H1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. it's not...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How did it come, because market was strongly down in Q3? You should have make a profit in H2, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's not a loss. It's only a strategy which had consisted -instead of keeping some equities exposure to buy some premiums to keep some upside, because, again, it's cheaper to buy some options which are in &#x2013; which are out of the money rather than keeping some exposure in equities. That explains why, and this correspond to time value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last one is more general. It's more on regulation and on SIFI, systemic financials. It looks like your insurance companies will &#x2013; could be &#x2013; could fall under this burden. What's your view, I mean the insurance <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:38) has lost the battle here, because it's a nonsense...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean first, I think there is a lack of clarity on the process. I've also heard that some insurance companies would be &#x2013; I mean, considered as SIFIs mostly because of their size. I think we have won the argument that, by nature, insurance companies are not systemic risks. They can be affected by systemic events like many, many other players. And I think the regulators are starting to understand better that the banking model is partly different from the insurance model. I guess what they probably want is to have more and accrued transparency on the consequences from systemic events on very large groups, which is something you can understand. But I think the &#x2013; progressively, we are very clearly making the point that insurance companies are not systemic by nature. They can be affected by the consequences of systemic events, but they do not generate systemic events unless they do things which are not insurance. I mean, which are not in their business, like we have seen for some groups in the past. But this is certainly not the case for us, nor is it for most of the very large European players.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thank you very much. My first question relates to the new DAC accounting rule, is it only an IFRS story or is it impacting also the risk-based capital in the U.S.? And can you elaborate maybe a bit more generally on the consequences of this change?</p>
          <p>My second is for you Henri, is about flexibility in the perimeter of the group. You've been quite active in the recent quarters selling activities. Is 2012 going to be a similar year, with some disposals and potentially some reinforcement here and there?</p>
          <p>And my third question is for Nicolas Moreau. Paris is full of advertisement for banking products sold by AXA Bank with a very aggressive credit rate. Can you give us some hints on the strategy there, and the potential margin you expect from this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Thomas, for spreading your questions evenly among the &#x2013; so G&#xE9;rald, you start with the DAC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, with the DAC, to answer your first question, it has no impact on the RBC ratio in the U.S. That's the first point. The second is that, as you can see in the press release, so that's a new accounting rule, which is more cautious. So that means that today, we have roughly &#x20AC;9 billion of DAC impact in our shareholders' equity. And we can expect that it will be a retroactive measure on the 1st of January 2012. And it will be a decrease of &#x20AC;2 billion. And it's, roughly speaking, 50% concerns the U.S. and 50% concerns the other countries, other countries being mostly France and also some countries in Asia like Hong Kong.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Nicolas?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, AXA Bank is offering, since the beginning of the year, a rate of 5% plus one for new customers, and five &#x2013; and the same for existing customers. So this is a quite popular offer, as we've raised around &#x20AC;600 million net since this offer is up. This is a promotion for new clients for three months and for existing clients, from the date they put the money until the 15 of April. And the plus one is due only if the money remains on the account until the end of June. So it's really a five plus one.</p>
          <p>So currently, we estimate the value, the cost of raising the money to a little bit less than 1%. And we are in the process of building campaign to transform this into life insurance policy. So we should, in June, put forward an offer for these people to move into structured products and Unit-linked structure. And the idea is to &#x2013; what is interesting for us is that 50% of the customers are new customers for the bank, 50% is new money, and also for the networks, it's a very good activity. We've got in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:23:18) also, a Life Insurance product which is called AXA <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:22:57), which is a HS structured product. And what is interesting is that both offers are not capitalizing themselves, because on the Unit-linked side we have had also &#x2013; we will do &#x20AC;150 million of sales since the beginning of the year. So in six weeks, which is a good &#x2013; for us, a good production. I hope I've answered your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the capital management. Managing the capital with agility does not mean only managing the perimeter of the group. I think it's bolder and deeper than that. It's managing the existing books, and that's why we are going to put more emphasis on the management of the Life inforce. We are the &#x2013; we have the largest Life inforce book in the world. I mean we are the first worldwide Life insurer and the third largest one in P&amp;C. So in Life, we have the largest inforce book. Most of the organizations historically are positioned for acquiring new business. And a nonsufficient attention is paid to the management of the inforce, where you have potentially significant productivity gains, both in terms of earnings and capital allocation. So looking at the possibility of optimizing the inforce books by converting some of the products, by possibly selling some of the Life inforce books, if you can do it at reasonable conditions, I think you &#x2013; things you have to look at.</p>
          <p>The other way to manage your capital with agility is to look at the way you price the new generations of products, as far as the capital consumption is needed, or is concerned. And from what markets presented to you, you can very well see that, in one of the geographical areas where we are, I would say, largely exposed on the savings portion of the business, which is the U.S. So new generations of products are much less capital-intensive than in the past. And this is a general trend. So the &#x2013; in the first phase, you work on your perimeter and you sell what you see as non-core or non-essential. In the second phase, you look, not necessarily geography by geography or company by company, but you look at the books, and you decide what you want to do on the existing books and on the building of the future books.</p>
          <p>Maybe we are going to take one or two questions on the net. Two questions. First one, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A question from Farooq Hanif, Morgan Stanley. "What is your latest view on the timetable for 72, and what do you expect in terms of changes to the model once the current consultation is completed? And do you think these changes will still be positive compared to K5?"</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good question. We all know that there are rumors about a possible postponement of the implementation of Solvency II. We are fighting against that, because the &#x2013; what is bad is to have a very large sector. An insurance is a very large sector contributing to financial stability and economic growth, having to live with two different systems without any clarity, neither on the timetable, nor on the principles of the future system.</p>
          <p>So what we want, and it's not we, AXA, it's we, the European industry, is first, clarity as soon as possible on the remaining open issues related to Solvency II. And firstly, about the implementation of the countercyclical premium, which we think is going to be more favorable than what was in <mark type="ph" /> QS5 (1:28:02). So clarity on the principles as quickly as possible, because the worst thing is to live with uncertainty, without knowing when the new system is going to be implemented and without knowing what it is.</p>
          <p>On the timetable, of course we would like the European authorities to stick to the initial timetable. If it's postponed by a quarter or two, it's not going to be a drama. But the worst thing, once more, would be to live with uncertainty. Next question.</p>

          <p>Question from Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. "Is the sensitivity to U.S. lapse rates a one-off impact on earnings or is it a per annum impact?"</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mark, do you want to answer that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very simply, the sensitivity we gave would be a one-off impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do we have other questions?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Last one from James Cooke, Scottish Value Management. "Surely, it would not be in AXA shareholder interest for Henri's ambition to stretch to worrying about Nescafe, Kit Kats, and Shredded Wheats?"</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a word on that, because it seems to be a coded language. I'm going to join the Nestl&#xE9; board. It's the first board outside AXA I'm &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> acts as (89:07) the first board position I'm accepting. I've done it because Nestl&#xE9; is, I think, a phenomenal success story globally. It's a wonderful company, and I think it's very interesting for me as the CEO of AXA to understand how a company has managed to achieve covering essential needs for its clients, a 6% yearly organic growth over a very long period of time. And has achieved to build a unique brand, delivering a very significant premium and delivering very good margins to its shareholders. These are challenges which are very similar to the ones we are seeing for us. And I'm sure I will be learning a lot, and I hope I'm going to contribute. This is the answer and be sure, this is not going to distract me from my attention for AXA.</p>
