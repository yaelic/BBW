          <p>Thank you, Alejandro. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us in this conference call. First, I will summarize the highlights of the year 2010, which will be followed by comments from our Vice President on the operational and financial results and final review the outlook for this year.</p>
          <p>Let's start with slide five and review the highlights for 2010. The company continued its progress in implementing its growth strategy achieving solid operating and financial results. There was a significant growth in exploration activities reaching geological success ratio of 29% that gross reduction of the Corporate Group rose 18% reaching an average production of 615,900 barrels equivalent per day. Group net reserve of hydrocarbon amounted to 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. As of December 31st of 2010, we had an 11% increase compared to 2009 reserve replacement ratio was 193%.</p>
          <p>The strategic plan was revised and updated until year 2020 confirming the goal to produce 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2015 and setting a new goal of 1.3 million barrels per day of production by 2020. The estimated CapEx amounts to $80 billion between 2011 and 2020. Regarding the quality of fuels that company began delivering diesel with less than 50 parts per million of sulfur content in Bogot&#xE1;, Medell&#xED;n, and the multi public transportation system, and with less than 500 parts per million for the rest of the country also, we are providing gasoline with less than 300 parts per million of sulfur in all the countries.</p>
          <p>In terms of expanding the transportation capacity for oil and products, the company made significant progress in key projects that will leverage the future development of the oil sector in Colombia.</p>
          <p>The excellent operating results together with the favorable price environment are reflected in higher sales, EBITDA, better margins compared to 2009. It was highlighting the EBITDA of COP$16.4 trillion, a 57% rise compared to 2009 equivalent to an EBITDA margin of 45%.</p>
          <p>At slide six, we have summarized execution of our investment plan. Organic investment for 2010 grew 37% compared to year 2009. 57% of the organic investment was allocated to production projects mainly for the development of heavy oil fields, 5% to exploration projects, 26% to downstream project mainly for the hydro-treatment plant and the expansion of transportation system, 10% to subsidiaries and the remaining 2% was allocated to corporate <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Transported volumes went up 29% between 2009 and 2010 due to the increase in the production and the investments in transportation facilities carried by Ecopetrol. Ecopetrol in Talisman, Colombia acquired BP Exploration Company Colombia Limited for a total amount $1.75 billion plus $145 million return on equity to Ocensa shareholders. Ecopetrol has a 51% interest in Talisman remaining. The new name of the company is EQUION, energy for life.</p>
          <p>Approximately 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day are currently produced and operated by the company of which it has direct ownership of 27,000 barrels per day. That 2011, 2020 strategy calls for Ecopetrol to invest approximately $80 billion, 80% of the investment will be allocated to exploration and production and the remaining 20% to refining, transportation, petrochemical, commercialization <mark type="inaudible" /> the internal cash generation should finance 65% of the capital planned. The oil price scenario for the plant is $60 per barrel of WTI in dollars of 2011.</p>
          <p>I now will turn the presentation to H&#xE9;ctor Manosalva, who will comment on the results in the upstream business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. This slide shows the progress made in our Exploration and Production strategy during 2010. Regarding exploration, Ecopetrol concluded the drilling of 15 exploratory wells in Colombia out of a <mark type="inaudible" /> Rio Zulia West-3, Quifa-6, Oripaya-1, and Akacias-1. <mark type="inaudible" /> Tinkhana-1 and Ambar-1 were under evaluation at the end of 2010. Without taking into account, these two wells exploratory success ratio in Colombia was 36%.</p>
          <p>10 stratigraphic wells were drilled, of which six of them were presenting of hydrocarbons, two in Ca&#xF1;o Sur, Mago-1 and Draco-1 and for the Quifa blocks, Quifa 26, 24, 22 and Quifa 20. International exploratory activity including six wells, Palomino, Soluki and Krakatoa in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Runtusapa in Peru, and Malbec and Itauna-1 in Brazil. These lots were located offshore in the <mark type="inaudible" /> block BM-C-29 reported evidence of hydrocarbons.</p>
          <p>The seismic activity for the corporate group grows 60%, around 25,000 kilometer equivalent, mainly due to acquisition of information in the U.S. Gulf Coast. In Colombia, the largest activity was focused in Blocks number 8 and 10 of <mark type="inaudible" /> and in the heavy oil blocks in <mark type="inaudible" /> Basin. Also,39 blocks were granted to Ecopetrol in Colombia, Peru and the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>In terms of the production, the Corporate Group reached a level of 615,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010, rising with 18% compared to 2009. Ecopetrol account for 579,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day Hocol reached 27,000 barrel, Savia Ecopetrol participation 7,500 barrel, and 1,900 barrels per day coming from Ecopetrol America Inc. Ecopetrol production growth <mark type="inaudible" /> mainly Castilla, with 24% increase, Rubiales with 84% and Chichimene, with 58% growth.</p>
          <p>Ecopetrol increased its <mark type="inaudible" /> reserves by 11%, to 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent <mark type="inaudible" /> ratio is 9.1 years.</p>
          <p>Now I will return over the presentation to Pedro Rosales, who will comment on downstream results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, H&#xE9;ctor. Good afternoon, everyone. Let's go to slide eight to present the results on progress of downstream. In August 2010, diesel and gasoline hydrotreatment plant in Barrancabermeja has started operations, allowing Ecopetrol to produce fuels with low sulfur content. The modernization plan of Barrancabermeja Refinery completed its structuring and basic engineering phase while the Cartagena refinery signed the EPC contract, reaching a 17% progress at the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Gross margin in the Barrancabermeja Refinery was US$7.7 per barrel compared to $4.41 per barrel in 2009. The margins improved due to a higher average price of products compared with the cost of raw materials. The differential for the gross grew $4.97 per barrel while the price of the raw materials increased $1.68 per barrel.</p>
          <p>Total volume of crude and products transported grew 29% reaching 1.36 million barrels per day. The growth came mainly from fuels for export and nafta exported to the Llanos region to be used as diluent for heavy oils.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the company began to transport biodiesel through the pipeline. Regarding the new transportation infrastructure, <mark type="inaudible" /> subsidiary was incorporated. Ecopetrol owns a 55% stake in partnership with six other companies. This subsidiary undertook the construction and operation of the pipeline running from Casanare province to the Cove&#xF1;as port. This pipeline will transport the increasing production from the Llanos region.</p>
          <p>The crude evacuation program achieved significant growth in the transportation capacity. Main increases came from the additional transportation capacity in Castilla-Apiay from 80,000 to 140,000 barrels a day; in Vasconia-Barrancabermeja from 140,000 to 160,000 barrels per day; in Ocensa from 460,000 through 530,000 barrels per day; and Apiay-Monterrey pipeline from 160,000 to 210,000 barrels per day. This storage capacity at Vasconia station grew by 240,000 barrels. Additionally, the capacities of the dock facilities in Ayacucho rose from 8,000 to 10,000 barrels and in Banad&#xED;a from 3,000 to 10,000 barrels. The building of new dock facilities in these plants achieved progress allowing <mark type="inaudible" /> increases in capacity.</p>
          <p>In the biofuels business during the second half of the year Ecodiesel sold 38,000 tons of biodiesel of which approximately 30,000 tons were delivered to the Barrancabermeja refinery to be blended with regular diesel at 2% ratio.</p>
          <p>Finally Bioenergy, our ethanol from sugarcane subsidiaries were granted with the free zone status at the end of the year with more than 1,000 hectares of sugarcane cultivated.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide nine. In 2010, our sales volume grew 11% compared to 2009. Local sales accounted for 50.5% of total sales while export sales <mark type="inaudible" /> 49.5%. Exported volume increased 18%, twice local sales volume went up 4%. Growth in local sales was driven by the higher natural gas demand for generation of electricity and the rising demand of diesel mainly for vehicle and the higher jet fuel demand of air travel increased due to road closures during the rainy season.</p>
          <p>The major connection of our export was the U.S. Gulf Coast with 60% share for crude and 36% products. Other important market for oil exports were the Far East with 17% and Central America with 6%. For product exports the Caribbean accounted for 23% and the Far East for 20%.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the presentation back to Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pedro. Slide 10 shows the main milestone in corporate and social responsibility and internal consolidations during 2010. Regarding health, safety and environment, the number of barrels spilled due to operational situations dropped from 7,533 in 2009 to 5,108 barrels per day in 2010. The frequency of accidents reached 1.6 per million labor hours, 26% higher compared to year 2009. Given these situations the company launched different initiatives to reinforce the commitment with live cultural model to develop the core HSE skills and to revise the safety profit management system.</p>
          <p>Cost savings from organic optimization initiatives in supply chain amounted to COP$1 trillion, a 69% improvement compared to the COP$607 billion in 2009. Social investment amounted to COP$159 billion in 2010, 17% more than 2009. The new projects focused on geographical regions where the company operates and also our <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Finally, in 2010, the general design for the shared services center project was completed and began providing five services, personnel selection, performance monitoring, catering, maintenance, and local transportation. That remaining big, big services will be provided starting July 2011.</p>
          <p>Now I would turn over the presentation to Adriana Echeverri, who will comment on financial results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Let's move to slide 12, please. As Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez mentioned, results for the year were very positive. Higher crude oil prices and exported volumes drove the growth of 32% in total sales when compared with the year 2009. Exported sales grew 78%.</p>
          <p>On cost and expenses during 2010 there was a total increase of 20% when compared with last year. This is mainly due to a growth of 27% in variable costs as a result of higher imports of nafta used as diluent for heavy crude oil transportation, the increase in transportation services and the rise of amortization and depreciation expenses coming from new amortizable crude oil investments of the <mark type="inaudible" /> segment. Fixed costs grew 10% due to higher depreciation and increasing contracted services, maintenance and labor costs, all of these items leads to rising levels of production.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased 2.5% due to non-capitalized project expenses and the payment of compensations to clients because of their failure in deliveries of natural gas due to operational and weather factors at the beginning of 2010. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of exploration of project expenses because of lower recognition of dry wells. As a result of the above, operating income amounted to COP$13.2 trillion. This 63% of increase compared with 2009 reaching an operating margin of 36%.</p>
          <p>Regarding non-operating results, there was a net loss of COP$1.8 trillion in the year compared with COP$881 billion in 2009. This result was mainly due to a loss of COP$641 billion in subsidiaries accounted under the equity method.</p>
          <p>Finally, the increase in the operational income from rising production and sales together with higher prices contributed to a net income of COP$8.3 trillion. EBITDA amounted to COP$16.4 trillion in 2010, 57% higher than in 2009.</p>
          <p>In slide 13, we present our segments reports. Exploration and Production segment contributed COP$8.4 trillion of net income in 2010 helped mainly by the increasing crude oil <mark type="inaudible" />. The EBITDA for the year was COP$15 trillion.</p>
          <p>Refining and Petrochemical segment reported a net loss of COP$783 billion in 2010. This segment was affected by the high cost of crude oil <mark type="inaudible" /> refineries as well as by the non-operating losses coming from provisions, taxes and results <mark type="inaudible" /> which reported a loss of COP$385 billion.</p>
          <p>The Transportation segment generated a net income of COP$500.2 billion primarily from the incremental volume of crude oil, biodiesel and other fuels transported.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Supply and Marketing segment reported a net income of COP$224 billion coming from higher exported volume and favorable prices of purchases of crude oil during the last quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>It is worth to mention that Ecopetrol is continuously identifying and delivering cost control initiatives across all segments that should benefit the company result as a whole in the short term.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to slide 14 to give an overview of the company's cash flow and the balance sheet for the ending of last year. The company continued having strong cash generation. Initial balance for the year was COP$4.8 trillion. Operations generated additional cash worth COP$35.9 trillion. New debt contributed an additional COP$1 trillion and other sources, COP$1.4 trillion. The sources funded operations for COP$24.8 trillion, organic CapEx of COP$7.6 trillion, dividend payment of COP$3.7 trillion and the acquisition of BP assets in Colombia for COP$1.2 trillion. The ending cash balance was COP$5.6 trillion.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains solid with a low level of indebtedness. Assets amounted to COP$66.1 trillion and liabilities to COP$23.6 trillion including COP$1 trillion <mark type="inaudible" /> in December of last year and a higher provision for income tax given the increase in net income for the year.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 expands and main results of our subsidiaries in 2010. The most important remarks are the following: Total <mark type="inaudible" /> for the Corporate Group during 2010 amounted to COP$42 trillion, highest revenues were coming from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Group's net income amounted to COP$8.2 trillion. Subsidiaries with the highest net income were Ocensa, Hocol and Propilco. Group's EBTIDA was COP$16.7 trillion with an EBITDA margin of 40%, 2% higher than last year mainly due to a positive operational result of the Group.</p>
          <p>Now I turn the presentation again to Javier Guti&#xE9;rrez.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let's go to slide 17 to review the CapEx plan for 2011. CapEx plan for 2011 could amount up to $8.5 billion including approved project for $6.7 billion and a contingent budget of $1.8 billion for projects still pending for approval. 95% of the investments are allocated to projects in Colombia and the remaining 5% vested to exploration and production projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Brazil and Peru. 45% of the investment is allocated to production segment in order to increase Ecopetrol's production by 20% in 2011. The main contributions to production growth will come from heavy oil <mark type="inaudible" /> regions as well from the <mark type="inaudible" /> fields. 50% is allocated to exploration mainly to drill 37 wells of which <mark type="inaudible" /> and six stratigraphic wells. Another 50% is earmarked to the modernization project of Barrancabermeja and Reficar equity contribution.</p>
          <p>20% of the capital is allocated to the expansion of the transportation infrastructure increasing crude transportation capacity by 1,250,000 barrels per day and double the capacity to move nafta from 45,000 to 90,000 barrels per day. The remaining 5% is allocated to biofuels and corporate consolidation initials.</p>
          <p>Let's move forward to slide 18 to present the milestone for Ecopetrol in 2011. In exploration we expect to drill 37 exploratory wells, 30 in Colombia and seven outside the country. Average growth production for 2011 <mark type="inaudible" /> 750,000 barrels per day driven by the growth in our main field Castilla, Rubiales, Chichimene, Casabe, and <mark type="inaudible" /> as well as the starting of the natural gas treatment plant of 17 million cubic feet per day in Cusiana, 140 million in Cupiagua and 36 million cubic feet per day in <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>In transportation, we will make progress in the crude evacuation program and together with our partners we'll complete the first stage of the <mark type="inaudible" /> to 120,000 barrels per day and we would increase the Oleoducto Bicentenario capacity between to 120,000 barrels and we will increase the Oleoducto Bicentenario's capacity between Rubiales and <mark type="inaudible" /> by 200,000 barrels among other relevant projects.</p>
          <p>In our refineries, we will continue with the execution of the long-term plan to improve the performance of this business with a high conversion factor, heavier feedstock and high quality products, and we will search for a higher share in those markets that might offer the better prices to our crude products.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I would like to ask a question referring to the shares offering. I understand that the Colombian Congress authorized the company on an extra 9.9% primary offering. I would like to know if the company has a more precise timeframe on when it's expected to be conducted, and also if the target is to issue all the 9.9%, or if it's actually be targeted in terms of U.S. dollar amount and not in terms of percentual?

I would like to know a little bit about the timeframe of it, and if the company expect to issue all the 9.9% or a smaller amount?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think it's important to be precise in terms of the definition. First of all, it's important to remind that the Colombian Congress approved a capitalization process, law 1118 of 2006, to issue up to 20% of the shares of the company in a primary offering, resulted for the needs of the company. We went to the market in August 2007 with 10.1%, that was the precise number that we need to liberate Ecopetrol of certain limitations we've had at that time.</p>
          <p>Now we still have 9.9% available to go to the market. And, as we have mentioned several times, now the company is preparing to go to the market, and as we mentioned during the conference, with the second round of this process. Now we are under preparation, and we are going to announce the amount and the date when we are ready. Additionally, as you mentioned, the government, through <mark type="inaudible" /> approved the selling of up to 10% of the shares that the government owned in Ecopetrol.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> that it's going to be completely coordinated with Ecopetrol's administration, and <mark type="inaudible" /> it is completely clear up to now is that all <mark type="inaudible" /> that is under preparation is the offering of the second round of the 1118 <mark type="inaudible" /> law capitalization process. And, as I mentioned before, the amount of the 9.9% that we are going to offer <mark type="inaudible" /> definition by our Board of Directors, and we are in the process of the approval by the official entities that participate in the process, that is what we cannot announce and clearly, that is completely &#x2013; the time is that we're going to have a complete coordination between the Colombian government and the company, and we are completely aware of the importance of the protection of the price of the shares in the market.</p>

          <p>Hi. I have a question regarding the decline in revenue at Ocensa that generated a negative EBIT in the fourth quarter. I wonder if you could elaborate on the market conditions that brought that about, and if the situation, whatever that was, has normalized by the first quarter? Could you give us an update on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Adriana has the explanation. Please, Adriana.</p>

          <p>Hi, Sergio. The point here is that, as you know, all the transportation subsidiaries are supposed to keep all the revenues, or the benefits to the upstream segment, since they are transporting the volumes that we are supposed to realize at the international markets at better prices. Then, if you take a look to the transportation subsidiaries, they are with a net income of zero, or close to zero, something like that.</p>
          <p>In the case of Ocensa, what we had this year was a repayment of a kind of a premiums that was given by Pacific Rubiales during the year in order, to be taken into account into future expansions of the company to be able to viablize their future production. So, we received that, and that's why Ocensa seemed to have better net income.</p>
          <p>Then after that, Ocensa returned to the original situation. That was first &#x2013; the thing that happened in the first place, and the second thing that happened in the last year, very important, was the de-capitalization of the company. If you remember, there was a new company that was then incorporated in order to have those monies out of the company and have them free to be able to invest in the segment in another company that is now denominated Ecopetrol Transportation Investments. So, those were the most important events that happened in Ocensa in the last year. But it has nothing to do with the market conditions or something that was happening there, extraordinary different from those things.</p>

          <p>Yeah, hi, I have a quick question, quick question about CapEx, the $8.5 billion for 2011, does it include the acquisition budget and if not, do you have any acquisition budget for this year, and how much do you plan spend on acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nick. Any acquisition budget is included on the $8.5 billion plant investment plan. We would have <mark type="inaudible" /> need to be approved specifically by the Board of Directors and we must present it to the Board of Directors, but the current numbers doesn't include any acquisition.</p>
