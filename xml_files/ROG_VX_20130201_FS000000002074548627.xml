        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our year-end briefing here in New York. By now, I'm sure you have all seen the figures in more detail. So, let me right get into the overview of our 2012 results.</p>
          <p>Outgrown the markets in both divisions in Pharma and Diagnostics with 5% and 4%, respectively, and we could again increase core earnings per share above sales with 10% and a dividend increase of 8%.</p>
          <p>2012, we really made huge progress, both on the portfolio side, but also in terms of efficiency that we completed a number of programs and certainly the highlight on the portfolio side has been the progress we made in the HER2 breast cancer portfolio with Perjeta and T-DM1. But as you will see later, we are also ramping up an interesting pipeline to secure our MabThera/Rituxan franchise.</p>
          <p>A bit of support from the Swiss franc, which has weakened in 2012 against the dollar and the euro, so 7% up in Swiss francs versus the 4% group sales growth in constant currencies. More importantly, we have seen a positive development of the sales dynamic over the last two years. And, as you know, we predict to keep the sales growth on this level as we go forward into 2013.</p>
          <p>From a regional point of view, continued strong double-digit growth in the emerging markets, both in Asia and in Latin America. We saw a very robust sales growth in the U.S., probably better than we would have expected; 7% up on the Pharma side, 3% up on the Diagnostics side. And the same picture as at Q3, a slight decline in Europe.</p>
          <p>Operating profit up by 11%, so aside of that, margins up by two percentage points and you see the same picture on the cash flow side and we spoke about the dividend where we now have payout ratio of about 54%.</p>
          <p>Now, when we look forward, let me really start with the pipeline and the success we had in progressing our late-stage pipeline in 2012. 11 out of 14 late-stage trials delivered positive results. I mean this is really a great result and many highlights I already mentioned T-DM1 with EMILIA study and that of course is feeding our overall pipeline. We have now 70 new molecular entities in clinical development. We have nine new molecular entities in late-stage pivotal trials. And 2013 is really unprecedented in terms of Phase II data readouts. We've never had a situation like that.</p>
          <p>Of course, not all of those compounds will make it, I think it's 14 Phase II trials where we expect data this year. This is really amazing from purely a quantitative point of view and many opportunities here would have an enormous potential. This is only the Phase II studies, where we expect data readout in 2013. So this does not include PD-L2, which is already on the way to pivotal trials and it does not includes the earlier Phase II trials.</p>
          <p>So, to conclude, very confident for 2013 both on the top and on the bottom line. We expect sales to grow in line with 2012 and we except again our core earnings to increase ahead of sales. And you've seen we have also put in a floor for the dividend for 2013.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to handover directly to Dan for Pharmaceuticals. Dan?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well, good everybody from my side. It's a good pleasure to be here again in New York, this time talking about Pharma for the first time. And I have to say having been with Roche for 26 years away and Diagnostics for seven years and back to Pharma it's truly an honor to come back to this type of a pipeline, which I hope to speak you through. It has been, as Severin mentioned, a very exciting year in terms of the data and our portfolio in 2012. And if you look at 2013, I think equally exciting as we look forward.</p>
          <p>So, let me first start with reviewing the results in more detail for the Pharmaceutical Division; 5% growth overall driven on an absolute basis significantly from the United States and also the international region, maybe just a couple of comments on those two. The U.S. had, of course, the ongoing growth of the oncology portfolio ACTEMRA, but also had a very favorable fourth quarter I would say with Tamiflu as well.</p>
          <p>And I don't know how many of you got sick this year, but apparently, you had a very big season here in the United States. So, stay well. I think it's now on the decline. But it was a big month in December for Tamiflu and also a fairly good month in January for Tamiflu.</p>
          <p>In the international region, when you look at the 9% growth, if you look at the E7 countries, they grew by 14%. And as I'll show you later, countries like China growing 27%.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, we declined by 2% in a market that was declining by 5% or 6%. The important message here is that our product line &#x2013; the strategic products continue to drive growth even in economically challenged market environments, you do better than the market, I should say accordingly. So, Western Europe was driven ahead of the market significantly by the new oncology franchise. And of course, we have products like CellCept, like Bonviva that are going off patent in Europe, which are also causing some decline in that market.</p>
          <p>And then finally, Japan, this was one of the years that we had the biannual price declines in Japan. For our portfolio, it affected our portfolio by minus 6% starting in April of last year, so for three quarters. So, even with the minus 6% decline on the price cuts, we grew in Japan by 2%. Again, strong growth in the oncology portfolio. Our colleagues in Chugai have some of the highest market shares in some of the indications in our oncology portfolio, particularly Avastin. So, overall, well ahead of the marketplace with a 5% growth.</p>
          <p>Now that sales transcended right to the bottom line in terms of an increase in the core operating profit of 13%. You can see that the sales was a major driver of that good product mix. We also had a good control of our cost lines, our reduction in cost of sales, M&amp;D, R&amp;D and G&amp;A all under good control as we move forward. You'll see the royalty line; there are some one-off effects here for 2012 I just want to point your attention to. They deal with some milestone payments related to Eylea and some of the royalty income there, as well as some product disposables that we had on the Pharma side this year, so Rocaltrol.</p>
          <p>So not all of that obviously will be recurring as we head into the future, but strong 13% growth. On a percentage basis, we move the margin 3.1% up to 44% in the Pharma Division. And I keep reminding Severin that's pretty strong and at the higher end of the industry as we continue to look forward.</p>
          <p>So, what's driving this growth, I mean it's all about the pipeline. And again this gives you our scorecard for some of the major events in 2012 that hit, some that didn't hit. You've seen this, the only thing I would point out that's change from quarter three. As we told you at the half-year with our schizophrenia treatment for negative <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:11) bitopertin, the recruitment is progressing, but it's lower than we expected so we now expect data readout because of that in 2014.</p>
          <p>So, let me talk a little bit about the growth drivers and what the impact was on the 2012, try to give you a little bit of a guidance as well as we head into 2013. So, overall, we had 9% growth in our oncology portfolio, which is more than 60% of our business today and clearly our top three oncology products were a major driver to the growth yet again this year. So, Herceptin, MabThera, Avastin all growing strongly, but we also had good contribution from ACTEMRA, I'll talk a little bit about why that is and also Pegasys. It was really a pretty phenomenal year for Pegasys and I'll talk a little bit about the dynamics in that marketplace and what we expect for next year. And you can see these products have really offset the decline in the tail of our portfolio CellCept, NeoRecormon, Bonviva all going off patent in the markets. They more than offset the decline accordingly in those.</p>
          <p>So let's first take a look at the oncology portfolio. Let me give you some of the dynamics that are happening there. MabThera, strong growth in first-line maintenance in the United States and B-cell lymphoma in the emerging markets, 9% growth overall and a product by the way that has a 19% CAGR for the past 10 years. So these products, even though they have been on the market for quite some time, continued to find innovation in terms of their indications and also penetration into new markets.</p>
          <p>Herceptin, a very strong year at 11%, strong growth in the emerging markets; in China and in Brazil, we had more than 20% growth with Herceptin in those marketplaces. And very importantly in our established markets, our personalized healthcare approach is really paying dividends. So if you look at our growth even in the U.S., which is a highly penetrated market, the combination of working between Diagnostics and Pharma on some of the more sensitive specific assays for the Ventana HER2 dish has allowed us to increase actually share of patients in these marketplaces as well. We're not doing that just in the U.S., we're doing that around the world. But I think it shows the power of having these two divisions working closely together on products where it really makes the difference.</p>
          <p>The other thing I would say on Herceptin is we are experiencing a delay right now with a subcu filing relative to some questions that we've had relative to that filing. I would say the questions we have on Herceptin subcu, are not &#x2013; we're not having those questions on the MabThera subcu filing, so they're distinct and different from that perceptive.</p>
          <p>Avastin was a strong year &#x2013; a return to growth year for Avastin after 2011 metastatic breast cancer in the United States, 2012 returned to growth plus 6%, I'll talk a little bit about some of the growth drivers on that in the next slide. And Xeloda, 9% in United States and in other markets as well. Tarceva 2%.</p>
          <p>So, let's spend a little time on Avastin because a healthy growth in 2012 driven predominantly indication-wise by ovarian cancer and also colorectal cancer. Ovarian, it's actually the strongest launch we've had to-date of an Avastin indication, actually of an oncology indication at all within Roche. 34% new patient share in the front-line ovarian in Europe and still growth to move there.</p>
          <p>In colorectal, the treatment beyond multiple lines in both the U.S. and in Europe has allowed us to both secure, more business from the second-line, defend the business we have in second-line and actually encouraged some first-line business with the knowledge that clinicians have that they retain Avastin as a backbone therapy as we move through.</p>
          <p>And then finally the other indication is glioblastoma. We will be filing that this year in Europe and we'll be looking at the overall survival data on that and then having a discussing with the FDA accordingly. It is important to note that glioblastoma in the U.S., Avastin sales only accounts for about $170 million today, so it's not a large indication I would say for Avastin overall or in the United States.</p>
          <p>And the regions that are really driving the growth and we see driving the growth also next year are really Europe and also the emerging markets. The emerging markets we have more than 30% growth for Avastin in China, just to tell you how the strategy is working with these very innovative drugs, also in the emerging markets, where we have very differentiated strategies by country to drive our oncology portfolio.</p>
          <p>Well, it was also a very good year for product launches, as you know, launching three new cancer medicines last year, Perjeta, Zelboraf and Erivedge. Perjeta is after a good start, I'll show you that in the next slide. CHMP opinion, we have received a positive opinion in December, so we expect the approval in Europe most likely sometime in the first quarter of this year as well. Good uptake of Perjeta, demonstrating I think the benefit it brings on top of standard of care for HER2 patients.</p>
          <p>Zelboraf, nicely penetrated in the U.S., I would say, almost fully penetrated in the U.S. today and still in the process of penetrating in Europe and we also filed the indication &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; we began the study with the MEK inhibitor by enrolling patients in the combinations Zelboraf, MEK inhibitor study for Phase III.</p>
          <p>Erivedge, this is a product that we've launched now in the United States. We expect approval sometime in 2013. We've had some good uptake, this is a relatively smaller indication basal cell carcinoma, and we're still learning frankly where these patients are and how best to treat them in the markets that we're working in, but where patients are treated and when we get to the key thought leaders, the utility of this product, the reaction to the product is very, very good.</p>
          <p>And then finally T-DM1, we expect the PDUFA date for that in the United States at the end of February. We expect the decision on that also in Europe in 2013, again this is for the second-line indication. And very importantly, the MARIANNE study has now fully enrolled and we're expecting data on that in the first half of 2014, which most of you know is the first-line trial in combination with Perjeta.</p>
          <p>So maybe just a pause here because it's all fine to look at these four products, but when you really think of it from a patient perspective, what has happened to the standard of care in HER2-positive breast cancer. If I just take you back 10 years, chemotherapy in the second-line setting &#x2013; first-line &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; metastatic setting provided about six months overall survival, Herceptin provided about 12, Perjeta and Herceptin are now up to 18 months and depending on how things work with MARIANNE, but the profile suggests that we can potentially move that up to almost two years.</p>
          <p>I mean, to take a product like Herceptin and improve upon that, for me is very motivating. And I would say of course that moving these into the earlier lines of therapy is really where we're now working with the programs like APHINITY for Perjeta in the adjuvant setting. And we'll look at that for the other indications as well.</p>
          <p>So, looking a bit at Perjeta, still early days after two quarters, but very encouraging launch in the United States. You can see here the uptake on weekly volume. This actually carries you through January to show you there's no year-end effect, 53% increase quarter four versus quarter three. We have now more than 75 physicians that have had experience with the drug, putting patients on drug. And our patient share continues to increase.</p>
          <p>Important to note that the NCCN guidelines adjusted in November to allow patients that had previously started with Herceptin in the first-line setting, but still on the early stages of their therapy to add Perjeta. So, we look forward to continuing this launch in the United States and also introducing it in Europe as well.</p>
          <p>And moving outside of oncology just to give you an idea of some of the other key brands, Lucentis &#x2013; it was a challenging year for Lucentis with the launch of Eylea. We did lose share in the AMD segment as you can see here very clearly at the launch of Eylea and we were able to gain some of that share back with our launch of DME. So overall, we expect net share to have a slight decline in Lucentis, the same dynamics will exist, increasing sharing of the market, if you like, at AMD, some increase in DME, but overall a slight decline as we head into next year.</p>
          <p>We are looking forward to having the PRN dosing in February of this year and to allow that dosing interval to expand and to be used in a way that's more convenient for patients moving forward.</p>
          <p>On the Pegasys side, this was a strong year as you saw from the numbers. I just want to guide you and warn you a little bit that we are now in a different stage of Pegasys and you can see this already in the fourth quarter of the U.S. So, what does this mean? What this means is that the patients in the Unites States that have been taken out of the warehouse and treated on Pegasys are now coming off of therapy. And already what we have is new patients are being put into warehousing, expecting the interferon-free therapies that that will come in a couple of years.</p>
          <p>So, we would expect in the U.S. to continue to see a decline next year. In Europe, we would expect to see slightly &#x2013; slightly different dynamics because the triple combination was a little bit delayed there. But overall, very moderate performance next year in Western Europe. And in international regions, we will still see a strong demand in Pegasys because of the importance of interferon therapy as a backbone therapy there. Overall, I would say that we expect this franchise to continue to decline as we go into 2013 as well.</p>
          <p>Now, one of the very exciting data points for 2012 was ACTEMRA. This comes in two pieces really, but the ADACTA trial, which was head-to-head against Humira in the monotherapy segment show significant advantages in terms of all the ACR endpoints as well as the 28 endpoint, which came out as you see in the third quarter of &#x2013; or actually the second half of last year and you can see the tremendous increase in our share from 10% to 25% now. And essentially in the monotherapy segment, there is a sharing of the market by Enbrel, Humira and ACTEMRA. But, obviously, we have an upward trend. We think with the very strong head-to-head data on ACTEMRA, we'll continue to penetrate in the monotherapy segment.</p>
          <p>In terms of the U.S., we also received approval for the first-line biologic use in October although we're &#x2013; we have some use in that segment, this will allow us to use the preponderance of data that we have on ACTEMRA in the U.S. market in a promotional way, which should also help us moving forward.</p>
          <p>And that finally the subcutaneous formulation &#x2013; as you know, the subcutaneous is a big portion of this market, was filed in the U.S. and EU in December 2012 and we would expect news on that most likely early 2014 at this stage.</p>
          <p>So, just a quick glimpse of the emerging markets. 27% growth in China, 14% in Russia, 11% in Brazil driven by the oncology portfolio, driven by the access strategies that we put in place, really very specific to each market, whether it's the capping program in China or the use of moving into the public sector in Brazil, we feel that these emerging markets will continue to drive our innovative portfolio as we head into 2013 as well.</p>
          <p>So closing on the outlook, lots of work to be done in 2013. We still have the launches in 2012 that will get approval in Europe and still in the uptake in the U.S. The things I would point to your attention to here, Avastin. We did received treatment beyond multiple lines, so rolling that out in Europe and the United States. Perjeta, of course, the EU approval I would draw your attention to. T-DM1 in both U.S. and Europe. And then very excitingly since our year-end, but also the press release that went on yesterday on GA101.</p>
          <p>The news on GA101, we're very encouraged by in the CLL setting. You have seen that we have a significant difference now between GA101 and chemotherapy, and we will be showing more data on this at ASCO. The other thing we did pass in this stage I of the study was the futility analysis for the head-to-head GA101, MabThera, which means that we are seeing an early effect there and we will continue to the end of the study on that. So, we are very encouraged by the GA101 news in CLL, and the programs in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma continue.</p>
          <p>The Phase II programs, as Severin said, unprecedented year. I'd just make a comment on a few of them. Obviously not all of these will make it, but they are all designed to be first-in-class or best-in-class compounds, the anti-EGFL7 in solid tumors is designed to be used in conjunction with Avastin to prolong and deepen the effect.</p>
          <p>The P selectin in MabThera looks interesting from a scientific standpoint and also the early data in cardiovascular disease and the other one is anti-PD-L1, the immunotherapy that we have, could really be a change in the backbone therapy for a lot of our oncology combinations as we move forward. So, we, like you, will be very excited to see the data on these as we go throughout the year, and see which ones are actually successful in Phase II.</p>
          <p>So, in closing, 2013 will be a year where the oncology portfolio continues to be a major driver both the established products and newly launched products as well as ACTEMRA and the growth in the emerging markets and we look forward to seeing further news on TDM-1 Perjeta and the Phase II studies that I just discussed before.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I'm going to turn it over to Roland to cover Diagnostics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dan. It's a pleasure to be able to present the results for Diagnostics today. We go straight to the sales. Severin mentioned 4% growth overall for the division, which is growth above the market certainly led by our Professional, Molecular, and Tissue franchises, so the entire lab and hospital diagnostics business doing very well, growing 8% together. And on the other hand, decrease in sales on Applied Science largely due to less funding in the public sector, but also some portfolio restructuring that we undertook in 2012.</p>
          <p>Diabetes Care impacted by price pressure and some reimbursement cuts in major European markets. But the highlight certainly the Professional Diagnostics sales outgrowing the market two-fold with an 8% growth.</p>
          <p>And going straight to the P&amp;L, profitability impacted by the price pressure on Diabetes Care and you can see this on the bottom line with the minus 2%. Couple of comments on the different lines here. The royalty income higher. We received back royalties from 2011, which were booked in 2012 as a result of some settlements on different licenses and then also an impact on the G&amp;A line as you can see where we release provision for royalties as well. This coupled with some IT project expenses.</p>
          <p>Then cost of sales largely investing in our installed base. M&amp;D investing also in the sales force and continues investments in the emerging markets. And then some discipline around the R&amp;D despite many programs in new technologies under development.</p>
          <p>What's worth mentioning and Alan will talk to this later. The division increased the operating free cash flow by 43%, focus on net working capital and especially on the accounts receivables also in Southern Europe. Several launches, I'm not going to take you through the list here, but 80% launch accuracy which actually helped us achieved the above market growth, a host of new products hitting the markets in the different segments in the different regions.</p>
          <p>And talking about the regions; very strong growth in the emerging markets. You can see here, Asia-Pacific, Latin America both growing 15%, China, India growing 26% actually, Middle East with strong growth contribution. But also in Japan you can see 7% growth, which is about three times the market growth. And then I would like to draw your attention also to EMEA minus 1%, if we exclude it for Diabetes Care, we grew 2% in Europe in the core IVD business, which is again taking market share and similarly in the U.S. growing 5% excluding Diabetes Care. So strong performance of the core laboratory business.</p>
          <p>Some details about the fourth quarter, and you can see of course the growth as I mentioned driven by Professional Diagnostics, but some good flows-through of approvals, especially in the U.S. And then also in Molecular Diagnostics, good momentum, good traction on the HPV franchise. We contracted 86 labs in 2012 in the U.S. for HPV. We're also expecting the data, the three-year ATHENA data to come through this year, so good traction there on the HPV business.</p>
          <p>And allow me to spend a little more time on the Professional Diagnostics, where we really have a strong business going forward, growing above the market. I mentioned that we are really true to our business model of continuing to install instruments into the markets; you can see here 13% more installed instruments last year compared to 2011.</p>
          <p>And then a continuously expanding menu, which is really paramount to have the flows-through of the assays through the installed base. We have more than 55,000 COBAS instruments installed across the world, which contributed to sales and in particular here, if we focus on immunology, which is really a success story. If you look at more than 10 years of double-digit growth in immunology, 15% last year in total serum work area, we performed more than 8 billion tests last year, and this really is continuing to fuel our growth. And at the same time, we want to invest in this business continuously and we plan to actually double capacity in our facility in Germany. And we plan to also carry-forward the very good, very strong relationship we have with our partner, Hitachi, now 35 years going forward.</p>
          <p>Another business, within Professional Diagnostics with growth potential point of care. And you can see here that we are well represented with a solid portfolio across the different areas in point of care, be that the hospital wards, all the way to the physician office and then also for patient home or self-testing.</p>
          <p>And new products coming to the market, the b 101, for lipid cholesterol testing. And also on the coagulation side, 8% growth in a business that is actually &#x2013; I have seen the advent of the new anti-coagulant drug, so there very strong performance still.</p>
          <p>Going forward into Diabetes Care, we are continued to be committed in what we believe is a good business, 370 million people that suffer from diabetes worldwide and that number continues to increase. We see a lifestyle changes in emerging markets. We see also continuous struggle with obesity and overweight people in the Western world and we feel we have a very comprehensive portfolio here to address the different areas of the business and the different segments.</p>
          <p>We have different portfolios &#x2013; different products I should say in the different portfolios. I will continue to differentiate with our products in this marketplace, providing people with diabetes with better solutions with more integrated approach, as you can see here for the Accu-Chek Mobile which has had a very good uptake, 26% growth last year in the countries where we introduced it. And I should mention also that the Diabetes Care business continues to provide really good strong cash flows.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Applied Science, I mentioned earlier, some restructuring of the portfolio and the focus in select areas where we believe in high growth opportunities, one of them you can see here our long-lasting franchise in the qPCR was a new system which addresses the very important mid-volume segment; easy to use, innovative approach, innovative system and a very successful uptake in the market since the launch, almost 100 instruments sold in the first seven weeks since launch.</p>
          <p>And then in sequencing, our own franchise with the long reach, where we continue to expand, we have partnerships around developing a more comprehensive work flow. We retained the sequence capture technology from the arrays business and we continue to look for launching also certain panels, neurology and oncology going forward. And on the other hand, we continue to have opportunities with our external partners with whom we work very closely together in developing this technology.</p>
          <p>Let me just spend one minute on companion diagnostics and Dan mentioned the HER2 franchise, this is an example from a commercial perspective in China and we have a lot of collaborations internally in R&amp;D, more than 200 between Pharma and Diagnostics Divisions. This one, the commercial impact, we're able to actually double our sales in Tissue Diagnostics. Last year in China, we trained, educating more than 1,000 histopathology labs in the value of testing early, accurately for the very aggressive HER2 breast cancer diagnostics, which, as you know, if you can capture it early, much better survival chances and then of course also leading the patients to access to Herceptin, so a really integrated successful approach here.</p>
          <p>2013, numerous new launches across our strategy in developing the testing efficiency, so providing instruments to the labs to enable them to run their laboratories efficiently. At the same time, also, contributing to the high medical value aspect through novel differentiating test of whom we have quite a few interesting ones here. I just mentioned the CINtec Plus, which will be working alongside the HPV test and then actually being able to diagnose pre-cancer in women, which are supposed to be at risk.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the outlook, we'll continue to see sustained growth &#x2013; sales growth from the leading IVD business as I mentioned further expanding our installed base and showing that we expand the flow-through with new tests and then focusing, of course, on opportunities in the emerging markets, investing in the growth in these markets, stabilizing diabetes care and we of course want to continue the successful collaboration companion diagnostics wanting to be the partner of choice not just for our in-house development, but also for external pharma.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation. Thank you very much. And I'd like to handover to Alan for the financials.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks a lot, Roland. What I'm going to talk about is four points. First about the profit growth, which is pretty much about the P&amp;L, then about the deleveraging, which is about the balance sheet and then about the fund statement in the focus on cash area. Last but not least, a couple of comments on the outlook.</p>
          <p>When you look at the highlights of 2012, the core EPS growth of 10% really documents and shows that we're really able to bring our sales growth to the bottom line and this was on one hand driven from the productivity programs and you might have two major events online here. One is the operational excellence program. We committed to the market to realize CHF2.4 billion in savings. CHF1.8 billion we had realized until the end of 2011, so we had CHF600 million to deliver in the course of 2012, which we did.</p>
          <p>The other point is about the programs that we have started at the half year 2012 and this has been in Diabetes Care, in Applied Science, in IT and then in Pharma R&amp;D/the closure of Nutley site. I will come back to that later on. But these programs also contributed to the productivity improvement in 2012.</p>
          <p>Cash flow and balance sheet is something I will did into later on and then about the dividends and Severin has not mentioned it here in the beginning. The Board has proposed to the AGM that the dividend will be increased by 8% going from CHF6.8 to CHF7.35, which is going to be the 26th increase, consecutive increase of the dividend of Roche. And when you look at the outlook and Severin has shown it already then you see we have the 27th increase already in sight.</p>
          <p>When you look at our major financial key figures, I think sales has been elaborated about, when you look at the core operating profit, up 11%. In Swiss francs, even up by 13%. So, we had quite some momentum coming from sales on one hand, but as said from the productivity programs as well.</p>
          <p>The core net income is, let's say, kind of translations where we brought the growth from the core operating profit to the core net income, and we brought it to the core EPS. And look at the cash generation, I'm going to talk about, but let me mention the growth rate right here, 12% up for the operating free cash flow in Swiss francs and for the free cash flow even 19% up.</p>
          <p>I think this is a very important slide illustrating how 2012 went. And this is quite a difference to 2011. What this slide shows, is the core operating profit in 2011 and on the right hand side you see the core operating profit 2012, but in between you see what has happened in the course of 2012.</p>
          <p>The major point is right in the middle is the sales growth. So the sales growth, which contributed to core operating profit, was CHF1.7 billion. We were able to overcompensate the pricing pressure that we had in the markets. In the one hand, we had the pricing pressure in Europe roughly 2% to 3% on our sales on the Pharma side.</p>
          <p>When you look at Japan, 6% price cuts in the markets, in Pharma. And then had Diabetes Care, the headwind that Roland described in his previous presentation. We were able to overcompensate that, if you were looking at the same slide and we have shown it in 2011. In 2011, we were just able to bring our profits up by productivity programs. This year, we really benefited from the sales dynamics. And certainly, that productivity programs also helped us here to really increase the momentum.</p>
          <p>And look at the P&amp;L, and as said, sales, I think is evident and described by Roland and Dan. When we look at the royalties and the other operating income up 17% in absolute terms, CHF363 million. And on one hand, when you look at the royalty income driven by Lucentis, up CHF86 million, driven by Eylea, and milestone payment plus royalties CHF73 million and also Humira and Soliris contributed to this line.</p>
          <p>Then we had disposals and disposal income. And the disposal income was driven by Ostac, a product that we sold roughly 30 million, but also by Rocaltrol, a product that we sold by roughly 50 million.</p>
          <p>We went down a little bit in out-licensing income. When we look at the cost of sales and the cost of sales is really the area where the productivity programs really, really show, we were able to stabilize our cost of sales and that's really driven by the productivity programs. We had on one hand higher collaboration sales. We had lower royalty expenses in this line, but that pretty much netted out. It's really coming down to our operating performance.</p>
          <p>M&amp;D, well, better utilization of existing infrastructure, lower bad debt expenses that we have had. Certainly, also due to the fact that we worked heavily on our accounts receivables in Southern Europe already starting in 2011. So, I think we were able to really to come up here with a reasonable growth rate. And then R&amp;D, and as mentioned, we had really taken action in the middle of this year in Nutley and certainly this also shows to a certain extent on the R&amp;D line, which is pretty stable with an increase up 2%.</p>
          <p>And, then we have the SG&amp;A and let me explain this. Administration expenses went up by 2% and to be precise by 1.51%, so a pretty reasonable increase. So, where is the rest of the increase coming from? 2 percentage points are coming from the release of a provision in 2011, Roland mentioned it in his presentation, roughly CHF30 million; and the other 2 percentage points are driven by IT systems where we have invested in and which will surely give us additional benefits in the future. So, core operating profit all in went up by 11%, 13 in Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>The margins were mentioned already, but for the group, we went from 35.6% to 37.7% in the core operating profit margin. You see really the uptick in Pharma, going from 40.9% to 44%, and then you see Diagnostics, and the decline in Diagnostics is majorly driven by Diabetes Care.</p>
          <p>The restructuring programs and this slide should remind you on the slide that we have shown at half year when we started the programs and we started to announce them. So, you see three boxes, the restructuring costs, the net savings, and the reinvestments and the P&amp;L impact. I can assure you here the net savings and the reinvestments nothing has changed in these boxes. We are fully committed to bring the savings and the reinvestments and the P&amp;L impact as outlined at half year. What has changed slightly is on the restructuring cost side and changed is also &#x2013; is just the first bar, the CHF1.33 billion we came up at yearend of 2012. Let me dig a little bit into this because on one hand there is Diagnostics, the CHF396 million and this is CHF187 million goodwill impairment, it is roughly CHF180 million personnel costs and site closure costs which have triggered this number.</p>
          <p>IT is personnel-related costs with CHF49 million, and then we have Pharma R&amp;D/Nutley with CHF885 million, CHF381 million coming from impairment in PP&amp;E, CHF188 million coming from personnel-related costs, net of a curtailment gain in pension that we have had from the change of the pension plan and on top of that we have environmental provisions taken for Nutley of CHF243 million. The rest is really unchanged compared to what we have shown you already at half year so you see the CHF1.44 million restructuring cost, full year 2012 and a little bit onwards, is still our estimate.</p>
          <p>The financial results; when we look at 2011, we came up with a number of minus CHF1.6 billion. In 2012, we've ended with minus CHF1.8 billion. And, this is not an obvious development as we are really on course of bringing our debt down but let me lead you through this. When you look at the currency impact, these are very much driven by the year 2011. We had, in 2010, an event of revaluation of currencies in Venezuela and really prepared for that and took that in account. And, then in 2011, there was really an amendment to this change of currencies in Venezuela. So, we had to release certain impacts that we had accounted for in 2010, which gave us a positive in 2011 of CHF45 million. In addition, we had in 2011 transaction gains which we normally don't have but, okay, it happened in this year. These both are pretty much explaining the CHF100-million negative impact you see in 2012. Then, we have the bond redemptions. We were proactive in the market, and whenever we have an opportunity really to realize a positive NPV, we go for that and we did that in 2012 and did more bond redemptions compared to the year 2011.</p>
          <p>Then, you see the net interest income. Well, interest rates came down so also our income in that section came down. Equity gains, we were not as active as a year before, and then interest expense, plus CHF45 million and there might be &#x2013; or there might have been the expectation that this is a higher number but look really at our gross debt situation. We started with gross debt into the year 2012 approximately CHF26 billion and we brought that down to CHF24.5 billion at the end of the year. Well, we can all expect, well, a more significant step in the course of 2013, but we were pretty flattish when it comes to gross debt in course of 2012.</p>
          <p>When you look at the tax rate, it looks a little bit challenging, but in fact, there is a very good reason behind we went from 21.3% to 22.7%, in constant rates to 22.4%. The major trigger here is the U.S. Our sales went up quite significantly evidently. Our profit situation improved as well and, certainly, this is a high cost country or a high tax rate country and that's really reflected in our group tax rate.</p>
          <p>This is, well, a heads-up for 2013 and that's why I raised the topic of IAS 19 because it's going to be effective this year and it's going to pensions. We will have an effect in 2013 and let me really lead you through this. It will affect pretty much every company accounting on IFRS. When you look at the balance sheet, actual gains and losses, you might know what we do. We book our extra gains and losses in OCI directly against the equity. And, this is, let's say, now the obligation coming with IAS 19 so there's no chance for us on the balance sheet. We go on as we did in the last years. When you look at the net financial income, though, we will have a change. When you look at the P&amp;L return on plan assets, under IAS 19, you are obliged to bring your return on plan assets down to the discount rates that you apply normally.</p>
          <p>In our case, when you look really at the average, we have huge return on plan assets, in average of 4.87%. The discount rate that we have applied is 3% roughly. So, what's going to happen in 2013 is we will have an additional expense of CHF161 million pre-tax coming from this change as that effective in 2013. So that means in 2013 we will adjust the numbers for 2012 accordingly. Important is certainly this won't hit our growth rates. So, the growth rates are really like-for-like, apples-to-apples, and so they are pretty valid which is important when you look at the guidance. But, when you look at the absolute numbers, certainly there will be an impact on core EPS but it should be less than 1%.</p>
          <p>Deleveraging the balance sheet; when you look at the balance sheet, three points I would like to mention. When you look at the asset side, cash and marketable securities went from CHF11.3 billion to CHF14 billion, an increase of 28%. So, really cash piled in the course of 2012. But, you might have seen we have a major maturity coming up at the beginning of 2013. We still have &#x20AC;3.3 billion outstanding in a Eurobond. We have done some tenders on this bond already but still &#x20AC;3.3 billion is with us and we will take this cash and pay the bond back at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>When you look at the equity and the liabilities, you see a move in the current liabilities, going up by 27%, whereby the non-current liabilities go down by 7%. And, this is nothing else and really triggered by the maturities of our debt that some long-term debt is now you find it now in the short-term debt line. That's all what's happening here. And, then you see the equity which went up by 19%. And, when I talk about the equity, let me remind you on the situation you have seen in 2009 where we really accounted and really, well, booked the cash-out for Genentech directly against the equity, which brought our equity down to CHF9.4 billion. And, you see the equity ratio at that time was 13% and we steadily climbed up to 26% in the year 2012.</p>
          <p>And, look at our debt situation, then let me here &#x2013; let me explain the chart first. You see really with the bars the total assets and the net debt development and then you see the ratio, net debt on total assets. You're not seeing the full year here only, you're also seeing the half year. So, why did we introduce the half year on that slide? Because, well, we pay the dividends in the first half and it's quite a significant dividend which triggers a net debt increase normally in the course of the half year and then we go down until the end of the year. Let me go to the most important figures. When you compare end of 2011 with end of 2012, and I'll start with the net debt, end of 2011 CHF15.6 billion and we went down to CHF10.6 billion so quite a reduction we have seen, which I think signals the strong cash generation. And, then you see really the ratio, net debt on total assets went from 25%, down to 16%. As you all know, our target is to be in the corridor between 0% and 15%. So, we have not reached this corridor yet.</p>
          <p>So, I want to go through the maturity slides in every detail but two points to mention here. The first point is, when you really look back to the debt we took on the balance sheet when the Genentech transaction happened, 52% of this debt is paid back already. And, when you really look at early repayment in 2013, pretty much in green and in blue, you will also see that we have major repayments in 2013 to come, which certainly will reduce the gross debt significantly.</p>
          <p>Good. With that, let's go to the fund statement and to the cash flow. You see on this slide the operating free cash flow and the free cash flow generation over the last three years and the operating free cash flow margin. When you look at the operating free cash flow margin, it went from 32.3% to 33.8%. In absolute numbers, the free cash flow &#x2013; the operating free cash flow went from 13.7% to 15.4%, so up 10%. Where is this coming from? Certainly, the vast majority is triggered by the good operational performance that we have had.</p>
          <p>We had a slight net working capital increase, lower though than 2011. Then, we had a modest increase when it comes to CapEx. When you look at the free cash flow, we went from CHF3.9 billion to CHF4.6 billion, up 15%. And what are, let's say, the major elements here? First, the out &#x2013; cash-out from treasury was pretty stable, 2012 compared to 2011. We paid, admittedly, higher taxes in 2012; difference is roughly CHF700 million, triggered by the better business in the U.S. on one hand, but also Chugai, and the other point is we settled some obligations.</p>
          <p>Cash flow and, when you look at the divisions, this is what this slide is really targeting on. Then you see the Pharma division went up from 39.4% cash flow yield to 39.9%, so quite an improvement. Remarkable is what happened to Diagnostics and Roland has touched on it already, saying that the operational cash flow really went up by 43%. When you look at the cash flow margin, it went up from 12.9% to 17.8% and underlines the cash flow generation of this business.</p>
          <p>We worked heavily, as I've mentioned, on our accounts receivable situation in Southern Europe and I got a lot of questions about this situation. As you see, we were able, in the course of 2012, to reduce our exposure in Southern Europe in accounts receivables by &#x20AC;500 million which is equivalent to CHF623 million and this went straight here to us as cash. It was wonderful and certainly helped us to mitigate the net working capital increase.</p>
          <p>When you really go through the countries, I could tell you a long story about every country. When you take a look at Greece, the major action in Greece happened in 2011. So, we are pretty happy with the stable situation that you're seeing over there and, in all the other countries, we were able to decrease the accounts receivables quite significantly.</p>
          <p>That leaves me with the outlook and let me talk about currency impacts first. As Severin has mentioned already at the beginning, the Swiss franc has weakened &#x2013; the average Swiss franc rate has weakened compared to major currencies in 2012, notably the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, also slightly against the euro, which gave us a positive impact in on our numbers as you see.</p>
          <p>Going forward for 2013, and you might know how we address this, the chart that you see on the right-hand side, we see impacts on sales, core operating profit, and core EPS is triggered by the assumption that we keep all the currency rates at yearend stable, moving forward, until the end of 2013. And, then you see what the impact would be on sales, core operating profit, and core EPS if this assumption is stable until yearend, not very likely, so this is one scenario that we are showing to you. You've seen that since yearend we had quite a volatility in currency rates. We looked at its &#x2013; the impact yesterday again, and as of yesterday, the impacts would be quite comparable as outlined on this slide.</p>
          <p>So, it leaves me with the outlook and Severin went through it already. So, there's not a lot of &#x2013; to mention from my side. Let me say two things. First of all, this outlook is really a commitment to further work on the productivity and the efficiency of Roche and really to drive that further as we have done in 2012. And, the other point is it really shows our belief in the fundamentals and really in the great strengths of our business.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to thank you for your attention, and we are happy to take your questions. Thanks.</p>

          <p>In regard to the antibody drug conjugates, what are the limits &#x2013; this should be for Daniel. What are the limits to which these might be applicable in various oncology settings? Are there some cancers where you don't think it's going to work, in other words?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, perhaps I can start with a general comment and perhaps then, Dan, I can hand over to you for what is in the portfolio. Now, what you need is you need receptors at the cells, which really internalize the antibody, and that is the limitation. So, it is not working for every antibody because, if the antibody is not internalized in the cell where a toxin then can be released, then you wouldn't have the effect. So, T-DM1 is one of the examples where the antibody docks at the receptor, then it's internalized into the cell, the toxin is released and kills the cells. So that is a limitation. So, it is not a platform which you can apply for any disease, for any antibody. It needs a lot of understanding of the underlying diseases and also the technical solutions, how you link the antibody with the toxin can differ quite a lot. So, it's something where you need a lot of knowhow. It's not by chance that it took literally decades until we had the first ADC with T-DM1, and now of course, we leverage this knowhow as we go forward. And, there is quite a pipeline ramping up of ADCs, Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, just to talk a bit about the pipeline; of course, as you know, the most advanced one is T-DM1 which has actually surprisingly, even to us, strong data in the second-line setting. And, then the other two ones &#x2013; to your points about whether it's solid tumor or lymphomas, is there any limitation beyond what Severin said about the receptors, we have a pretty broad program. So, we have more than 20 ADCs now. The next most mature ones beyond T-DM1 would be the two in lymphoma, leukemia, the ADC 22, ADC 79, which are both programs in Phase II right now, being looked at for lymphoma, CLL first. And, then we have a host in Phase I, different disease states, from prostate to colorectal to some others in lymphoma. So, there isn't any particular solid tumor or blood-based tumor that it necessarily wouldn't work in. But, to Severin's point, it really then is important that we understand the antibody targets within those particular diseases. So, a strong program and I also think the linkers are equally important.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is &#x2013; it's for Alan. It's on slide number 58 where you talk about the &#x2013; how the productivity improvements offset the pricing pressure that you saw in Diabetes in Japan and then in the EU. Just looking at these categories of pricing pressure, I am not so sure that they are going away anytime soon. Diabetes probably will continue to face some pressure. The Japanese price cuts happen every two years. And, we're not sure EU austerity, there is a lot of countries in EU, so any one of them could do something. Do we need ongoing productivity improvements in order for you to realize your sales growth potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to give it a first...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. We had a good discussion about that yesterday already. Yeah, first of all, I think &#x2013; let me outline once again. I think we have good momentum when it comes to sale growth. I think the outlook gives you also a little bit of a feel how we see really this year evolving going forward and, certainly, I think these price pressures is something which will be with us to a certain extent. Let me outline Japan. We had a 6% price cut in Japan in 2012, which is a biannual price cut, but we're going to see this again in 2014. We will see what the hit is going to be in the year 2014. EU austerity, well, 2% to 3% I think is something, well, we have to deal with to a certain extent; when you compare it with the previous years, pretty comparable, the hit that we have taken over there. But, the major point is with the pipeline we are having and Dan I think can talk and elaborate much better about this than I can. I think, really, we have a good momentum, really, to further overcompensate. But productivity, as said, also connected to the outlook. Productivity and efficiency gains is something we still will work on and where we put emphasis on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add from a strategic point of view, because you ask an extremely relevant question, I agree with you the price pressures will not go away. There's just no doubt. If anything, it will increase because the underlying issues which the states have -or the countries have is not resourced, but huge budget deficits as such, huge pressure on public households &#x2013; okay &#x2013; pressure on public households and as such certainly pressure on healthcare spending, which eventually means price pressure for us. There's no doubt about that. And that is actually where you see our strategy paying off. It's exactly the reason why we keep focusing on innovation. That is why we keep this razor sharp focus on our core two business &#x2013; on our two core businesses, Pharma and Diagnostics, leveraging the opportunities, of course, of those business but not diversifying into other areas because at the end of the day the decisive point for payers will be where do you get the incremental benefit for the buck you invest into healthcare, where do you have the biggest incremental value for the patient. And, in the long term, you can only create incremental value by innovation.</p>
          <p>But, I think &#x2013; I just want to make the point; I think now where this becomes more evident. We see how this strategy is starting to pay off. If you look in Europe, for example, the overall market has been under price pressure, price decrease of approximately 6%. Now, our prices have been reduced by 2% to 3% and that, at the end of the day, is a reflection of the value and the innovation we bring with our medicines. Anything you want to add, Dan, from your side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I just &#x2013; back to the &#x2013; you need really outstanding differentiations to succeed in these markets and that's why I tried to point out the 6, 12, 18, 24 months in HER2. They're just not small incremental gains. They're fundamental changes to the disease. I am not suggesting that we won't run into challenges in terms of reimbursement as we approach Perjeta and T-DM1, although in the United States, things have been growing very well with Perjeta. But, our ability to get those value price &#x2013; or what we bring to the equation much, much better when you have this type of differentiated data. And, can you imagine if we bring that, hopefully, into adjuvant setting and be able to take what is today, Herceptin, 50% of patients from &#x2013; moving on to metastatic disease, if you could take that up to 60%, 70%, or 80%, I think then you have a story for a healthcare system that would put it at the top of the funding pile.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and just on the efficiencies maybe one other thing because it is something we will continue to work on. Look, obviously, our R&amp;D budget is precious to us. It's something we want to make sure we're investing in the very best products in our pipeline, and so our development group is equally looking to how do we make things more efficient, and we've looked at a project where we look at how do we really reduce the cost on an average candidate basis to bring it from Phase II to Phase III. I'm really happy to say we've made tremendous progress there, from everything, like, where we source our clinical trials, to the type of data we collect on our clinical trials. It's very easy to over-collect data, but to collect the most critical data. So, there's so many initiatives within the company. I don't want you to think we've taken our eye off the initiatives to be more efficient. And, I think the people are passionate about it because they know, if they can improve the efficiency, we can fund more drugs and put more drugs through our pipeline, which we're in a good opportunity to be able to do.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Dan. Can we have the next question please?</p>
          <p>I think we have a question here in the first row, if we can switch over, and then we will go back to this side. Yes please. Then, I misunderstood you. We'll take the question over there. I thought you had a question, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Picking up on Dan's commentary there, if the Phase II activity you have this year has the same sort of success rate that you have had, the need then to further prove the differentiation of those drugs in the coming years would likely push up your R&amp;D spending. Do you have enough of those efficiencies in the activities you were talking about, Dan, to offset or mitigate what may be a bulge in R&amp;D pressures in 2014 and 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a good question. It's one we're constantly analyzing, frankly. I feel very comfortable for 2013 that the moves we took as a company to also shift some of the funds from the early-stage research to the late-stage research was also the difficult decision, but I think the right decision to close Nutley and to focus our activities on pRED and Basel have allowed us to be &#x2013; have a good budget for 2013. You point out 2014 and 2015 which is something we're constantly analyzing. It does, I think, put even more emphasis on scientific rigor. I'll just tell you, we've had some programs in Phase II that we were intending to take &#x2013; one program in particular, I will tell you about rontalizumab which we've decided not to take on to Phase III, not because it doesn't have potential, but just we have to draw the line somewhere to be able to fund what we're going to fund. So, some of it is portfolio prioritization for sure; some of it is efficiency. And, then finally, I think we have to maintain a certain flexibility because, if we have terrific data, we &#x2013; as Severin said, we don't expect all the Phase II's to hit. But, let's say all the Phase II's did hit, impossible, but then we would I think have a very good problem to come and look at and say how do we best use cash in the organization to drive our innovation moving forward. I think we'd come back to that question when we have the data in front of us. But, for the time being, I'm comfortable that we're working the levers we need to work to make the R&amp;D portfolio work. I don't know, Severin, was it...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would have emphasized the second point which you made on setting high hurdles internally. This is what is happening. As the value you need to provide for payers goes up, I think the internal hurdles of medical differentiation go up and the scientific hurdles we have to reach to go up. So, I think the capping has also this benefit from a management point of view that you almost force the organization to increase the hurdles because, if you take off the least interesting opportunities on average, you improve the medical value which we provide with each medicine, in particular if you are in the comfortable situation we are now with this host of projects coming through.</p>
          <p>But, the answer is, if you don't cap it, scientists will never give up on their babies. If you don't have a mechanism which forces them to make portfolio trade-offs, you get a long tail-end of projects, and from a management point of view, you are in a situation of asymmetric information because you talk with the scientists and you listen to the scientists and you go away with the impression this is the next blockbuster. The only mechanism you have is that you say, okay, you have a certain budget; now, make the best out of it. And, then the scientists themselves &#x2013; or the research management comes up and says, well, this is our best opportunities, these are not so good opportunities so we park them, out-license them, or stop them altogether. I think that is something which is important in managing R&amp;D. Our philosophy is that we leave a lot of freedom to our research and our scientists. We value diversity. The units have a lot of freedom. Basel can do it their way and San Francisco can do it in a different way, but we have to manage the overall expense; otherwise, it's exploding.</p>
          <p>Right, if we can have the next question. In the back please, yes.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe you said you're working on a trial to extend the Lucentis shots to try and decrease the number of injections. Do you have any kind of follow-on drug because you're losing market share in that space? Do you have any kind of technology or you're working in that space to try and find a follow-on?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, do you want to comment on that and on the PRN?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is a couple of things &#x2013; there is, of course, the PRN dosing, which I don't think you're referring to, but that should help us a bit in terms of the dosing intervals. We are looking at more of an extended duration Lucentis like you mentioned and then finally, the one &#x2013; we do have some early stage research on potential follow-ons to Lucentis and the one in Phase II is the anti-factor D I think, is that right, anti-factor D which is in Phase II which will get a readout on &#x2013; this year or next year?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'm not an analyst or a very informed person, but I do want to thank this company for reaching out and making a partnership with Genentech and then later incorporating Genentech into your corporation. And, my question to you is, because of the complexity of working with the targeted antibodies, the linkers and getting that disease better treated, is there any consideration from you in joining with ImmunoGen in a partnership that's deeper or even a takeover at some point down the line? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we wouldn't comment on specific M&amp;A targets as you certainly understand. We do have a collaboration with ImmunoGen, don't we, Dan? Could you comment a bit on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, other companies on the linkers too, so yes, we do though.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I am afraid I couldn't comment in more detail.</p>
          <p>Can we have the next question please?</p>

      <speaker id="1">

          <p>If there are no more questions, what I would suggest is that we close here a bit earlier and go directly into the breakout sessions. The breakout sessions for both Pharma and Diagnostics take place in the fourth floor. If you take the elevator to the fourth floor and I think they take each for about half an hour and then there would be a switch where you can join in the respective other sessions. For those of you, who are interested on the strategy and finance questions, Alan and myself will stay here in this room for another session.</p>
