          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Gazprom Third Quarter of 2011 IFRS Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Just to remind you this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to your Chairperson, Andrey Kruglov. Please begin your meeting, and I'll be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the introduction. Good afternoon, dear ladies and gentlemen. We are happy to welcome you. Actually, it's another teleconference dedicated to the publication of the Consolidated Financial Reports by Gazprom covering the nine months of 2011 prepared in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.</p>
          <p>This teleconference is taking place on the eve of our very traditional Days of Investors, which we are holding in the middle of February, the first part of which will be starting next Friday in Moscow and shall continue then in London and New York. So there will be the opportunity, apart from today's teleconference, to communicate during the forthcoming events.</p>
          <p>Let me repeat, my name is Andrey Kruglov, I'm the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and the Head of the Financial &amp; Economic Department. Together with me, this teleconference is being attended by the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board, Senior Accountant of Gazprom, Elena Vasilieva; Member of the Board of Gazprom, Head of the Economic Expert Assessment and Pricing, Mrs. Elena Karpel; the Head of the Foreign Economic Activities Department, Mr. Pavel Oderov. Also, we have representatives of the Marketing and Liquefied Hydrocarbons Processing Department; Gazprom Export; Finance and Economics Department and our other colleagues on this side of Gazprom.</p>
          <p>And let me remind us that for the purpose of this teleconference, we have prepared a presentation which is available on our website.</p>
          <p>So please look at slide number 3 of the presentation and we shall start with a brief review of the results of the Gazprom activity during the reporting period. During nine months of 2011, the company has demonstrated growth in its financial results.</p>
          <p>The net revenue from sales grew by 32%, compared to the similar period in 2010. The EBITDA grew by 44%. By the end of nine months of 2011, the net debt of the company grew by 11%, compared to nine months of 2010. The correlation between the overall debt to the adjusted EBITDA figure is 0.8.</p>
          <p>Up on the next slide, number 4, you can see the balance of the activities done by our gas transportation system. This chart reflects the physical movement of gas throughout the trunk pipeline and not the commercial operations of the group. In Q3 2011, the volume of gas transported along the gas transportation system grew by 5%, compared to the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>On slide number 5, you can see the operational data between different months, and I'd like to note the increase of exports of gas to Western Europe by 8%, and the former Soviet Union countries, 4%. The sales of gas domestically remained at the level of the previous year, whereby the output grew by 1%.</p>
          <p>During the nine months of 2011, the net revenue from the sale of gas grew by 31%, compared to the nine months in 2010. This was brought about by the improvement of pricing environment within our core markets.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to pass the microphone over to my colleague, Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and Senior Accountant of Gazprom, Elena Vasilieva. Please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and good evening to you, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at slide number 8. Mr. Kruglov noted the positive dynamics of sales in the main segment, which is the sale of gas. Apart from the growing sales in this segment, as you can see on slide number 8, during the nine months of 2011, we can note the positive effect of the revenue from profit from sales came from the sales of gas and oil processing, as well as the revenue from the sale of electricity and heating.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that the factors which affect the changes in the profit from sales and operational expenses during the reporting period are similar to the factors which we debated when considering the consolidated financial reporting in Q1 and H1 of 2011. At the same time, the revenue from the sale of the gas and oil processing in the reporting period grew by RUB213 billion or 42%, compared to the similar period in the previous year. So this particular increase can be explained by the growing world prices for oil and gas processing product, as well as the greater sales revenue of the Gazprom Neft Group. Revenue was 85% in the total revenue from the sale of oil and gas processing.</p>
          <p>The revenue from the sale of electricity and heating grew by RUB38 billion or 19%. This incremental increase can be explained by the growing tariffs for electricity and heating, as well as the growing volume of sales of this kind of energy.</p>
          <p>Let's move over to the next slide, please, and consider separate results of our operational expenses. This is slide number 9. Operational expenses during the nine months of 2011 compared to a similar period last year grew by RUB393 billion or 23%. As one can see from this slide, the basic effect over the growth of the operational expenses within the nine months of 2011 came from such line items as the acquired gas and oil, as well as the profit taxes.</p>
          <p>The expenses for the acquired gas group are RUB160 billion or 57%, amounting to RUB422 billion. This particular increase can be explained by the greater volumes of the acquired gas as well as the growing prices for the gas, which was bought from third parties within Russia, as well as outside of Russia.</p>
          <p>The expenses for the acquisition of oil grew by RUB40 billion or 28%, amounting to RUB187 billion. This particular increase primarily was brought about by the growing oil prices.</p>
          <p>Taxes, apart from the profit tax, grew by RUB98 billion or 46%, including &#x2013; because of the natural resource production tax by RUB68 billion or 54% respectively. This particular increase can be explained by the growing mineral extraction tax rate activity of gas from RUB147 up to RUB438 per 1,000 cubic meters as of January 1, 2011, as well as the growing oil production tax because of the global oil prices growth.</p>
          <p>The expenses within the line items, the reselling, including products of oil and gas processing, grew by RUB42 billion or by 116%, amounting to RUB78 billion during the nine months of 2011. This increase primarily is related to the growing expenses for the acquisition of oil and gas processing products, led by the increase plus RUB33 billion or 152%. And this increase can be attributed to the operations of the Gazprom Neft Group and be explained by the growing oil prices, as well as the prices for refined product, as well as the respective volume growth. Without taking into account these line items, the operation expenses grew by RUB52 billion or by 5%.</p>
          <p>The cost for labor grew by 18%, amounting to RUB267 billion during nine months of 2011. This growth primarily can be explained by the average wage growth versus the Other operational expenses went down by RUB12 billion or by 2%. This particular change can be explained by the growing balance of stock of the main products compared to the 31st of December 2010.</p>
          <p>And please allow me to finish my part of the presentation with that and pass the microphone over to our colleagues in the Finance and Economics Department. Thank you very much. Mr. Kruglov.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The &#x2013; ladies and gentlemen, let's move over to slide number 10. Here, we can see the analysis of the Gazprom group cash flow during the reporting period, a considerable growth in our cash flow account aimed specifically at our investment activity. The higher level of investments during 2010 and 2011 can be explained in the first place by our access to Yamal, where in 2020 we are planning to produce more than half of our overall gas output.</p>
          <p>For the current year, the Board of Directors endorsed the amount of investments by our head company at the level of RUB777 billion; if one is to be more precise, RUB776.8 billion, but you know 777, triple seven kind of sounds like a lucky number, which is almost 40% below the figure of 2011. Considering the results of our operations in H1, we expected traditional adjustment within our approved investment program, as well as the overall reduction of the capital expenses will positively affect our free cash flow.</p>
          <p>The next slide number 11 is where you can see that we are continuing to maintain a very comfortable debt burden within the whole group. The debt ratios remained at considerably lower levels and the appropriate ones continue to go down. The structure of the debt repayment is balanced throughout the years. And considering the result of the first nine months of 2011, the average rate for all of our borrowings was 6.6%.</p>
          <p>And in conclusion, I would like to share with you preliminary results of the company's operations throughout 2011. We expect that the amount of gas output would grow up to 513 cubic meters. Thanks to a conservative financial policy and favorable environment, the financial results of the group shall maintain its positive dynamic.</p>
          <p>And once again, in conclusion, I'd like to remind us that on February 10, on February 14 in London, and on February 16 in New York, Gazprom is going to hold its annual events which is the Day of Investor and I would like to invite all of you to attend these days where you, ladies and gentlemen, should be able to personally talk to the management representatives of the Gazprom Group.</p>
          <p>So I'm very appreciative for your attention. And now we will be happy to answer your questions. For our Q&amp;A session today, we have a slightly shorter amount of time than usual. But once again, I would like to offer my apologies and say that all those who won't be able to raise their questions or those who would somehow like to expand whatever topics we touch upon will have such an opportunity during the Days of Investor, February 10 in Moscow and February 14 and 16 respectively in London and New York.</p>
          <p>So today on our Q&amp;A, we'll have 30 minutes. Thank you very much, yet again, for your attention.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Ron Smith. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ron Smith, Citi, sitting in Moscow. Thank you very much for the call, gentlemen. The first question that popped actually is circling back to what you were just talking about, and that is CapEx, the RUB777 billion. How &#x2013; the few questions that circle around this, and I'm glad that you're talking about it in the associated cash flow. But how likely is it that you will end up the year only having spent RUB777 billion? And because traditionally and sometime in August or September you end up upgrading that number substantially. And what is the true difference in numbers, the major project differences between last year and this year in terms of the &#x2013; well, exactly last year and this year in terms of the amount of money that you're spending, purely Yamal or is there some other things that are figuring into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as the capital expenditure program is concerned, traditionally when the budget undergoes a consideration and the endorsement for the next year, we are reviewing several scenarios of possible cause of events. And depending upon the scenario conditions, we, in the first place, are trying to analyze the possible sales volumes for the markets domestically inside Russia, as well as abroad, possible pricing situations. And based on that, we are trying to project the possible volume of funding that we can afford for, specifically, our investment program.</p>
          <p>And again, traditionally, when identifying the original level of investment expenses, we are being guided by a conservative approach. Meaning to say that we act upon an assumption that the environment may not be evolving, following not the worst scenario, but at least the so-called &#x2013; a conservative one when we will have the opportunity to fund, as part of the capital expenditures, only our top priority and only our necessary &#x2013; the project which we require most.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of why such adjustments take place, first of all, we finalized our results in as far as the first half of the year is concerned. And you definitely can note that the first quarter of any given year turns out to be the most indicative in our operations. And based on that, one can summarize the extent to which our forecast or predictions are coming true. And usually, as I already mentioned, in a conservative scenario, we, looking at the results of the first half of the year, can see that we are in a position to slightly accelerate the execution of the previously planned investment projects and consequently dedicate greater amount of funds to any particular one we deem necessary.</p>
          <p>But I would like to note that that hasn't always been the case, because in 2008, on the contrary, we adjusted our expectations down, basically remaining on the same level because of the financial crisis. And in as far as the different projects are concerned and the differences between them, in the first place, I would like to note the capital construction expenditure in the area of production and the completion of the Bovanenkovskoye, Zapolyarnoye, Urengoyskoye and Yamburgskoye field. In the transportation area, it is the construction of the trunk pipelines between Bovanenkovo and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:54), from Ukhta to Torzhok, the trunk pipelines from Gryazovets to Vyborg, from Pochinki to Gryazovets, from SRTO to Torzhok.</p>
          <p>And also, last year in 2011 and similarly, those were the projects which received more funding for the execution of the projects in the East of Russia and specifically for the construction of the gas transportation system from Sakhalin to Khabarovsk to Vladivostok and then towards the start of the operations at the Kirinskoye gas condensate field, as well as the completion of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:38) and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:40) fields.</p>
          <p>So investments, in the same token, were dedicated to the creation of a sectoral information data management system, which in Gazprom would see as its basic modules to be commissioned into operation in 2012. So this is basically as brief as I can talk about these separate projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Karachinsky. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is Ivan Karachinsky, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I have two questions, please. Given this year's dividend expectations and potential for CapEx inflation, what are the risks that the free cash flow will be sufficient to cover both? And how are you going to finance that in this case?</p>
          <p>And question number two is, can you please update us on the negotiations in China? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is in answer to the first question about the dividends. In our budget for 2012, we have allocated the similar level which we had &#x2013; I mean, in terms of the relative size, the relative figure, exactly like what we had back in 2011, which is 25% from the net profits under the Russian Accounting Standards. And so, you should know that we have changed our dividend policy last year. And we, in terms of our dividend policy, have specified that the amount of the dividend payout may amount to &#x2013; from 17.5% to 35%.</p>
          <p>And so, as of last year, the decision was made by the shareholders to raise the dividend payout because before that, Gazprom had been paying out primarily at the bottom on our threshold, which was defined in our dividend policy with the only exception taking place in 2009 when, for the results of 2008, the sum was paid out following the decision of our shareholders, which was 5% and that was the first crisis year.</p>
          <p>So currently, the company's policy is aimed at raising the level of dividend payment. And in our budget for 2012, we have the same level, which is 25%.</p>
          <p>Now, as far as the second part of the question is concerned about China, I would ask my colleague, Mr. Oderov, to give you an answer, who is in charge of the Foreign Economics Activity Department.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first place, one should say that we are convinced that within the mid-term and long-term perspective, the requirements by the Chinese markets will probably require some considerable amounts of the Russian gas. We are negotiating with our Chinese counterparts about the supplies of gas following the Western corridor. But right now, the majority of the commercial terms and conditions have been arrived at. The only point that we're still awaiting to come to an agreement about is price. And so right now, we are waiting to receive a renewed offer from the Chinese partners. And we would say that we're going to receive it in some immediate future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Oswald Clint. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. Oswald Clint at Sanford Bernstein. Could I ask a question on Nord Stream, please, and ask should we expect any volume sales through Nord Stream in the fourth quarter? And what would be the guidance for 2012 coming through that new pipeline?</p>
          <p>And also, second question is, in terms of the last couple of weeks and months, could you give us some insight on discussions with your European customers on pricing for European contracts in 2012. I remember back in 2009, you had some discussions and the strategy then in 2010, you're able to talk about potentially 15% of your volumes being sold at spot prices. Have you had any similar discussions through the last few months of 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will have our colleagues from the Foreign Economics Activities department answering, Mr. Oderov. And the second part of the question would be answered by Gazprom Exports.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the Nord Stream project is concerned, in the autumn of 2011 we've launched the first phase of the pipeline with the 27.5 billion cubic meters of capacity. The construction of the second line or the second phase is following exactly the schedule that was planned, which means that in the fall of 2012, this second line will be commissioned into operation with the overall marine section of the pipeline reaching 55 billion cubic meters, which in itself should mean that in Q4 of 2012, we would be able to receive full capacity into operation for the second line as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the pricing question, there seems to be an impression that the spot component price issue is the most important one that people can raise with respect to Gazprom. But, unfortunately, I won't be able to give you an elaborate answer to this question because, first of all, we haven't yet finalized the results of last year. And secondly, I can assure you that no serious or considerable changes, with respect to the spot price component in our current contracts, is not going to happen. And the negotiations, which have been concluded just recently, were not about us trying to raise the spot price component, we were able to identify other solutions to arrive at a mutually acceptable conclusions with our five counterparts that we've just finished negotiating with.</p>

          <p>The question from UBS Bank. Because of the reevaluation of the loan provisions of the acquisitions of the company, specifically in as far as the big loss from this particular reevaluation is concerned, is it going to be taken into account in your dividend estimation for 2011?</p>

          <p>It is worth our mentioning that the exchange rate differences have been affecting our P&amp;Ls also previously.

I mean, if I zoom into France because I'm French, and let's look at GDF Suez, it seems, I mean, from what we did understand, that there was an increase in spot indexation. Can you tell us &#x2013; I mean, if yes or no if there was an increase in spot indexations &#x2013; but also if this kind of a negotiation were retroactive for how long for the full year 2011? And also most importantly, how long are those renegotiations for? Are they for two years, three years? A few of those information will be valuable for us. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to specify that the negotiations, which have just finished, didn't lead to us increasing the spot component in the price. We identified different sorts of mechanisms, which I wouldn't like to specify right now, because of understandable reasons, since this information is quite sensitive. Now, as far as the retroactive nature is concerned, it will definitely be present. And in as far as your third question is concerned, undoubtedly amongst our partners there is a desire to move away from a traditional three-year cycle of reconsidering prices, so as to make this period shorter. But we ultimately will be making our decisions at our discretion whenever we will deem it necessary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Thank you very much. It's Mark Henderson here from Credit Suisse. Just a couple of questions, I think you've already answered some questions on price renegotiations in Europe. But I'm interested also in whether there was any grounds to some comments in the news in recent weeks that you may be interested in an involvement in the Yamal LNG project? And also just be interested in getting some update as to where things stand with Shtokman, when you expect to achieve final investment decision on that project? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Oderov will be answering this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to Yamal LNG project, I should say that this is, first and foremost, the project of the NOVATEK Company and so it would be best to direct this question to NOVATEK. But on our part, it is quite well known that we have an agency agreement with NOVATEK, which envisages our participation in it and as long as the project is taking place, whereby we'll be taking on the functions of marketing and exports from Yamal LNG. We do have our own field in Yamal but with respect to our particular involvement in the project so far, no specific decisions have been made.</p>
          <p>Now, as far as the Shtokman field project is concerned, from the very beginning, the final investment decision was expected to be taken in December 2011 and because of objective reasons, the partners decided to postpone this decision-making until later. And so, at this point in time, we, together with our partners, have defined the so-called framework agreement, which defines the principles upon which the foreign partners are going to participate in the first phase of the development of the field.</p>

          <p>Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Kushnir. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Through estimation, by dividing the revenue from the sale of gas in the former Soviet Union countries' markets and of &#x2013; by the volume of sales, I ended up having the following figures for pricing: $279 for 1,000 cubic meters in the second quarter and $226 for 1,000 cubic meters in Q3. And out of my estimations it shows that the price for consumers in the former Soviet Union markets went down by 19%. Could you please tell me whether I am correct in my calculations? And if I am, what explains such a dramatic decrease in pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Rosseev will be answering this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If basically we go to the presentation, on slide number 6, in it you can see the estimated prices, which are given for different quarters and it shows that in Q2 2011, the price was $277, while in Q3, it was $313. So I believe that in answering your question and looking for an answer to your question, you can go to this particular slide and see the direct answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We now have time left for two questions. Please go ahead and ask your next one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Igor Kurinnyy. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Igor Kurinnyy from ING Bank. I have two questions. One is regarding self income from associates. It basically declined significantly in the third quarter versus second quarter and first quarter. So I want to &#x2013; if you could comment why, what is the case? And also whether we should expect increased income from associates in the fourth quarter? And also, if you could reiterate your guidance for sales volumes for this year? And also how much gas are you going to buy from Central Asia in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will have Mr. Rosseev answering the first question. And as far as the sales volumes for the foreign markets is concerned, we will have an answer given to us by Mr. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:02).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the reduction, I should say, of the share which are associated companies and organizations are making, it comes from the <mark type="ph" /> two-one serve (55:41) that we're having. The first one is the Nord Stream, simply because this company took some big loans under the construction or for the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline. And this particular launch of, I would say, that many of them were based on a floating rate, which in itself was based on the Libor rate and so, the interest payment with the business loan have been hatched. And because in Q3, Libor rates started going down, as a result, we registered the negative effect from this hedging on the results of Nord Stream. And the results of Gazprombank also slightly went down because, first of all, it divested from quite a huge price of its Chemical business. And so, it stopped making a positive contribution.</p>
          <p>And secondly, because of the negative developments of the environment and the market, there was a need to create a certain impairment for investments, which also produced a negative effect over the contribution made by the Gazprombank into our overall results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first part of the answer to the second question, the volumes of gas that &#x2013; which we sold in 2011 shows that, compared to 2010, we were able to raise the overall volume by 8.2%, while the general sale of gas into the foreign markets constituted 150 billion cubic meters. But I would like to note that this particular figure was achieved against some very difficult background because Europe in that year reduced its consumption of natural gas by 46 billion [cubic meters].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In 2011, our acquisition of gas from the Central Asia and Azerbaijan in case of Gazprom were at the level of 27 billion cubic meters, which is basically the figure that remained compared to 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And our final question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Hromushin. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So two questions. The first one is that sometime from 2011 we have been observing a considerable level of production of liquid hydrocarbons in Gazprom Group, but that didn't &#x2013; does not relate to Gazprom Neft. Could you give us details about the reasons and the nature of this growth? And do you expect this trend to sustain in the current year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is there in any way the exchange rate differences that are being reflected in the structure of the Other operational expenses line item? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question will be answered by Mr. Ivanov from the Department of Strategic Development and the second question by Mr. Rosseev from the Accounting Department, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The growing share of the liquids in our output is a long-term trend. And it can be explained by the fact that we are having less of this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:03) gas in our overall production. And we are producing more gas with more valuable components, including the liquids and this trend shall continue not just for a year or for two years but for a decade. And we'll expect that in 10 years' time, the volume of the production of liquids may as well double.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the second question is concerned, everything which relates to the exchange rate differences, all of them related to the operational expenses are now being reflected in a separate line item in the structure of the operation expenses, not in Others because they produce quite a strong effect and so we had at every teleconference to give you a separate explanation. Now, for your convenience, we put it into a separate line item and so that is where it will remain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Dear, ladies and gentlemen, once again, thank you very much for your participation in this teleconference, for the interest you are demonstrating towards our company, thank you very much for your attendance. And once again, I would like to invite you to come to the Day of the Investor in the Gazprom headquarters in Moscow on February 10.</p>
