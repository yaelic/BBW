        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Sean . And thank you everyone again for joining us for the Third Quarter 2009 Southern Copper Earnings Conference Call. Participating in today's conference is Mr. Genaro Guerrero, Southern Copper's CFO. Mr. Guerrero will now lead the conference. Genaro?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Raul. Good morning, everyone. Welcome, again. Today I will discuss current metal prices, Southern Copper's performance in production sales, operating costs, financial results and the development on our capital spending program. After that we will be glad to open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>In terms of prices after a sharp decline in metal prices at the end of 2008, during 2009 we have seen a continuing recovery of metal prices particularly copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver which are the most important commodities produced by Southern Copper. As we have mentioned in the past conference calls our major driver for better metal prices has been the significant demand recovery of emerging economies led by China. In the case of copper <mark type="inaudible" /> 70% of Southern Copper sales the LME copper price has recuperated from $1.40 per pound at the beginning of 2009 to an average of $2.66 per pound in the third quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>However this significant recovery is still 24% behind the average of $3.48 per pound for the third quarter 2008. We are optimistic regarding the future evolution of corporate prices. We think the Chinese and emerging markets growth will support its copper demand. Regarding the US and European economies we do believe that the worst of the recession has passed and we expect a much better performance in the fourth quarter of this year as well as in 2010.</p>
          <p>Nowadays there are some concerns regarding copper inventories, which have grown in the last quarter. However what we are currently seeing are strong copper prices of around $3 per pound. We think that the reasons are the following. The markets are anticipating a recovery of developed economy's demand expected for the first quarter 2010, the investors' funds are going to basic metals, and among them copper as a way to protect themselves for a weaker dollar. And the current inventory levels are still relatively low representing just only 11 days of consumption.</p>
          <p>Regarding the supply response to new demand, we think that the major reasons for supply unperformance are still there. Block in supply growth. Factors are the lack of credit, labor unrest, government, environmental and tax requirements are still major barriers for long-term supply growth.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper Corporation's second product is molybdenum that represents 11% of total sales. Molybdenum is used for the production of the special alloys of stainless steel. As in the case of copper, the molybdenum markets have significantly improved since the beginning of 2009. Molybdenum price has recuperated from $9.50 per pound at the beginning of 2009 to an average of 14.5 per pound in the third quarter of 2009. However, this significant recovery is still 56% lower than the third quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Silver COMEX price has significantly recuperated since the close of 2008 when it was quoted at $10.79 per ounce. During the third quarter 2009, silver averaged $14.76 per ounce, an increase of 37% and 1% lower than the third quarter 2008. We think that the silver prices will be strong in the coming quarters due to the inflation concerns and the recovery of industrial demand.</p>
          <p>Regarding zinc, in the third quarter 2009, the LME price averaged $0.80 per pound, 60% higher than the $0.50 quoted at the beginning of the year and equal to the average price of the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now talking about production, we are glad to report that our mined copper production has run at a good pace during the last quarter. Major reasons for the result have been better ore grades and higher recoveries in our operations. Production for the third quarter of current year was 120,000 tons, 1% higher than the third quarter of 2008. Southern Copper operating units have increased their production in the third quarter 2009. La Caridad and IMMSA copper production increased by 4% and 35% respectively. And the Peruvian operations of Cuajone and Toquepala maintained their copper production levels.</p>
          <p>Regarding our smelting and refining operations, the production increased 8% and 6% respectively in the third quarter this year. At this point we are increasing our guidance for 2009 from 490,000 tons to 500,000 tons of copper salt.</p>
          <p>For molybdenum we have had excellent production in 2009. During the third quarter, production increased by 18% when compared to the second quarter of 2009 and 14% when compared to the same period in 2008. The 14% increase resulted from higher ore grades and improved recoveries at the La Caridad and Cuajone operations.</p>
          <p>In respect to mined zinc, production increased by 4% in the third quarter 2009. Our on-the-grounds operations have obtained better ore grades as well as improved concentrators recoveries. Refined zinc production increased also by 4% at the San Luis Potosi zinc refinery.</p>
          <p>The silver mined production in the third quarter '09 increased 10% to 3.3 million ounces compared with the third quarter 2008 and refined silver production for the third quarter 2009 also was 3.3 million ounces, 8% higher than in the third quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>Now going into our financial performance, net sales for the third quarter were $1,152 million, 40% higher than the $825 million in the second quarter 2009. The significant net sales increased results from higher volumes sold and better metal prices as we have previously mentioned.</p>
          <p>Copper sales volume increased by 7% when compared third quarter '09 with its 2008 equivalent. Molybdenum sales volume increased by 12% compared to its third quarter 2008 level. Silver and zinc volumes sold increased by 6% and 2% respectively when compared to the third quarter '08 volumes. However, these higher volumes sold have not upset the price differences between the third quarter 2009 and the third quarter 2008, where sales were $1,440 million.</p>
          <p>Talking about operating costs, we would like to mention that our total operating costs and expenses have decreased by $426 million as of September 30, 2009 when compared with similar period of 2008.</p>
          <p>For third quarter 2009 this cost was $643 million. This figure compares favorably with the $764 million in the third quarter 2008. The cost reduction of $121 million between this quarter and the same quarter last year includes an important reduction of fuel costs of around $10 million, around $63 million reduction in power costs mainly through lower tariffs, lower labor costs of $5 million, decreasing workers' participation by $19 million, purchases of copper from third parties decreases by 19 million, and other costs and expenses reductions.</p>
          <p>As a result of the mentioned sales, and operating cost variances, the third quarter 2009 EBITDA was $592 million or 51% of sales. This figure compares with the $380 million in the second quarter 2009, and $781 million or 54% of sales for the third quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>The company cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product credits for this quarter was $1.63 per pound, $0.40 lower than the $2.03 per pound for the same period of 2008. The cash cost including the benefit of by-product credits was $0.27 per pound in the third quarter this year, compares to a cash cost of $0.18 per pound for the third quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of the significant adjustments in cash cost, the better market prices and the mentioned higher volumes sold, Southern Copper net earnings in the third quarter 2009 were $312 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.37. This figure is 78% increase compared with the net earnings for the second quarter 2009 of 175 million.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper Corporation capital spending programs continue on track during the third quarter of 2009. The company has been carefully managing all capital expenditures to ensure efficiency on the use of its resources. The Tia Maria project is expected to produce 120,000 tons of SX/EW copper cathodes per year. The budget for this project is $934 million and through September 30 of this year $250 million has been spent. The detailed engineering is in progress. Current work on the project include equipment fabrication and some early construction work, such as access roads and platforms. The environmental impact assessment for the power line and the support facilities have been approved by the Peruvian authorities and construction is underway. Bids for the construction management contracts are being evaluated, while additional drilling is continuing to evaluate water resources.</p>
          <p>Another ongoing project is the Toquepala concentrator expansion which is expected to increase annual copper output by 100,000 tons of copper per year and 3,100 tons of molybdenum per year is starting in 2012.</p>
          <p>As of September 30, 2009 the company has expended $75 million on this project. Proposals for detailing engineering are in the final evaluation, one 320-ton truck and two drilling machines were put in operations, while a 73 cubic yard shovel is in its final stage of assembly. The environmental impact study is currently being conducted and is also expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. After expending 16 million, the by-product treatment plant at the La Caridad metallurgical complex was completed in September and is currently in operation. This plant was recently distinguished winning the first prize in an important nation-wide contest to promote waste recycling. With a total investment of $17 million, the line plant at our Agua Prieta which is 100 kilometers north of La Caridad mine was fully modernized to comply with environmental regulations and to meet the line requirements of the Mexican operations.</p>
          <p>A vertical Maerz furnace will reduce the consumption of natural gas to a third of its current level and we expect costs to be reduced by 45%. The start of operations has been scheduled for this October. In respect to a large project that is a world-class copper deposit in the central part of Baja California peninsula in Mexico. With estimated resources of over 1.3 billion tons of mineral, it is expected to produce 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. The company has recently invested $5.4 million in land acquisition related to the project. In addition, a set of the studies has been completed evaluating alternatives to provide El Arco with water and electricity power needs. The company will consider the development of this project subject to appropriate investment conditions for the mining industry.</p>
          <p>In respect to Cananea, on April 14, 2009, the Mexican Federal Labor Court issued a resolution based on first major confirming the termination of Cananea's labor relationship with individuals and unionized employees as well as termination of its collective bargaining agreement with its employees and with the National Mining and Metal Workers Union. This ruling has been challenged by federal individuals and the National Mining and Metal Workers Union.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter of 2009, a Mexican federal judge from the second district has issued ruling dismissing most of the cases filed by the union related to individuals. This was a favorable decision for the company. At this point we are waiting for a final ruling by Federal Justice regarding the termination of Cananea's labor contract and the collective bargaining agreement on the basis of a force majeure event.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends I would like to state again that it is the company policy to review at each board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, on October 19, 2009, the board of directors authorized a dividend of $0.18 per share, approximately 50% of earnings per share of the quarter. This dividend will be paid on November 24, 2009, to shareholders of record as of November 5, 2009.</p>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. And now we would like to open the forum for questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have questions related to Cananea, Genaro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Felipe, we can't copy you well. Can you speak a little bit up, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure. Is it better now, Raul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Certainly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, sorry for that. So my question was related to Cananea. I just wanted to know if you have any estimate or any guess on when you could see a final resolution on the strike issue, because it's been well over six months since the Mexican Federal Labor issued the resolution. So that's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Felipe. Well, here with us &#x2013; has joined us Armando Ortega, who is our General Counsel, and I would say that he can provide better information in respect to the Cananea matter. I will pass the question for him. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning. As you know with courts there is no specific timing. What we have stated, and we consider this to be appropriate, is that by the end of this year, we should have a final ruling, and we are still hoping that it will be a definitive one, and of course one that would be in our favor, because we consider that we have crafted a solid case in connection with the force majeure subject matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Armando, what are the next steps? Is there anything that you have to do right now or what are the decisions that you are having to, or you are waiting for right now? Or is it just a final decision by the courts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the past we have explained that the ruling from the Mexican Labor Court, which did validate our decision to terminate the labor contracts, including the collective bargaining agreement, was challenged by individual workers, around 1,000 and by the Union itself. We have stated this morning that during the last weeks a federal judge has dismissed almost all of the individual cases, almost all of the individual challenges. Those dismissals are not definitive. There is still a recourse against them. And then there is the case presented by the union, which is before magistrates at the Federal Circuit Court. Upon best available information and legal basis, what should happen is that once the magistrates from the Federal Circuit Court resolve the case, the challenge, that challenge will be definitive and as a matter of consequence the individual challenges should also disappear. Then if as expected we have a favorable ruling, then the subject matter would be taken again to the Mexican Federal Labor Court, validating its decision and consequently another natural step would be to return the mine to Cananea, to the company. That is how we expect in a roadmap what could and we hope potentially happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And my second question was related to the copper and moly introduction. Can you just remind us what the &#x2013; your production guidance for 2010 excluding Cananea please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Felipe, our guidance for molybdenum production is 18,000 tons and copper, we are increasing our guidance to 500,000 tons of copper sold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that for 2009 or 2010?</p>

          <p>Any changes for 2010 or the numbers should be pretty much similar to 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have not completed yet our production plan for 2010. Well, probably very soon we're going to have a better idea in what is going to be our production, but we are not expecting any reduction in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Genaro, it's Jorge Beristain and Raul. My question just again, just to clarify, we're talking 2009 guidance for copper output was raised to 500,000 tons, moly remains at 18,000 and could you also give us zinc and silver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay, zinc and silver. Zinc is &#x2013; hold on &#x2013; is 105,000 tons and silver is 17 million ounces for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and sorry, just looking ahead to 2010 you've mentioned that you don't see a reduction. But my understanding was in the case of Cananea you needed about a two month, maybe three month lead time to get that facility back up and running because of the damage done by the striking workers and I think the idea that it could be relaunched by the first quarter of 2010 was predicated on an October resolution. We're now almost at November and it does sound like from what your lawyer said that you're still at best a few weeks, if not a few months away from getting these final legal issues resolved. So do you see the potential now for slippage to a 2010 start date for the Cananea mine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Jorge. This is Raul Jacob. We think that &#x2013; as you know, we have the expectation of getting the Cananea mine back before year-end. But we have also stated that ramping up of the mine will take between three and six months. So that certainly will affect a forecast where you can see our 2010 production with the full Cananea production. At this point we can't say how much of 2010 production of Cananea will be affected. The guidance, as Genaro mentioned, regarding 2010, which is not complete as he well stated, it's referring to the current operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just only to clarify, the 500,000 tons that is our guidance for this year is not including Cananea, Raul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And could you remind us how much molybdenum Cananea could produce in &#x2013; at a full production rate, I would assume about 180,000 tons of copper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Cananea doesn't have a molybdenum circuit yet. There are plans to invest on such a circuit when we retake the asset but at this point we wouldn't have any molybdenum production coming from Cananea, Jorge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have the -- any of the other by-products that would be impacted by the restart, zinc or silver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Silver. Basically Cananea will have some ounces of silver with the copper concentrate that it produces.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Yes. This is Anne Milne from Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Genaro and Raul. I have &#x2013; one of my questions was answered, but the second question relates to your CapEx and investment program. I know you outlined what you've spent so far this year on a number of projects, and it looks like from your cash flow statements you've spent about $316 million on straight capital expenditures this year. I was wondering if you could give us what your current estimates are for full year 2009 CapEx. And I know you're still working on your plan for next year, but could you possibly give us a range of what your CapEx might look like for next year or at least maybe a bottom figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Anne. How are you? This is Raul. We &#x2013; for 2010 we're still doing our capital plan. But we are expecting to spend about $600 million on our projects. That number could be adjusted regarding when we see where the market is in terms of prices and cash generation. At this point that's what we're thinking. As we pointed out in the press release the company thinks that there is no problem to go ahead with our projects and we're moving forward with them as scheduled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and for 2009, for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the full year, let's see if we have the information here. Yes. Hold on one second. Well, we have a budget for 2009. In Mexico it's $65 million and for Peru it's $240 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you're just about there right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the budget for 2009. What we're spending will be in the range of $450 million, Anne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just ask a small question on your cash flow statement here? You have under investing activities, two lines, capital expenditures and other net. What is the other net, in general? Is it various items, or is it one item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Other net are certain investments that are reclassified between cash holdings and mid-term investments, Anne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Alonso Arambur&#xFA;. Mr. Arambur&#xFA; could you please state your company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, from Santander, thank you. One question about Tia Maria, a couple of weeks ago there was, in some press releases in Peru, some news that there was a vote against the development of the project by some of the surrounding communities. Can you comment on that and whether that's significant? How the company is dealing with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Alonso, let me explain to you what happens in Tia Maria. At the last public hearing that the company had in August, some local communities in the surrounding area of Tia Maria opposed the use of underground water for the project, alleging that it could cause a short wave &#x2013; a shortage of water supply for the farmers in local communities. We're working with them and the Peruvian authorities to respond to these communities' concerns on the project and ensure that our Tia Maria mining project complies with all environmental regulations and all the legal requirements in Peru. We have to submit a proposal that would be the third and final &#x2013; for the third and final public hearing. And after that we should have a decision from the mining authority approving the environmental impact study or not. We believe that the project will move on, and that's basically where we are right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so basically once this is approved by the government, do you think the communities will go along with this? Or that still needs to be negotiated a little bit further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we think that we will be &#x2013; we'll go ahead with the project after the approval of the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, Raul. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your next question comes from the line of Dan Richmond, a private investor. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thank you. I have several questions, the first being third party concentrate purchases during the third quarter, how many contained tons and what is the impact of those purchases on cost per pound?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well the volume of purchases during the third quarter was 20,000 metric tons. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the impact on cost per pound?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the impact is around $0.08 per pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The second question is you filed an 8-K with the SEC outlining a settlement with governments whereby Southern Copper agreed to stop using anhydrous ammonia in its zinc smelting refining operations. Could you tell us whether that will have any material impact on either production volume or costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have checked that and the impact that it's going to have, that change in our cash cost is around $0.002 per pound of zinc, then it's minimum, the impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And no impact on volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not impact at all in volume, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My next question relates to rod production. Your rod production is down 31% compared to a year ago. Is that due to demand or production problems?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well in the case of rod, that production is in line with the market demand. That means that if the market is requesting for rod, then we are running the plant at a higher capacity and if the market is not requesting for this product, we are slowing down the production. That is the reason that &#x2013; for the variances that we have between one period and other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I mean, it's a demand &#x2013; it's a lack of demand, it's not something that's mechanical or labor or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all. It's something that we decide and it's something that is in relation with the market demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And my last question relates to capitalized interest on the income statement. Usually capitalized interest is a reduction of interest expense. This quarter, it's an addition to interest expense. Is that a reversal of a prior capitalization and should we expect this to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. We changed the accounting policy and basically we changed that because our project has been financed by our cash and not by financing or other source, and that's the reason that we decided to change the accounting rule or the accounting policy in that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so this is a reversal of a prior capitalization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, basically yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me clarify for our audience, usually you can capitalize interest when you have a financing that is attached to any specific project. Since we haven't taken any financing in a while, in a few years, since 2005, the company has used already, or has finished the project that were financed with those loans. So, right now we are not applying capitalized interest because we have no new financing that is coming &#x2013; getting to our current projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But my question is, is the entry in the third quarter a reversal of prior capitalized interest? And is it finished? I mean do we have more of this to come? Or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is this...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the answer, the straight answer to your question Mr. Richmond, is that first, yes, it is a reversal of some capitalized interest that we did on the first two quarters of the year. And second, that's it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are not going to capitalize any more for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I'm from JPMorgan. My question relates to the cash costs in three quarter &#x2013; third quarter. Could you please throw some more light on the sectors that led to increase in cash costs, excluding by-product credits in third quarter, and if possible your expectations for the same in fourth quarter '09? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you get it? Okay, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hello, Mandeep, we have &#x2013; in the third quarter we had a cash cost before by-product credits of 1.63 per pound, and that's &#x2013; when you see the second quarter cash costs before by-product credits, which was 1.50, represents an increase in cost of about $0.13 per pound for the quarter. And if we look at our direct production cost increases, and some other expenses related to our sales such as freight and treatment charges, that represents about an increase of $0.05 per pound between the second and the third quarter. Then you have the &#x2013; a cost increase related to third party copper purchases that the company has done in the third quarter as we enjoy the benefits of having higher copper prices in our sales when we &#x2013; copper &#x2013; when we purchase copper from third parties we also have to absorb the higher cost that comes with better prices. In this case as Genaro pointed out, we are having a cost increase by this factor of $0.08 per pound between the second quarter and the third quarter of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add that an important fact in or factor in this increase is the revaluation of the local currencies, especially Mexican peso. That means that we have in respect of our local cost, when we experienced that in dollars we are &#x2013; we have a negative difference or a negative impact as a result of that the Mexican peso has been revaluated against dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And a follow-up question; under the <mark type="inaudible" /> about Escondida's labor contract settlement, what are your views on the wage deal and do you think if it has any implications on the negotiations that PCU conducts with its labor unions in Mexico and Peru and your views as to if that could have any impact on the labor negotiations that happen in the copper industry? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On labor &#x2013; on the &#x2013; and I couldn't catch what you say about the Escondida Mandeep, could you repeat it please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is about the Escondida's labor contract settlement that they did earlier this week, and it was criticized by some industry participants. Just wanted to know if you have any views and whether you think it would have any implications for the industry as in on the negotiations that PCU conducts or some other companies would conduct with their labor unions. Or do you consider that as an independent event not impacting any other thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay regarding the Escondida labor negotiation, we don't think that we should talk about it since it is a &#x2013; it is not an operation of Southern Copper. Regarding our own labor situation, as you know well, we have the Cananea labor case that is about to clear, that was explained by Armando. On the other Mexican operating units the company, it's doing excellent in terms of productivity and as well as labor relations. There are no problems at all with the other eight units that the company has in Mexico. In Peru we have eight unions. As you may have heard, this week the National Mining Union of Peru called for a strike, and none of our operations decided to join this strike in Peru. So we think that we're in, excluding one case, which is politically tainted in our view, we have a very good labor relationships at this point.</p>
