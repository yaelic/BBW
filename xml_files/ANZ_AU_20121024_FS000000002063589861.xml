          <p>Good morning, everybody. Just wait for the last couple of people to sit down. Welcome to those of you joining us in Sydney here today for the Full Year 2012 Financial Results and also to those of you on the phone and watching on the web.</p>
          <p>Now here with me this morning is our Chief Executive Officer, Mike Smith, and our CFO, Shayne Elliott. They'll present for around 35 minutes, and then we'll move to Q&amp;A. I'll take you through the procedure for Q&amp;A when we get to that point.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand over to you, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Many, many thanks, Jill, and good morning to all of you. I know that most of you will have already seen detail of the earnings announcement. So what I'd like to do this morning is just go through and touch on the highlights and make a few comments about our strategy and actually the operating environment that we see or we find ourselves in at the moment.</p>
          <p>Essentially the 2012 result is consistent with the key trends that we outlined in the August trading update. And again, there have been no real surprises during the final quarter. I made a quip at the time that this consistent, no surprise performance is what investors and customers are looking for in a bank. I hope that's the case. To an extent, I think it's always been the case, but I think that's especially true in the volatile post-GFC world.</p>
          <p>But I think what's important to understand that this hasn't happened by chance. It's what we've been working hard to create at ANZ, a bank with a clear growth strategy that can consistently deliver on its promises. It's been five years of hard work, but we fundamentally transformed ANZ. And I have to say this hasn't always been plain sailing. We have managed through the largest financial crisis of the modern era. But I'd like to take a few minutes later to report on our progress.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to give you a feel for how we see the environment for banking going forward and how we're going to be managing our business through 2013. But first, let me touch on a few points on our result. We delivered an underlying profit of AUD6 billion for the financial year, which is up 6% on 2011, both on an underlying and a statutory basis.</p>
          <p>The proposed final dividend is AUD0.79 per share fully franked is 4% higher than last year, making the total dividend AUD1.45 per share. I'm also pleased that together with our share price performance, total shareholder return this year was a sector-leading 35.4%. This is a good result, which reflects the quality of our franchise, the clarity of our strategy and the consistency of management action to deliver against it.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased to say that because of the actions we have taken, more customers are increasingly putting more of their business to us. At the same time, we're taking a much more active role in the communities in which we operate. But clearly, given the reputational issues banks are facing globally and even here, this is an area that we need to work even harder.</p>
          <p>Looking at the result, and across the group, we've continued to focus on productivity. While we grew the business, we managed to keep cost flat. And this saw a cost-to-income ratio fall to 45.1%. And while we continue to invest in our strategy, the trend on cost growth is lower with positive jaws for the year.</p>
          <p>In the Australia division, we delivered an improved performance particularly in the second half. Profit grew 4%, underpinning or underpinned by a strong focus on productivity, market share gains in retail, growth in the commercial customer numbers and tighter management of margins. We saw growth in International and Institutional Banking division with profits up 3% or 7% on a pre-provision basis.</p>
          <p>Our highlight, again, was the performance of segments linked directly with the regional strategy, with Transaction Banking, Trade and Supply Chain and Global Markets, all well up. Offsetting this, the second half was impacted by more subdued trading conditions, and in Australia by significant margin pressure as well as individual provisions relating to the small number of longstanding issues.</p>
          <p>New Zealand division put in another good performance with profit up 11% on a New Zealand dollar basis. This was largely off the back of hard work by management in continuing to drive simplification and productivity in the business. It's important to understand that this performance was delivered in a period of significant change, including the recent decision to move to one brand and that is very encouraging is that we also achieved customer satisfaction gains, market share growth and higher staff engagement.</p>
          <p>Profits from our Global Wealth division were flat. But importantly, with renewed focus and new management, we saw an improving contribution in the second half with better insurance results, higher investment income and productivity improvements.</p>
          <p>Across the bank, credit quality was consistent with expectations. The provision charge of AUD1.25 billion was broadly in line with 2011, although the mix between collective and individual has differed.</p>
          <p>So in summary, ANZ delivered a good performance in 2012. As I said earlier, this didn't happen by chance. Five years ago, in late 2007, I articulated an ambition for ANZ to become a super regional bank. And I'm pleased to report that despite having endured the global financial crisis and a few other headwinds, including a 25% appreciation in the Aussie dollar, we have delivered on that aspiration with our network in APEA driving 21% of Group revenue for the year.</p>
          <p>Now I don't really want to dwell on this too long because we're already focused on delivering our next set of aspirations for the bank. But I will say that the scale of transformation over the past five years has been very significant, involving a systematic and coordinated program of action in every area of the organization, something that, frankly, will not be easy to replicate.</p>
          <p>And it's not lost on me talking about ANZ as consistent and predictable and perhaps even boring is the significant change from the ANZ of the past. Now I have to say &#x2013; I say that with some humility because our management understand that we're only as good as our last set of results. And there is frankly still a lot to do to move along our super-regional journey, but our progress is significant. We have set new aspirations, which will see further growth, and we are working hard in a challenging environment to adapt the bank to the post financial crisis world.</p>
          <p>There is no question that the global economy is softening, with many of the European economies contracting. Although I think there is now growing confidence that policymakers will avoid an economic Armageddon scenario in Europe, the ripple effects of a chronically weak Europe are becoming more and more apparent.</p>
          <p>The U.S. recovery is, to be frank, painfully slow. And although I am optimistic about the U.S., decisions about fiscal policy in the coming months are also going to have a large impact on global growth outlook for 2013.</p>
          <p>In China, the economy is in a managed slowdown, and we expect it will continue to grow at about 7% to 8% in 2013. Now, while I know many commentators like to see the glass as half-empty in China, I would like to remind you that China and India are the growth engines of Asia and Asia still remains the best performing region in the world economy.</p>
          <p>In Australia and New Zealand, consumer and business confidence remains weak and economic growth in calendar 2013 is expected to be a little bit more subdued at around 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively.</p>
          <p>While our strategy gives us options and opportunities that are not available with a domestic-only strategy, we know we have to drive, both growth, but also productivity. That is particularly important to be successful in the current environment where growth is going to be weaker and conditions are likely to be volatile. And I think this involves action in two key areas.</p>
          <p>The first is improving our operational delivery to drive a long-term sustainable cost advantage. Our operations and technology hubs, increasing automation and straight-through processing and a focus on quality will give us the opportunity to do that. That's why we've set a target to take a further 2 percentage point of cost/income ratio by the end of 2014, while leveraging our hubs and taking advantage of our combined scale across Australia and New Zealand to achieve savings. And in Australia, we're investing to transform the business; and in New Zealand, we work under one brand and one technology platform with far more efficient market coverage.</p>
          <p>Second, in a world where we are required to hold more capital, we are also bringing a much greater focus to managing capital across our portfolio of businesses and to ensure we build out a super-regional strategy in the most capital efficient manner. You have already seen us make some early decisions about this with the sale of our stake in Visa, the disposal of Origin and our sale in the non-strategic stake in Sacombank.</p>
          <p>In closing, let me just sound a note of caution. And although I remain upbeat about ANZ's prospects and we are confident we can deliver against our plans for the year, 2013 does look challenging with the softening economic outlook and headwinds in a number of areas. And I think realistically, this will include a slightly higher provision outlook, which will be broadly in line with current market consensus.</p>
          <p>Finally, delivering a good result in a year of significant changes isn't easy, and I'd like to thank our team of talented and professional people, all 48,000 of them, for their support and their hard work on delivering on our plans.</p>
          <p>Now, let me pass to Shayne Elliott for his second outing in the CFO jersey and we'll see what he has to say. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Mike. As Mike said, we want to be the best-connected most-respected bank in the region. And from a financial perspective, that means delivering above-peer returns, driven by our super-regional strategy with a focus on both growth and efficiency.</p>
          <p>Quite clearly, the environment slowed. The revenue growth was good and we made real progress in terms of efficiency. ROE was slightly lower at 15.6% for the year and 15.2% for the half, and this reflects the requirement to hold high levels of regulatory capital and the impact of lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Despite that, second-half improvements in Australia retail and actual credit costs moving closer to our expected losses economic profit was higher by 1% for the year and 7% for the half. Earnings per share growth was 3% for the year.</p>
          <p>We've tried to keep the results document as simple and as transparent as possible. So rather than repeating what's in it, I think it's more a value in me giving you a sense of how we think about the business and what's driving it.</p>
          <p>Simply put, our super-regional strategy is built around five pillars: first, strengthen our position in our home markets of Australia and New Zealand to drive group earnings and returns; second, to reorient our focus for the intermediation of the fast growing trade capital and wealth flows in the region; third, to diversify and de-risk our revenue streams by building product breadth, expanding our geographic footprint and focusing on those customer segments where we have real competitive advantage such as resources, infrastructure, financial institutions, migrants and the affluent; fourth, to drive speed to market, economies of scale and improve controls through the use of shared platforms and global hubs; and fifth, to do so in a capital efficient way that drives superior returns for shareholders.</p>
          <p>I think we made progress this year on all five fronts. We made good progress in strengthening our home markets. These are already our most valuable businesses and we continue to see opportunity to grow. The focus on customer segmentation and product simplification saw solid gains in market share. Lending was broadly self-funded with deposits, Australia a little less, New Zealand a little more, and returns improved.</p>
          <p>In Australia, retail deposits grew 12% for the year, particularly core deposits. And mortgage volumes grew above the system at 7%. Business lines and deposits both grew 9%. These are healthy gains, given the environment. And growth was strongest in the affluent segment, a particular area of focus for us, and in small business banking where we acquired 30,000 new-to-bank customers.</p>
          <p>We experienced good share gains in targeted segments, but in line with the market, growth did slow in the second half. And hence, deposit competition in the first-half pushed margins lower, but they recovered 4 points in the second-half, bringing the annual decline to 12 basis points.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, we also saw good market share gains in most segments, particularly and the important Auckland mortgage market and like Australia in small business banking. Margins were higher in the first-half due to a better mix of business, but fell a little in the second-half to end 10 points up for the year. Most recently, the team in New Zealand has been focused on preparing for the brand and platform conversion, and ensuring that customer engagement and staff engagement remains strong throughout. The early signs of this are encouraging and we are excited about the opportunities the single brand and unified platform will bring to our customers.</p>
          <p>On a combined basis, retail and commercial businesses in Australia and New Zealand performed very well, driving half of the group earnings growth, with profit up 6% and even stronger growth in the second half. An already strong ROA improved by almost 250 basis points. The benefits of the recently announced Banking on Australia program, coupled with New Zealand's simplification, give us great confidence in the continued growth opportunities in these important markets.</p>
          <p>When people talk about super regional, it's very easy to focus purely on the geographic aspect, but super regional is more than that. It's about a focus on the intermediation of trade, capital, and wealth flows in the region, and the diversification benefits that come with it. It also naturally aligns us to the faster growing sectors of the economy and from our perspective is lower risk. This was another year of strong progress on this front. Trade revenues grew 25%, foreign exchange 17%, and from a customer segment perspective, commercial Asia was up 46%, natural resources 25%, financial institutions 15%. Infrastructure and agri were down 8% this year, but the growth of other segments more than offset this and that's the nature of a diversified business.</p>
          <p>Retail and wealth Asia continued to build deposits, and revenue up 7% and earnings up 61%. Cross-border referrals between our corporate and commercial businesses, in particular, increased strongly. Global markets revenue was up 14% for the year, but down 11% in the second half. This really reflects a very strong first half, particularly a second quarter, and overall, the second half compares well with results in previous years. It's probably worth noting that as our markets business grows offshore, it is exposed to more seasonality in results, as the slow in northern summer impacts our second half to a greater degree than in the past. 40% of our markets' revenues are now booked offshore.</p>
          <p>I think the real story with markets is the transformation that we've made in this business to a higher quality, better balanced business, and that trend continued through the year.</p>
          <p>Three years ago, this was a business dominated by rights and trading. Today, it's a business driven by customer sales, and one focused on servicing trade and capital flows. These changes make markets more aligned with our super regional strategy, make it lower risk, less volatile and less capital intensive and we're very pleased with the transformation that has been made.</p>
          <p>There's no point in building a more diverse business if we can't operate it effectively and efficiently. A critical part of the strategy is, therefore, building an operating model that drives speed to market, greater control, and delivers economies of scale. That's even more important as we move into lower growth environment and I think this is a big shift for ANZ in 2012.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased with the price on this front. Overall, costs were held flat in the second half, and only up 4% for the year, that compares to cost growth of 11% last year and 15% the year before. All businesses delivered good productivity gains, particularly in the second half, where Australia, New Zealand, and Institutional and International were each down 1% and wealth was down 3% in expenses. Group percentage was slightly, reflecting the small number of group wide infrastructure programs. Head counts in FTE were down in all divisions and have now fallen for four consecutive quarters and we would expect that trend to continue primarily through natural attrition.</p>
          <p>Total transaction volumes for our various processing units was up between 5% and 15% depending on the product, but all of that growth was absorbed; meaning, total operational costs were flat year-on-year. Or putting it another way, the unit processing costs were down 5% to 15%. Cost to income, therefore, fell slightly for the year, but strongly in the second half. Of course, cost to income is impacted heavily by margins and other factors, so it isn't always a reliable indicator of true productivity. Another way to think about it is the ratio of operating expenses to average assets and this improved from 1.35% to 1.28% for the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, perhaps the most important part of our strategy is managing capital and this is particularly true in a low growth, low interest rate environment and one we are required to hold higher levels of regulatory capital. All our capital ratios improved. And on an APRA Basel 3 basis, our common equity Tier 1 ratio improved to 8%, up 50 points for the year. While continuing to strengthen our capital position as part of the transition to Basel 3, we've already undertaken a number of actions to improve capital efficiency and we are confident that we have sufficient flexibility within our portfolio of businesses to improve returns and this will be our focus.</p>
          <p>As Mike mentioned, we've restructured OnePath's balance sheet, sold our stake in Visa and sold the Origin mortgage business. We're also taking a more proactive stance to capital allocation across our businesses and this will have an impact in the future. Given the strong capital position and prospects of further organic capital generation, we will be removing the 1.5% discount on the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Bonus Option Plan for the proposed final 2012 dividend.</p>
          <p>And so to credit quality and risk management, we saw good trend in gross impaired assets, which fell a further 3% in the half, bringing the annual reduction to 7%. Provision charges were broadly stable at AUD35 million for the year, but with two big changes in composition. First, the second half was up on the first half by AUD116 million and second, that increase was somewhat offset by a release of collective provision. Both of these changes were largely driven by the crystallization of losses associated with a small number of institutional loans, which we had identified previously.</p>
          <p>Individual provisions were booked for these loans, but given the nature and history of them, it triggered a release of AUD185 million in collective provision. After considering the potential for further weakness in the economy and taking into account our planned business growth, we believe our collective provision coverage ratio at 1.08% is strong and appropriate. It's worth noting that this includes around AUD600 million with management overlays.</p>
          <p>While we accept that there is likely to be weakness in certain sectors of the economy, consistent with our previous view on the cycle, we would expect that weakness to be most prevalent in sectors within the middle market. Our exposure to this segment is relatively small and we are well diversified and we do not believe we are unduly exposed.</p>
          <p>On average, the credit rating for customers in this segment actually improved slightly this year. You will, however, note a reasonable percentage increase in the Australian Commercial segment provisions in the second half, but this relates to particular risks in the regional agri book and the amounts in absolute terms are small.</p>
          <p>So, just in summary, let's look at where we made money this year. Revenue grew AUD767 million and growth was where you would expect, but it did slow a little in the second half. Almost half the growth, AUD380 million, came from outside Australia or New Zealand, mostly from Institutional driven by Trade and Markets with AUD55 million coming from Retail and Wealth in Asia. Australia division contributed AUD151 million and New Zealand AUD80 million, both from good gains in market share and despite some margin contraction in Australia. Corporate Banking Australia grew AUD80 million and global wealth fell very marginally by AUD7 million. Expenses were well managed, up 4% for the year and flat half-on-half, provision charges broadly flat, so overall good earnings growth but slightly lower ROE as a result of holding more capital and lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>So turning to the outlook, when I think about the Group and what's driving results, I think about it in terms of the three big things we do for clients that makes money. Put simply, we gather deposits, make loans, and help customers manage risk, and each of these activities has different underlying trends and drivers. Gathering deposits is a great business and generates around 20% of our customer revenues. Its capital lite, low risk and high return, very simply you win by offering easy and intuitive ways for people to manage their money and in return they leave balances with you.</p>
          <p>Success is therefore increasingly about technology platforms like goMoney, internet banking and Transactive, and that's why these are at the core of our investment program. In 2012, we saw strong deposit and transaction growth in all businesses and geographies. And while clearly some of that reflects system growth, we gained share in all major markets. Customer deposits grew 10% in the year and 6% in the second half. That's faster than our lending growth, and we expect our share to continue to grow, particularly related to our platform rollout.</p>
          <p>Margins, however, came down particularly in Australia and there are two key reasons why. First, just plain old competition, as banks seek to improve liquidity ratios ahead of regulatory change, and second, from lower interest rates. The margin on non-interest bearing or low interest deposits is just less when interest rates are low.</p>
          <p>It's far more difficult to forecast margins. On one hand, further rate cuts will put further pressure on margins. On the other hand, we have seen wholesale credit spreads decline in the last few weeks, and this is usually a good indicator on future deposit pricing. Having said that, I would suggest it's prudent to assume that overall deposit margins will remain broadly stable, perhaps s down a little.</p>
          <p>In 2012, despite very good growth in transaction numbers and balances, margin declines meant that overall revenue from deposits and payments fell 2% or AUD63 million. Looking forward, with volume up and margins more stable, we would expect a more balanced outcome.</p>
          <p>Lending has very different characteristics and takes place in various forms across the bank. This is by far our largest source of revenue, representing 65% of customer revenues, which is appropriate given the risks associated and the capital required. And while this will always be the largest source of group revenue, our strategy will see a change in the mix towards lower risk, less capital intensive lending, and also drive greater diversification from a geographic and customer perspective. That shift is already evident with lending growing faster in two key areas; mortgages in Australia and New Zealand, and trade and working capital outside Australia and New Zealand. These gains drove overall loan volumes up 8% for the year and 4% for the half.</p>
          <p>Of course, the other side of the equation is margins, and in a lower growth world, banks compete heavily to retain share and we saw that particularly in the Australian institutional market. For ANZ, we have more options available, and instead of competing on price alone, we shifted our institutional focus to growing shorter duration, lower risk lending like trade and working capital loans in Asia. This business does, however, have lower average margins, but we feel that the risk reward tradeoff is prudent.</p>
          <p>I've commented previously about margins in Australia and New Zealand divisions, but it's worth commenting here a little more on the net interest margin in IIB. Excluding the impact of markets, which was a net positive this year, net interest margins in IIB declined 40 points for the year and 33 points in the half. These are significant declines and simple competitive pressures were key drivers as you would expect, driving around half of the decline. However, that conscious shift I talked about of shifting focus towards lower risk, shortage duration lending explains a further third of the decline.</p>
          <p>Despite some pressure on margins, primarily in retail lending in Australia in the first half and institutional lending in Australia in the second, good quality volume growth produced a 4.3% or AUD430 million growth in revenues for the year and even stronger growth in the second half. Looking forward, loan growth is likely to slow a little and average margins stabilize. We will continue to prioritize risk adjusted returns, and we expect our balance sheet mix to continue to evolve. This should mean revenue growth is broadly similar for lending.</p>
          <p>Finally, we help customers manage risk with products like FX and interest rate hedging, superannuation on life insurance, and these represent around 15% of customer revenue. Overall, this was our fastest growing area with revenues up 5.7% over the year, which is not surprising given our focus on trade, capital and wealth flows. The business did slow, however, in the second half with revenue down 2%.In these businesses, the key drivers here are how good you are at cross sell and the performance of financial markets.</p>
          <p>Penetration of products like FX and rates hedging increased due to strong customer acquisition, particularly in the FI space and from deepening share of our customers' wallet. Those gains position us well for the long term. However, much lower market volatility saw overall volumes decrease in the second half. Basically, customers don't hedge when markets are stable. Just to give you a sense of market conditions, it's worth noting that the industry globally saw FX volumes 39% lower in September 2012 than September 2011.</p>
          <p>In one year, Aussie dollar FX volatility started the year at 22% and closed the year at 8%. However, from all the data that we see, despite a small reduction in second half sales revenue, we believe our market share continued to grow through the second half. Insurance revenues are also dependent upon effective cross sell and revenue performances correlated to the levels of interest rates and equity markets.</p>
          <p>Better cross sell through the branch network, strong performance in New Zealand and lower interest rates drove much better performance in the second half. Despite being difficult to predict and the inherent volatility in these businesses, our strategy and focus should mean that this area will continue to be our fastest growing.</p>
          <p>In summary, in 2012, the Group's result was solid and fully aligned with our strategic intent. Earnings growth was driven by market share gains in retail and commercial, Australia and New Zealand, strong revenue growth in businesses aligned to trade and capital flows, good expense discipline across all businesses, and a relatively benign provision environment with increased capital levels and lower interest rate slightly reducing our overall ROE. We expect revenue to be broadly &#x2013; revenue growth to be broadly in line with last year, perhaps slightly lower. In that environment, we will continue our focus on productivity and capital efficiency.</p>
          <p>In terms of provisions, we see continued stress in parts of the economy and think it prudent to expect provisions to increase slightly, perhaps around 10%, which is broadly in line with market consensus.</p>
          <p>Before I hand back to Jill, I would just like make some closing comments. ANZ began reporting underlying profit in the first half of 2009. That was appropriate and in response to shareholder feedback wanting better clarity on underlying trends in the business, given the noise associated with the early stages of the GSC and also the actions ANZ was taking to reposition its strategy.</p>
          <p>As you know, underlying profit adjusts statutory profit for certain non-core items using AICD/Finsia definitions, and we've always clearly disclosed those adjustments. With the repositioning of the strategy largely complete, we feel it's the right time to move back to reporting statutory and cash profit and we will be doing so for 2013.</p>
          <p>Finally, while we anticipate subdued and challenging conditions to continue, we see significant opportunity given the strength and natural advantages of our franchise and our alignment to the fast growing and low risk trade, capital and wealth flows in the region. We remain committed to our objective of producing superior shareholder returns with a focus on both growth and efficiency. And as part of that, we're committed to our stated targets of improving our CTI by two percentage points within two years, improving our ROE from current levels, and maintaining our dividend payout ratio. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse You've mentioned about the cost income ratio coming down a couple of percentage points. Just wanted your clarity on the benchmark, is that the benchmark that we should be looking at? Is that an FY 2012 cost to income ratio or second half 2012 cost to income ratio, from where your starting point is?</p>
          <p>And then second question on capital, one of your peers that have already reported their FY 2012 results came out with some broad sort of target ranges that were above levels, I wondered what your view was in terms of where you saw capital and core equity tier 1, noticing that you have removed your DRP discount now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll take, okay. Well, let me talk about the capital first, because whilst we've reduced the discount or we've removed the discount on the DRP, we still have the DRP in place, so there will still be take-up on that. But we've really reached a stage where I think our capital is sufficient, and the &#x2013; with the operating environment that we're in at the moment.</p>
          <p>Where will regulation go from here? I'm hoping, and this is probably naive of me, I'm hoping that this is &#x2013; and we're about where we should be. I mean I can't ever see regulators telling us we've got too much capital. But I feel that we do have to put a little bit of stress on ourselves on this, because we've got to manage capital much more effectively, and I think Shayne went through that in some detail.</p>
          <p>It is important that we manage capital much more efficiently than we have in the past. No bank in the world has managed capital very well for the pre-crisis &#x2013; for the 20 years pre-crisis, because they didn't need to. Top line growth was so significant that it just got covered up, and you were able to raise sufficient capital quite easily. And the crisis, I think, has highlighted that. So, we've really got to do a much better job with that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of the cost to income ratio into the 2% target, look, we stated that at the trading update for the third quarter. I mean logically what we've done is there was really no response to our first-half results, so I think you would take that as the starting point. I think it's more though than just the maths around it. It's really a statement of intent here to say, we get the point that it's about growth and productivity. That doesn't mean it stops here. So, we see big opportunities on that front.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just a question on the institutional business. I just wanted to get a sense on &#x2013; we're looking at the return on regulatory capital over the half, that deteriorated, and part of that is seasonal and also some of the mix effects that's going on in that business. But I just also wanted to get a sense of what's the impact the competition has had on that, and how permanent these changes on the returns overall for the business. And the bad debt charge also was one feature that came back in for the &#x2013; on transaction banking. So I'm more thinking about the pre-provisioned component of the returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, in terms of the provision, there are basically a couple of names that have been longstanding issues that we already had earmarked under collective, but then we have to release collective and raise individual.</p>
          <p>In terms of the return overall, I think there are two issues here. One is the margin contraction and that has had a lot to do with competition, somewhat irrational competition at times, I would say. And pricing has come in, but it's also been very much a part of a deliberate strategy of moving the book much more to trade business, and this is particularly true in Asia where you would expect a lower margin on that business, but it's much safer business in the short-term, self liquidating. So that was a strategic decision that we made, and I think it was the right one in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Will there be continued margin pressure? No. Look, I think that we're beginning to see an improvement there, but there is no doubt that it is very competitive. Oh, and I should have also mentioned that deposits were also very, very competitive, but I think we'll start to see that improve a little bit off the back of wholesale markets actually. We're going through a period where it's a bit easier. It's not going to last, but we just have to make hay while the sun shines.</p>
          <p>Do you want to say something, Alex, on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Direct answer to your question, margin compression has been the major driver of erosion of ROE. The strategy we have is very clear, to become less reliant on long-term lending and become more reliant on foreign exchange, trade, cash, et cetera. It is my view in the long term that that will actually improve ROE as we take a different balance sheet position. And look, the margin side, I think has got a little bit more pressure in it, but not on the liability side. In fact, if you see half to half, we've actually slowed the margin compression down, but that has been caused predominantly on the liabilities side. As Mike said, the pressure is on the asset side, predominantly in Australia, and secondly by switching the book into a trade book as a greater portion.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...and into 2013, and just where &#x2013; most of the cost initiatives were coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think there is two things going on here, one is recognize really that the environment is tight, and obviously management response is we have to work harder on productivity. So there was just a kind of &#x2013; there was a lot of folks on that really from late last year and you saw some of the actions in the first half, and then we had some restructuring charges relating to Australia and other parts, so as we acted earlier and now we're getting the benefit of that.</p>
          <p>The second thing, I think, is probably a little bit more subtle, which is the recognition that we have been building actually for five years. At some point, you get to the scale where you start to get the benefits of that and you start to be able to say, actually now we've built this thing, we've got these hubs, we've streamlined process, we've invested in technology, you start to get the benefits of that. And that's really &#x2013; the story I was telling around the transaction processing cost was really to highlight that. And we've now got sufficient scale to get that through and that's starting to really drive benefit to the businesses, and I think Australia is a good example and maybe Phil can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would like to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only reason I have mentioned it, James, this is &#x2013; these are real productivity gains. And so in terms of what happened during the half, it was kind of a steady gain through that period of time, and that's why we really expect that general trend to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The use of the hubs has been, I guess, this year has been a real turning point for us. We've been building up the hubs capability overtime and working with getting the service delivery up to the standards that we wanted. In the year we have just had, I think we had about 14% lift in our activity levels across the board for our operations group and our nominal costs were down year-on-year. So that gives you a sense of the productivity gain that we are getting.</p>
          <p>More importantly, a lot of that productivity gain is coming from automation and productivity improvements within the hub. So, they're creating new capacity as they streamline processes that we moved up there, and that's giving us the dual benefit of improving the quality, reducing error rates and lowering costs. So, I think the point Shayne makes about leveraging the benefit of investment over several years is quite correct. We are now seeing that we're in this virtual cycle, where the hubs are making fewer errors, getting better customer results, complaints are down, and we are able to absorb more and more work without adding to the head counts in the hub.</p>
          <p>So, we feel that we've got some real momentum on that piece. And in fact, I think Mike, you and I've made the comment that the only problem was this is that a lot of their costs are in that back-ups and they need to find a way of getting more of the activity covered by that type of productivity improvement. So, we've had that and I guess in the balance of it, obviously, there is full year effect of the FTE reductions that we've had, the only counter to that, of course, is we always have our one October pay increases that we need to absorb. So, looking at all those together, I think what we're looking to those to continue the same sort of momentum that we've had.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jon Mott from UBS. Mike, if you look at some of the things you've been most proud of over the couple of years, the years of management experience that you've got and the strongest level of provisioning amongst your peers, are two things you've been very proud of. When you look at this result, you're seeing a pretty material reduction in the collective provision, especially, versus credit risk weighted assets, and you're now back within the pack of your peers in the level of provisioning that you've got and you've put that up with the softening economy that you've mentioned. Is it now the right time to be releasing collective provisions and when you guided towards higher bad and doubtful debts next year, is that basically saying well, we're just not going to release the CP any further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, we've got still a very significant amount of management overlay and there is a fair amount of pressure to release this, the stuff from our external accountants who are represented here. This is not something that we do lightly. It's &#x2013; they can only exist if there is a real reason to have them and if there is not, you have to release them.</p>
          <p>Now, the release that we have used them for this time has been against identified accounts that we have had. So, we've released that CP and then we have raised individual provisions. And that's what it is there for, that's the whole idea of it. So, provision management is part of what we do and I'm comfortable with where we sit. I think that that coverage 1.08% is still good. And in light of where we are with our overall capital position, I'm still very comfortable. Do you want to say any more on that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Rich Wiles from Morgan Stanley. On the reason Asia sort of there is very little reference to credit quality and yet in this result the IIB loan losses are up 45% for the full year; they're also up 45% in the half. I wonder if you could explain the reason for that, particularly, in the context of the level of provision &#x2013; collective provision releases in that division, I think it was something like AUD200 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I thought we'd already answered that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've also got a reduction in new impaired assets in this division and as you've been mentioning, how you're trying to de-risk the book by doing shorter duration, less risky lending. So, in the context of those three facts, could you explain why the loan loss is up so much in IIB this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important thing to note is that the loan losses are not anything to do with Asia. These are &#x2013; as I say, previously identified long-term issues, which were earmarked against collective provision. We've released that collective provision and created the impaired, the specific provision, what do we call it now, individual provision.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Victor German from Nomura. Two questions, somewhat interrelated on margins. One is, you've highlighted the impact of lower rates and rates have continued to decline, and the expectations are that they will continue to decline further. Are you able to give us a little bit of a perhaps guide in terms of what margin pressure that might result in Australia business? I noticed you're shaking your head, I was hoping that's going to be the case. But &#x2013; and also secondly, on Asia as you're moving away from sort of more balance sheet intensive business into shorter duration business, is there that mix impact going to continue into the next period, and also what impact does it have on your ROE, because presumably that business should have different capital requirement as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so it's good question. So, in terms of the assets side, absolutely, I mean, I think it's prudent. Alex has been really strong in this in terms of the IIB business in particular that we emphasized shorter duration, trade buys lending over long-term. That comes at the expense of margin, but on a risk adjusted basis that's a better business for us to be and it's more aligned with our strategy. So, it will mean that margins come in and we expect that mix &#x2013; I mean I'm not sure that's what you want to call it, but I'd say, we'd expect that shift in the balance sheet to continue, because it's the right thing to do and it's aligned with our strategy, so the mix will shift over time.</p>
          <p>In terms of the deposit, lower interest rates clearly have an impact as I see it. If you got a non-interest bearing deposit, rates come down 25 points, your margins come down 25 points. What you're really asking is what's the mix between our non-interest bearing and interest bearing. So -the other problem with that is that that shifts as well, because customers' behavior changes depending on where rates are. So, it's not quite as simple just kind of mathematically roll it out and say this is the ratio we have an impact, but it will have an impact.</p>
          <p>I think it's fair to say though that over time the ratio of non-interest bearing deposits in the business has reduced over time, just in the industry, because people become more sensitive and obviously, banks compete heavily. What's been a really good performance in the Australia division, in particular, over this year, where we saw the deposit growth a lot of it was in that core end of the market, so it wasn't the kind of expensive TD end of the business. And volume growth is ultimately where you offset any of that margin, and that's why we are pleased with the performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think to also take the point that was made a little bit earlier, the competitive pressures in the deposit side particularly in the institutional are likely to come off a little bit. So, I don't expect that the &#x2013; that continuing margin compression on deposits.</p>

          <p>And you wanted me to just to add a little bit. With regards to return on an economic basis, return of trade assets is very good. On a regulatory basis in Australia only, i.e. APRA that return doesn't come through loud and clear, because of the way that they rate trade assets. We're working with APRA to try and get those rules change.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I can &#x2013; yeah I can tell you that in broad terms actually what's been a terrific transformation of trade over the last three years is this is now a business, where used to be single digit ROE on a standalone basis, just looking at trade assets today, it's mid teen and that's been the tremendous target, because we're getting benefits of scale. So what's happened as the business is growing, revenue is growing and costs have actually been held flat. And that's just &#x2013; so that's a terrific turnaround in the trade business standalone without cross-sell, so it's a mid teen kind of business. I think that's pretty decent for their business.</p>
          <p>The other thing that to Alex's point, the other benefit that you don't see there is the cross-sell from a trade staffing relationship is much better than the traditional kind of long term lending business. So, there are other benefits of being focused on trade.</p>

          <p>Yeah, again if you think about a trade line, you're bound to pick up the foreign exchange business off the back of it that significantly improves your return. So, if you're looking at it as an overall return that knocks it up into the mid 20s.</p>

          <p>Craig Williams from Citi here. Acknowledging James' earlier observations about the group's cost growth in recent periods, you're better balance sheet positioned than your peers, and access to Asia, which the group has, are you satisfied with the revenue performance this half sort of 1% growth, half-on-half, should we expect sort of greater revenue momentum and piece moving forward as you see it and or is ANZ a bit more historic catch up on costs now as we are sort of seeing this half?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so. I think it's both cost management, but also revenue growth. I mean, absolutely it's both. And again the regional strategy provides us with options and optionality that you wouldn't get from just a domestic only strategy. So, quite clearly, I still believe that there will be further growth there. I think the second half growth really there was a huge amount to do with the volatility. It was a much more benign environment than the first half, so that had significant impact, but yeah, I think the strategy is based on having that growth optionality and that's what we will continue to drive.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. Shayne, I have three quick questions. Is a bit of what we're seeing in the loan loss charts, the collective versus the IIP explained by Gunns, BrisConnect and basically Burrup, is the first question, which I suspect we previously dealt with. The second one is could you give us the RPA deposits that have been streamed down into Australia. And then the third one is the software write-off &#x2013; the capitalized software write-off of NZD220 million that everyone will forget about at the end of today, the software amortization saving going on, was that reflected in this period or do we see an instantaneous improvement in the operating cost starting the first day of the next period from that NZD220 million being written off, which is about NZD70 million a year and that's where basically the 2% improvement in the cost comes through without doing anything?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Really? It's a qualitative term. I think he is on the line actually. So obviously I don't comment on particular names with IIP, but I think it's fair to say given the size of the situations, they're reasonably well known. So in terms of RPA deposit, I don't actually have the actual number at the top of my head as of today, isn't it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's about 15 billion, I think. It's a little bit high than it has been in the past, Brian. I'll just talk to why that is. Part of the &#x2013; again, the flexibility and optionality and Mike talked about in our footprint, part of that comes through in terms of our ability and &#x2013; or choices that we have around funding as well. It just means that we have more choices available to where to access funding, given pricing and other things. And at the moment, given the &#x2013; some of the pricing pressure on Australian deposits, it was better for us to go into the APEA markets and get a little bit of deposits there. It's cheaper, and naturally that reflects rather than I don't think that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:26) a long-term shift that we're going to keep seeing that number go up far, far, far from it, but it's around 15 million today, a little bit up.</p>
          <p>In terms of the software impairment, software impairment was obviously taken in the second-half. The operating expense benefit of that is pretty small in terms of the timing.</p>

          <p>Yeah, but just in terms of those impairments, impact of those impairments themselves to the businesses get a little bit of a benefit in the second-half, yes, but it was pretty tiny. The real benefit does come into next year. That alone won't explain a whole lot of an improvement in that CTI. And certainly, hand on my heart, when we set the 2% CTI target, it wasn't with the view that we've got something in the bag from the software impairment.</p>

          <p>Oh, in terms of &#x2013; yeah. And I &#x2013; Mike's just remind me in terms of forgetting that at the end of the day, it should be a good idea. But I did want to make a point in terms of transparency around that, because it was some commentary around that thing below the line. Look, from a management performance perspective in terms of compensation, we trade that above the line. So when we put our plans, even set our targets, clearly it wasn't in the goals to have that charge below the line. So when I go to the board and make those recommendations in terms of financials, we add it back. So absolutely it got taken into account in terms of performance for individuals and for the businesses.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Wiblin from Macquarie. Perhaps a question for Shayne. Just in terms of your comments around disciplined capital allocation, can you just go into a little bit more detail about what that actually means? Is it a set of hurdle rates? Does that differ by geography? And what does it mean for the dividend potentially? If things become hyper-competitive, could that start to go up in terms of the payout if you can't find, for instance, things that are meeting your hurdle rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me &#x2013; look, this is not an exact science, right? This is basically &#x2013; we are continuing to invest in terms of the growth potential in Asia-Pacific and we will continue to do so. And some of those businesses will have lower ROE hurdles than some of our material businesses in &#x2013; traditionally in Australia and New Zealand. So there is a balancing act there. But we do have to &#x2013; it's the question of feeding the fat and starving the thin, a little bit. And you've got to put your money where you're going to get the best return for it.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously if you got a low-return business that you can actually improve, so that it &#x2013; you get the uplift, then that's far better than having a high-return business that is stable and you can't do anything with, yeah, because you've got to keep that going. So it's that sort of discipline. And again, discipline is the right word. It is just as squeezed the businesses a little bit and make sure that they really are returning something for us.</p>
          <p>What was the second part of that? The dividend. Look, I am very comfortable with the 65% payout ratio. I think that's about right. It's low by Australian standards. It's high by international standards. So I think it works for our strategy right now. I'm comfortable where that is. If we were in a position of having too much capital, we would look to disperse that in a different way. I don't think it's sensible to increase dividend and then reduce it the next year. Or whatever. Or when suddenly you've got a problem in the credit cycle, you have to look for more capital. I mean I don't see that that's very sensible. So I would like to try and keep the dividend fairly consistent.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Brett Le Mesurier of BBY. A question for Alex. The transaction banking business had income that deteriorated by 3% from the first-half to the second-half, while the risk weighted assets and therefore the capital went up by about 7%. So we've had a bit about trade in the higher ROE, but trade sits within that doesn't it &#x2013; looks like the ROE, and that business is declining. Can you comment on the factors behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're correct that the margin was &#x2013; there was some margin compression in the trade. But also, it's fair to say that on the transactional business side, which I think on the deposits side, is up 6% federal deposits, half-on-half. The effect was this margin compression there. As Shayne pointed out, when you have interest rates going down and you're at zero, it's just a straight hit to the P&amp;L. So a lot of the effect has actually come from the deposit cash management side as well as more than the trade side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; so there is two things going &#x2013; Alex, you're absolutely right, so two things are going on: one, the margin compression on transaction banking on the cash deposit, which I talked about in my piece; and second, you got a mix issue in transaction banking, because trade is a lower ROE business than cash management. So as trade grows really, really fast, which it is, just the mix within transaction banking shifts towards that when you get an averaging effect.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions on the Australia division. Just looking at the margin improvement in the second-half, it looks like it was really dominated by the retail segment, and the commercial actually went backwards. I was just interested in a bit more of the reasons behind that. Is it just SVR or are we seeing more competition on the commercial deposit side?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just in terms of the new impaireds are up in Australia, just wondering if there is any trend that you'd call out by segments or industries, or whether it's just broad-based?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Phil to explain in a bit more detail, but yeah, you are right. I mean I think the deposit environment in the commercial business has got tighter and certainly there has been much more competition. That's easing off a little bit now. It is &#x2013; it has improved slightly. In terms of &#x2013; what was the second part of that?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The impaireds? Well, I think Shayne covered that quite well in his speech. The impaired is there in the rural book and the numbers are actually quite small. But there has been a little bit of stress in that area and probably quite understandable. But, Phil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just only one thing I'd add to the comment about the impaireds in the rural book is that predominantly the uplift in the IPs is driven by changes in valuations of existing assets that are in the lending services group rather than new flow. So &#x2013; the incurring new flow. So the increase in the impaired and therefore the provisions associated with it has a lot to do with valuation effects as we are seeing the tightness in the rural markets. And that's probably the essence of what Mike has covered with the margin question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks and good morning, everyone. Just two quick questions on capital. Firstly, you've continued to optimize capital by divesting some non-strategic assets. Can you perhaps just speak about further options that exist particularly with regards to the holdings in the Asian region?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, a question on the capital intensity of the global institutional business, but particularly focusing on global market. I just note that global market risk-weighted asset growth in the first half was broadly flat, but then up 17% in the second half. Just wondering if that's predominantly driven by regulatory requirements. And if so, why was it so biased to the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the minority interest that we hold in the Asian portfolio, the partnerships, obviously under Basel 3 or under APRA's definition under Basel 3, quite clearly the capital intensity has increased in those businesses. And as you quite rightly point out, we have looked to divest a number of those assets that are not strategic, Sacombank, Visa and Origin. In terms of the businesses that we have left, most of those are strategic and form an important part of the strategy moving forward, but we evaluate these all the time. And quite clearly, that &#x2013; this means that they're going to have to meet a slightly higher hurdle than they've had to in the past. But that doesn't really detract from the fact that many of these investments are for strategic &#x2013; are important strategic investments. And the overall dilution to capital is actually quite small. So would we be doing it more of this type of investment? Quite clearly not. But the existing businesses, we're comfortable with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the issue around institutional and markets, the increase is really driven by regulatory changes as you guessed. I think what's &#x2013; I'll try to cover this a little bit in my comments. What's important there is with the new regulatory environment, there is a differentiation happening within markets in terms of the capital treatment of various businesses. And so, on a relative basis something like foreign exchange actually in the new world would look a whole lot more attractive than, say, interest rate derivatives, or some of the other businesses because of the nature of the business. So &#x2013; and quite clearly, customer sales driven business is a whole lot more attractive in any environment. So that is a benefit of the strategy that we have that really just pushes those businesses to the least capital intensive over time, but what you're seeing in the second half is a bit of a catch-up on the capital weightings.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we continue to invest in Asia. I mean that's &#x2013; that's an ongoing part of our strategy. So we will continue to invest. And if we can find good assets to buy, then we will. Right now, assets are still quite pricy. It's hard to shake them out at the moment, but we continue to look.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Organic growth, okay. Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Just firstly, one of the bit housekeeping, just the reasoning behind the AUD30 billion upward restatement of interest trading assets and the extra 1,000 people trained in the FTE head count from last half. And secondly, just with the transparency of the growth in the Asian business. If you're pushing more towards these shorter duration type of businesses because they're higher ROE, how are you managing the potential volatility to revenues against this scale that you've got, the servicing on the cost side? And does that potentially introduce more volatility to the Asian operations in the future in terms of earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the Asian businesses are very balanced. The business mix is very balanced. It's just that we are looking to skew the balance sheet a little bit more to trade and the ancillary business that's come off that. But of course you still have to provide working capital and other support for your customers. We're a relationship driven bank. So what we've been talking about that specific book, I mean there is still &#x2013; and it's still a universal banking model. What was the first question? I didn't understand it.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And going to the second question, I mean, to look clearly the growth in Asia or anywhere business has to be built on some shared platform. So in fact the part of strategy is actually to create scale for expanding the business, not by adding new business with new operational requirements. And that's what I was trying to talk about that. We stand and see the benefits of that come through. I mean it's fair to say that through the GFC with the expansion that we had in Asia, a lot of it was opportunistic to get out there while competitors were trading to acquire some good assets. And now there's been a bit of a clean-up in terms of the prices, seem to really just stream on that and push it all through the same factory and its part of the reason we're getting productivity gain.</p>

And as an accident of history you've probably got a bigger equipment financing book than your other banks.

          <p>Okay, so dealing with the mining one first. I think it's a good observation and we do have a large exposure to the resources sector. We're proud of that exposure. It's part of our strategy and strength actually. I think you really need to look into the mix of that business. So in terms of &#x2013; its focus is towards the top end of town. We don't have a strategy focus on junior miners, et cetera. It's very much the very big end of town. And then you look at the mix of business that we have there. This is &#x2013; again, this is a business focused on providing trade, working capital, foreign exchange. You're saying equipment leasing &#x2013; and actually the level of lending in terms of that business is pretty small in the scheme of the things. So you look at just the weighting that we have of our loan exposure to the sector is actually pretty tiny. In fact I think it's probably still the case that we have more deposits from that sector than we do out the door in Australia.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's a small book. The equipment leasing is again, that's part of Australia, we like that business. We are conscious of the fact that clearly it is &#x2013; those assets only have value as long as the miners themselves are doing well and there is demand for those assets, but we feel it's a much better way on a risk-adjusted basis to play that sector than just clean lending to the sector.</p>
          <p>In terms of mining services, same thing. Yes, we have exposure there. It's an industry we understand. The exposure is not that particularly large. It's well diversified geographically, well diversified in terms of actual underlying mining projects as well. It's an area that we are conscious of in terms of our exposure, and so it gets a lot of due diligence and a lot of focus from risk and the business, but we're comfortable with it.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Brian, it is a natural resources franchise. We actually have a big oil and gas to the global five place, as well as the mining sector here in Australia and obviously Indonesia. So when you look at natural resources, always keep in mind that there is an increasingly bigger oil and gas exposure to a number of the major players. The other point to make there is that the CP in terms of the model has not been reducing. The model is the model. It's the overlay that's been reducing. And as I say, you can't keep that forever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I didn't talk about that. So to the second part of your equation in terms of the overlay. I mean I think over the last few years we've been very focused in talking about the overlays that we generated as part of the movement of the GFC. So whether it was concentration overlays or economic cycle, and that's really what's got a lot of the attention. But to Mike's point, what's more important from our perspective is what is the total level of provisioning that we have. We can divide all day long the make-up of it, but that 1.08% we feel is appropriate given the risks in where we see the cycle. But as I said, it's not totally &#x2013; this is not totally a judgmental number, it has to be based on some facts and quality of our book. And we think the management overlay at around 600 in total is probably the right number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think with that &#x2013; sorry, Craig. I'm determined to deprive you. I can only apologize. One last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Craig Williams from Citi again. Capitalized software in the period, was that AUD460 million in the half, which seems like quite a strong level of run rate. So can you talk about expectations in terms of level of spend moving forward around that and what the money has been spent on broadly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So clearly part of the strategy is around growth, it's about geographic expansion, it's about product expansion. And I also talked about the fact that there's an underlying need to invest in technology, particularly around gathering deposits. That is on &#x2013; big chunks of that investment are software. And so, that's inherent in our strategy and you've seen that through the &#x2013; evolved through the years. That puts a burden on us in terms of the amortization of that. We're very conscious of that in terms of the drag it require &#x2013; it imposes on us in terms of expense.</p>
          <p>In a lower growth outlook, we have to really look at the rate of that spend. And so, we're doing a couple of things around that. One, we're increasing the bench or the hurdle at which we capitalize items that we're going to push more things to be OpEx rather than capitalized. We're taking a harder look at amortization periods to try and shorten them. So we &#x2013; and we're also &#x2013; and the way we manage projects in terms of new investments has been some new kind of more robust way, should we say, of looking at that and trying to get the timing right.</p>
          <p>I would expect &#x2013; and again, it's hard to forecast exactly, but given our current slate of projects and the investment that we've done and recognizing the fact that a lot of the stuff has been done. We've had to clean up a lot of processes, invest in a lot of stuff, like Transactive, like some market risk systems, like internet banking, most of its behind us. I would expect the total level of software on the balance sheet is going to be peak somewhere in 2013, 2014 and then we should get it into a steady state and hopefully, not immediately, but hopefully start to see that those levels come down.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I think the important point here, Craig, is that discipline with the overall cost-income ratio, but you have to accept that we have to play catch up here and we were &#x2013; we had a very poor systems architecture. When I think what we've put in, we've now got a proper &#x2013; a world-class cash management system, a world-class trade system, we've got a global credit card system, we've got a global trading system, we've got the Asian core system in place now, the New Zealand simplification down to one system, and the mobile banking, which I think is as good as it gets in Australia in particular. So there has been a lot of work and we're now coming to the end of that. So, as Shayne has been saying, we should try &#x2013; we should be seeing the benefits of that, but I think cost and in income of course, the income line.</p>
