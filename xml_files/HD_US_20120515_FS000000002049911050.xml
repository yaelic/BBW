          <p>Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $17.8 billion, up 5.9% from last year. Comp sales were positive 5.8% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.68. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 6.1%.</p>
          <p>This is the second quarter in a row that we have posted a positive comp in the U.S. of over 6%, something we haven't done in eight years. This was well ahead of our plan for the quarter and as with the fourth quarter of 2011, unusually warm weather played a significant role. We had the fourth warmest winter in history and also had the benefit of a comparison to a relatively cold winter in 2011. Not surprisingly, the areas of strongest growth for us were in our northern division where we had double-digit positive comps in the regions across the northern-most tiers. By contrast, while we had positive comps in our southern and western divisions, they were mostly in the mid to low single digits.</p>
          <p>In all, we had positive comps in 38 of our top 40 U.S. markets and Florida and California continued on the path to recovery. Adjusting for weather impacts and for the pull forward of activity, the quarter's results were encouraging and consistent with our view that our growth this year will be reflective of broad GDP growth rather than a recovery in the housing market. While there is still some &#x2013; while there are positive signs in the housing market, it is still under pressure. Pricing is stabilizing but not yet solid. Inventory is down but shadow inventory remains a concern and credit availability continues to be constrained. In this environment, our customers are looking at DIY projects as a way to save money while they improve their homes.</p>
          <p>As Craig will describe we have focused on that need and are providing innovative products at great value to make home improvements simple and more affordable. Craig and his team are also focused on developing and leveraging our merchandising tools. Our business is obviously impacted by weather, particularly at this time of year, and those tools are critical in making sure we have the right product in the right place and in the right quantity as the season breaks.</p>
          <p>Unusual weather, such as this year's, presents an additional challenge. As you know, over the last few years, we rebuilt our supply chain and centralized forecasting and replenishment. This quarter was a real live stress test of these new capabilities. There are always opportunities but overall, we are very pleased at the response of our supply chain and we also leveraged our supply chain expense for the quarter and saw a turn improvement. We had strong transaction growth in the quarter and at the same time, were able to improve our customer satisfaction scores, which is indicative of the progress Marvin and our store operations team are making. We retrained all of our associates on customer service during the quarter as part of our continuing commitment to customer service improvement.</p>
          <p>On the pro side of our business we have seen gradual recovery. To give this some context, at the height of the housing crisis, our pro business declined at a much faster rate than our consumer business. Our hypothesis was that the pro would be a leading indicator coming out of the housing crisis. The reality has been more nuanced.</p>
          <p>We are, in fact, seeing recovery in our pro business but the strength within our pro business appears to be developing sequentially within different classes of customers. Our larger pro customers are growing at a faster pace than our consumer segment, but our overall pro business is moving slightly less than the general consumer. This suggests a thawing process with the larger customers recovering first with, hopefully, stronger recovery spreading throughout the rest of our pro-base over time.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we upgraded our-dot com platform, enhancing the site's visual appeal and responsiveness. Our apps recently reached a new milestone and have been downloaded over two million times. We now have over 500,000 SKUs on our site, including our Home Decorators Collection.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in the business and Matt and his team are providing new tools throughout the company. For example we have begun the roll-out of what we call our First Phone Junior to all stores. This Junior version of the First Phone provides our associates a tool that combines the communication features of the phone with the product and inventory lookup features of the First Phone, but without the complex business analytics and product ordering functionality of the First Phone. This allows us to spread the basic functionality in the First Phone throughout the store at a fraction of the cost.</p>
          <p>On the international front, our Mexican business posted positive comps for the 34th consecutive quarter and our Canadian business also posted a positive comp, their strongest first quarter comp since 2004.</p>
          <p>Before I close, let me comment on a small acquisition we just completed. This month, we acquired a flooring measurement and quote building company MeasureComp. The company's business was largely dedicated to Home Depot and by in-sourcing this service, we can build a seamless process for our flooring customers that we expect will provide a far better experience for them and a better close rate for us.</p>
          <p>As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are raising our earnings per share and sales guidance for the year. This is based on our outperformance to plan in the first quarter, adjusted for the estimated sales we pulled forward in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on taking care of the customer and investing in our business and in our associates. I'd like to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication in the first quarter. Based on this quarter's results, over 98% of our stores would be eligible for Success Sharing, our profit sharing for program for our hourly associates. We're very proud of that result.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter driven by continued strength in our core business and enhanced by record-setting weather in February and March. Warmer-than-expected weather allowed customers to complete exterior projects and begin spring projects early. We estimate weather positively impacted U.S. comps by 300 basis points. Of which, between 80 and 100 was an estimated pull forward of activity that otherwise would have occurred in the second quarter. While northern regions benefited from a strong seasonal business and an easy compare in the first quarter, we are also pleased with the positive performance in southern and western regions where the weather was more normal.</p>
          <p>Total transactions grew by 3.9% while average ticket also increased 2.2% for the quarter. Transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 2.4% for the first quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales were up 6.7% in the first quarter. All departments except for two posted positive comps for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were indoor garden, lumber, outdoor garden, electrical, decor, paint, and hardware. Lighting, tools, millwork, building materials, bath and flooring showed positive comps. Comps in plumbing were flat and kitchens were slightly negative. Sales in the first quarter were driven by double-digit positive comps in seasonal product categories like walk-behind mowers, riding mowers, lawn accessories, soils and mulches, chemicals, grills, watering and planters. Fertilizer, exterior lighting, live goods and landscape lighting delivered solid comp performances as well. We also saw double-digit positive performance in the following outdoor project categories: decks, pressure washers, exterior stains, siding, gutters, portable outdoor power, roofing, exterior paint, windows, water proofers and fencing.</p>
          <p>In addition to exterior projects and seasonal categories, as I've shared in the past, simple decor categories continue to gain strength. Within our hard surface flooring, the combination of wood and laminate categories led the way with comps in the high teens. We are also pleased to see comp growth in other decor categories like window coverings, bath accessories, vanities, interior paint and ceramic tile.</p>
          <p>Finally, due to our continued emphasis on providing value for our customers and offering innovative products, the core of the store continues to perform, and we saw positive comps in fasteners, electrical repair, portable power, door locks, and pipes and fittings. We continue to offer our customers great values.</p>
          <p>For the professional electrician, we are introducing new load center value packs. These new larger load centers meet the increasing demand for electronics in the home while allowing for better customization per project for our pro customer. We are also expanding our successful SharkBite program by introducing new dishwasher hookups, water heater expansion tanks and many more products for the professional plumber.</p>
          <p>We launched new brushless motor technology and power tools from Makita and Milwaukee. Brushless motors use energy more efficiently than brush motors, which means more work per charge and a longer, maintenance-free motor life.</p>
          <p>For our do it-it-yourself customers we are introducing new products in decor including a significant update of our in-stock faucet assortment. We are also announcing the addition of one-inch blinds from Bali complementing our Home Decorators Collection's premium faux wood blinds.</p>
          <p>For outside of the home, we have new weatherproofing wood stains from Behr and new Masonite and Feather River fiberglass doors. Also for Father's Day we he have a strong product line-up in our gift centers and at the end of the second quarter, we will have a storage event, which will feature products from departments across the store and from our Home Decorators Collection.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to mention the work of our consumer insights team. As Frank said, we're beginning to see a recovery in our pro business and this recovery appears to be sequential but by only a certain class of pro. This analysis is the direct result of the team's efforts to bring our consumer analysis in-house. The ability to see customer purchase patterns on product and frequency has enhanced our shift from mass marketing to personalized communication.</p>
          <p>In addition to seeing broad trends in our business, we are now able to analyze specific customer behavior. We can look inside customer segments, for example painters, or electricians, and the data helps our CRM tools and as a result, led to more productive and successful direct marketing campaigns. As we continue to enhance our attributing capabilities inside our enterprise data warehouse across product, customer and geographies, we will drive efficiency in our response to trend recognition and actions with our CRM team.</p>
          <p>Finally this was a demanding quarter and I'm proud of the hard work by our stores, merchants and supply chain as they did a great job to meet the needs of our customers and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $17.8 billion, a 5.9% increase from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 5.8% for the quarter with positive comps of 6.2% in February, 6% in March and 5.4% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6.1% for the quarter with positive comps up 7.2% in February, 5.8% in March and 5.6% in April.</p>
          <p>Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter and, an increase of 8 basis points from last year of which seven basis points came from our U.S. business. In the U.S., the gross margin expansion can be solely attributed to benefits arising from our supply chain transformation. Excluding supply chain benefits, the gross margin for the U.S. was flat to last year due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold. For the year, we continue to expect moderate gross margin expansion.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 109 basis points to 25.1%. Total operating expenses grew at a factor of 24% of our sales growth, better than our original guidance due principally to the sales environment. For the quarter, our operating expenses were within $8 million of our original plans.</p>
          <p>Based on our first quarter results we now expect total expenses to grow at approximately 40% of our sales growth rate on a 52-week basis.</p>
          <p>Turning to interest and other expense, you may recall that we had guaranteed a $1 billion senior secured term loan issued by HD Supply and established a $67 million fair value liability related to this guarantee. In the first quarter, our guarantee was terminated and as a result, we reversed the liability. This reduced other expense by $67 million and provided approximately $0.03 of earnings per share benefit in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our income tax provision rate was 36.5% in the first quarter and for the year, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.</p>
          <p>Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.68, an increase of 36% from last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to our operational metrics, during the first quarter, we opened two new stores in the U.S. for an ending store count of 2,254. At the end of the first quarter, selling square footage was 236 million. Total sales per square foot for the first quarter were $304, up 6% from last year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, inventory was $11.6 billion, down approximately $100 million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.3 times, up from 3.9 times last year. We ended the quarter with $43.3 billion in assets, including $3.2 billion in cash. We are about $500 million ahead of our cash plan, due in large part to in the money stock options that were exercised in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.1 billion, or approximately 19.4 million shares of outstanding stock, including $2.1 million shares through open market repurchases and 17.3 million shares through an accelerated share repurchase program. The shares acquired under the accelerated share repurchase program are an initial calculation. The final number of shares we purchased will be determined upon the completion of the program in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 15.4%, 240 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>As you've heard, the warm spring weather and continued strong performance in the core of our store drove first quarter sales ahead of our internal expectations, but it's our point of view that the fundamental assumptions behind our 2012 financial plan haven't changed. As a result, we are simply raising our guidance for fiscal 2012 to reflect first quarter outperformance, offset in part by the sales we believe we pulled forward into the quarter.</p>
          <p>On a 53-week basis, we now expect fiscal 2012 sales to increase approximately 4.6%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. Based on our first quarter results we now project fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 17% to $2.90 on a 53-week basis.</p>
          <p>This earnings per share guidance includes share repurchases completed in the first quarter and our intent to repurchase an additional $2.4 billion in shares over the course of the year. Our guidance assumes that share repurchases will contribute about $0.07 of EPS accretion in 2012 offset by $0.02 of dilution coming from shares issued in association with stock option exercises.</p>
          <p>We look forward to sharing with you a longer range business out outlook at our investor conference on June 6 in Atlanta. We thank you for your participation in today's call and Christy, we are now ready for questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one question to follow up. Your current guidance adds up to about a 10% operating margin and that's with no strong &#x2013; with nothing really in the housing market, as you mentioned, and just the beginning of the contract business coming back. In a stronger market as you look at your &#x2013; at what you've done internally, what type of margin assumption &#x2013; where do you think you can get to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gary, we have an investor conference coming up on June 6, at which time -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Am I going to ruin the conference with this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Thank you for teeing it up for us, actually. We'll talk about our longer-term margin opportunities. We're not stopping at 10%. We have an opportunity, we believe, to grow our margin. If you remember, our peak margin back in 2005 was 11.8%. We'll give you a lot more color on June 6th.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that doesn't count as a question. Could you talk about share gains this quarter? Your comps were much stronger than one of your competitors. The other one obviously hasn't reported. What do you think you did in terms of market share for different categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Gary, we look at share two different ways. We obviously look at the census data from the NIACs. That would actually indicate that we lost share although there are companies in there that have a much smaller base that had huge, huge gains which affects the number, and then when we look at the consumer side of independent tracking which doesn't include our pro business, we gained in four departments out of our total. That would have been lighting, lawn and garden, kitchens and millwork. When we try to triangulate the data working with our suppliers we do feel that we're gaining share in a number of our business categories but those two indicators are what they are.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go to our next question from Colin McGranahan from Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Wondered about pull-forward of demand. This is going to be a little bit confusing, but if I look at the fourth quarter, your 5.7% comp, I think at that point, you said weather was a benefit of 200 to 250 basis points, so I may be getting a little too nuanced here but if I were to back that out, I'd say the fourth quarter weather adjusted comp was maybe 3.2% to 3.7%. If I look at this quarter, you comped at 5.9% and said 300 basis points. So again, a little nuanced but backing it out would suggest a 2.9% weather adjusted comp. So I guess my first question is, is that reasonable and do you think the underlying business actually decelerated by something, about 50 basis points or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an art as much as a science in terms of what's weather impacted and obviously for us, the fourth quarter is a little bit anomalous because it's our lowest volume and heavily driven by how we perform on the seasonal holiday, which was very strong for us in the fourth quarter. I would tell you it didn't feel like the business decelerated, but weather, as Craig mentioned and you know, Marvin is here for the store side, boy our stores were very, very busy and we had huge transaction growth in the first quarter. So I understand your point, Colin, on weather adjusted, did we decelerate, but I would say it didn't feel like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. Again, I know it was a very nuanced kind of thing, just trying to make a little bit more science out of it than probably is worthwhile. But then as I think about pull forward of demand, I guess my second question is, how do you measure that? How comfortable do you get with that 80 to 100 basis point estimate? And if that's the right number, should we think about this quarter being something around a 3 comp, the first quarter being something around a 3 comp on a weather adjusted basis and then back out 80 to 100 to think about 2Q comp, something more like in the 2% range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just share with you the math behind it or the science behind the art, because we do try to apply some science. We will take five years of garden business looking at the relationship between the first and second quarter and we'll come up with a ratio that we regress against the first quarter results, which will give us a factor to apply against the second quarter projected sales against our plan and that's how we determine what we have pulled forward. Again, 80 to 100 basis points of our total comp growth pull forward. That's about $120 million to $150 million. We then, Colin, do an eyeball test, and we look at the categories where we saw sales growth that would be one-time categories, be it a riding lawn tractor or a walk-behind mower that sort of thing where typically you are only going to buy it once in a season, to give us some comfort that our math is more or less correct. And that's in &#x2013; Craig is just asking me to make sure it's clear that when we say weather impacted of 300, the 80 to 100 is in that 300 number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. It's not additive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. And then my follow-up question, Carol, while I've got you here, just on OpEx, you said you were within $8 million of the plan from the beginning of the quarter. It seems like obviously you probably hadn't planned for comps this strong. So were you able to just deal with the labor as it was because productivity is so much better, or did you add labor as sales picked up and found other places to take out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we leveraged payroll in the first quarter, but the stores did an awesome job of staffing up to meet the sales demand and Marvin, you might want to comment on that.</p>

          <p>Colin, we put in a new labor system, scheduling system last year. It was part of our 60-40 initiative, worked with Matt and his team to get this in place. It was a big undertaking but it really paid dividends this quarter because we were able to have our labor meet our sales demand and schedule and forecast to that in a more effective manner.</p>
          <p>For the first time, our store managers were able to track their labor versus their sales performance on a daily basis. We've never been able to do that before. So that enabled us not only to meet the demand but also to make the right investments in departments like live goods where for the first time we actually experienced a customer service score increase in the live goods area during season. Typically for us, Q1, we take a really big decline in service scores in that seasonal area. So we made a labor investment based on the new system and we actually saw improved sales as the numbers reflect, but in addition, we saw improved customer service scores.</p>
          <p>So we feel good about the process and we feel good the about the leverage we were able to create because the leverage was created on top of increased sales and on top of increased customer service scores.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A couple questions, so first on your pro commentary, the largest customers recovering faster and sequentially but the rest really not recovering, what's been the discussion internally on what you think that represents and what customers are on the other side of that transaction and what projects they're doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, I'll give you a hypothesis, but again, recognize that this is just a working hypothesis and we'll have to see as this goes forward. The first just comment to make is, I was in the commentary differentiating between the pros, our larger pro spend customers and our smaller pro spend customers. pro overall, so in both segments, it's recovering. Where we're seeing outsized recovery versus our consumers with our larger pros, I'd give a hypothesis that credit has something to do with that, that those are the larger, more credit-worthy firms and as you think about kind of a thawing process, it sort of makes sense that they start picking up business in advance of some of our smaller customers. That's the theory. As Craig said, we have a lot more analytics that we now have at our disposal to put to the question and hopefully over time we'll get more and more refined on exactly what's driving that difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can give you some numbers behind the comments that Frank just shared with you. If we look at the insights, consumers grew about 7% in the quarter. pros grew about 5%. Thank you. In their sales growth, and then our larger pros, those who spend more than $10,000 with us annually, they grew around 11%. That's about 12% of the pro base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, this is Marvin, the additional point to that probably the vast majority to all of the growth came from those large customers, so in addition to credit, it's also moderate demand. When demand is moderate, those smaller pros don't get the subcontracting jobs that they typically get and what happens when there's high demand is that the large pros can't handle all the work that they get and so residual work kind of falls down to some of the smaller GCs in the marketplace, but when demand is moderate and as Frank mentioned it's recovering, those larger pros can take those jobs and it meets their work schedules and their capacity. We feel good about the moderate recovery but until we see every pro in our demographic start to benefit, then we stay cautiously optimistic that it's recovering but not fully.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. I wonder if you can update us a little bit more on what you are seeing in the competitive environment and if you have any commentary around the introduction of Amazon supply?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Amazon Supply?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kate, I would say from a competitive perspective first know that it would be very early in the day to see anything from Amazon Supply, obviously it's something we're very aware of and focused on, but no competitive impact from it. Across the board, as Craig was saying, it's always worthwhile recognizing that we compete in all of our different business segments across a broad range of competitors. We believe talking to our vendors that we're picking up share, but that's always &#x2013; just because our various markets are so different, it's always hard to track precisely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And one of your competitors is doing a pretty extensive line review right now and I wondered if that was having any impact at all with some of your conversations with vendors and maybe your relationship with your vendors and what you're getting into your stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, again, we're, in constant communication with our suppliers, our focus is on driving with our suppliers and we're always talking to folks in the market who we do business with and we don't do business with. So really no major change to how we're approaching things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would say that growth is a great thing to deliver to our suppliers and we grew ourselves in 2011 and we started off the year pretty strong.</p>

          <p>We'll go to our next question from Allen Rifkin with Barclays. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Question on the gross margin line. Carol, you mentioned that the gross margins were aided mostly from improvement in supply chain, but compared to the last few quarters, it looks like those improvements are moderating. Can you maybe give us an update on where you think future improvements from the RDC initiative are likely to come and what those benefits may be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We were actually very pleased with our supply chain performance in the first quarter. It was better than our plan and given the sales spikes that we had across the country, we needed to do amazing things to move product, so kudos to our supply chain team for doing such a great job and for delivering the leverage that they did deliver. A couple of other points, Alan. First, we did have some fuel headwind come our way in the first quarter that cost us about 3 basis points so the spiking benefit would have been 11 ex- the fuel. If you think about year-over-year, last year we got about 32 basis points of benefit coming off the supply chain. This year, we will probably get about a third of that for the year and that's consistent with the plan that we laid out and if you look longer term, and again, we have got an investor conference coming up in June, we'll show you even more benefits coming off supply chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. One follow-up, if I may. Just going back to the difference on the pro side, between the larger pros and the smaller pro business, what opportunities are there for to you try to stimulate the smaller pro customer including credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Alan, the biggest opportunity we have with our pro customer, which is what Marvin and his team are focused on, is doing a great job getting them in and out of the store fast and having the product that they want in the right quantity and at the right price. And that's really where we're focused and that's where Marvin has focused his team. I don't know, Marvin, if you want to comment. So we're not thinking about a new program on our side on credit to try to stimulate activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But when you do approve 70% of all applications that we receive from our pros, the average line that we grant is about $6,600, so we will provide credit to those who qualify and a 70% approval rate is a pretty good approval rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and Alan, to the service point that Frank made, our net promoter score for the pro segment increased 453 basis points in the quarter. It's the largest improvement in service we have in the entire store and when you dissect that service score into components, the most improved component is the speed of checkout and how the pros feel about our price and our product. So for us, we've asked a lot of questions, we've spent a lot of time with these customers, both small and large and we asked those customers what can we do to facilitate a better environment for them and the service, in and out fast is important, the right products at the right price is important and as Carol mentioned, we feel really good about our credit offering. So we're just very hopeful that we'll continue to do these things and that business segment will continue to improve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then just one quick point of clarification, did I hear you correctly in saying that larger pros who spend $10,000 or more represent 12% of your pro base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. During the script, you alluded to some stress within the supply chain that you handled well over the quarter. Do you think that had the impact of restraining your sales and are you able to quantify that during the period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I don't think we can quantify it for you, but for sure and Craig and Mark Holifield, our head of supply chain are here. This was a very unusual winter and we got hit with some very unusual demands and we were really pleased at how our supply chain responded but the reality is, you are always a little bit chasing in that kind of a spike environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we had regions of the country, Michael, where we had product categories that drove comps in excess of 50%. Certainly our suppliers didn't plan and anticipate that, nor did we at the beginning of the season, but everybody rallied to scramble. Really hard to tell if you missed sales. In most product categories, we carry a multitude of products to choose from so whether you actually missed a sale or not is a question that's pretty hard to get your head around. We certainly know we had opportunities within the quarter in those kind of high spike areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's probably safe to assume that supply chain always acts as a bit of a bottleneck in such a spiky and seasonally changing business. Do you think it was any more intense given the patterns you saw during this quarter than it has been in the past, especially given the newness of the supply chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say actually I think the supply chain allowed to us react faster than we would have been able to before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did, as I said,  this was an interesting real stress test on a new system and we were really pleased with how it responded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember the last time we saw these kind of comps was fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. And back then we didn't have much of a supply chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Michael, speaking as the guy that runs the stores and takes the calls and emails from the stores when we're not performing well in any part of the business, they were very pleased. You look at the northern parts of the country, high volume markets, accelerated spike sales, the supply chain team did yeomen's work and we were very pleased with our ability to get products to the market, in some cases before our competition and we feel good about that. So we think that Mark and his team deserve a ton of credit for helping to us to facilitate the sales that we were able to bring to the table.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to switch gears just as my follow-up. In the past, the relationship between home improvement and housing has been that home improvement has tended to lag behind at least the velocity of housing turnover. Are you seeing any evidence to suggest that the relationship may be a little different this time where the home improvement may be picking up before housing and if that's the case, could take some wind out of sails as the housing market recovers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I would say, Michael, if I understand your question, the first thing I'd say is that the home improvement, the repair remodel business has obviously been more stable than the housing market, you know, particularly the new home build, and so you are seeing some more elevated, you know, growth compared to home building. I'm not sure I &#x2013; the second part of your question, which is could that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if consumers are feeling better about that, the sentiment has improved and that would normally occur or at least in the past, it would have occurred concurrent with housing lift in either prices or the velocity of turnover and now it seems like sentiment has been improving faster than the fundamentals of the underlying housing market so maybe home improvement is getting a little bit more of a lift ahead of time and that would take some of the benefit, I guess, essentially pulling it forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So here's how I'd answer that and, you know, again, we'll see how it responds so this is kind of new territory for all of us, but I'd say the important thing to look at is, both on housing, existing home turnover and on repair/remodel activity, just think about the number of mortgages that are underwater. So you've got almost a quarter of the people who own mortgages that are underwater. That is both stressful on a turnover. That kind of puts a bit of a brake on existing home turnover and it's stressful on repair and remodel activity. You do some basic repair activity, but you're less inclined to do large remodels when you're underwater. And we'll talk about this more in our upcoming conference, but I'd say what you would hope to see is pricing improving, credit availability improving and the lift across both segments so if I understood the kind of basis of your question which is would home improvement repair/remodel decelerate into the improving housing picture, we don't think that is how it will play out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so there still could be good days ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly think so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good luck. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go to our next question from Greg Melich from ISI. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I want to follow up on an earlier question and I have one on inventory and cash flow. The follow-up is the ticket which was up 2.2 in the quarter. It sounded look a lot of that was driven by seasonal projects and also these large contractors. So does that mean as we decelerate in the second quarter it will be more ticket, do you think, or do you think it's really traffic that is driving that deceleration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we look at ticket above $900, the big drivers in this quarter for that were riding lawn equipment. We had a solid quarter in appliances and then interestingly the in-stock kitchen business which largely focuses on our pro customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, we had 329 million transactions in the first quarter. That's the highest in our company history. So we would think that would start to slow down as we move into the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically, it sounds like both are going to slow when you see it in 2Q? And then on the cash flow, inventory was down but payables were up 9% and your cash balance ended up over $3 billion, which is very heavy. If I take your guidance, I get your leverage moving down around 1.8 tines debt to EBITDA by the end of the year. Would you go to the debt markets to try to keep that at 2, or are you sort of happy with it being at 1.8 if that's where it ends up? Just give us some thoughts on the working capital on the leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, well first on the working capital side, the payables ratio is really a reflection of how weak sales were in April of 2011. As you'll recall we had a negative comp in April. Our purchases were down. We had a positive comp this year and so it's just a timing matter year-on-year</p>
          <p>We are about $500 million ahead of our cash plan, but that's because of stock options that were exercised in the first quarter that we hadn't planned on. Our stock hit a 10-year high. Many of our optionees elected to exercise their options and we got some cash in.</p>
          <p>As we think about then what do we do with the cash and what do we do with our capital structure, I don't mean to kick the can down the road, but I'm going to kick it to our June conference at which time, we'll give you more color about any additional share repurchases we might do in 2012 as well as a longer-term perspective on share repurchases debt capital raising, etcetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess just lastly, do you think the inventory is now at the right level, or are we still a little light given how strong the quarter was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at our inventory, down $100 million year on year, on a per-store basis, down a little over 1%, the majority of the per-store decline as of the end of the quarter was in Canada, and last year, our Canadian inventories were bloated, in all candor. So we feel good about where inventory is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other piece of the inventory, Greg, is with the investments we made in our DC F&amp;R programs, we have actually been able to leverage our inventory investment in our DCs while maintaining good position overall, so we feel good about that as well</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot. Good morning. Two questions and the first revolves around the merchandising efforts. Obviously, you have been working on building localization, regionalization of inventory. Can you help us understand how that might have impacted your in stock and it might have benefited margin above and beyond the direct supply chain benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Matt, you're right. We've been working hard to make sure that we are adjusting our assortments to the local markets and the demographics in those markets. We certainly think that is part of what has helped us drive the overall business and deliver the comp performance not only in this quarter but kind of where we have been for the past few quarters and certainly when you get the product in the right location, you then benefit from, you know, particularly if they're in seasonal businesses. You don't have the same liquidation expense that you might have like we did a few years back when we weren't leveraging or didn't have the capability of the tools that we have. So certainly having the right product in the right place benefits you in terms of the ability and the amount that you sell at full price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt this is Marvin, I don't think we can overstate the importance of product coming from receiving to the sales floor versus in the overhead. Mark Holifield and his team in the supply chain along with Mark Powers and the operations team have really done a good job of partnering on the whole receiving and freight movement process. You follow the Home Depot for a while and just take a look at the overheads in our stores versus years past and what you'll see is product where it needs to be and that's on the floor where we can sell it, our payroll is a lot more productive and we don't need to carry as much safety stock because of the supply chain improvement. I think you take what Craig said. You think about the efficiencies on the supply chain and in the receiving and in-stock process and that's benefiting us as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any way to quantify that year on year, or just we know it that helped?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's pretty tough to actually put a number to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. On the numbers and this is maybe a bit of an academic exercise since we have a sense of where Q2 is tracking, but within the first quarter, the cadence was driven by better weather in part for the first couple of months and then you had this presumably a lot of pull forward within the quarter and this very subdued compare given the rain a year ago. Any sense on how much February and March pulled forward from April just as we look at the monthly multi-year trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we didn't do that regression. We should have, but we didn't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally, Carol, you spoke at the outset of the year about your anticipation for comp cadence over the year as a whole. Clearly, I guess the first quarter probably, at least in your outlook, is a high watermark. In the update, I think about the ensuing quarters and what kind of cadence might you anticipate as part of that guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Because of the pull-forward, the second quarter comp should be lower than the first quarter. The comp for the first half should be higher than the back half, not a big difference between the halves, but clearly, first half will be stronger than the back half</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second quarter versus the rest of the year, if I could try to parse it that finely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the second quarter would be the lowest comping quarter of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Despite the fourth quarter compare?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Despite the fourth quarter compare because, as you know, every year we tend to outperform the previous year since Craig and the merchants and the operators are doing a masterful job of growing our seasonal business. This is a something that we're very low penetrated in and we continue to show year-on-year growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You guys have been pretty adamant for quite a while that there isn't a recovery in the housing market and that you expect to fluctuate with GDP, but you have been comping in the 4 to 6 range the last few quarters and I understand the weather has helped the last two, but I guess the question is, if we were to get a housing recovery, what kind of comps do you think you guys could generate on, let's call it, a multiyear basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Scot, first, I don't want us misinterpreted as saying that there is no housing recovery. I think the housing market is definitely better. The question for us is, is it better enough to kind of push us off the general GDP growth connection that we've been seeing for the last couple of years? And we go, yep, it's better, but it's not yet that much better.</p>
          <p>When we get together in June, hopefully we can lay out for you a little more clearly how we think our business improves depending on your point of view on the degree of the housing market recovery, strong recovery when it occurs and whether it's a strong recovery or just kind of a very gradual thaw.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair, then just curious in terms of, you know, mix. I don't know if you guys mentioned this or not, but you know, with the stronger sales of outdoor products because of the weather, was there a negative impact on the gross margin from mix at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As we said, the gross margin ex- supply chain was flat year on year and that was a mix story. Craig, maybe you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, categories like outdoor power equipment, dirt, mulch, all those carry lower than average margins so it certainly had a mix impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You may recall last year, Scot, we had 14 basis points of gross margin benefit in the first quarter from mix because we had a lower penetration of seasonal categories then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, thanks a lot, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you guys. So Frank, you'd said that Florida and California continue to recover. Can you quantify that relative to last quarter where I think you said Florida was ahead of the comp average and California was about in line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and this quarter as you might expect, given just the weather impact, Florida and California were below the company average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and so then I guess therefore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's still a good recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still positive and a good recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. And then you said 38 out of 40 regions were positive so two were negative. Surprised that any were negative. Can you just tell us what areas were negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>38 out of our top 40 markets. I mean, we don't have 40 regions. The negative ones were, for what it's worth, it was Phoenix and then we also were negative in New Orleans and there are some very specific conditions in both of those markets that explain that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Particularly the year-over-year comparisons. Last year in the first quarter, those two markets were some of our strongest performing markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just more curious than anything. And then one last question. The commentary that you talked about the large pro versus small pro, I don't think you've talked about that before. So I'm just wondering why you call it out now? Is it a change in trend that you are seeing, that sort of dynamic where the large is doing so much better than the small pro, is that something you have seen consistently or did that really just sort of pop up early this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, so I'll tell you why we called it out. In part, first off, because I do think it's an interesting way of thinking about our business and thinking &#x2013; for us it's a tool for thinking about the recovery of the business because we've been talking to everyone for quite a while about how our pro and consumer businesses, how they're differentially faring. And the second thing was, as Craig said, and for those of you who have followed us for a while, you know we've been sort of on a journey to build in some of this customer insight capability. We had it outsourced and then we brought it in-house and it's taken a while for us to get comfortable with the tools, get the data together and so we were kind of giving you a, here's what those tools are showing us, here's what we think the implications are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's not necessarily &#x2013; it's just that you are starting to look at it now but it's not necessarily that the large pros all of a sudden have gotten a lot better than the small pro or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, as we called out, that we saw some good-sized growth on those large pros which is encouraging. As I said, you can have a theory of the case on how the pro market as a whole will thaw and we'll be giving periodic updates I'm sure on how that hypothesis is playing out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Fair enough. Okay, thank you, guys.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. A few quarters ago there was a lot of concern in the market about the potential uptick in promotional activity across the space. Can you talk about how the promotional tone was during the quarter and how it was versus your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, to be honest with you, we didn't see any major shift in promotional activity during the quarter at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, perfect and then some regional color on this pro recovery trend. Not to beat a dead horse here, but particularly those larger pros, are there any markets in particular where that recovery by the larger pro is particularly strong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, this is Marvin. It's no coincidence that the north and the northeast was very strong. Really due to the ability of pros to get out and do jobs they typically would not be able to do this time of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Marv, so more of a weather thing. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christy, we very time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our last question comes from David Strasser from Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'm going to change the topic a little bit. Can I talk a little bit about online and private label? Two things I've noticed a lot of recently is, it just seems you have been really expanding online as you have talked about a lot, particularly into the seasonal patio furniture. I was just curious how that's gone and sort of this home decorator concept that you've had? I think it's through Groupon and I don't know if it's exclusively Groupon.</p>
          <p>And then I guess the last question somewhat related is the HDX, I'm seeing that brand pop up a lot in stores. So I was just sort of curious, as you think about that, it seems to be a somewhat rather diverse group of product offerings in that and how you're thinking about that. So I guess three somewhat different questions, but I hope you can at least answer two of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, let me start with the online. As you know, we've been investing in our online business. We put new WebSphere 7 in place to enhance our capabilities, improve the speed, which is important obviously for our customers. We're very pleased with how that business is going. We're seeing both sales growth that obviously exceeds the company and we're seeing traffic growth in that space, and so it's an area of business that's important to us. You know, it's still around 2% of the business in total.</p>
          <p>We have seen some nice external recognition of the work that we've done as well in terms of the ForeSee E-Retail Satisfaction Index. We got above 79 which is a new place for us, which is a very positive result and recognized as the most improved since that index began at over 10 points. So we're pleased with where that space is going and overall how it's helping us to satisfy the customers' needs to be able to shop when, where and how they want.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the private label business, you know, we've talked quite openly with our supply base in terms of when and why we'll go after a private label program. We are expanding the opportunity that we have to continue to drive value for our customer and be able to deliver, you know, strong value propositions as well as support the overarching strategy that we have in place to compete in all channels. So you'll see us. We'll talk more about that at our investor conference, but that is an element of the business that, you know, we're focused on as part of our portfolio strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up and kind of, once again, the two of them are related, as you look at a lot more free shipping and you are offering it even on patio furniture over $399, the impact to that on gross margin and then sort of, I guess, the positive impacts on sort of the HDX, is that even big enough to have any impact at all today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we do look at the business in total in terms of, you know, how we look at both sales and the contribution margin, both in store and online and how those businesses come together. You know, so that is something that we're focused on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But your point about size is the right point. Today, our dot-com sales is about 2% of our total sales.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

          <p>All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p>
