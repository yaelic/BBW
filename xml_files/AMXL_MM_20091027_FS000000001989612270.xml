          <p>Good morning everyone. This is Tomas Lajous from UBS. Thank you all for joining us on Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil's conference call for the third quarter of 2009. I am pleased to introduce Daniel Hajj, CEO of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, Carlos Garc&#xED;a Moreno, CFO, and Daniela Lecuona, Head of IR. I will turn the call over Daniel and Carlos for their initial remarks and then we can move on to the Q&amp;A session. Dan?</p>

          <p>Yes thank you, Tomas. Thank you everybody for joining us in the call. Carlos is going to make a summary of the results of this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning, everyone. Thank you Tomas for hosting the call. Although there are signs of an economic recovery in several countries, particularly in South America, subscriber growth has remained subdued throughout the region. Net additions were lower than the previous quarter and substantially below those of a year before. There were two major exceptions: TracFone in the U.S. and Claro in Brazil. TracFone added 712,000 subscribers in the quarter which was flat with respect to the previous quarter but doubling those of the year earlier quarter, while in Brazil we obtained 1.8 million subs, twice as many as the previous quarter although still below the same period of 2008. Altogether we added four million subs in the quarter, 11.6 million year-to-date, which growed to 194.3 million, our wireless subscriber base. We have been increasingly successful in attracting clients that are more sensitive to the overall quality of service and that are preshared request of our networks and our more than technological standards. All major operations plus some more have been growing more rapidly in the postpaid than the prepaid one.</p>
          <p>The increasing importance of postpaid subscribers in our base and the significant expansion of data revenues made possible by our investments in 3G networks over the last couple of years were the main drivers of revenue expansion in a weak economic environment. Our quarterly revenues, 100 billion pesos, were up at 16.9% over the prior year with service revenues increasing 19.5%. The depreciation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar and all Latin currencies, particularly the real and the Colombian peso, explain part of the increasing service revenues. The quarter EBITDA was up by 15.9% from a year ago to 40.4 billion pesos, with the margin remaining roughly flat from a year ago at 40.5%. Operating profits in turn totaled 27.7 billion pesos in the quarter, bringing the total to September to 82.6 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>Our net financing costs were down 82.5% year-on-year to 653 million pesos. Year-to-date, they were down 80.3% in annual terms as a result of foreign exchange gains, lower interest rates and a reduced level of net debt. We obtained a net profit of 18.7 billion pesos, which exceeded by 50.6% the previous year. Our earnings per share rose 57.3% in the period. Our net debt came down by 32.6 billion pesos in the nine months to September while our capital expenditures reached 25.5 billion pesos. Distribution to shareholders via buybacks and dividends totaled 27.5 billion pesos. At the end of the quarter, our net debt to EBITDA came down to 0.58 times.</p>
          <p>Tomas, I think this would be the summary and we could open up the floor for Q&amp;A.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is about Brazil, I want to understand what it takes for the margins in Brazil to improve and what is still pressuring the margins at this point? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Vera. Well, if you see Brazil, if you saw Brazil this quarter, we doubled the net adds against last quarter. Even the margin reduced a little bit, but if you see all overall, the amount of EBITDA is more or less the same that we have last quarter. In Brazil, we still think that we have growth. The economy is not so bad. So, in Brazil, we're still focusing on the growth, and we are also growing a lot on the postpaid. So those are the main things that we are doing in Brazil. We still think that for the next year or two, Brazil is going to have very good growth. So we're still focusing in the growth in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would be level of normalized margin, so when this growth phase is behind us where do you think margins in Brazil can go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think mid thirties would be margins in Brazil, Vera. Brazil is a country where you have a little bit more cost than other countries, so I think mid thirties would be a good margin for Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Vera.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, this is Tomas here. I got cut off momentarily. If I can ask a question myself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start actually with two semi-specific questions that will hopefully allow you to shed some light on strategy going forward. The first one is related to the report last night. Things look solid at the consolidated level, but the margins and net have come among others look a little bit odd. Can you help explain the difference a bit more than you have already done? That would be very helpful. Is it postpaid, is it data links, is it both, is it data or voice? And the second question is related. Network expenses are rising and a key thing for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is data network infrastructure. Can you talk to us about infrastructure needs and investment and capital intensity going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question is I think it has to be a lot on postpaid, Tomas, as to we are growing a lot on postpaid. Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is trying to grow on postpaid a good subscribers. These subscribers on postpaid we think are the subscribers that are going to get data in the future. We're spending more in better handsets so 25% of our net adds this quarter were postpaid, are postpaid. So I think it's the highest we have been having since long time and we're spending a little bit more on better handsets. These better handsets are going to give us more data, more services. So I think that's the main reason. In the exchange rates also has a lot to do with this in this quarter. It's different in each of the countries, so the weight of the countries in the EBITDA or in the revenues changed a lot with that. And that means that the cost also fluctuates a lot because of the exchange rates. But what I can tell you about the investments is that we don't have it. We don't have the final budget for next year, but we don't see any main change in the CapEx for next year, even that we're going to invest a lot on the data on the links, as you were saying, on the backbone on 3G. I think we have been doing that for maybe two years investing in 3G and we don't see any major change on the investments for the next year, Tomas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Michael Clark from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Carlos and Daniel. A couple of questions. First, you alluded to depreciation expense being higher than expected or higher in Guatemala in particular because of accelerated depreciation. Is that a one-time event or should we expect this kind of level of depreciation to continue? And then secondly, if I may, on the topic of mobile termination rates at the Telef&#xF3;nica Investor Day two weeks ago, they alluded to the likelihood that these rates might come down in Brazil starting in 2011 and I was wondering if that is also your expectation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of Guatemala, I think the depreciation will remain at the current levels through the end of the year. We don't expect it to continue at that level going forward. And as regards Brazil, well I think that, you may recall that a bit more than a year ago, we engaged in an accelerated depreciation of the TDMA assets. So from time to time, what we'd like to do is to make sure that the value in our books will be, will be well resulted that we have it really representative of the market value of the assets. So from time to time, we engaged in assessments of these values and when needed would proceed to a faster depreciation, okay. That's something that we do on an ongoing basis to ensure that the value of our assets in our books is not far from the market value total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the termination rates in Brazil, I think we are also expecting that they reduce in 2011, but we don't have anything discussed with the government or with anybody still today. So, it's very early to know what is going to be the reduction, but I think it's going &#x2013; we are going to have a reduction on the termination rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Gary Powell from Wells Fargo Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning everyone. I was wondering if you quantify just what you think the overall market opportunity is for 3G wireless broadband, just given the relatively low wireline penetration in your country or in your regions. And do you think that most of your countries can achieve broadband penetration rates similar to that of the U.S. in the high 60% range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all I want to clarify and to tell you that I think Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is ahead of everybody, all the wireless operators in the region on the investments on 3G on the backbone, on the backhaul. We have been investing a lot, I think. That's something that nobody saw that, but at the end of the day it is going to help us a lot into the market. But we have been advancing a lot on the infrastructure. We have been also advancing a lot on the growth on the data services. So, we feel that of course we can have the same penetration on data as the U.S., and we're thinking that the next secular trend of the wireless is going to be data. So, we are very enthusiastic about the data and we feel that it has a big future in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just as a quick follow up, can you tell us what is the most popular rate plan is in Mexico for your netbook offering. And then I know it's early, but just how should we think about churn and margins on the product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have a lot of offers in the netbooks only with the PC SIM cards. We have been, I think, selling for $40 unlimited until 3 gigs or 5 gigs. So I think we have a very good offer today. And we have, we're seeing to that, it's going the next year also &#x2013; we have been growing around 58% growth rate of data among all our operations. So, the growth has been very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Andrew Campbell from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. My question is about the balance sheet. As I recall from previous years, you guys had indicated a loose leverage guideline of around one time a net debt-to-EBITDA. I know that was never a firm rule, but do you believe that over the medium and long-term that one time leverage is still an appropriate target for the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the, well we're well ahead and we don't want to be about one time debt-to-EBITDA. I think in the recent past we've had to be a bit more, more conservative given the retail price was significant lack of visibility out there. We want to be a bit more cautious. I think that's, that we probably think that one times net debt is not what we would prepare to have today. We would like to be a little bit below that. But we are certainly at a very low leverage today, no? We would like to get closer to 0.8 or 0.75 than to where we are today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I understand. And what do you think is the most likely means by which you would potentially get there. I mean you had very strong cash generation again in the third quarter, even with the dividend payment that you had, your net debt continues to decline. So, how do you think you might get to a slightly more leverage ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The same way that we have done it all throughout the last several years, Andy. It's always been through the distribution to shareholders for the most part, no? If you look at the last three years, it's almost exclusively been distribution to shareholders that we haven't been engaged and made acquisitions. So, I think that we have been consistent in terms of maintaining a capital structure that is efficient. And in terms of ensuring that the way of maintaining that capital structure is such that provides the benefits to investors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Carlos.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Richard Dineen from HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. Actually a couple of questions, if I may. Just the first one relating to general competition in Brazil, you mentioned in the release that voice prices was stable over the period. ARPU has now been flat for three quarters. Do you think that competitive intensity is easing in this market? And second whether you think that this will be maintained going forward or is this just a temporary pause in the fighting, if you like. So, firstly on competition. Secondly, if I may, just on Mexico, you had quite diverging trends there with strong postpaid adds and a prepaid loss. And just given your focus on postpaid, I wondered if you might speak about the value of postpaid subscribers and how this might effect blended ARPU and MOU as they grow as a portion of the base? Thanks very much, indeed, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, the competition in Brazil, I think competition in Brazil it's going to, it's still there. It's going to be harder in the future. It depends a lot on I think competition and the reduction on prices. Depends a lot on the capacity that you have, the capacity that the competition have. And maybe competition doesn't have enough capacity to be more aggressive in prices. We have been investing a lot. We had very good third quarter and I hope that in the next year, we're going to still grow a lot in Brazil. We're investing in capacity, we're investing in 3G, so we are ready to compete and to be aggressive in prices in Brazil. Of course I think that prices are going to be down and competition is still there. We are four big competitors in Brazil and everybody is trying to do the best there. We are growing in prepaid but we're growing a lot on postpaid. So that's something that the strategy on Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is focusing a lot also in postpaid. And in Mexico, what was your question? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, it was just really about have you &#x2013; given your focus on postpaid, if you could speak about what a postpaid subscriber brings to you in terms of what is their ARPU versus a typical prepaid subscriber, maybe what their minutes of use trends, just to give us a sense of how this might affect the overall MOU and ARPU at a blended level as the postpaid subscribers become a greater proportion of the base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you can see, the strategy in Mexico has been good. We have been growing the service revenue, ARPUs has been stable, we are growing on data. So focusing on postpaid has been good. We are not &#x2013; for getting prepaid, what is happening in prepaid in Mexico is that exchange rate moves around 30% year-on-year and handsets, we've had handsets increase prices. And when handsets increased prices and you have a economy like this, then you have immediately the reduction on net adds in prepaid, but we're still, we are not forgetting prepaid, we're really interested in that segment of the market. And I think us the economy gets in better shape, I think growth in voice is going to be higher and growth in the segment in prepaid is going to come again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But maybe just, thanks very much, just maybe, just a quick one. Would it be right to be thinking about a postpaid customer being in terms of ARPU, being something like four or five times that of a prepaid customer, is that broadly correct or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think postpaid is going to be maybe five times higher than the prepaid, but other more important thing is with the postpaid the subscriber today, you can add a lot of value added services. So in the future, I think could be a little bit more than 5% five times sorry.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question was again about prepaid, postpaid. So you're growing your postpaid quite a bit. Do you think most of these adds in the postpaid are coming from your prepaid high-end prepaid customer that you're converting into postpaid or are you grabbing more market, are you grabbing subscribers from your competitors or just getting from the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think part of that is from our own base and maybe, I don't know exactly, but maybe 20 to 30% would be our own base and rest would be new subscribers in the market; it's more or less what we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as you converge your high end prepaid and postpaid, in some of the other markets you seen 10 to 15% increase in ARPUs. Are you experiencing something similar, more or less?</p>

Given that we are coming towards the end of the year, share buybacks may not be, you may not be able to buyback enough shares to keep leverage close to one, should, is it reasonable to expect a one-time extraordinary dividend?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone and thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on an impressive result, especially on TracFone on both the subscriber loading and margin. Do you expect AT&amp;T's commitments to the FCC per the Centennial acquisition could adjust Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil's strategic options with respect to TracFone? For instance will you be able to renew your commercial wholesale agreements with AT&amp;T Mobility when it expire and maybe more importantly, does a loosening of the board representation from AT&amp;T at Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil and the consulting and collaboration between the companies allow AMX, if it were economic, to migrate TracFone to more of an owned and operated network platform, again, should an opportunity arise to further expand Trac's penetration and long-term profit potential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, there's a lot of questions. But well, first, we already have a commercial agreement with AT&amp;T. We don't have the commercial agreement with AT&amp;T with the Straight Talk business but we have the commercial agreement with AT&amp;T with other businesses, with the SafeLink and with TracFone and with NET10. So AT&amp;T is a very good carrier for us. We don't want to own a network in the U.S., we're happy being an MVNO. We have been very successful and we want to maintain like this in the future. And on the AT&amp;T, I think the DLJ is asking for something to AT&amp;T to maintain in the Board. We made some changes in our Board representatives. I don't have the details at this moment, but we made some changes and AT&amp;T is going to stay in the Board of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it doesn't, just to follow-up Daniel, and thank you for that, but it doesn't affect your ability to renew the wholesale agreement? And as I recall it was about half of Trac's minutes that were on AT&amp;T. I think more importantly though, to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no it doesn't affect anything. Our business with AT&amp;T and TracFone doesn't affect anything right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So longer term, where do you think TracFone can emerge, I mean vis-&#xE0;-vis the 12.7 million subs that you have now on the network wholesale agreement, really how much further do you think you can expand or scale this business in America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are just launching that we have some testing in Wal-Mart. I think the test was very successful with our new product, the Straight Talk, and I hope that we just launched last week in all, in all the U.S. So I think this product is going to be very successful. So I don't know exactly what are the numbers, but we're feeling that the Straight Talk is going to be very successful in the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. We've recently seen Telef&#xF3;nica set some quite aggressive dividend commitments recently. And do you feel perhaps that their need to maximize Latin American cash flows to support those dividends might present you with an opportunity to take some share over the coming years or is your strategy completely independent of this? And my second question is just if we see new 3G operators emerging in Mexico or Brazil over the next 12 months, could you just talk us through how, if it all, that might change your strategy and your approach in those markets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have a different strategy. We &#x2013; what we're doing, I don't know exactly what Telef&#xF3;nica is doing, Telef&#xF3;nica is doing, giving a very good dividend. What we are preparing is to invest in the business, is invest long-term. And when we have the rest of the, what Carlos has been telling is that the commitments that we have like last year and two years before, then we are going to return to the shareholders. But today, the main focus today is to invest in subscribers, invest in data, invest in networks, invest in distribution, and that's what we're doing today. So that's the main focus and the strategy on Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're right, I mean we have been gaining market share because the various competitors have nothing investing in the business aggressively over the last year, couple of years. So if you look at most markets, I think, that we've been gaining market share.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, thanks so much for the question. Two questions. Firstly, in Mexico, the decline in net adds and how much is that to do with market competition, are you seeing market competition increase in Mexico? And secondly, on the depreciation expense, how much of that is explained by the foreign currency movements, for example, in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Mexico, we have a lot of competition. It's not only Telef&#xF3;nica, it's Iusacell, it's Nextel so we have a lot of competition in Mexico. And I don't know, I haven't seen the results of my competitors, but what we are doing today in Mexico and the focusing on postpaid has giving us very good results. And as I told you before, why we are reducing on the postpaid is because the price of the handsets gets maybe 30% higher and with the economy like this people is &#x2013; they're waiting a little bit to buy or change their handset or to buy a new handsets, or. But I think that going to recover in the future. So we're still having very good distribution networks, we're taking care about that. So when the economy in Mexico gets better, I think, we're going to recover our subscriber base in prepaid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the depreciation and the growth in prepaid, in Brazil, if you look at the third quarter numbers, you will see that the operating profits are effectively doubled from the second quarter to third quarter. And that's from a year ago. And basically the &#x2013; what is causing that is that last year, we were under a process of depreciating in an accelerated fashion the TDMA investment as I mentioned earlier today. So that means that since all of it has made impairments stopped being &#x2013; were fully depreciated by the end of last year. We were not depreciating them anymore and you will see a very significant increase in our operating profits because of that. The depreciation charges in Brazil, as I mentioned before, more than anything linked to the market value of the assets. We intend to keep our books more broadly linked with the actual market value. And it is less affected really by exchange rate movements. And in fact today you don't see very significant movements.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Daniel and Carlos. I was wondering if you could give us your view regarding the fiscal modifications that are being currently discussed in Congress regarding tax loss carry forwards and tax deferrals? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in Congress they are discussing a lot. They are discussing the tax that is 3% more on telecommunications. We feel that it's very badly because that's a, telecommunications is one of the things that drives growth in the economy. So, I don't think it's a very good idea to put 3% tax on telecommunication plus 15 or 16 today that they are discussing. So, it's 19% tax on telecommunications. It's too high what we have. In the consolidation, I don't think there is a main issues for us, but Carlos can talk a little bit....</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Couple of questions, one on the, still on TracFone. Net add there is still substantial, but if I understand correctly Straight Talk was launched in later part of the second quarter and still so the third quarter was the first with full, the first two quarter with Straight Talk. So just wanted and still net adds were the same in the third quarter as in the second. Just wondering if there hasn't yet enough time to see a pickup in net adds or ARPU or MOU?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think Straight Talk; we launched Straight Talk. We launched a test in 200 or 300 stores in the Wal-Mart only as a test and the test is very different to launch a product. We just launched the product last week and it's too soon to see how things are going with the product, but we are really optimistic that we're going to have good sales for this quarter on the Straight Talk plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. Thanks Daniel. The second question is regarding the Caribbean. Any specific reason, maybe the effects why the EBITDA margin fell from the second quarter to the third quarter and still net adds are lower in the third quarter than in the second?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there are three main things. First thing is we have a big growth on postpaid in Dominican Republic. That's one issue that we have. Second in Puerto Rico, we have new tax, a tax for the properties that cost us a lot of money. I think it's mainly cost us like $15 million. It's a new tax for all the country in Puerto Rico. And the third one is that we are growing our greenfield operation, that is Jamaica. It's starting to grow better and we're doing much better in Jamaica that we have been doing. So, the growth in Jamaica has been costing us a little bit, but that's the main reason that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understand. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another, another important it's in Dominican Republic, we launch a satellite TV and also it's like handsets now, when you acquire a subscriber it costs you a little bit but that's mainly the reason we are having our costs under control and we're growing so we are doing okay in Caribbean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is only one other thing in Puerto Rico. There's a new tax that appears within the operating EDITDA effect on the operation, so it appears in EBITDA and it's nothing significant. And you we also have to consider in the Caribbean we have Jamaica, and Jamaica is now growing positive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, thank you for taking my call. My question is in regards to the actual data revenues in the quarter, if you could give us the number for the revenues from the revenues from the data and value added services and if you can give us a break down on the actual number of WCDMA, HSDPA 3G connections and what percentage were data card connections and what percentage were people connecting from iPhones or from any type of mobile handset?</p>

          <p>We haven't been disclosed that number, we &#x2013; and but what I can tell you is that the median growth rate of data plans was around 58% among all our operations. All that additional revenues from broadband and other 3G applications is what we're growing so 58% is the median that rate growth that we are growing in all the operations. It has value-added services. It has broadband PCMC cards and netbooks. It has plans in over the voice plans that we have and all the services, download, music and all of those things that it's still growing a lot.</p>

Any idea as to have you guys would prefer to utilize that, and I know you've kind of addressed some of the share buyback questions you've gotten and you know, some questions about potential special dividend, but in terms of the investment in the network, I'd just like to understand how this $750 million could be used?</p>

          <p>Well, that has been a long story, no. They haven't &#x2013; they haven't issued their rules still today, so I don't have anything to tell right now. So there's a lot of rumors in the press, in the market, but the rules they haven't been out today. So in Mexico, so until we have the rules, I prefer not to make any comment. And In Brazil, well in Brazil we last year, we invest a lot on frequency in the spectrum and I think we have enough spectrum in Brazil now.</p>

So, what I &#x2013; I'm going to insist that we have and we are ahead of all of our competitors in 3G in coverage, in capacity, and maybe in quality. So, I think we are doing good in all over all Latin America in 3G.</p>

          <p>My congratulations. My last question if you look at Mexico, and you look at Brazil and you've been through this economic downturn, how do you see the economic outlook for Mexico and Brazil from next six months versus the last six?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Brazil, it's bottomed earlier. I think probably the first quarter was the bottom for Brazil; stabilize in second quarter. You are seeing already a good momentum picking up in the third quarter. So, I think that Brazil is likely going to continue to do well economically over the next several months. Again I have, I think they have everything going for them. There is good growth expected. And in the case of Mexico, I think that we may have bottom in the second quarter. We are basically stabilizing the economy in the third quarter, but it seems like and then we may begin to grow into the fourth quarter, that's I think the base expectation. We are lagging Brazil and already whether the economy indeed picked up speed or not is going to be very much a function of what happens to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Rick Prentiss from Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, one question really on the, this significant increase that you guys are seeing in your postpaid and your data sales. Can you talk to us a little bit about what you need to do with your distribution channels, specifically do you need to add different channels for postpaid, how many different channels? And with data, what are you going to do with the distribution and how is that affecting maybe your margins in the short term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on postpaid of course you have different distribution channels. They are more specialized. You have to train them more to sell postpaid and you have to train them more to sell data. And it's a little bit more difficult because then you have to have, these guys has to have some credit. So it's not like prepaid where you go and pick a handset, you pay it and then you start talking, okay. So it's a little bit more a specialized sale. The other question is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How that's affecting your margins maybe in the short term as you establish these new distribution channels and I assume pay some probably slightly different commission structures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course the postpaid cost you more on, the acquisition cost is higher on commission, on handset, on everything, but the return is very good on postpaid. So, I think it's a very good business to invest in the postpaid segment. Do you know if there is another question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Andre Baggio from J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I would like to get a little bit more details on the negative additions in the postpaid, sorry, in the prepaid segments in Mexico. Was it really only related to the price of the handsets because in a sense we had a similar pricing in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's mainly 30% increase on the price of the handset, it's a lot and in this type of economy where things are not so good so people, it's, remember that we have churns also. Still we are selling a lot, but people is not buying as they usually do it. So that's really the reason. We still have our distribution channels very good, our distributors chain, the retail stores. So everybody is carrying our products, so it's mainly that. And I think and I'm sure that when things get better in the economy, I think, we're going to start to have again growth on prepaid.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andre, you're looking at it from Brazil, so you probably &#x2013; in Brazil it goes from the value goes from 160 to 250 and it came back to 170. So it's really more or less but it was last year. So in the case of the Mexican peso, it went from 10 to 13 pesos and 10 to 13 pesos and that's where it has stayed, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now from 10 to 15 and then returned to 13, so it has 30% year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And effectively about the valuation of currency in Mexico in real terms is about 25% in a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question, I did some calculations and I reached that in constant currency, so excluding the FX, growth was around 7% this year versus one year ago and some 8% in the second quarter. Is this number reasonable what you have more or less in terms of constant currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is reasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Andreas Cuello from BBVA</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Can you give us any light on how the legal case against Axtel regarding the 50% interconnection regarding Mexico is going? What will be the consequence if the court is confirmed by the judiciary authorities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're in an injunction with Axtel. We need to finalize the injunction. But the only thing is that they are paying us less. So if they win the case, then there's nothing else for Telcel for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. But if they lose the case then they have to pay us everything that they don't pay through this year. So that's mainly what we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is no risk for Telcel in this case because we're giving, putting everything on the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the point also, is that we are indeed booking the revenues at the lower base. We are getting paid today. So we don't have any contingency. Only positives are prices to the extent that we win, but that is not what's being done by Axtel. They are not, they do have to continues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but if they do win, do you think other operators could also cut the interconnection rate using most favorite nation plus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know, we don't know. So we need to understand the way they are going to win and why they are going to win, if they win, no? So, it's been, the interconnection rate has been a problem because we have some interconnection rate, then the corporate delegation are the ones to Iusacell and Telef&#xF3;nica with others so. I think what we should expect is that comfortable puts in all their interconnection rates for the future. And what you're asking is if everybody can ask for a most favorite, I think, they cannot do it for the past. If they could do it, then maybe it's going to be for the future, but not for the past because with the past we have contracts with all of the other, with all of the other competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I see. So, it's only an issue that could affect the future and not the past, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course. Of course</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Fernando Ramos from GBM Global.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Carlos and Daniel. Thank you for taking my question. It appears that voice tariffs have continued to post year-over-year declines and I wonder if you could give us a sense of what the trend will be going forward particularly in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil? And my second question is whether you'd be interested in acquiring some fiber optic backbone in the coming auctions of the electric company in Mexico? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, prices are going to go down. We &#x2013; let's talk a little bit about Mexico. Mexico has five-tenths of a dollar on price. So it's very competitive. I don't think any country on the OECD has those prices. Well, U.S. had some, has better prices in postpaid, but in prepaid I think we are one of the lowest countries &#x2013; the lowest prices countries on the OECD. So, we have very competitive prices. I think we're going to still be competitive because there's a lot of competition. But we're in a &#x2013; the price of five-tenths of a dollar is really competitive. What was your other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just a follow-up on that one. What trend do you see going forward in local voice, in local currencies? And my second question is whether you'd be interested in acquiring fiber optic backbone from the coming auctions of the electric of the CFE in Mexico? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again on rate, we're comfortable that the rates are really competitive and I don't think that for anybody it's going to be easy to compete against us because prices. It's easy to compete when prices are higher and quality is bad, but it's not the case in Mexico, in Mexico prices are really low and quality is good. If you compare with other countries, and another important issue that we have a lot of capacity. So, we can still reduce the prices as much as the competitive environment can make us do it, no. So, we are lets say in very good shape in Mexico and I don't think we need right now because the links that they are on auction as the government I don't think we need it because we already have some links in the same routes. So I don't think we have it, but, we're going to get deeply to see if there is some special places where we can need some of those links and of course we can if there is a case, we're going to get it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our last question for today comes from Andre Rezende from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's actually Stephen Graham from Goldman, thanks. Can you comment just a little bit on the operations in Chile, where the growth was almost flat for the year and the margins were low also? What's going on in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't hear you very well, can you repeat that question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I wanted to ask you if you could comment on the operations in Chile, just because both growth and margins were unusually low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think this quarter growth was not so bad in Chile. We are growing a lot more on postpaid, we are growing in prepaid. So Chile has been growing and I think for we doubled the net adds this quarter. So Chile we need to grow. We have a very small market there, so we still are looking for more growth, for more revenues. So that's mainly the focus on Chile, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at Stephen what we call the core EBITDA particularly for service revenue basically the EBITDA before taken into accounts of core acquisition costs, it picked up nearly three percentage points from the third quarter of last year to third quarter of this year. So basically the full change in EBITDA margin is explained by various which is called the acquisition costs that has to do with the fact that we doubled net additions, more than doubled net additions in third quarter of '09 vis-&#xE0;-vis the year before.</p>
