        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stacey, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Gilead's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the quarter. This press release is available on our website at www.gilead.com, as are the slides that provide much more detail around the topics discussed today on this call.</p>
          <p>Similar to the format we introduced on our last earnings call, our prepared comments will be brief to allow more time for your questions. Our speakers today will be John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide some comments on the quarter and our view about future &#x2013; and opportunities for the company. Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of R&amp;D and Chief Scientific Officer; Robin Washington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Young, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, are here as well for the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>I would first like to remind you that we will be making statements relating to future events, expectations, trends, objectives, and financial results that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. I refer you to our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases for a detailed description of risk factors and other matters related to our business. In addition, please note that we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>We will be making certain references to financial measures that are on a non-GAAP basis. We provide a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in the press release we just issued and on our corporate website at www.gilead.com.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John Milligan.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Susan.</p>
          <p>Gilead posted strong third quarter 2010 results, with non-GAAP net income of almost $760 million, or $0.90 per share, representing a year-over-year increase in net income and EPS of 4% and 15% respectively. Sales growth was strong, with total revenues of just over $1.94 billion, up 8% year over year. Antiviral product sales were a record $1.65 billion, up 12% year over year. The U.S. contributed $923 million to our antiviral product sales, increasing 15% year over year, resulting from the continued strong growth in patients and market share in the U.S. and up 4% sequentially, despite the added impact of rebates to ADAP and PHS as mandated by healthcare reform. There are now over 600,000 HIV-infected patients in the U.S. taking antiretroviral therapy, and we believe we are starting to see the impact of DHHS guidelines endorsing earlier treatment.</p>
          <p>Europe contributed $614 million to our antiviral product sales, increasing 5% year over year and 2% sequentially. While we saw demand growth for our products across Europe, including clinical trial purchases totaling $10 million, this was partially offset by the full quarter impact of mandated price reductions and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as we described on our second quarter call.</p>
          <p>The products in our cardiovascular franchise, namely Letairis and Ranexa, delivered strong year-over-year growth of 26 and 23% respectively, but were relatively flat sequentially. Both products saw demand growth that was pared back by small adjustments in wholesale inventories, as well as changes to average selling price due to selective discounts into managed care.</p>
          <p>Our newest product, Cayston, achieved nearly $15 million in its second full quarter of sales in both the U.S. and some countries of Europe. In June, we presented data from our head-to-head study of Cayston versus TOBI, showing statistical superiority over TOBI at Day 28, and we are presenting six-month data from this study at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference taking place in Baltimore later this week. We continue to receive positive responses from the CF community as to the importance of having an additional treatment option and a novel antibiotic to address the growing incidence of tobramycin resistance and intolerance.</p>
          <p>We continue to be vigilant on expense management, resulting in a very healthy non-GAAP operating margin of nearly 55%. And we generated $740 million in operating cash flow for the quarter.</p>
          <p>And we've also been aggressive in our $5 billion share repurchase program, having repurchased and retired $1.55 billion worth of stock, or more than 45 million shares during the third quarter alone. Our total share repurchase activity over the course of this year has reduced our total shares outstanding by approximately 10%. Given our current valuation, we view share repurchase as the preferred vehicle for returning value to shareholders. We will continue to be opportunistic and leverage our cash balance over the coming year to complete our authorized program, in addition to advancing our pipeline programs and considering strategic options through partnerships, licensing, and M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The last financial highlight that will I speak to is our 2010 guidance, which is detailed in slide 38 in the earnings call deck. The only adjustment we're making to our full-year guidance is to R&amp;D. We are lowering our R&amp;D guidance for the full year to a range of 830 million to $840 million, from a range of 850 million to $870 million. This reduction in R&amp;D spend is driven by the timing of clinical trial expenditures. All other guidance parameters remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>As previously disclosed, on September 24, Gilead received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration related to an inspection of our San Dimas, California, facility. We have responded to the warning letter within the mandated 15-day period. As a reminder, back in January and February of this year, the FDA inspected our facility and issued a 483 letter citing a series of observations due to concerns about our manufacturing and quality-related procedures. Subsequently, we learned we were likely to receive a warning letter based on the inadequacy of our response to the 483's. We disclosed this in our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2010. We have been and will continue to work diligently to address the FDA's concerns. Gilead continues to manufacture AmBisome, Cayston, and Macugen and package and distribute products from the San Dimas facility.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the key milestones during the quarter. At the International AIDS Conference in July, Dr. Cal Cohen presented 48-week results from the two pivotal TMC278 studies during the late-breaker session. The data demonstrated TMC278 was non-inferior to and better tolerated than efavirenz, leading to fewer discontinuations due to adverse events. There were fewer Grade 2 to 4 adverse events, and the difference was statistically different with regard to some psychiatric and neurological events, and rash. There were more virological failures in the TMC278 arms compared to efavirenz, and further analyses of the data presented at ICAAC in September suggested that suboptimal adherence and/or higher viral load were the primarily predictors of neurological failures with TMC278. Due to the blinded placebo control design of the study, patients in this trial had to take multiple pills, multiple times a day, which may have led to suboptimal adherence, resulting in virological failure.</p>
          <p>As is recognized by the major treatment guidelines, single-tablet, fixed-dose regimens lead to better compliance. Therefore, Gilead plans to conduct a head-to-head open label study of the fixed-dose combination of Truvada and TMC278 versus Atripla, as well as a study in which we will switch patients from a protease inhibitor containing regimen to our single-tablet regimen of Truvada and TMC278. We'll provide more details as we get closer to initiation of these studies.</p>
          <p>With regard to regulatory process, Tibotec filed for the single-agent TMC278 in the U.S. in July, and followed with a filing in the European Union on September 3. We also filed our EU Marketing Application for the single-tablet regimen of TMC278 and Truvada on September 3. We expect a standard review in Europe, which would allow for approval in the fourth quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>Gilead plans to file for the single-tablet regimen here in the U.S. in November, which would be expected to lead to an approval timeframe in the second quarter of 2011. We're very pleased with the progress of this program. The introduction of this product will give patients and physicians an important new choice for a one-pill, once-daily regimen.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to John Martin to discuss our pipeline and other upcoming milestones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. I am pleased with our performance and productivity in the third quarter of this year. Ultimately, our success over the long term is dependent upon continued innovation and pipeline advancement, where we have made significant strides this year. Management recently completed a thorough review of our R&amp;D portfolio, and we are enthusiastic about the number and quality of programs under way across our therapeutic areas.</p>
          <p>For our HIV pipeline, the Quad and cobicistat programs continue to progress rapidly. As you know, last month at the ICAAC conference this Boston, 48-week data from the two Phase II studies were presented, confirming the positive results seen at 24 weeks. Enrollment was completed in the pivotal Phase III Quad studies, 102 and 103, in only four and a half months after study initiation. Study 102 is a head-to-head study of the Quad versus Atripla. And Study 103 is a head-to-head study of the Quad versus boosted atazanavir plus Truvada, both comparative arms being guideline recommended first-line regimens. Each Phase III study enrolled over 700 patients, putting this development program on track for availability of 48-week data in the third and fourth quarters of next year. The speed in which these studies were enrolled speaks to the excitement surrounding this integrase-based, single-tablet regimen.</p>
          <p>The third Phase III study, Study 114, evaluating cobicistat versus ritonavir, is also making rapid progress, and screening is now completed. And the study will be fully enrolled before year-end. This study, along with the other studies which use cobicistat, will support the filings for cobicistat as a standalone agent.</p>
          <p>Turning to the ongoing research evaluating the potential for tenofovir and Truvada to be used as a prevention in HIV, a topical gel, tenofovir, for use as a vaginal microbicide to prevent HIV infection in women has been under evaluation by a South African based group called CAPRISA. This trial was jointly funded by the governments of South Africa and the United States. At the IAS conference in July, the first data from this study were presented. Results demonstrated that the use of tenofovir gel led to an overall 39% reduction in risk of contracting HIV among participants. And women who used the gel most consistently experienced a 54% risk reduction. This presentation received a standing ovation at the conference, as this is the first study to provide evidence of effectiveness of a topical microbicide for the prevention of HIV infection.</p>
          <p>A number of oral prevention studies are also ongoing. Data are expected shortly for from the iPrEX study, which is a placebo-controlled double-blind trial conducted in North and South America and Southeast Asia of the daily use of Truvada in nearly 2,500 men who have sex with men. This study is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. If the results are positive, Gilead will work with the appropriate regulatory agencies to determine whether the data would warrant inclusion in the prescribing information.</p>
          <p>And finally for our ongoing HCV research. During the past quarter, we revealed that our HCV pipeline has grown to seven candidate compounds with six different mechanisms of action. Five of these are currently in human clinical studies, and two are nearing Phase I initiation. At AASLD in Boston next week, clinical data on four of these programs will be presented. One presentation is a late-breaker of data from the three-arm Phase IIa study evaluating GS-9190, a polymerase inhibitor, in combination with GS-9256, a protease inhibitor, when used as dual antiviral therapy alone, or as a three-drug regimen in combination with ribavirin or as a four-drug regimen including ribavirin and peg-interferon. As reported in the published abstract, a substantial portion of patients receiving the four-drug regimen achieved rapid and complete viral suppression after 14 days of therapy, supporting further clinical evaluation.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I am pleased to report that patient screening began just last week for a Phase IIb study utilizing this regimen to determine if the duration of therapy can be shortened from 24 weeks to 16 weeks. Shortening of therapy is an intermediate step in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, as expect that an all-oral antiviral regimen from three or more classes will ultimately become the standard of care. While there is considerable competition in this space, we believe that we have an expanding multi-class antiviral HCV pipeline, along with a talented research and development group in place to deliver on our ambition.</p>
          <p>In summary, over the course of 2010, many of Gilead's core pipeline programs have advanced on schedule, and in some cases have exceeded our own aggressive timelines. We delivered strong commercial and financial performance in the third quarter, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress as we conclude this year and embark on 2011.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A portion of the call. Operator?</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question for you on slide 17, the CD4 counts. So do you guys have a sense in this data what the segmentation is of patients for counts greater than 500? And the follow-up to this is maybe a bigger-picture question. After the guideline changes and the CDC recommendations a few years ago, what would you guys say today is the tipping point for converting the patients in care to those on ART?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Geoff, it's Kevin. Yeah, we do have that underlying data. We thought it was a lot cleaner to put the two together. There was a small movement of the patients above 500. The majority of that growth that you're seeing, up to 42%, is coming from the 350 to 500. We felt it was important to give you that slide on this quarter, as I had referred to this slide on the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the tipping point, I actually think we're in the tipping point. If we look at the Synovate data for the second quarter, to go over 600,000 patients on antiretroviral therapy was a big landmark for us. 219,000 patients now on Atripla, 226,000 on Truvada, so we have two products now well above 200,000 patients. Other markers of earlier treatments include &#x2013; you know, we are seeing increases in the actual number of starting patients on antiretroviral, and we're seeing a shortening of the average time between diagnosis and starting antiretroviral treatment. So it does seem as though all of the key drivers are now operating kind of in parallel and all in the same direction. So what we sensed was happening earlier this year is really starting to come through in the numbers. And I'm quite pleasantly surprised that we're seeing this as early as we are, but I think it shows the commitment of the HIV community to really adopt these guidelines. So I think we're into the tipping point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, I was wondering &#x2013; follow-up on Geoff's question. Could you maybe talk about &#x2013; I just didn't hear you say it, and maybe I just didn't hear it, but the &#x2013; if the new treatment guidelines are having any material impact in Europe yet? Are they having an impact in Europe? If not, why not? And then the follow-up &#x2013; well, it's actually a second question, so you don't have to answer it, but I was wondering if you could comment on this issue around does FTC equal 3TC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me deal one at a time here, Mark. I was commenting, to the first question on the U.S., not quite as strong an indicator yet in Europe around guidelines. The EACS guidelines changed in November, not quite as strongly as DHHS, and not as strongly as IAS. So we haven't seen as strong a situation as we have here in the U.S. And that's not unusual, because Europe is normally a little bit slower following the U.S.</p>
          <p>I do want to highlight one particular guideline change that's happened fairly recently, and that's France. France is a very important market, as you know. It's our number one market outside the U.S. Very progressive from the point of view of HIV, and the French guidelines, so-called Yeni guidelines, have moved up the start of antiretroviral treatment to 500. So that's a very, very key change in guidelines. So, again, I would hope to see that starting to come through.</p>
          <p>In terms of your question &#x2013; very quickly &#x2013; on FTC versus 3TC, here in the U.S., we have still not seen the launch of any generic 3TC, and we are preferring in guidelines here, so I think we have a very, very strong position. So &#x2013; as would be seen from the growth in Atripla, and the growth in Truvada. I think our single-tablet regimens and fixed-does combinations have a very, very strong position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do your customers view them as the same? And then I'll stop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we've been at our advisory boards of late, our HIV specialists are recognizing the difference between FTC and 3TC, and we have medical education slide sets and descriptions that are used by our medical scientists, which clearly differentiates the products based on resistance profile, based on the pharmacokinetics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just add something, I mean, I want to emphatically say that FTC is not equal to 3TC. And as Kevin said, that's recognized by the people who are in the know. It has a longer pharmacokinetic half-life. It is more of a q.d. drug than 3TC. It is more potent on monotherapy. And there's some clinical data emerging that would indicate that there's less resistance development when you're on a FTC-containing regimen compared to a 3TC. And then lastly, as Kevin very correctly pointed out, FTC is the only compound that's in a preferred regimen, co-formulated either with Viread and Truvada or with Viread and efavirenz and Atripla.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Just two quick questions. One is just on the non-retail purchasing during the quarter, if there's any comments there? And then just when we think towards 2011, just a comment here about $50 million worth of pharmaceutical excise tax expected in 2011, I'm just wondering when we look at that, thinking about your HCV pipeline, is it fair to assume, just directionally, an operating margin decline next year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rachel, this is Kevin. The first question, non-retailed U.S. was really, really solid. I was very pleased to see the results. We had excellent purchase from Texas. As you remember, Texas was a little bit cooler in Q2, because they're always waiting for the start of their new budgets, both color and supplemental. But we had very good purchase from Texas. Very good purchase from Florida. That was unaltered, and has had no impact to the wait lists in Florida, so it was absolutely rock solid. And as you know, typically Q3, Q4, and Q1 are the stronger of the quarters from the point of view of the financial year of ADAP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rachel, this is Robin. I'll take the second part of your question. If you noticed, on slide 35, we kind of highlight that we expect the excise tax in 2011 to not be greater than 50 million, and it could be less. We're still working and trying to understand the calculation as is the rest of the industry. Clearly, to the extent it impacts SG&amp;A, it will have some impact on our overall operating margin, but I think overall that's yet to be determined. And we won't be providing 2011 guidance until January.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much, and a nice quarter. If you don't mind, I just have a quick question for Robin, kind of as a follow-up, and then just have a follow-up to the follow-up. So in this quarter, how much was the top line impacted because of healthcare reform? I remember in Q1 it was around 29 million, and it was slightly more than that in Q2. If you can give us a sense of this quarter.</p>
          <p>And then there was just a question for Kevin. Help us understand a little bit &#x2013; it sounds like this quarter there was again growth resuming, both in the U.S. and OUS, in HIV. And after kind of the previous two quarters where it was much more sluggish, is it all because of the guidelines? Because if you look at the slide on guideline changes, you actually saw an uptick in patients starting at the 500 level, even in Q1. Some I'm just trying to get a little bit of understanding, what's different about this quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Yaron, it's Robin. Yes, we did provide the initial impact of healthcare reform in Q1, but we also highlighted that we would not break it out just because it's difficult to do going forward. But we stand by the guidance that we provided of around 200 million for the full year. We are staying on track relative to that guidance. I will say that in Q3 as well as in Q4, we did see a higher ramp of healthcare reform costs, driven primarily by the fact that the discounts in the PHS and ADAP sector of our payer population increased in Q3. So the second half, as we've highlighted before, we see a higher ramp, and we'd expect to see that flatten in Q4.</p>

          <p>Yaron, in terms of your question, just as much as we don't get doom and gloom when we have kind of a flat quarter with Synovate, we probably shouldn't go the other way to get the trumpets out when there is a very good quarter. I think we always look at Synovate as the trend, as the direction. It certainly is nice to see that we've got over 600,000 patients now on antiretroviral therapy.</p>
          <p>I think what we're seeing is the coming together of all of the key parameters in HIV. We have got diagnosis and screening going on. We have got earlier treatment. We have got HIV still in the news, and still is a major healthcare challenge. So whether it's the U.S. and more testing going on and the $25 million emergency fund that went out there to help ADAPs, or whether it's guideline changes in France, or diagnosis initiatives in the UK, I still think there's tremendous momentum behind this market. And the need to diagnose and the need to treat is compelling.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Couple of quick questions. One's a clarification, really, which is the healthcare reform projections for 2011. If the 2010 impact is primarily back-end loaded, how do you wind up with the same magnitude on a percentage basis in 2011? I would have thought that it would have actually gone up as a percent in 2011. And then a quick question on the prep studies on the tenofovir gel and oral formulation, do you see that as a viable commercial opportunity? And if so, what kind of parameters can you put around that? Thanks very much</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Josh, relative to healthcare reform, I think we talked about it being 4 to 5 or 5 to 6 for 2011, and then that 5 to 6 being the same percentage going forward, probably leaning more to the top end, okay? And begin, because it's top-end loaded, it starts to get built into our run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Josh, with regard to the prevention studies that are going, both with the gel and with Viread and Truvada, we do believe that we will have an important conversation with regulatory bodies to try to determine how the information should be included in the prescribing information around the world. Because there is an obligation to provide that information to physicians, so they can provide better guidance to their patients. But with regard to a commercial opportunity, we do not see this as a significant commercial opportunity at this point.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Ian, this is Susan. I'll just clarify. Ian, you were asking whether or not you believe we've all of the assets we need to leapfrog in the HCV space. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. That's right</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Ian, I want to state again what our strategy is. As you know, in the way the field has evolved in HIV, that really, every drug, all 32 of them that are approved right now, have been developed as a stand-alone agent, either in addition to an existing regimen or a substitution for another agent in the regimen. We think HCV &#x2013; and by the way, that has taken 30 years or so for that to happen.</p>
          <p>I think HCV will be much accelerated. We have learned a lot from HIV, and I think that's why we are working not on single agents, but we are working on a combination &#x2013; oral, antiviral combination &#x2013; that leads to cure of hep C. And if you look at the distribution of patients infected, patients diagnosed, and patients on treatment, it turns out that only 5% of those that are infected are actually on treatment, and that's in large part a reflection of the treatment modality that we have now. And in order to substantially change that and really be able to access the large number of hepatitis C infected patients that are out there, you need to get rid of Peg/riba. And that's our goal.</p>
          <p>And so we think if we have &#x2013; maybe it's three drugs, maybe it's four drugs, we will find out that out sometime during the next year. And also which three drugs or which four drugs. Then we will do a combination study with those three or four, show that it leads in certain genotypes to a cure of the hep C infection, and that's the modality we will get approved by regulatory authorities. And I think that will leapfrog the field, and it will greatly change how people view the disease. It will greatly lead to increased diagnosis, and those that are diagnosed to increase treatment. That's our philosophy. And we think we have all the assets in place right now internally, both in terms of programs and people, to execute on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. Just a question on the cash performance. Impressive share repurchase activity since May. And clearly, you could go through this &#x2013; the authorization much faster than you originally anticipated. I think it was three years. So Robin, just thinking ahead to where you might be another five months from now, is it your expectation, first, that if the stock stays in its current range that you would deploy the cash at the same pace or a different pace? And secondly, would you be willing to lever up further to get more cash to continue with that program at that pace? And then lastly, you've talked in the past about dividend discussions. I'm wondering if you've had any follow-up to that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Geoff. So to address the first part, if you think about the rest of the year, we plan to probably use in the range &#x2013; and again, it's based on the valuation &#x2013; of about 3 million of our share repurchase program. And then as John mentioned, and outlined in the script, we'd anticipate utilizing the rest of that authorization in 2011. Okay?</p>
          <p>So relative to cash on hand and ability to lever up, we would. We've talked about getting a rating before. As you recall, the reason why we did the initial convert offering back in July was because we didn't have a rating, so that is also something that we're planning on looking at in 2011.</p>
          <p>And relative to dividends, as we've mentioned, we pretty much view share buybacks, given our valuation, as the appropriate vehicle for returning value to our shareholders. But it's a topic that we continue to evaluate as our business matures. We do recognize that our shareholders &#x2013; while there are a lot of different opinions out there &#x2013; but they expect us to have a sound capital management strategy. And they also want longer-term visibility around our cash usage and our return value, so we will continue to ensure that our method of returning value is complementary to our strategy and our future growth profile.</p>

If we think about the Gilead profitability structure right now, do you think that you can achieve your long-term goals in terms of the pipeline, whatever you need to do to fill the patent cliff with the current type of structure on operating margins? Should we assume that you're going to try to keep the operating margins in this general range, 50 to 55%?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Thomas, it's John Milligan. As we model out for the future, I think it's fair to say, for example, this year, that we're spending less in R&amp;D than we had planned to spend, and that was a result of, of course, two things &#x2013; darusentan not going forward as we had thought, and also the issues that we encountered on the safety of GS-9450. So as I look at this year, we're not spending as much on R&amp;D as I would have liked. As I look at the year, we're going to come in around the mid &#x2013; between 10 and 11%, depending on how the year plays out, in a couple of different areas. So that's a little bit lower than we would want. And I would like to see us do longer term is return to a higher level of R&amp;D spend.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm not saying it's significantly higher, but we need to spend a little bit more. And looking at Norbert's pipeline for the future, he's going to clearly need some more money to put into some of those larger, more important, Phase III clinical studies, especially as the HCV portfolio matures. And I would expect that to happen. So 55% is about as good as you can do anywhere these days, so that's a tough one to maintain, and I would like to put a little bit more money, particularly into R&amp;D long term.</p>

          <p>Hey, thanks for taking my call, and congratulations on a good quarter. Wondering if you could comment on how, if any, there was an impact from the patient assistance programs, and the co-pay assistance programs, which I believe were expanded this quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason, it's Kevin. Yeah, we &#x2013; in conjunction with our price freeze that we agreed with ADAP, we did make some other changes, one of which was to take up our co-pay card from &#x2013; basically from zero &#x2013; it previously started at $50, it's now zero &#x2013; to $200. Just as a reminder, but that can only apply to private-pay patients. It can't apply to any of the federal payers. It has been well received. There were very, very small areas of the country where we probably have a situation where a physician favored a competitor product because of our co-pay card, perhaps being bettered by a co-pay card of another company.</p>
          <p>So that has been helpful, but I have to say that's probably been in very small spots. You know, I think the thing that's really driving this is the extra funding that came from federal, the extra funding that went out in this emergency $25 million fund, and just the desire by the physicians to be adopting the guidelines. We are having discussions through our medical scientists and our field force around the guideline changes, but the reception to that has been very positive. We haven't been pushing uphill. The physicians themselves, I think, wanted that endorsement to be starting patients earlier. So I think that's where the real momentum comes from.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So could you speak to how the co-pay assistance program might work through the P&amp;L over time, and is that going to be a growing thing? Something that we're going to see more patients take advantage of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a relatively small amount in my expenses. So it gets captured in expenses. So it's a very, very small amount of money. And for the goodwill, and doing the right thing for HIV, it's quite appropriate.</p>
          <p>I should also say, Jason, that we have seen an increase in our PAP, that's our patient assistance program, not the co-pay card, and that kind of goes hand in hand with some of the growth that we've seen in the ADAP waiting lists. Again, we feel responsible as an HIV company to do the right thing, and typically the PAP is a transitional place for HIV patients until they come off of a wait list. And so whether it be Florida or another state, we make sure people know about our PAP. They come onto our PAP, and then when wait lists hopefully eventually come down or are cleared, that allows for a very quick transition to a commercial-paying patient.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a quick &#x2013; another macro question on hep C. As a leader in hepatitis B, where it's also very under-diagnosed and under-penetrated, what, in your view, is the key difference about hep C? Is it the ability to get a cure that would move that needle? And then as a follow-up, with your six mechanisms of action, what currently do you think are the most likely that could be combined to achieve an all-oral, three-drug cure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Tom, the first question, you're exactly right. The big difference between hep C and hep B is that hep C, the treatment, the end goal of treatment, is cure. Whereas in hep B that's more what you would like to achieve, but in most cases, it's a question of viral replication. We are, by the way, with our TLR7 agonist, agonist, actually pursuing a hepatitis B cure as well. And that would, I think, greatly expand, again, the diagnosis and the treatment of patients that are infected with hep B.</p>
          <p>With regards to which mechanisms are most likely to work, Tom, I don't think there is a particular rule that we have. You simply need three potent agents that are not antagonistic, that don't have unfavorable drug interactions, that you can combine, and that have additive or synergistic activities, so that you suppress virus replication. And you have to suppress it for a certain period of time. That could be between 12 and 24 weeks, and afterwards HCV will be cured. That's our ongoing assumption.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In about six or eight months it sounds like Atripla and Btripla will be competing in the marketplace. So now that you've had more time to digest the Phase III data from TMC278, could you give us your updated thoughts on how you're going to position Atripla versus Btripla? And could you remind us how much flexibility you have in your agreements with J&amp;J and Bristol to change strategy, change the horse that you're backing following the data from the Atripla versus Btripla head-to-head study?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Phil, it's Kevin. Maybe I'll try and sort of reverse my answer to your question. First of all, we've got complete flexibility when it comes to our partnership with Bristol-Myers. That partnership today with Atripla continues to be incredibly professional, but in the first quarter of next year, we will essentially separate from BMS in terms of that joint promotion. Both companies can continue to promote Atripla. That's at their own discretion. But we'll be no longer coordinating our efforts with Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p>
          <p>Coming back to Truvada 278. Yeah, we did a lot of work, and certainly we've ramped that up since the two recent presentations of 278. The first thing I want to say is that I think some people have considered that 278, Truvada, is some form of either niche product or is somehow second line to Atripla. We don't see it that way. We see this as a really strong first-line drug for treatment-naive patients, certainly in terms of the tolerability process &#x2013; side effect profile, it's seemed to perform better than Atripla in both ECHO and THRIVE. And certainly for the 49% of treatment-na&#xEF;ve patients who start on Atripla, I think we've got an alternative.</p>
          <p>The other part of the treatment-naive pie is obviously Truvada. The majority of Truvada is with the protease inhibitors or in some cases with an integrase inhibitor, with Isentress, and that's also an opportunity for us in that naive setting. So we think the profile of Truvada 278 is very strong, and we'll be leading out with that for treatment-naive patients.</p>
          <p>The final thing I would say is I do think we have a good opportunity with the switch patients. Certainly talking to the physicians and having advisory boards, whilst there are some patients who much prefer the single-tablet regimen of Atripla, in some cases they do struggle sometimes with tolerability. I think to have a second single tablet available as an alternative will provide a good opportunity for a physician to switch a patient. So the final thing I would say is it's really a very strong position to have two single tablets, and we can certainly get to a place, having those two, presenting to the physician, that we could never get with just Atripla alone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Phil, I would like to add, and this was said before by John Milligan in the conference call earlier, that we believe that the Phase III data on 278 do not fully reflect the value of 278 fixed-dose combination. Because as mentioned, due to the blinded nature of the study, these people had to take three pills, everybody, at two different times of the day, one with food, the other one without food at bedtime, and so it may have led to less compliance than you would get if you'd simply have one pill once daily. And that's the reason why we're repeating or doing this study openly, both one pill versus one pill, 278 fixed-dose combination versus Atripla, to really show that that would lead to higher compliance rates, and less virological failures on 278.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if we can show that, then 278 will be truly a winning combination for a good substitute for Atripla.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. And if I could follow up on Kevin's comments on the protease inhibitor part of the market. In my prior conversations with HIV physicians, it sounds like they use PIs in the first line in many cases in patients where they don't think they're going to take their pills, to give them a higher barrier to resistance. If there's a question with 278's barrier to resistance, or what happens if you miss pills, how likely is it that you're going to be able to penetrate that part of the market? Kind of what's going to be your marketing message to convince somebody to go on 278 plus Truvada, instead of a PI plus Truvada?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you're right. There are some physicians who, for that reason, use a protease inhibitor. There are physicians who choose a protease because they just don't like efavirenz. I think that's &#x2013; they are physicians, they are patients, that an alternative would be very welcome.</p>
          <p>One thing I want to say is that there to be another comment regarding effect in viral load. Basically 75% of new starting patients have a viral load of less than 100,000 copies, so the majority of patients who are treated in the naive setting have a viral load below 100,000. So, again, I don't think that's an obstacle to prescribing of Truvada/278.</p>

We are doing a study where we're actually switching in a Phase III design in a controlled way, people that are suppressed on their PI-containing regimen to a 278 fixed-dose combination. I think those data are very useful, and maybe even necessary to convince a large part of the physicians that this is a viable strategy.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks a lot. I had a question about your cardiovascular franchise. So you mentioned that the &#x2013; in explanation for why there was flat sales effectively for Letairis and Ranexa inventory in the ASP chain, and so I'm wondering what the sequential demand growth was, if you can give us a feel for that? And just to help us model it going forward. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Joel, it's Kevin. Basically, I'll take Ranexa first. Depends what data source you use, but Wolters Kluwer was about a 5% sequential increase in prescriptions, and IMS was 6. So it's 5 to 6. That is lower than it was in the second quarter, where it was one of our highest growth levels of 13 for Wolters Kluwer and 10 for IMS. So it was lower than Q2 growth, but nevertheless, there was growth there.</p>
          <p>In terms of Letairis, we don't base our demand on prescriptions, it's shipments out. And shipments out, Q3 on Q2, were about 6% up. But as John said in his text, we had a slight lowering of inventories with regards to Ranexa &#x2013; that's with the major wholesalers. With regards to Letairis, that's with the specialty pharmacies. And we do do some contracting on a very selected basis with Ranexa. That's been all about access, and with Letairis, that's more reactive to some moves we see from competition.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. First question is, so according to your metrics, what percent of patients really struggle with tolerability on Atripla, according to your databases? And my second question is for Norbert. So have you given any thought to &#x2013; I know your HCV pipeline's early &#x2013; have you given any thought or seen a need to partnering your drugs with some of the earlier drugs that are going to come to market in the hep C space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Robyn, it's Kevin. I don't have a percentage off the top of my head, but I can answer that more qualitative. What we typically hear from physicians when we have our roundtables is they particularly get concerned about HIV patients who have high technical jobs, so maybe in kind of the financial world or just are dealing with complex information. And so those are the people who sometimes, because of some CNS effects, don't do as well. So if people are operating machinery, people are driving as part of their profession, that's when physicians tend to be just cautious about using an efavirenz-based regimen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robyn, to answer your question about partnering on hepatitis C, absolutely we're looking at that constantly almost. We're in a number of discussions with various organizations to look whether partnering makes sense. But I have to say, it makes sense to us, if we believe that it greatly accelerates the timelines for us to come up with the &#x2013; all-oral antiviral regimen. And in that case, of course, we would completely enter into a partnership and support that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up on just the focus on your HCV development program. What do you view as the major dis-risking event in trying to get to a three- or four-drug combo? It is efficacy? Is it safety? Have you done the pharmacodynamic modeling where you feel pretty confident if you can put three drugs together you're fine and so it's safety? Just trying to understand how you're thinking about that. And when we'll hit that sort of time point where you can take a step function in terms of your confidence that you're going to be the ones that develop a triple combo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Jim, we actually have a late-breaker presentation at the AASLD that you may have seen the abstract. And basically, this was an experiment to ask the question whether three &#x2013; two drugs, two oral antivirals &#x2013; in combination with ribavirin may actually be enough to give him a good RVR or suppression of viramian ; the answer to that was no. So we of course don't &#x2013; we're looking at viral modeling, viral kinetics, and we just need &#x2013; either it's going to be three drugs or four drugs, and we will be in a position to test that concept, hopefully sometime by the end of next year. And then we can really find out whether the concept works and whether three or four drugs are enough.</p>
          <p>But I think in the end it has to do with &#x2013; there has to be an absence of course of antagonism. Ideally we want synergy between the drugs in terms of activity. You want to have potency, which means each drug by itself should lower viral load by a few logs. All of them together should be, as I said, additive or synergistic. And when you &#x2013; and so shouldn't have significant drug interactions. But if you have all that, I think you have a chance of being able to cure HCV infection with an all-oral antiviral regimen with a limited treatment duration of between whatever it is, 12 to 24 weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just follow up on this. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if you're quite certain that you've got the three or four drugs to combine, then I understand not being aggressive in pursuing partnership or acquisition. But it just seems like it's a pretty high technical hurdle, and why not increase your odds by being more aggressive on the M&amp;A or end-licensing front? It just seems like you're making a bet on what you've got internally with limited information, and why not be more aggressive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, I completely agree with you, and all I can tell you is we are aggressive. I just am not at liberty to talk about the details of all of the discussions we're having with various organizations. But we are looking at the &#x2013; the de-risking event could be &#x2013; the only thing we're not certain about our compounds is the safety, because we simply don't have enough experience like with our protease inhibitors yet to be able to say how safe they are. So it does make sense to look at other opportunities of compounds that are further along in terms of human safety experience, and think about should we collaborate with those organizations or acquire them? And we're actually doing that. We are in discussions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Norbert, questions for you. You mentioned two HIV trials. The one is Btripla versus Atripla open-label trial, and another one is switching from PI to Btripla. Could you give us a little more detail in terms of number of patients, when will we be seeing data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so these are two large Phase III studies. And when we receive data, we're in the stage of protocol development; we still have to go through the FDA approval, IRB approval, et cetera, and then enrollment. I would say, just back of the envelope calculation, it's probably going to be sometime in the year 2012 before we have data on any of those studies.</p>
          <p>The design is very simple. The one is a randomized one-to-one Atripla versus 278 fixed-dose combination, and the other one is a controlled people on &#x2013; suppressed on the PI regimen, and they're randomized to either continue on that regimen or switch to 278 fixed-dose combination. The endpoint is at, in both studies, a 48-week proportion less than 50, with missing equals failure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then quickly of the Phase IIb HCV study, you said you're starting Phase IIb and trying to look at either 24 weeks or 16 weeks. I assume that is compared to the standard of care as a control, but just going &#x2013; looking into the future, if you do indeed move with &#x2013; into a regulatory trial, what do you think will be the control to be if the protease inhibitor is already on the market? Do you have any dialogue with the FDA about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have had conversations with various regulatory authorities, but the way this is going to evolve, in our mind, is the following. So you will show &#x2013; let's say you take a triple combination, oral antiviral agent &#x2013; combination. You show the contribution of each individual agent to the antiviral response in a short &#x2013; maybe 14- or 28-day &#x2013; viral dynamic study. Then you do the typical Phase III study, where you use as a control the standard of care that exists at that point. Once telaprevir is approved &#x2013; that, maybe that together with Peg/riba will be the standard of care &#x2013; but you will then simply compare that standard of care to the three or four all-oral antiviral regimen and show that you can get similar SVR rates, and that will lead to approval of the regimen, whether that's three drugs or four drugs. And of course there's the realization by regulatory authorities, by physicians, and most importantly by patients that if you get rid of pegylated interferon/ribavirin, it will have a greatly better tolerated, more convenient regimen, that I think the world would embrace.</p>
          <p>You know, the other thing I would like to mention quickly about the two Phase III studies &#x2013; I forgot to say this. In HIV, I mean, we all recognize that you can get value of the study while it's still ongoing. When the world knows that you're actually doing the study, that means that there is conviction on part of the company that this switch strategy, and the randomized versus Atripla, has value. And I think that could change the behavior of prescribers and physicians, while the study is still ongoing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jason, I'd just like to add that obviously with the Quad, one of our studies was totally done in the U.S., and for our second Quad study, 60% of the sites was in the U.S. But if you look at ECHO and THRIVE, Tibotec's studies for 278, only 30% of the sites were in the U.S. So I think the Phase IIIb/IV studies that Norbert talks about are going to be very helpful for U.S. physicians to gain more experience in Truvada/278.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you discuss the profile of GS-7340 and what hole in the market that would potentially fill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so 7340 is a pro drug that actually delivers more antivirally active components into the compartment in the body where it's really needed, which means into lymphocytes mostly. What that means is you can take a lower dose &#x2013; and actually our clinical study would indicate it's one-sixth to one-tenth the Viread dose, and you will get actually higher efficacy with less exposure. So we're actually looking at this compound, Ed, to be used in subpopulations where people have a concern with Viread. And that's in particular the one in renal impairment or in elderly people that have reduced renal function. And the other population would be those that have pre-existing, or a suspicion of bone disease, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia. So that's where we are initially going to position the compound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and Maged, I mean, as you know, probably the hottest topic in HIV is the whole issue of aging. And several of us here were in an advisory board recently, went around the table and asked the percentage of the physicians' populations over the age of 50, and most of them had 40 to 50% of their patients over the age of 50. So in terms of long-term therapy, as well as the age of the HIV patient, we want to be progressive and look at potential advantages for long-term care of these patients, and a potential alternative to telaprevir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the follow-up, guys. Really quick &#x2013; there's been some noise on Viread and XMRV, and I'm wondering if you guys have any feedback on that and chronic fatigue or prostate cancer. I know that's been in the press of late, and I know there's some publications, but wasn't sure if there were any Gilead plans to capitalize on any further data in these two implications?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Geoff, actually we're actively monitoring the situation. We actually have a meeting scheduled internally in two weeks from now to talk about this, what we should do, if anything. Needless to say &#x2013; so first of all, we have done in vitro studies in house with XMRV, and it turned out that both tenofovir and enterocyte have been &#x2013; are active and of course Truvada would be a very good inhibitor of XMRV.</p>
          <p>The challenge that we have &#x2013; and I think the whole field has &#x2013; is to have some certainty about XMRV as the causative agent of CFS. There have been in the past, various reports about viruses being involved in chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia, and they all turned out to be not true on further follow-up. You may also have seen there was a recent Science paper. I think it was in Science, where they actually disclosed that it may have to do with contamination in this particular study where they have found mouse mitochondria DNA sequences in these human samples, which would indicate that there's some mouse tissue contaminate &#x2013; that is a contamination issue and not really an XMRV issue. But we're looking at this, and we're debating what we should do, if anything.</p>
