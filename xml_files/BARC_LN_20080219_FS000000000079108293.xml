        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much for being with us. I hope you appreciate the new Art Deco mood of the room. Can I ask you please to switch off your telephones and BlackBerrys? And then let me introduce the Executive Committee Team in the usual way, Bob Diamond, Group President; Chris Lucas, Group Finance Director, and out front Frits Seegers, Chief Executive of Global Retail and Commercial Banking, and Paul Idzik, the Chief Operating Officer. We're also joined this morning by Marcus Agius, the Chairman, and Gary Hoffman, the Vice Chairman.</p>
          <p>So, what we are going to do is, Chris will kick off and then I will give you some remarks following that. And then in the usual way we'll be open for your questions. Our intention is to finish by 11 o'clock latest. You are very welcome. I hope you have a productive session with us. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John, and good morning. We delivered over &#xA3;7 billion of profit in 2007, showing the benefits of diversifying the business in recent years. Our investment banking and investment management businesses performed well, despite market turbulence in the second half.</p>
          <p>UK retail delivered pleasing profit growth. In Barclaycard very good profit growth was driven by strong international growth and improved impairments in UK cards. And international retail and commercial banking established real momentum in expanding the business. I'll give you the headline numbers before I go into more detail.</p>
          <p>Profits for the full year were over &#xA3;7 billion, 3% up on an outstanding performance in 2006, excluding business disposals. Earnings per share were 68.9 pence. This is after net losses of &#xA3;1.6 billion from sub-prime and related exposure. About half of this is reported in the income line, the other half is in impairment. I'll talk about this in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Income grew 7% and cost growth was well-controlled at 4%. The Group cost-income ratio improved 2 percentage points to 57%. Return on equity was 20% and we've increased the dividend by 10%, to 34 pence.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our divisional performance in Global Retail and Commercial Banking. In UK retail banking, profits grew 9% to &#xA3;1.3 billion, benefiting from the work we've done to improve the franchise in recent years. Income grew 2% to &#xA3;4.4 billion excluding settlements from prior year overdraft fees of &#xA3;116 million.</p>
          <p>The Group performance in savings, current accounts, mortgages and local business was offset by lower income from payment protection insurance and lower net interest income from unsecured lending, where we've taken a more selective approach. The benefit of that approach can be seen an impairment, which improved 12%.</p>
          <p>Average deposits grew 7% and deposit margins increased. Asset margins were lower as a result of a larger proposition of mortgages in the mix. Our mortgage business has continued to grow and our net share of new lending was 8%, reflecting consistent volume growth over the year, with an up-tick in the fourth quarter. Our risk profile remains conservative, with an average loan to value on the residential mortgage book of 33%. The average loan to value on new business was 54%, mortgage impairment remained negligible.</p>
          <p>Effective cost control in UK retail led to a 3% reduction in expenses, delivered through improved processing, greater automation and a reduction in the number of operating sites from 86 at the beginning of the year to 56 at the year-end.</p>
          <p>We reinvested gains from property sales of &#xA3;193 million as we continued to work on improving the customer experience. This included the migration of more than 4 million accounts from the Woolwich to Barclays, refurbishing over 500 branches and transforming mortgage processing to half the time it takes to get an offer to the customer.</p>
          <p>In Barclays commercial bank profits before business disposals grew 5% to &#xA3;1.4 billion. Income increased 7% to &#xA3;2.6 billion, driven by very strong fees in growth -- very strong growth in fees and commissions, with good contribution from lending, foreign exchange, and derivatives transactions.</p>
          <p>Net interest income grew to &#xA3;1.7 billion, as a result in growth in both loans and deposits. Deposit margins were stable and there was a reduction in asset margins due to changes in the product mix.</p>
          <p>Impairment grew &#xA3;38 million to &#xA3;290 million, mainly in larger business, reflecting both business growth and the expected trend towards risk tendency. Costs grew 6% as we initiated investment in technology, infrastructure and distribution. The cost-income ratio in commercial banking was stable at 36%.</p>
          <p>In UK banking as a whole, the cost-income ratio improved 2% to 48%, excluding the impact of settlements on overdraft fees. This amounts to an 8 percentage point improvement over the last three years against our target of 6 percentage points.</p>
          <p>At Barclaycard, profits grew 18% to &#xA3;540 million, driven by very strong international growth, coupled with significant improvement in UK impairment. Barclaycard International moved into profit this year and contributed &#xA3;77 million, showing the benefits of our investment in recent years. Barclaycard US was a substantial contributor to this and remains on track to deliver profits of $150 million in 2008.</p>
          <p>Income at &#xA3;2.5 billion was broadly stable, with strong income growth in Barclaycard International offset by lower revenue in UK cards. International extended credit balances grew by a third to &#xA3;3.3 billion and UK balances fell 14% to &#xA3;7 billion, due to our more selected approach to the market. That approach has contributed to a significant improvement in impairment charges which are 21% lower than 2006. More selective customer recruitments in UK cards, tighter management of limits and improved collections have resulted in reduced flows into delinquency, arrears and charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Costs increased by &#xA3;120 million to &#xA3;1.1 billion as we continued to expand our international card business. Over 40% of our cards in issue are now outside the UK.</p>
          <p>International retail and commercial banking excluding Absa delivered profits of &#xA3;246 million. There was outstanding income growth of 28%, with excellent performances in both Western Europe and emerging markets. Loans and advances were up 36% and deposits grew 43%. The pace of growth accelerated in the second half as the business grew. Impairment charges increased by &#xA3;38 million from a low base, as a result of strong balance sheet growth.</p>
          <p>Costs grew 32% as we invested in distribution and technology. We launched retail banking services in India and the United Arab Emirates, and the total number of distribution points in IRCB excluding Absa grew by 55% as we opened 324 new branches and 157 new sales centers. We expect a similar pace of growth in our distribution network in 2008. We continued investing in technology to build a common scalable platform for IRCB. This was rolled out in India and the United Arab Emirates in 2007. And we expect international rollout to be complete by 2010.</p>
          <p>Absa Group Limited announced profit growth this morning of 23% to R14 billion. We report these in two different parts of our business. Absa Capital is included in Barclays Capital and the larger part is in IRCB. IRCB Absa's sterling profits were down 1% to &#xA3;689 million, reflecting a deterioration in the value of the rand. There was a very strong performance in Absa corporate and business banking and in retail banking where loans and advances grew 22% and deposits increased 20%.</p>
          <p>Profit more than doubled in Absa Capital to &#xA3;155 million due to very strong growth in primary market income and a growing contribution from secondary market trading. We have delivered synergies above our target of R1.4 billion, 18 months ahead of plan.</p>
          <p>Moving now to investment banking and investment management and starting with Barclays Capital. Profits at Barclays Capital grew 5% to &#xA3;2.3 billion, with strong income growth of 14% across most asset classes and regions, in particular, in interest rates, currencies, equities and commodities. This performance is the result of the investment we have made in recent years to diversify the business in Barclays Capital.</p>
          <p>There were losses in sub-prime and related credit businesses of &#xA3;1.6 billion. This included &#xA3;1.4 billion against super senior CDOs and just over &#xA3;800 million in other credit-related exposures. We recognized a gain of &#xA3;658 million on revaluing our own credit.</p>
          <p>The next two slides show our credit market exposures. At the end of the year our net super senior CDO exposures were &#xA3;4.7 billion, down from over &#xA3;7 billion at the half year. So you can see that we've managed our exposures carefully and taken selective hedging opportunities. In total, protection provided by subordination, hedging and allowances amount to over 70% of the sub-prime assets within the deals. None of the hedges we've executed were with monoline insurance counterparties. Other sub-prime exposure at the year end was &#xA3;5 billion, down from &#xA3;6 billion of the half year, and we've retained drawn leverage finance underwriting positions of &#xA3;7.4 billion at the year end.</p>
          <p>You'll see in our results announcement that we've updated the disclosure we gave you in November and given further details on our credit market positions, including our exposure to commercial mortgages, Alt-A and monoline insurers. Exposures of &#xA3;12.4 billion in commercial mortgages are half in Europe and half in the US. This includes commercial mortgage backed securities of &#xA3;1.3 billion. The larger part of the exposure is real estate loans, with an average loan to value of 67%. As you would imagine, our balance sheet valuations have been subject to rigorous internal process as well as external audit.</p>
          <p>We've taken a very disciplined approach to costs at Barclays Capital, which have gone down year-on-year. The cost to net income ratio improved 1 percentage point to 63% and the compensation cost to net income ratio improved 2 percentage points to 47%. We've continued to invest in growing the business, and head count increased by 3,000 to 16,200. Most of the organic growth was in Asia Pacific, which has been the region of fastest growth in 2007.</p>
          <p>In Barclays Global Investors, sterling profits grew 3% to &#xA3;734 million, in dollars they are up 12%. Profit growth was driven by strong income growth of 16%, largely from increased management fees and securities lending revenues, incentive fees grew 6%.</p>
          <p>Overall assets under management increased 15% to $2.1 trillion, which includes $23 billion from INDEXCHANGE, which we acquired in February 2007. INDEXCHANGE is now largely integrated and considerably strengthens our iShares business in Europe. Net new assets in 2007 amounted to $86 billion. We are pleased with the resilience of our performance in difficult market conditions during the second half. In line with others in the industry, we've provided selected support to some of our liquidity products, and this increased costs by &#xA3;80 million.</p>
          <p>Expenses grew by 25% as we continued to invest in new products, distribution and technology. We extended our suites of iShares with over 100 new exchange traded funds, introduced several new active equity funds and invested in our research capability in order to identify new areas of out-performance. We expanded our distribution channels in continental Europe and Japan in 2007, and we continued to build the infrastructure to support business growth. Headcount grew by 700 to 3,400.</p>
          <p>At Barclays Wealth there was excellent profit growth of 25% to &#xA3;307 million. Income grew 11% to &#xA3;1.3 billion, reflecting strong growth in client assets and transaction volumes.</p>
          <p>Cost growth of 7% reflects the benefits from lower redress costs and efficiency gains, all of which have been reinvested in additional client-facing staff and infrastructure improvements. The cost-income ratio improved 3 percentage points to 76%. Total client assets increased 14% to over &#xA3;130 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to coverage ratios, these reduced from 57 to 49% for potential credit risk loans. This was caused by a shift from unsecured retail loans to secured retail and wholesale loans, which typically have lower losses in situations of default. This is consistent with our long-term average and we are comfortable that our risk exposures were appropriately covered by reserves at the year-end. This excludes the super senior CDOs, which I talked about earlier.</p>
          <p>Looking at capital, our Tier 1 ratio at the end of the year was 7.8%, ahead of our target. Within that, risk-weighted assets grew by 19% and about 20 basis points were accounted for by preference shares issued since our trading update in November.</p>
          <p>Under Basel II, which was introduced at the beginning of 2008, our Tier 1 ratio is again ahead of our target at 7.6%. The difference is mainly due to higher capital deductions under Basel II. Our equity Tier 1 ratio at the year end was 5% under Basel I, under Basel II is 5.1%.</p>
          <p>On our pension fund our IAS surplus on our main UK scheme was about &#xA3;700 million, an improvement of over 1 billion on last year largely as a result of the increase in the discount rate. We completed the buyback of shares issued to China Development Bank and Temasek at the end of January and we announced dividend growth today of 10% to 34 pence.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we delivered over &#xA3;7 billion of profit in 2007, showing the benefits of diversifying our business in recent years. Our investment banking and investment management businesses performed well despite market turbulence in the second half. UK retail delivered pleasing profit growth. In Barclaycard, very good profit growth was driven by strong international growth and significantly improved impairment in UK cards. And international retail and commercial banking established real momentum in expanding the business.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much. I'll hand back to John now.</p>

          <p>I'm pleased that we've again generated profits of over &#xA3;7 billion in 2007, and that's sharply ahead of the average profits of the previous three years. We've been delivering on our commitments. Of course, our stock price performance has been poor. We can't control the price at which our stock trades, but I want to say up front how acutely I share the disappointment that our shareholders must feel in our 2007 total return.</p>
          <p>In the context of profitability, which we can control, I'll give you a one word description of our performance in 2007, which stands as my main message to you today, resilient. You can see good discipline in the management of income growth versus cost growth. Our ratios are solid. Cash generation in 2007 supported significant growth in WRAs. And we feel well served by the capital mix that we've adopted. I'll talk about each of these points in my remarks this morning.</p>
          <p>These things give us confidence, despite the environment. The source of profit resilience and the source of confidence is business strategy. It can be simply stated. We aim of achieve good profit growth through time by increasing our presence in markets and segments that are growing rapidly.</p>
          <p>The precondition of successful growth is relevance to customers. The investment choices that we've made in IBIM and GRCB over the last years have positioned us well for future growth. Not so long ago, of course, our earnings were dominated by UK banking. Today two-thirds of our profits come from other business lines. We intend to grow our UK businesses, of course we do, but the rates of the growth outside the UK will be faster.</p>
          <p>A good illustration of that strategy of work during 2007 is the growth we've seen in our Asian businesses, where profits more than doubled. In 2007, our Asian profits amounted to 9% of total Group profits. The equivalent figure five years ago was just 1%. And our new relationship with China Development Bank promises to be an important source of growth in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Like many strategies, ours is simple to describe, but tougher to implement, but it runs through everything we do. You've heard the detailed numbers from Chris &#x2013; I won't repeat them. My plan this morning is to show you some of the links between performance and strategy. At the heart of that, of course, is an implicit examination of the business model, which is working well. First, I'll look back at 2007 including some remarks about the balance sheet and then I'll look forward into 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>The big event of year was our bid for ABN Amro. We were disappointed not to be able to acquire it. ABN represented an acceleration opportunity, and in particular, we liked the physical footprint that it gave us. But we were unable to secure ABN Amro at a price that represented value for our shareholders. That hasn't affected our strategy.</p>
          <p>Let me touch on the 2007 performance of one or two of our businesses. First of all, Barclays Capital. The significant stress test of 2007 was well handled. Indeed, as you've seen, BarCap ended 2007 ahead of 2006, which itself was a record year. Barclays Capital has benefited significantly from the business diversification that I talked about at these results a year ago.</p>
          <p>This next slide shows our progress in broadening the income streams in the business, in particular, currencies, rates, equities and commodities. The income growth in 2007 was particularly notable, given that several of our markets were effectively closed during the second half of the year. The combination of business diversification and good risk management lies at the heart of another strong set of results. To be clear, it was a testing year for Barclays Capital.</p>
          <p>Our consumption of capital rose, but we continued to deliver returns well ahead of the cost of capital, as this next slide shows. Cost flexibility is one of the vital safety valves in a capital markets business. This year, as you've heard, we improved the cost to net income ratio by 1% and the compensation ratio by 2%.</p>
          <p>A key test for BarCap over time is if the rate of profit growth exceeds the rate of risk consumption. And this next slide indicates how over time we performed on that measure.</p>
          <p>Another test is that we can make money in variable climatic conditions. Here is a slide I have shown you before, updated for 2007. It makes the point that the business model is resilient to significant environmental change. In looking at BarCap, and at the industry as a whole, it's important not to lose sight of profit performance for all the understandable emphasis on exposures and write-downs. BarCap's profit growth in 2007 shows it as a top three performer in the global industry, in a year that really tested investment banking businesses all around the world. There will soon be a chance for you to get more detail on our IBIM businesses, because during the first half of this year we will hold a seminar which will enable Bob and his team to show you, among other things, the benefit of the IBIM structure.</p>
          <p>Now the second area of 2007 I want to highlight this morning is the underlying momentum in GRCB. In creating GRCB in 2006, I felt that these businesses were capable of faster growth. I also felt that we had skills that, with the right leadership, could take us into markets where we were either underrepresented or indeed not represented at all.</p>
          <p>Part of our thinking was that an important source of growth would be our ability to use in one country capabilities and products developed in another, taking for example, a skill in credit cards developed in Northampton and employing it in Asia or in Africa. The GRCB structure was also based on a view that we would see increasing convergence of customer needs and buying behavior around the world. And I think you can see many of those things in our performance in GRCB in 2007.</p>
          <p>You can see that we've been building distribution to create a much broader business base for the years ahead. You can see an increasing number of staff who serve customers, steady rationalization of the operating platforms, a significant increase in the number of branches, rapid growth in customer numbers and balances, and the unifying of standards and capabilities in risk. All of this &#x2013; more employees, more customers, more demand, higher balances &#x2013; is generating increased activity levels and increased income, with profits in the emerging markets and Western European businesses jumping sharply as a consequence.</p>
          <p>At the time of the creation of GRCB, I talked about my desire that Frits should raise the metabolic rate of this side of the Group. He has. During this half we will also hold a GRCB seminar at which we'll show you in some detail what's been happening.</p>
          <p>Now, before I turn to the future, I want to say a word or two about the balance sheet. The year-end ratios &#x2013; tangible equity to gross assets, Tier 1, core equity &#x2013; are at levels that we had planned and with which we feel comfortable. We've typically focused on the risk adjusted balance sheet more than on absolute balance sheet size. It's not been our practice to take big steps to limit nominal growth. Our repo activities would be an example of what I am talking about.</p>
          <p>We've run a leveraged balance sheet for many years. Since the implementation of the new accounting standards at the end of 2004, we've kept constant the ratio of the tangible equity to assets.</p>
          <p>In the past, as you know, we've leveled the balance sheet quite aggressively. For example, when we acquired our stake in Absa in mid-2005, the equity ratio fell to about 460 basis points. But by the end of 2006, we'd taken that back to 500 basis points, which is where it is today.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio is cash generative. Let me show you. This slide is one which we've used before. It indicates how our profit derived cash generation supports rapid business expansion through the balance sheet. We monitor the core equity ratio carefully and seek to maintain a broadly consistent level of equity and non-equity in our capital structure.</p>
          <p>An important part of balance sheet management is managing liquidity. And this has never been more important than in the last few months. We've benefited from strong liquidity flows into Barclays during 2007.</p>
          <p>We've now repurchased 300 million shares at a total cost of &#xA3;1.8 billion, and we did that to offset the dilutive effect of the investments by China Development Bank and Temasek last year. But the buyback also signaled our confidence in the strength of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Of course all the ratios are influenced by our dividend policy. We've been very clear in describing that policy, saying that we expect dividend growth broadly to match underlying earnings growth over time. We've also said that we expect the dividend to be broadly twice covered. That policy is unchanged, and it informs the dividend announcement that we've made today.</p>
          <p>So much for 2007, I'll turn now to the future, and I'll start with our new goals for 2008 to 2011. As you know we set goals every four years. When we last reset them in 2004, we said that we planned to grow economic profit at a compound annual growth rate of 10 to 13%. We wanted to generate thereby cumulative economic profit for the four years of between 6.5 and &#xA3;7 billion. We achieved that goal, as this slide shows.</p>
          <p>We also said that we wanted achieve top quartile total shareholder return. We did not meet that goal. The new goals issued today, which are on the slide now, are designed to be realistic but stretching. They assume an increased cost of capital of 10.5%. In setting them, we have of course taken into account the current state of the world, and also our assessment of what we think it will take to drive top quartile TSR. The range we're aiming for over the four year period is 9.3 to &#xA3;10.6 billion of cumulative economic profit, or 5 to 10% compound growth. If we hit the upper end of the range, this will translate we believe into top quartile TSR.</p>
          <p>We remain very focused on maximizing the alignment between the interests of our owners and the interests of Barclays, and focused also on choosing a profit metric, economic <mark type="inaudible" /> profit, which is sensitive to the cost of capital, the cost of risk and the cost of acquired goodwill.</p>
          <p>Now the achievement of these goals will be influenced by various factors in the future. First, we've made good progress in turning around our UK Retail Banking business. Its cost-income ratio has improved. We now commit to improving the cost-income ratio by a further 3 percentage points over the course of the next 3 years. We make this commitment even though it's right to be realistic about growth in the UK retail banking industry during 2008. This is partly because we expect only moderate GDP growth in the UK, and partly because of the regulatory headwinds with which you're well familiar. But we still have market share opportunities in UK retail banking on the income side, and you can test that aspiration against our significant market share gains over the last two years, particularly in mortgages and in savings.</p>
          <p>And on the cost side, there are also efficiency opportunities available to us. We have started the process of rationalizing our UK operations in UK banking and Barclaycard UK. We've halved the number of operations centers in the UK over the last 24 months, and we now have some 7,000 positions located offshore, up from 2,000 two years ago.</p>
          <p>Second, one of the biggest areas of risk concentration in UK commercial banking businesses has been and remains exposure to commercial property. Our stance in this sector has been conservative over the years, and that's one good reason why the loan loss rate in Barclays commercial bank has been stable. At this point in the cycle it's the right place to be.</p>
          <p>Third, our Wealth business has made brisk progress in 2007 towards our medium-term target of &#xA3;500 million of profit.</p>
          <p>And fourth, I want to touch on the outlook for BarCap. We continue to expect that the securitization of borrowing and the use of derivatives for risk management will represent significant sources of growth in the capital markets in the years to come. We see the trends over the last few months as dislocation, not cessation. I've only got to look at the buoyant activity levels in BarCap during the second half of 2007, and in the year-to-date, to find evidence of that. Volatility, of course, is good for BarCap, and volatility has increased. We see significant opportunity in investment banking, as well as more broadly across our IBIM businesses in the period ahead.</p>
          <p>I have sought to draw attention this morning to the growing business base of Barclays, which has served us well in 2007 and which will serve us well in the future. Meanwhile, we are getting on with it. You saw us announce recently the acquisition of Goldfish. The timing of this transaction suits us and the price suits us. We opened a further 80 branches and sales outlets outside the United Kingdom during January. We recently received a license to open branches in Pakistan. We've continued to take market share in UK mortgages, and income generation at Barclays Capital during the first weeks of the years has been strong.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the outlook, although of course the world is a less predictable place than it has been for sometime, we see the backdrop of 2008 as another year of world economic growth of close to 4%. This will be driven by the strong performance of the emerging economies. In the developed world, the more important question is not will there be a recession, but what is the depth of the slowdown and how long will it last? The US economy should respond to the fiscal and monetary stimulus which has been fast, aggressive and large. And we expect rate cuts in the UK, too, which will help reduce the impact on the UK of slower rates of economic growth elsewhere in the world.</p>
          <p>In an environment such as this, we have to be disciplined in our management of risk and rigorous in our approach to cost management. Our experience of 2007 gives us confidence about these things, and we enter 2008 with a strong capital base, broadening sources of income, a consistent strategic direction and significant opportunities for growth in the medium-term.</p>
          <p>I'll stop now, and we're happy to answer your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's <mark type="inaudible" />. Let me, two questions if I can for Chris, and then maybe a bigger picture one for Bob. Just two questions on the numbers maybe Chris, could you talk us though the amortization, the fair value adjustments unobservable inputs and just talk how that comes through in terms of P&amp;L and what we should expect to &#x2013; if that's one-off and how it should flow through into 2008? And the second one on the BGI &#xA3;80 million provision for liquidity support, is that a one-off for '07 and talk about whether we should expect any ongoing impact there into '08 as well? And then maybe just in -- for Bob, maybe if you could take a bigger picture view about how you see the outlook for 2008, and how BarCap got off to a start so far this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Chris, if you want to take first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first two. In terms of the amortization, that is quite often known as day one profit and loss or unobservable moving to observable income. It's a requirement under accounting standards that until you see observability in the marketplace, you defer the income, which is what we had done over 2007. As the markets continue to develop and become in some respects more liquid, particularly at the long dated part of different instruments, you start to observe prices in the marketplace which enables you to get a recognized factored P&amp;L. It's a standard that's being developed to be prudent, and we have used it. That recognition of income is clearly &#xA3;514 million that flows into 2007. There will be income that will flow into 2008, because we'll continue trading in the products that are now providing observable income. The quantum of that though will be dependent upon volumes that go though the market.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second point, the BGI cost of 80 million, that was the result of some support we provided to some liquidity products and really represents the importance that those products and the customers who are invested in them are to us. Will there be more is difficult to tell. We would look at that on a case-by-case basis. But in terms of 2007, it's that 80 million that you see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, do you want to talk about outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll, just before that, just to add to what Chris said on the BGI charge, that's an accounting charge for providing credit support. There is no actual losses at this point. There is no -- obviously, we're providing credit support, so there is a possibility of those. But at this time it's an accounting charge.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook, I think if you step back, and if I feed off what John talked about with economy, there is a lot of focus on the US and what impact that will have on the UK and the rest of world. We don't believe in the theory of decoupling. We think if the US is a hard correction, it will have an impact around world. But, as John said, we think that the Fed was early and bold, 225 basis points in rate reductions is well ahead of what you would see with the kind of numbers in this cyclical correction if we had seen them before. The currency is down about 10% over 2007. The fiscal stimulus looks like it's going to put $100 million into consumer pockets by May or June, somewhere in that timeframe. Inventory levels, frankly, are very positive. Trade flows are still 9 to 10% per month. So, we are going to have to watch the labor numbers. But our operating -- the way we are operating is we would expect this, as John said, to be shorter and shallower, and if we sat here in six months, we think we'd be talking about recovery in the US, not recession in the US.</p>
          <p>We think there is three other things that are important to keep in mind in terms of the challenging conditions of 2008, and we expect the first half, no mistake, to be extremely challenging. The question is will it improve in the second half? And in addition to our view of the economy, it's what we are going through today. It's the first audited financial statements of the UK and European banks since the July, August period. We think this is important, and we hope you see a lot of transparency, disclosure and frankly a lot of good news in terms of the underlying performance of the businesses here. We think over the next couple of weeks we will get clarity around whether monolines are as serious as people are making out or not. And we think -- we are not uncomfortable with our risks, but what we mean is more industry-wide, until the industry gets more clarity around exactly how big or how small an issue it is, it will impact the market conditions.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, its liquidity in the short end of the market, I think for those of you that saw the FT today, there was a good story on the term auction facility that the Fed has in place, they've kept it in place since December. It's got about 50 billion outstanding, it's been a real positive in terms of providing liquidity in the dollar market. If we can get those things clear over the next couple of months, and it won't be next week, then we feel good about the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The one thing that we feel really, really solid about though, and John has talked about this as well, the performance in 2007 has given us a license. We had better profits in investment banking and better profits in investment banking and investment management than we had in 2006. There is only other, two other banks that can say that. And that gives us a license to manage the challenging market conditions, but also invest in growth. And the biggest issue there is the US, and it's kind of counterintuitive, because the US was where most of the pain was.</p>
          <p>The US banks have experienced most of the pain, but when you have seven or eight US banks and a couple of -- or included in that seven or eight, a couple of foreign banks with big US operations, that for a host of reasons are retreating from the market, there is no way John and I are going to look back in two or three, or three or four years and say that we had an opportunity to do in the US what we've done in Europe, which is to be in the very, very top tier of all of our products and all of our markets. We're just below that top tier in the US right now, but there is an opportunity over two to three years to gain traction.</p>
          <p>So, we're not going to stop investing in Asia, in Africa, in continental Europe. But all of a sudden the US has moved very high on our priority list. For BGI it's an opportunity in defined benefits, for BarCap the opportunity I just presented, for Wealth it may be an opportunity to expand into that space. So, we're very excited about figuring out how we are going to manage the challenging market conditions while we invest and grow, and that's the management challenge that we have.</p>

          <p>There we are <mark type="inaudible" />, everything you wanted and more. To your right Simon. Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks very much. Simon Samuels from Citigroup. I think these are for you, John actually. I just wondered, on your sort of economic profit targeting and the fact that you basically delivered ahead of your own internal expectations, but failed on your positioning by quartile, and linking it to your comments about your balance sheet leverage, and the fact that you've sort of historically run a very leveraged balance sheet to use your own phrase, do you think there's a connection there? So, my question really is does the fact that you failed to achieve your TSR target cause you to reflect on your balance sheet structure and leverage? And there's a second and related question, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me handle the first one first, Simon. We have, of course in the way that I described in my remarks, we've thought carefully about business model. And the question we ask ourselves is what is the best model that enables us to capture the winds of growth in the years ahead. We are very confident about the structure of the model, and we're very confident in the balance sheet ratios that we have. So, I mean I think that what we control is economic profit, and we want economic -- we choose economic profit because we think its alignment with TSR through time is the best. But what we have to control is what is within our gift, which is the economic profit performance, and I feel very pleased actually that we have significantly outperformed that EP target over the course of the last four years. And if you look at the compound growth there, it was 16%, and we were 19% in cumulative EP, above the top end of the range, and that's a good performance. I think you know as well as I do that the sector as a whole took a real clattering during the course of 2007. I mean we all know that. But does that event cause us to say there is some structural imperfection with how we're doing business. I think you've only got to look at our results in 2007 to see that that isn't the case. I think our results in 2007, as I've described show up very well against the strategic risk test and the financial risk test that was posed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean, before I get onto my second question then, how do you sort of therefore rationalize away that disconnect? I mean in a way I am on shaky ground here, because I note from your appendix the bottom TSR bank in the universe was Citigroup. But how do you sort of rationalize away the fact that you've done your bit and the market stars have done its bit and you are not going to change anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think through time, Simon, is the right way of looking at it. I mean if, for example, I look at the eight years, the last eight &#x2013; so last two four-year goal periods, our performance there is a second quartile performance. Now, is that where I want it to be? I'd prefer it to be top quartile. But if I look at it over the last eight years, I mean interestingly, in the first goal period, we underperformed on EP and outperformed on TSR. We had exactly the same business model then by the way. We were a top quartile performer, but we underperformed on EP. If you then look at the second four-year goal period, it was the reverse of that &#x2013; out-performance on EP, underperformance on TSR. But through an eight-year period, we are not far away from hitting the TSR goal that we want to hit. I don't feel satisfied by that, because we set ourselves a goal and we want to achieve it. But I don't think any of the evidence that I am talking about here renders negatory the business model that we have. I think the business model that we have is enabling us to grow very fast.</p>
          <p>One last point I'd make. If you look at the average profits of Barclays for the first four years of this decade, they were about &#xA3;3.5 billion. And if you look at our performance over the quarter -- last couple of years, as you know, we've been at &#xA3;7.1 billion. Over that time, we have diversified the business significantly using the business model that we have adopted now for several years. I think it serves shareholders very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The second question, again linked to the EP issue, is just on your forecast going forward, it looks like you are targeting EP growth circa half the number you have just delivered for the last three-year period, 16 down to I think the midpoint is 7ish. Can you just kind of flesh out the changing in gears there, so what it is that as you look forward that you think would be growing at a meaningfully different pace than the last few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try, and my colleagues to the right may want to add what I say. Simon, what I would say is this, that first of all, think of it in absolute terms. So, we have gone from 5.3 billion in the first goal period to 8.3 billion in the second goal period, and now we are saying the range is 9.3 to &#xA3;10.6 billion. So, in terms of absolute growth, there is plenty of absolute growth there; point number one. Point number two, although I feel confident about our ability to grow over the four-year period, it would be unrealistic of me to sit here today and tell you that 2008 isn't going to be, by the standards of recent years in the industry, a much less benign year. And certainly in setting a 5 to 10% range spread over the course of the coming years, we have taken that into account.</p>
          <p>I think the third thing that is relevant is that the cost of capital, as I mentioned in my remarks, the cost of capital is up from 9.5% to 10.5%, and it's important that we should reflect that new calibration in the overall totals. If I look at the business -- the businesses underpinning that growth, we ask ourselves a question how well aligned are we to growth in the industry in our IBIM businesses and our GRCB businesses. And I feel quietly confident about the extent of that alignment. Anything that <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Just in front. And I will come to the other side of the room in a moment, I promise.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Could I follow on those two questions? One follows on and one un-related. And on the leverage issue, could I ask you to comment if you will on the attitude of the regulators to leverage and capital? I know not strictly speaking in this context he's a regulator, but Mervyn King has made it pretty clear what he thinks in terms of taking marks and raising capital. And I'll come to the marks in a minute, but obviously you haven't raised capital with these numbers. What do you think the regulators are in a mind in terms of capital and increasing the capital ratios of UK banks at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, does it surprise me to see the head of our central bank making some strong remarks about the need for prudence at a time like this? I mean I don't think that there is anything surprising in that at all. I mean you'd hear those remarks echoed by central bank colleagues of Mervyn King's all around the world, perfectly understandable. I think that the regulators will most of all look at the Tier 1 ratio, of the banks that they regulate, not uniquely, but most of all. And if you look at our own experience there, as you know, our target is 7.25. Our year-end was 7.8. That was up from the previous year end of 7.7. 7.8 is well up there in terms of average versus recent years. It's above the average of recent years, in the way that Chris described.</p>
          <p>And I think given all that was going on in 2007, all that the market threw at us, including our balance sheet growth during the course of 2007, to end the year higher than we started the year, notwithstanding all of that, I think shows our ability to generate cash in the way that I indicated and raise capital even in difficult times. So, I think that that's the way that the regulators are most looking at ratios. Of course where they have discretion, where are they likely to jump on the risk-friendly versus risk-averse, I mean again no prizes for answering that question, it's very clear that they are feeling more cautious about the world. And you can see that reflected in some of the exercise of the discretion that they have at the moment. But I go back to my point, we manage by reference to a number of ratios. I think that we feel quite comfortable with the ratios that we run, and I knew that this was going to be an area of considerable interest and hence the remarks that I made about balance sheet during my presentation to you this morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to turn that down, so you think the ratios you have been targeting to and running with over the medium term in the past will be appropriate to the medium term in the future now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've had cause to reflect quite carefully on that. And of course, I like the fact that in the Tier 1 we are running well ahead of our target. That seems to me to be a good and comfortable position to be in. In terms of the equity ratio, I made some remarks consciously about that because it is just 5.1; it is just below our target of 5.25. But I've talked about cash generation in the portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was on the assets in BarCap, and may well be for Chris and Bob. I mean, I'm relating this to notes 17 and 18 and in page 60 and preceding in the press release, could you comment on some of the assumptions behind the valuation of the assets on page 60 in BarCap? So, how much of those are related to I think it's non-observable factors? Have you also included anything for change in value since the year-end and any other comments you would like to make on the assumptions behind the valuation of these assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start, and if you go to page 58, where you have the unobservable inputs across the whole business of &#xA3;24.7 billion, that is pretty much what you see on page 60. There are relatively few assets that are unobservable but aren't shown on page 60. In terms of page 60, we have for each asset class been through a rigorous process in terms of marking these to market. They are with December 31 marks. We draw the line there and take those market prices and inputs that are available to us on the 31st. We, of course, in the few days following that look for information that may tell us there was something wrong about those marks, but what we do not do is update the marks in the absence of finding anything that is, is materially different from what we found at the end of year. In terms of the process, they go through a -- independent product control process, independent of the desks. They run through a challenge process up to and including Bob and the senior management at Barclays Capital. And there are a series of adjustments that are made reflected in here following that process. Finally, they are subject to year-end audits, and these have been through that and are the products of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that imply then that there is very little mark-to-market input into these items on page 60 as they are non-observable items. And if you were to look to mark-to-market, could you comment on what the difference would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are marked-to-market or certainly marked-to-model. The inputs are those that are available to us. They are not in all cases observable in the marketplace. That's why they are on the unobservable portion. But what you do is take information from indices and also other reference assets that are available to give you the inputs you need to value these.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning John. Good morning, Bob. Good morning, Chris. Could I just stay on note 18, there are sort of various, sort of questions, I think, the actual disclosure throws up. I mean, it feels like this is a note to everyone's accounts now. It's the note about things that we might be worrying about and, I'm just looking at Alt-A and also the monoline insurance and even commercial mortgages, which I thought was strange that the 11 billion of actual mortgages would actually be put in here with, alongside everything else. But I'd just like to get a better understanding of what this sort of notating is really trying to show us &#x2013; how far things have been marked down already, whether or not we should be expecting more markdowns, whether via the P&amp;L or straight  to reserves. Just a better understanding of the exposure, and particularly also the hedging on the ABS CDO, is that 1.3 the total extent of hedges in place now as of 31st of December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, well I welcome your comment about over-disclosure. This is a first, and thank you for it. And I'll hand over to Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just give you a few thoughts. First thing to say, these are exposures and they are consciously shown net of hedging and net of write-downs. These are the remaining exposures within these categories. Secondly, all of these are fair valued, so that the increase or reduction in value goes through either the trading income line or it goes through the impairment line. Nothing here goes to reserves. In terms then of the individual categories, you can go down them line by line, but probably the one that will catch your eye, and let me just touch on for a second is the monoline insurers. That is the mark-to-market of -- to the extent we rely on the monoline insurers for their guarantees or credit wrappers that they've applied to individual assets. We take the mark-to-market because we believe it's the best proxy for our exposure, but as with any mark-to-market, is not a realized loss. For example, when we look at the underlying assets, there are no defaults and no losses in the underlying assets. This is if you like the estimate we have of the market value of the support that we have reflected. So, all of these are marked-to-market and they are all the remaining exposures, and the adjustments that would be made either positive or negative go through the income statement and not to reserves.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, John, I should have advertised I've got a second. Just, well just on Barclays Capital, I think, but also maybe on broader drivers for the Group, because I mean obviously Barclays has, Capital has been a fantastic driver of your profit. The second half looked as if there is a few revenue items in there which sort of quasi-one-off in terms of equity realizations and disposals and the net investment income line. If we take that out, revenue growth was okay, I think. It seems like you've borne down on costs pretty aggressively, by what you are saying on the wires about your desire to invest and build head count, I'm not so sure that you'll be able to maintain that sort of cost discipline, but again please correct me if I'm wrong. But if BarCap is not the driver going forward that it has been, and I look across your other businesses, UKRB, I mean you mentioned yourself its top revenue growth is still negative, branch sales I guess will run out at some point. And IRCB ex-Absa looks like risk tendency's rising, Absa itself is arguably facing economic slowdown. We know what you look like, or would have looked like with ABN. Unfortunately that's not the business mix now. I'm just trying to get a sense of strategically, given the headwinds you're facing, how you're really going to drive decent growth in the next couple of years, or maybe we shouldn't be expecting that?</p>

          <p>Yeah, first on BarCap, because we're going to have our cake and eat it too. We are going to drive profitability in BarCap and the other areas of the Group are going to perform strongly as well. And I think we've shown you that. What you kind of just described is if I listen to you, I would have thought 2007 was a tough environment -- it was. It was a very tough environment. I think when you step back from that, Tom, and look at BarCap, in July we recognized that we had some exposures that we had to manage in sub-prime. And we managed those through the aggressive issuance of our own securities so we could fund our balance sheet. We've managed those through aggressive hedging on the index. Sometimes it was 1 billion or 2, sometimes it was up to 6 to 7. We didn't leave them in a static position. We hedged it by aggressive management of our DVaR. And we recognized that the same things that were going be difficult in sub-prime and in credit, were going to mean that the short end of the curve was a great place to be.</p>
          <p>And so what was the result of a full year? Credit was down 50%, I spot you that. Our credit business was down 50%. Our interest rate business was up 76% on its record year. Our FX business was up 61% on its record year. Commodities are now at &#xA3;1 billion and ahead of Goldman Sachs, up over 20%, equities up over 20%, prime brokerage up over 20%, emerging markets up 40%. Asia as a region doubled, Africa as a region doubled. Continental Europe was up almost 50%. We drove a very strong underlying performance, and clearly there were some one-offs in the second half of the year. But I think the story here, if you are being objective and really looking for the story, is strong risk management, an incredible best-in-industry driving of the underlying business and a culture where people didn't quit, they stayed focused. They kept working with the clients and kept driving the business. And so does that augur well for 2008, 2009 and 2010 for BarCap, you bet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Tom, on the other side of the business, GRCB, the comments I'd make as follows. I made the commitment in my remarks to giving you a seminar about GRCB, because I think it would be very helpful for our owners and those who help them to understand just what's going on. I think that as I see it, Frits has laid the grounds of significant growth in the years ahead. And you can see that in some of the indicators that I pointed you to this morning. So if you look at the UK, for example, we made a commitment a year ago about the experience in impairment in Barclaycard UK improving sharply. It has. As you saw, impairment was down 21% year-on-year. We made a commitment that the relative scale of the international card business in Barclaycard would rise sharply. It has. You can see the number of new credit card customer outside the United Kingdom recruited during the course of 2007, and that business, Barclaycard International, has broken into profit, 77 million of profit in 2007 versus 36 million in 2006, with the American card business being a big driver of that.</p>
          <p>If you look at the UK retail banking business, I mean its -- its headline profit was 9%, but if after you adjust out for those fee rebates during the course of the year, which arguably, you could say was a one-off, the underlying profit growth in that business, notwithstanding the headwinds, was 18%, and we've seen record levels of recruitment of savings customers and recruitment of current account customers, and the mortgage business we've done 3.5 times more net lending in mortgages in 2007 than we did in 2006. So I think that in the UK, I mean we've made some commitments historically about getting to greater productivity, and we've delivered on those, and we've made a further commitment in that regard in UK retail banking now this morning.</p>
          <p>Then if you look outside, I mean I -- again I tried to cover it in my remarks, I fear imperfectly. What we've been doing is we've been expanding our distribution channels and the number of our customer-facing staff, expanding as a sort of passive word &#x2013; actually it's been dramatic in terms of the growth. We've increased the distribution channels outside the United Kingdom by over 50% during the course of 2007. I would expect by consequence to see good growth, and I am seeing good growth. Now, I recognize that what we have to do is we've got to give you more information about this. We've got to enable you, as I do and Frits does, to look under the bonnet of GRCB, but we will do that in April, and I think you will derive from that real confidence about our ability to grow in the years ahead.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask you about the risk tendency, because it's the nearest you give us to a forecast? I was a bit surprised that the risk tendency is 2.3 billion, and you have 100 million from 2006. I thought that the sort of high levels of credit spreads in the credit markets, and maybe your own numbers on problem loans on page 67 might indicate that the risk tendency, your expected level of impairment would be going -- would actually be rising at this stage. I mean it seems to me that your risk tendency is saying that there isn't going to be any form of UK resection, maybe GDP growth is going to be between sort of 1.5 and 2%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, I'm going to let Chris comment, but just one word upfront, which is that a big driver of risk tendency of course through time, and indeed a big driver of risk tendency growth through time, has been the unsecured lending exposure, particularly here in the United Kingdom. And you've seen that our experience there at both in UK retail banking and in Barclaycard sharply improved. So, reduction of 230 million year-on-year in the Barclaycard UK impairments, a reduction of 80 million year-on-year in the UK retail banking impairment. I mean that's one of the reasons why that increase in risk tendency is quite suppressed, given the growth in the balance sheet, because the growth in the balance sheet is, lending to customers, is quite noticeable. Chris?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just to add to that, it really is a change in mix. You will see that the move from unsecured lending to secured lending has a very significant impact on this. And therefore, if I look at some of the key components of drivers, the big reduction is in Barclaycard, which reflects the improving, an improvement in the credit files that we've seen. The big increases are exactly where we're growing the business. They are in IRCB ex-Absa and they are in Absa. So, whilst the net is a relatively small increase, there are some quite significant fluctuations within the individual businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It's Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. I've got one question and then just a few points of detail in BarCap. I think, if you think about what everyone is chattering about this morning, it's basically that Barclays hasn't taken enough marks in BarCap relative to Merrill Lynch, and relative to some of the other investment houses that have clearly taken much bigger losses. If you had four things that you could defend your position, what would they be? And as I said, I've got some follow-up questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I went over this before, but I -- the contextual point I'll give you, and then I'm going to let Bob comment, the contextual point I'll give is that risk is not generic. Don't assume that all the banks in the world &#x2013; I know you don't &#x2013; don't assume that all the banks in the world are running identical risk. That's why the experience, the write-down experience of the players is rightly variable. Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly right. So I'm glad we have a chance to answer the question. What we try to do, and Tom hit on it early, and John and Chris and I discussed this at length. We gave you more disclosure than we've given in the past. We added CMBS, we added Alt-A, we added a number of things. We want to be state-of-the-art in term of disclosure of positions and also in write-downs. And I've heard this comment a couple of times this morning. And frankly, you can't compare our positions to Merrill or to Citi. They're very, very different.</p>
          <p>I'll give you four examples, since you asked for four. One comment I got is sub-primes marked down 20%. Well, there is two big positions in sub-prime, about half of it is the ABS CDO and if you &#x2013; the super senior position &#x2013; and if you take what we've done in terms of hedging against the index, zero hedges with monolines against the index. If you take the subordination, and if you take the write-downs, it's the equivalent of a 72% write-down. So it's not 20%, it's 72%.</p>
          <p>There is another position equal in size, very close to equal in size, which is whole loans. It's the real loans. That's primarily our production. We made a decision to stay in the business of origination, we'll continue to focus and look at this over the next year or so. But we're originating at our underwriting standards, our securities, they have 99% first lien. They have a loan-to-market value at the depressed house prices of 80%. We have just recently sold two large blocks to real buyers above our origination and above our marks. That's very different, those aren't down 20%. So you can't combine them and take a haircut across them. We are extremely comfortable with our positions.</p>
          <p>Alt-A is also a security class that is very, very broad. Our FICO scores are at the top end. 99% of all the Alt-A securities we have are performing. Our Alt-A securities have an average 81% loan-to-market value, and 96% of the bonds that we hold in Alt-A are AAA or AA. We can't just say that's like anyone else's Alt-A position.</p>
          <p>And then since I got four, I will give you a fourth. CMBS is very similar. As John had said, or Chris, I can't remember now, of the 12 billion, roughly 11 billion is in loans. These are our clients. These are our credits. We chose these. They have a loan-to-market value that averages something in the mid-60s. They are about half in the US and half here. So this isn't -- of course we're managing this, and of course we know the environment is tough, but we are not uncomfortable with the risk we are managing in these areas. And I think what Chris described in terms of the auditors at the end of the year, the rigorous process we go through here, the transparency, I want you coming away saying, not only is the disclosure market-leading, but so is the valuation, and that's how we feel.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, you had another question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I should have asked for five. Just on page 16 of the presentation where you talk about the BarCap revenue, commodities, I am sorry to be picky, but commodities looks like it slowed down a hell of a lot in the second half. I don't remember any big seasonal swings in the commodities business from before, given that it's been growing a lot, so I was wondering if you could comment on that. And just as a point of detail, I think -- I was just wondering if you could give us both the breakdown of the 658 million of valuation notes, I am sorry, excludes that -- the 500 million of amortization benefit, if that's in BarCap, where is that sitting on the revenue line. And I was wondering if you'd give us a feel for within the credit products, what's the revenues from leveraged loans, from securitization, and just because that's clearly where people are worrying about, a bit more of granularity there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, sure, I will ask Bob to handle the commodities question, and then Chris may take over from there and Bob may add. Do you want to go first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was nothing very unusual first half, second half. Frankly, I haven't got the number on the top of my head first half, second half for commodities, but the business, you know, we get a pretty good look into other people's numbers, not perfect. But we have been fighting for top three status in commodities since we began that business in the early 2000s. We believe we passed Goldman this year in full year revenues. We're still slightly behind Morgan Stanley. We're ahead of both of them in Europe and Asia. We're slightly behind in the US, so that's where the investments will be. But we think the 24% growth rate in the commodities business last year, off its record year, was very solid, and that's a business we are continuing to invest in. It's the business that we think will get the single biggest impact from our strategic partnership with CDB as China is the single biggest strategic market today for commodities, and this gives us an advantage position with the signed MOU.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you asked two questions. In terms of the 658 from the valuation of the notes issued, we've not put that into any of the individual business lines that you see on page 16. We felt that given that it was across Barclays Capital, it would be inappropriate to put it in any individual category. So we've highlighted it, we kept it out of those charts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if we did, we would have put it in credit, but it was not fair given the situation of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the 514, which is the amortization, that goes across a number of these, but you'll quite often find the majority of it in those which are interest rate, equity, currency and emerging markets. So, they go across a range of those individual categories. In terms of revenues, I think what we've put on page 16 is probably as far as we're going to go in terms of explaining the composition of the revenue base across Barclays Capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. It's Tim Sykes from Execution, three questions if I can. One on potential credit risk lendings, one of costs in BarCap, and one a slightly more philosophical on Basel II and your new target. I suppose what we're worrying about, and we are all just coming back to the same point, is there more to come, and I wonder if there is any instruction, Bob's mentioned the note at the bottom page of 68, but if we look at potential credit risk lendings on page 67 and 68, I wonder if Chris could help us marry page 60 with this page, particularly as the coverage in the US seems to have reduced substantially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I -- when I look at page 68, I exclude from it the disclosures that you see on -- in relation to ABS CDO super senior, because I think to bring that in just muddies the picture. What you see across this is when you ex- out the ABS super senior, is a -- is the results of a change in mix in the underlying loan portfolio, particularly away from unsecured to secured, and away from retail to wholesale and corporate. That is the big driver of the coverage ratios. When I look at the coverage ratios in overall terms, I look at it not only as a spot position, but where they sit across versus the long-term average. And whilst they are down year-on-year, they reflect the changes that I've talked about, and also surprisingly, I think, very much in line with the long-term average that we see of overall coverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, your second question was on BarCap costs, was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just -- if I can just push back on that slightly. I mean the coverage in the US at 7.6% is materially lower than what you indicated on the slide. I just wonder if you could just comment on that particular...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 7.6% includes the impact of the ABS super senior CDOs, whereas that is just measured on a gross basis. When you take account of hedges, which aren't in here, when you take account of subordination, which is not in here, when you take account of write-downs, that number goes significantly higher, because you get to the 72% that Bob described earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this would -- if we gross up on these numbers, it gives us a better position of your gross exposure rather than the net which might be on page 60?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gross. Okay. I think that's what we're trying to get to. If I can ask about costs, sorry John, and the cost performance in Barclays Capital was excellent, congratulations, it's important that the interests are aligned. Can I just check that there isn't an accounting change between the first half and the second half, that you continue to work on the same basis as you have done throughout 2007?</p>

          <p>I think your -- I can understand why you raised the question, Tim, and it's important that, that again I -- we talked about cost discipline in BarCap I mean to me it's a real signal of cost discipline that the compensation ratio has improved, that the staff to net income ratio has improved, that the cost-income ratio has improved. And this a time for those ratios to be resilient and to protect the performance of the Group and the interest of shareholders, and they absolutely have delivered. Your third question?</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Is a philosophical one, I think you said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well possibly. It's about Basel II, which is usually, people do philosophize somewhat, and you stuck with economic capital and risk tendency for your target looking forward, but you've made a virtue as you should moving of towards Basel II, and I wondered why you didn't in your targets look at the Basel II capital calculation and why you continue with economic capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I, Chris will probably want to add. But, I would start by saying, Tim, that one of the -- in our mind very positive developments of Basel II is that it has created much more significant convergence between an economic capital view of the world and a regulatory capital view of the world. They are not synonymous, for reasons that we both know. But they are much more closely aligned. Our view continues to be that economic capital and economic profit represent the metrics that are best aligned with the interests of shareholders. I don't think Basel II is perfect from that point of view. Indeed I wouldn't say that economic capital or economic profit is perfect. But it's the closest thing that we can measure to the generation of long-term value on behalf of shareholders, that's why we've not deviated from selecting it for our new goal period. It's a very conscious decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only thing I would add is a very practical point. We've clearly spent 2006 and 2007 building all the infrastructure that we need to deliver Basel II, and we've produced the numbers for you as at January 1. There is still work to do in really understanding Basel II at a granular level, so we're able to understand it by business, we are able to understand it by product, and until we've done that, it just felt premature to move away from something that we understand much better.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks John, it's Stephen Andrews from UBS, two questions, one on note 18 and one on note 17. Just firstly -- just putting everything together, as Bob was saying in his four points, obviously the marks taken on these at-risk assets were taken at the 31st of December. Based on Bob's comments, and the fact that there's been a bit more turmoil in the first six or seven weeks of the year, can I assume that where you stand today, that you don't think there is a need for any further significant write-downs on these positions since December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask Chris to answer. And you're absolutely right. These were taken as at the end of the year. We continually mark the positions as we go across the whole business on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. And if we had something that we felt significantly changed the comments that we've made about the outlook and something that had a significant effect on the market position of our equity, we'd make a statement. And we do not feel we have to make one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's very clear. And then just secondly on note 17, and I kind of share John's view in terms of equity to assets and it's quality rather than the quantity that matters. But in that regard, if we look at note 17, if we exclude the derivatives obviously, and that, the stuff linked to customer under investment, you've got &#xA3;300 billion of debt securities on balance sheet, and you've given us disclosure about 20 billion -- about 15 to &#xA3;20 billion of note 18. Can you say a few words or perhaps give shareholders a little bit comfort why they shouldn't be worrying about this &#xA3;280 billion of debt securities in terms of what quality they are, where they are and why you're comfortable that we won't to see further marks on those? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's Ian Smillie from ABN.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Ian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I invite you to make some comments about the appetite to grow the Group's balance sheet from here, both in terms of risk weighted assets and assets, and perhaps if you could do that in three ways? Firstly, in terms of how much of the second half growth was due to growth in previously committed lending, rather than perhaps new loans which you made. Secondly, how you might have changed the terms and conditions and the pricing on the new loans which you've been committing and which you continue to commit. And here I'm thinking mostly probably about corporate and wholesale and also the UK retail piece, rather than IRCB. And thirdly, how changes in the availability of credit from you as an individual bank, but also from you as system of banks, may impact the credit quality of the underlying customer base, which is dependent on those borrowings to continue and to repay their loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's try and parcel that out. On the first point, for context, you'll see this, on WRAs, which grew broadly &#xA3;50 billion year-on-year, the second half growth was 30 billion and the first half growth was 20 billion. If you look at loans to customers, where the growth during the year was &#xA3;70 billion, it was actually the inverse of that. There was lower growth in the second half than in the first half. On your point about balance sheet, Chris just may want to comment on some accounting consequences on the gross balance sheet second half impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's worth just looking at the half-on-half balance sheet, because if I take the June 30th balance sheet, and I take that because that was the most recent balance sheet prior to what we've seen in the credit markets, and I compare that against the year end balance sheet, you'll see that the balance sheet has grown by about &#xA3;70 billion. If you look at the source of that, you'll see that the derivatives gross up is about &#xA3;75 billion. So, if you exclude the accounting adjustment, the balance sheet movement is actually a small reduction between June 30th and 31st of December. And that, when you decompose it, has an increase in customer loans and a reduction in trading portfolio assets. What it does show to me, though, is that the balance sheet in terms of the pieces we control is flexible, and we are able to manage it accordingly.</p>

          <p>Bob, do you want to make any comments about pricing on the wholesale side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I think Frits would say the same on UK retail, is frankly while volumes in the institutional space in the second half and early in the first quarter this year are down, pricing is much better. So, at the end of that five-year liquidity bubble, pricing was tough for the banks. And clearly we are getting better spreads for the business we do now. And I think you'd said same on mortgage business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If all of the banking system is withdrawing credit at the same time, then it's going to increase the probability of customers struggling to repay their loans.</p>

          <p>Of customers not being able to repay their loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean I guess what I would say is judge us by our performance in 2007, that was quite a tough period. If you look at the Barclays commercial bank, you look at the loan loss rates there, you look at growth in the book relative to the overall increase in the impairment charge,  I mean what that suggests to me is a business where risk is well controlled. I think you can see exactly the same pattern across our retail businesses in the UK. You were particularly asking about the UK. But if you look at the experience in UK retail banking and you look at the experience in Barclaycard, I mean I think you're seeing good repayment profiles, and all those risk indicators that we were talking about a lot year ago if you remember, those risk indicators are pointing in the right direction, not least because for millions and millions of consumers in the United Kingdom, they've just had the first point of alleviation many of them in their debt servicing costs because of the rate reductions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we conclude from that, that the widening credit spreads that you can see in pretty much every capital market product is almost entirely about liquidity and not about the capital market taking a view that credit risk is going to deteriorate over the coming months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's a -- I think your point is a very fair one. And you know when Bob in answer to an earlier question talked about some so to speak conditions precedent and normalization, one of the things he was careful to say was liquidity, it's very clear that after the consolidated action of the central banks in the December, which had a big impact on liquidity in January, some of that liquidity has dripped away and that is certainly a source of concern to the market as a whole. I think what we've seen is the empirical evidence of concerted action having an impact, and so of course we would welcome if there were to be more such action.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I realize you've got two minutes left, I will be cheating and try to get three really quick questions in. One, just to follow on Stephen's question, specifically can you disclose your exposure in synthetic CDOs as opposed to the ABS CDOs? And second, and it's a related question to that, if there are ratings downgrades on -- in particularly structured credits, do you see some downside risk on particularly Basel II capital ratios, given the increase in risk weightings that are accompanying the ratings downgrade? And the last question is, just on the exposure to the monolines, that increase in the second half of the last year from &#xA3;140 million to &#xA3;1335 million in exposure monolines, was that a mark-to-market gain on existing positions or was that added positions?</p>

          <p>Chris, go, please, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the synthetic CDOs, where we have them, they are included in that super senior disclosure, so they are included in there. Second question was around...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rating downgrade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rating downgrade. You are absolutely right that Basel II does get impacted in terms of its RWA calculations by rating downgrades. That's something we watch when we look at out capital position, when we look at the plans going forward, we take account of projected stress scenarios where you have those downgrades. That's something we absolutely agree with you, you have to watch. And in terms of monolines, the increasing exposure to the monolines is as a result of the mark-to-market change in the underlying assets rather than a lot of new volume.</p>

          <p>Good morning. It's Leigh Goodwin from Fox-Pitt, Kelton. Just a question on your leveraged finance positions, and that market in fact, and I noticed your position is essentially unchanged now for six months or more. I wonder whether these are the same assets that are essentially sitting on your balance sheet, as of six months ago, and what the prospects are for that market sort of opening up again? And also if I can just ask about the impairments that you've taken against those, it doesn't seem as if those changed at all either since October. And I just wondered what your view is on that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are correct to say that the market is moving slowly. We think for all the reasons we've said about difficult market conditions in the first six months, it's unlikely that that market is going to be really moving we think before the second half of this year, if earlier maybe at the very end of the second quarter. There has been some movement, but not great, in and out. One example would be, when we talked to you before, we had &#xA3;60 million in bridge equity exposure, which was at the very low-end of the industry, that's down to &#xA3;2 million now. So, it has been possible to move some things, but it comes back to John's earlier point. At this time corporate credit remains very strong and the exposures we have to the clients we have, we're not uncomfortable managing that risk and continuing to manage as we have.</p>
