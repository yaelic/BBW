          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Statoil's Fourth Quarter Earnings Presentations and Capital Markets Update, both to the audience here in London and to our audience &#x2013; and webcast audiences. My name is Hilde Nafstad, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations in Statoil.</p>
          <p>Before we start, let me say that there are no scheduled fire-alarm tests today. So if the fire alarms do go off, please listen to the announcements, and follow the instructions. The fire assembly point is over by St. Paul's Cathedral, opposite the Blacks camping store. The venue management team will be on hand to assist. The nearest fire exits to this location are out of the entrance doors behind me, and turn to your left or right, the fire exits are indicated by the green running man sign. In the event of a medical emergency, please inform the event management team who are trained first aiders or, where required, contact development services.</p>
          <p>This morning at 7:30 Central European Time, Statoil announced the results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012. The press release and presentations for today's events were distributed through the wires and through Oslo Stock Exchange. The quarterly reports and the presentations can, as usual, be downloaded from our website, statoil.com. I would ask you to kindly make special note of the information regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found on the last page.</p>
          <p>Our CEO, Helge Lund, will not be present today. He is attending a reception in Bergen to receive the casket of our esteemed colleague and Country Manager for Statoil in Algeria, Mr. Victor Sneberg, who was killed in the terror attack in Algeria.</p>
          <p>Today's program will start out with Statoil's CFO, Torgrim Reitan, who will go through the earnings, the strategy update and the outlook for the company. Then after the break at 2:00, EVP &#xD8;ystein Michelsen will give an update on the Norwegian Continental Shelf; followed by EVP Eldar S&#xE6;tre, who will give a presentation about natural gas.</p>
          <p>After the presentations, Q&amp;A sessions will follow. Please note that questions can be posted by means of the telephone but not directly from the web. Dial-in numbers for posting questions can be found on the website. The operator of the conference call will explain the procedure for posting questions over the phone immediately before the Q&amp;A session starts. The event will close around 3:30 UK time.</p>
          <p>It is now my privilege to introduce our CFO, Torgrim Reitan. Please, Torgrim.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hilde. In Amenas, in Algeria, we are part of two international corporation, three companies from three countries and two continents, and suppliers from across the globe, colleagues from Algeria, the UK, Japan, U.S., Canada, Ireland, Norway and others, and this is what the terrorists so coldheartedly attacked. More than 40 people from 10 countries were killed. Innocent people with rich lives. And in Statoil, we lost five of our best. So we share the pain, and we share the sorrow of all the families who have lost their loved ones. It is difficult to understand, and it is impossible to accept that our colleagues are the victims of deliberate and gruesome violence.</p>
          <p>Our response to this evil has been to respond with determination and to reach out with care and support to the victims and the families. In these dark hours, we have also experienced the character of our people. On behalf of Helge and the rest of the company, I would like to thank you for the support and the sympathy we have received from partners, from authorities and from the financial community from all over, and that means a lot to us.</p>
          <p>Terrorism is a global challenge and it needs an international response. Statoil cannot respond alone, but we will work together with authorities and our partners and we will do our part. And we have the responsibility to learn and to improve and to protect our people and our assets. And we will not be deterred from doing business around the world. We are going to share our experience, we are going to share our know-how and bringing energy to those who need it.</p>
          <p>Today, I will show you the state or we will show that the state of Statoil is strong. I will start by going through the results and give you an update on our strategy and our outlook, then &#xD8;ystein and Eldar will cover our activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and in the gas markets. And then we look forward to taking your questions and discuss these issues with you.</p>
          <p>We have started our fifth decade of growth. Last year, we marked the 30 years anniversary, and in the last few years, we have accelerated that development. From a Norwegian National Oil Company to a globally competitive oil and gas company. We have achieved necessary scale and now we have operatorships in several of the most attractive basins around the world.</p>
          <p>From an integrated oil and gas company to a focused upstream company with a clear strategy, selling non-core assets and putting our money where our strategy is. From resource constrained to opportunity-rich, we are delivering industry-leading exploration results and production growth. And we have moved from financially restrained to having significant financial flexibility. We have brought down our net debt to 12% currently. So we enter 2013 from a robust position and then we do look forward to the next 40 years as well.</p>
          <p>2012 was a year of record for Statoil. We delivered strong results across the business. When we broke new barriers, we produced more than 2 million barrels per day in 2012. And two years back, I'm sure you recall that we said we will grow with 3% on average from 2010 to 2012, and I am very glad to be here today and tell you that we have delivered on what we have said. That meant a production growth of 8% from 2011 to 2012.</p>
          <p>We deliver strong earnings and the earnings are growing. Our cash flow from underlying operations is the best ever, more than NOK250 billion last year. Then reserves. Reserve replacement rate is 110% in 2012. Maybe take into account the divestments that we did, it is 100%.</p>
          <p>Exploration had another great year, adding 1.5 billion barrels from the drill bit. That is the best exploration year since 1997. And then our dividend policy remains firm and we propose to continue the growth in the dividend, NOK6.75 per share this year, and that translates into a direct yield of around 4.5 percentage points.</p>
          <p>For 2012, we delivered strong adjusted earnings. It increased 7% and we report an earnings per share of NOK22. And in the fourth quarter, earnings increased by 5% when we make the adjustments to reflect the underlying operations. And this growth of 5% comes even without the results from Statoil Fuel &amp; Retail and Gassled that has been part of earlier years' results. Then I know that tax on adjusted earnings is a bit lower than what you expected. Simple reason behind that; the lower tax rate is mainly due to deferred tax assets in the international business. And you will find that the tax rate for the year, 71.5%, is within the guided range of 70% to 72%.</p>
          <p>We can report strong performance across the business, across the segments. Our Norwegian business continues to deliver strong earnings and earnings growth for the year. And there's particularly one thing I would like you to see, that even if we have more fields into production now, costs are stable. So we have kept operating costs stable for five quarters in a row. So our cost focus is paying off and, &#xD8;ystein, he will come back to the NCS later today.</p>
          <p>From our operations outside Norway, we see increased earning. Earnings grew by 20% and production grew by 25%. And we are ramping up production from Peregrino in Brazil, from Pazflor in Angola and Bakken in the U.S. and Pazflor in Angola. And currently around one-third of our production comes from outside Norway, and this is profitable production. The cash flow per barrel is on par between the Norwegian production now and the international production. So we are growing internationally and it is a profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Marketing, processing and renewables contributes with close to NOK18 billion last year. That is a 60% growth. We have record gas sales and we have record gas prices in Europe, and in addition, our traders are doing well and they achieved better margins from our refineries. And, Eldar, he will tell you more about this later today.</p>
          <p>In 2012 we produced the barrels we promised you at the Capital Markets Day in New York two years ago. Average annual growth from 2010 to 2012 was 3%. And the last year, it increased by 8%. In the quarter, it was up 3%. We responded to strong gas markets and increased gas production on the NCS, and we are ramping up production, as I have told you. And we have also reduced the maintenance compared to the same period in 2011.</p>
          <p>We are on course to profitably grow our production to above 2.5 million barrels per day in 2020. And this means a 3% growth on average throughout this decade, and our current resource base has a potential well beyond that. Allow me to come back to the details of that later in my presentation.</p>
          <p>I'm following the cash flows very carefully. And cash flow from underlying operations was record strong, more than NOK250 billion last year. It was up NOK20 billion from 2011. We sold oil and gas, more oil and gas to higher prices and, of course, we had to pay more taxes as well.</p>
          <p>Our organic CapEx was $18 billion, and that was in line with what we told you in advance. And after dividends, we are left with around NOK26 billion for the year. Net debt has been reduced from 21% at the start of the year to 12% at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So let me now move over to give you an update on our strategy. 2012 was a year of strong strategic progress. In Norway, we are growing and we are growing on back of a rich and highly profitable portfolio. And we are on track to grow our production to more than 1.4 million barrels per day in 2020.</p>
          <p>We are positioning ourselves for the future gas markets in Europe. In 2012, we realized highest gas prices ever in Europe. Negotiations have been concluded for the majority of the volumes, and we have agreed on a sustainable solutions for all parties. We are actively shaping this market and we are seizing new opportunities. We are deepening our positions in the offshore basins, and we had another strong year within exploration with five high-impact discoveries. It was Havis in the Barents, it was King Lear in the North Sea, it was Zafarani and Lavani in Tanzania, and P&#xE3;o de A&#xE7;&#xFA;car in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Within unconventionals, we will now operate production from all the three U.S. plays that we are part of. And we have doubled the production from Bakken since we acquired it a year ago. And we are making money on our unconventionals in today's prices and with the current differentials.</p>
          <p>And finally, we will continue with portfolio management as a key part of our strategy. You have seen the successful divestments we have done of our retail business. And we have also realized substantial value from non-core assets in the transactions with Wintershall. In total, we have delivered gains of more than $6 billion over a short period of time. So, we will continue to add and subtract to our portfolio, and you will recognize the pattern. We are sharpening the growth, putting our money where our strategy is, securing influence and control to Statoil and giving us added financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>We are in a robust position to finance our growth. And first of all, in the past four years, Statoil has generated strong cash flows. This has provided strength and flexibility to invest in our projects, reducing our net debt from 27% to 12%, and at the same time, maintaining a firm dividend policy. And then we have maintained a solid credit rating, AA minus.</p>
          <p>Over the next four years we aim to follow a similar pattern. We are going to generate significant free cash flow from operations. And we will active manage our portfolio going forward. And then we will continue with our dividend policy, which is to grow the dividend in line with underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>Let me then turn to how we are investing the capital. In 2012, our producing assets generated around $10 billion in free cash flow. That is after investments. And the producing assets will continue to deliver a solid free cash flow over the next years. That means that if we had selected not to invest in &#x2013; on new assets, we would have paid back the entire company value by 2020. But we are reinvesting. And we are reinvesting to deliver even greater value to our shareholders. With a return on capital employed above 15% last year, we are in the top quartile compared to our peers.</p>
          <p>And we will invest and we will invest in a controlled way. This year, we expect to invest some $19 billion on organic investments. And over the coming four years, we see an average yearly CapEx of around $21 billion. And this is consistent with delivering on the 2.5 million barrel per day ambition in 2020. We have more than 100 projects that has a potential production capacity of 1.9 million barrels per day ahead of us, highly attractive and profitable projects that are competing well within the industry. The average breakeven price for our sanctioned projects is $50 per barrel. And the average payback time from production start is actually three years for the new project. So this money will come back quickly.</p>
          <p>And as a last point, let me remind you that we operate most of our investments ourselves and 40% of our total new projects has not yet been sanctioned, so we have the flexibility to adjust and optimize as we choose.</p>
          <p>Then over to Norwegian tax system. 40% of our projects are located in Norway with a tax system that gives a very efficient cash recovery of CapEx. I get questions about the Norwegian fiscal regime and, yes, 78% is a high tax rate. But what makes this work is that the system is balanced. And due to depreciations and uplift, we get back 93% of our investments as reduced taxes. And that is just over the first six years. So this means that after-tax CapEx cost is only 7% of the pre-tax CapEx and it's, of course, the after-tax investments that will impact our cash flow.</p>
          <p>Projects are put into production as planned. Since the strategic reset in 2011, we have delivered the first growth wave. 400,000 barrels per day in new production capacity for Statoil. Let me put that in context, that is four times the contribution from Gullfaks to Statoil, and the projects that are operated by Statoil have been delivered on schedule and at cost.</p>
          <p>Towards 2020, we will add an additional 1.9 million barrels per day of new capacity, and 900,000 of those will come over the next three years. Our fast track portfolio, they will produce 100,000 barrels per day for us in 2014. That is stronger and it is faster than expected. So this is substantial value creation and projects with low breakeven prices.</p>
          <p>As you understand, we are on track to deliver on 2.5 million barrels per day in 2020. And as you know, we will grow with 2 to 3 percentage points from 2012 to 2016. Then our investments results in many big projects coming onstream. And growth will accelerate, 3 to 4 percentage points growth per year from 2016 to 2020. And as we have told you, growth will not be linear, and in 2013, production will be lower than in 2012. This comes from decisions we have made ourselves and decisions we have made to create value.</p>
          <p>The Wintershall transaction will reduce our production by 40,000 barrels per day from closing. We have reduced the rig count in Marcellus to adjust to the price environment there, and so we can produce the gas at a later point in time at higher prices. That will reduce the growth in Marcellus with some 25,000 barrels per day. And then we have sold more gas in Europe in 2012, meaning that there will be a lower gas production in 2013, around 15,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>And lastly, the situation at In Amenas will also impact output in 2013. In Amenas produced 23,000 barrels per day for Statoil in 2012. And work needs to be done on the plant and work needs to be done before it can be started up safely. It is too early to say when that can happen so it puts uncertainty into the production for 2013. So we are on track and we are moving ahead, as we have discussed earlier.</p>
          <p>We have a portfolio with a capacity to produce more than 2.5 million barrels per day in 2020. Our current portfolio of producing assets is performing well. Decline is 5% as it has been over the last years, and it is as expected. And new projects will add significant growth on top of that.</p>
          <p>We are also increasing the oil share in our production towards 2020. And we expect the NCS gas volumes to stay around the same level throughout the decade. Then we are growing both internationally and in Norway. All clusters are growing, and we are growing on all our continents.</p>
          <p>Based on the resources, we could continue our production for more than 30 years, but our ambition doesn't end there. Our ambition is to consistently deliver an organic RRR above 1. In 2012, it was 110%. We have increased the oil ratio as well. And the three-year average, RRR is 1. These results come from a strong effort by the organization. We have sanctioned four new developments, giving more than 200 million barrels of new reserves: Dagny and Ivar Aasen on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, Hebron in Canada, and Mariner off the coast here in the UK. And then increased recovery also provide important reserve additions. So our large project portfolio will ensure an average RRR above 1 throughout this decade.</p>
          <p>Then on to exploration. Our new exploration strategy is showing results. 2012 was the best exploration year since 1997. 46 wells completed, 23 discoveries, adding more than 1.5 billion barrels from the drill bit. In our high impact discoveries in Norway, in Brazil, in Tanzania, and the reserve is even better than in 2011 when we discovered Johan Sverdrup, the world's largest oil discovery that year.</p>
          <p>And you have seen the Tanzania announcement today, 7 to 9 Tcf in recoverable resources from our Block 2, a great reservoir, probably 60% to 80% recovery rate. And that forms a good basis for an LNG project. And we are moving our discovery Americas to East Africa and we will work together with Exxon to mature older prospects there. And there is more to come.</p>
          <p>20 high impact wells is going to be drilled from 2013 to 2015. And this year, we have four exciting campaigns with a numbers of wells to watch. First, the Barents Sea. We will drill four wells in the Skrugard/Havis. The first one is Nunatak, so that is &#x2013; we should pay attention to. Then we have the Hoop area, further north. There we have the first well called Apollo. That is a potential play opener.</p>
          <p>Moving to East Africa in Tanzania and Mozambique, Zafarani 2 was announced today. And then we have Tangawizi, that's a new prospect, looking promising, that should be watched. Moving over to Canada, there we will have three wells. The one to look out for there is called <mark type="ph" /> Harefield West (29:52). And then in Gulf of Mexico, a program of high wells and a prospect called <mark type="ph" /> Sarkia (30:00) is worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>And finally, in Indonesia, we have a potential play out there called <mark type="ph" /> Sekar West (30:08). And back home in the North Sea, the Lupin prospect should be watched. So it's a long list and that is the whole point. Then next year, we will start drilling in the Kwanza Basin in Angola.</p>
          <p>As you have seen today, we are in an investment cycle. We are building two legacy assets for the future, and the growth will be strictly governed. Our projects will give a strong cash flow and a cash flow growth, and we have the luxury to pick our best projects. Balancing all of this will ensure that we deliver our competitive growth on top of a robust balance sheet and while we are providing a competitive dividend yield.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, we are delivering strong results across the business. We are executing our strategy and we are on track to meet our targets. So thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Brendan Warn from Jefferies. Just my one question, in terms of value over volume, you've given us the impact of 2013 by producing the gas in 2012. What was the EBIT or can you give us an idea of the value you got from the reduction in volume in 2013, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Alejandro Demichelis from Exane BNP Paribas. Yeah. My one question is you talked about stabilizing costs across the portfolio, maybe you can give us some indication of how you see that evolve in both, in international business but also in Norway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, could you repeat start of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've talk about stabilizing costs in your upstream business, maybe you can give us some indication of how you see that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. I'm very glad to see the development on the cost side in 2012, stable operational costs. I do expect cost controls to be strict going forward as well. And the way we work with these elements is, first of all, on simplification, and I think the fast track concept is a very good example of addressing cost. Standardizing the way that we build these projects, so one project team can take care of more than one projects, and they probably have to use these type of equipments.</p>
          <p>It has reduced the time from discovery to production by 50% and reduced cost by 30%. So, that is getting more out of scarce resources. That is about working with suppliers, long-term frame agreements. It is a scale effect working with costs, take advantage of them.</p>
          <p>And then the last point is about culture and the people and the attention that our leadership put on culture. So it is under control. But it is a tight market, many places, so we need to have full focus on this going forward as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul Spedding from HSBC. Your production profile that you show on slide 15, shows a relatively flat gas profile. I'm curious as to whether you include anything in there for gas from East Africa or whether that could be providing some upside to that profile.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you. You are right, the gas profile is rather flat on that profile. When it comes to East Africa, still large uncertainty when that would be put into production. We are very encouraged with what we see. And the potential, the block is large, there are further things that we want to mature and drill. So that is what we focus on now. And then we have to come back to any potential start-up and decisions in East Africa. So you're right, it is not part of the gas profile in that chart.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Haythem Rashed from Morgan Stanley. Thanks for the presentation. One question with two parts, if possible. Just around your financial framework, I just wanted to ask firstly on the sort of CapEx guidance that you have over the coming years, sort of how comfortable you feel with that, and whether you think it's enough, given some of these projects that you are considering sanctioning, like Tanzania for example, some coming over the next couple of years. I'm sort of particularly interested given the &#x2013; when you look at the operating cash flow that you're guiding for and the CapEx, sort of how much flexibility you have there, obviously assuming you actively &#x2013; continue to actively manage your portfolio in that regard.</p>
          <p>Second part to it is just on your reference oil price. I just &#x2013; I wanted to get your thoughts around that. The $110 looks relatively high compared to some of your peers in terms of reference conditions. I just wondered, given some of the agencies we've seen around the world talk about spare capacity increasing quite substantially over the coming years, what your thoughts are around sort of that oil price going forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Haythem, for a long and complex question and I counted three or four questions, so thank you. On the CapEx, I'm more comfortable. I mean a key point on the CapEx guiding is that it is consistent with the 2.5 million barrels per day production in 2020, and the project portfolio can produce more than that. If we bring on all the projects that we are working on as soon as we can, we can produce more than that, and that would also lead to a higher CapEx than we have guided on. So it takes a strict prioritization picking the best projects, picking the most profitable projects, and that is what we are doing and that is what we have done over the last years as well. So it is a consistent in that respect.</p>
          <p>You touched upon Tanzania and sanctioning and upsides. So if there are sort of an increase into the growth outlook, it will need more CapEx, in a way, so it sort of hangs together. But this is a consistent data set that's sort of built into 2.5 million. Then about the operating cash flow and flexibility and divestments and so on. Over the last two years, we have brought in proceeds of around $13 billion, creating capital gains of $6 billion on those transactions. We haven't stated anything going forward on what will happen with the portfolio, and that is deliberate. I see that some of the peers are more explicit on numbers somewhat, but we are not doing that. But what I can say is that there will be changes in the portfolio going forward as well. We will sharpen the growth. There are assets that will be sold. There are assets that will be acquired. So that will, of course, distort the picture and the guiding, in a way, but we'll have to come back to any adjustments in that respect.</p>
          <p>And then your last point and that was on the oil price, I think $110 per barrel, the reason why we use that is that that is the current prices. At just on the same prices as today, this is the development. This is not what we do for planning purposes. So we use different prices as such.</p>
          <p>You sort of tied that into development of the oil price outlook. Hard to tell. I think the world is off at a good start this year. Macroeconomics showing strength, I do think it's very vulnerable, but let's hope that Europe can come back in growth modus, then that will sort of strengthen the picture.</p>
          <p>Then political risk, there is a political risk premium into the current price environment, maybe $10 to $15 per barrel, an escalation or an extension of the Syrian issue, Hormuz Strait issues and so on could add to the price. And then we have the general macro issues. I think it's important to remind ourselves that if you see more than $100 per barrel while the world is at the state it is, and you know it's a strong oil price. So there are some strong fundamentals here that sort of supports strong oil price in the long term. But we need to be prepared for significant volatilities in the short term. So this is sort of to me more of a short-term concern than a long-term concern. Okay, long question, long answer. Sorry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Rahim Karim from Barclays Capital. Just wanted to touch back on this issue around financial framework and, perhaps, around the growth of the international business. You seem to be suggesting that you're putting a constraint in terms of capital that you want to deploy as a group as a whole, and that's why you're not going to perhaps deliver more than 2.5 million barrels per day by 2020. If I've understood that correctly, we should be getting towards the point in the middle of the decade where the international business becomes free cash flow positive. Am I thinking about that correctly? And if not, what am I missing? At what point should we start to see that international upstream business start to generate free cash flow rather being an absorber of CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, the international business is contributing strongly to fund the investments. The cash flow per barrel on par with our Norwegian production and one-third of the total production. So it is contributing well. Then sort of the way we look at the investments going forward, it is not allocating x billion to international and y billion to Norway when these projects have to compete side by side with equal measures, and then we prioritize the best ones. So it's a strong competition for investments funds in Statoil today and all the projects knows that, and they know that they have to deliver. So that is the way it works. So I can't give you a specific guiding on for the totality on the international sort of as one unit.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. This is Michael Alsford from Citigroup. Just a quick question on the financials while we wait for the next presentations. But just on tax, obviously, a few one-offs in the fourth quarter. But could you give us some guidance on 2013 tax rate for the group? And perhaps by division will be helpful.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as you said, the fourth quarter tax rate was a bit lower than expected. If you look at our international segment, it's especially related to that one. And we announced earlier on that there's a new law in Norway saying something about the availability then for getting tax deductions for international activities. So that is an effect that we will have now in fourth quarter, which we have accounted for.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we have also done some restructuring in the group, which we have done &#x2013; have the opposite effect from the cost that we had related to the future international <mark type="ph" /> dispossessions (44:26). So we have an offsetting in the group related then mainly to restructuring to our U.S. business.</p>
          <p>If we look at DPN Norway in itself with high prices, the effect of the uplift related to the investment is a bit lower, but we are in the similar segments at similar level as we have guided on earlier on also for that one. And in MPR, we have said that there will be volatility in that, especially when we don't have Gassled anymore here. So looking forward, it's about DPN, similar level as we have said earlier on. DPI also at a similar levels as we have said earlier on. But then when we get more and more then from the U.S. and lower tax regime, then it will be a bit lower as we have guided on earlier on as well.</p>

          <p>Hi there. It's Marc Kofler from Macquarie. I just had a quick question on the reserve additions for 2012. I noticed you talked about I think it was four distinct geographies within that one-time replacement ratio. I was just wondering how much of that was U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll not give a specific number there. But what we see is that we have the onshore part in the U.S. is having a high contribution then and being important then for the booking of the reserves, which adds significantly then to our reserve replacement ratio. So it's still a large contribution, as it also was in 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Hutton from RBC. I'm just wondering if you can give any kind of guidance of what you see as the optimal gearing level for a company like Statoil? You've gone to 12%. Your guidance is for 15% at the end of 2013. If we look at the slides in terms of op cash, dividends, CapEx, you're free cash flow negative of about NOK1.5 billion, so creeping up. So you're in between 15% and 20% over the medium term. Is that the right level or is that a bit conservative or what do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good question. From a purely financial perspective, it's probably low. I mean, we're on the low side. I mean, debt is very low priced currently. So I guess there are good arguments to increasing the gearing from that perspective. When that is said, to us it is extremely important and strategically important to run with a strong balance sheet and a lot of liquidity, because we must be able to take long-term decisions, even if there is short-term volatility and trouble in the short term.</p>
          <p>So we need to be able to lead safely through strong volatility in oil and gas prices. And it is in those that you can actually create much additional value. So running with a solid balance sheet is very important to us, strong rating and a lot of liquidity, and you will see that going forward as well. So I'm not prepared to give a specific range and so on. But the current rating is &#x2013; the current net debt level is of course very comfortable but a very solid balance sheet going forward will be the case. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's <mark type="ph" /> Neil Morton at Investec (49:22). Could I just follow on from that comment and just go back to portfolio management with regards to gearing. As you sharpen the portfolio further in the future, can we assume that in dollar amounts, acquisitions are offset by disposals? And also just in terms of acquisitions, perhaps just give us a clue as to what the criteria are? Are you looking at conventional or unconventional, existing areas with synergies or new areas, et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Some years there will be more divestments than acquisitions, and then some years the other way around. It's based on opportunities that arise and the market conditions and so on. I think if you &#x2013; to better understand the future, I think we need to look back on what has happened.</p>
          <p>Over the last 10 years, divesting out of shipping, petrochemicals, <mark type="ph" /> fossil fuel (50:39) and retail, a lot of other assets as well. And then acquiring into things that can be something big going forward. So that will be sort of the things for the future as well. So I'm not prepared to give any specifics on what will happen with the portfolio. You just have to be prepared that there will be changes to the portfolio going forward as such. So, thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi. Oswald Clint from Sanford Bernstein. Maybe a question on the Gulf of Mexico, some of your projects there, Jack, St. Malo, Julia, in FID or close to &#x2013; but you haven't quite given the volumes yet, the capacity of those projects. Could you say what's happening there in terms of what you expect volumes to be? Maybe also just an update on what's happening in terms of your Gulf of Mexico portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So on St. Malo, we have said that we assume production start in 2014. And from Jack, St. Malo and Julia, the capacity combined, we expect to be around 170,000 barrels per day as such. We haven't split it.</p>
          <p>So there are quite a few interesting developments in Gulf of Mexico coming onstream now. We are going to continue our exploration efforts. There are several wells this year. And then we took quite a bit of acreage in the licensing round the last time. And we have quite a few interesting prospect that we really would like to try out. So we are positive with outlook on it and looking forward to get going with more production.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just a question on CapEx in related to the recent attacks in In Amenas and the Arab Spring in general. Has the recent terror attacks changed the way you think of which areas you will allocate CapEx to, like in the long term from, let's say, to 2015 and onwards, will you allocate more CapEx to less or areas with low political risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Teodor. First of all, safety for our people is the absolute most important one. So we will not bring back our people into Algeria until we know it is safe, and that is the way going forward as well. But it's important to remind ourselves that risk management and security assessment is a key judgment with any investment decision and is constantly evaluated because we need to be very comfortable with where we send our people.</p>
          <p>We are committed to our assets in Algeria. They are important to us. They contribute well to production and then there is work that needs to be done on the asset before it can be started safely. But &#x2013; and then we have started an investigation, or agreed with the board that we will start an investigation, that will establish the fact and chain of events. It will see to that we take out learning from what has happened and that we improve our business. We need to wait for that investigation report to evaluate the consequences of what we are going to do.</p>

          <p>Hi. I just noticed in the Marcellus, it looks like you had a pretty significant ramp-up there despite a lower rig count. It looks like about plus 12,000 barrels a day in the quarter versus plus 5,000 barrels a day in 3Q. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about what's going on there as far as rig counts, wells drilled in the quarter, and then wells drilled but not turned on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So you're right, production from Marcellus has increased and that comes from a large inventory of drilled wells that has not yet been produced &#x2013; put into production. So that inventory is being capitalized on currently, stepping up production in Marcellus. So you're right, it is increasing even if we have reduced the rig count.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, this Marcellus gas will not be sold in the Marcellus area. It will go to Toronto. We have taken on capacity, as you know, there. There's oil capacity in that pipeline, and our gas is now realizing much higher prices in that area than the alternative was. So we are earning money in Marcellus currently.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon in London. I wonder if you could give the split of the E&amp;P spending, the CapEx spending and the exploration spending versus <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:34) into Norway and international, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, John. Svein?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There we'll refer to the supplementary information that we have provided in the details that we have provided. If you look at the investment going forward, we have said that around 40% will be at the Norwegian Continental Shelf, and then the split of what is then going into the North American and the rest of the international portfolio is splitted out.</p>
          <p>Also we have said that 10% of the CapEx in the future is then expected to be in the MPR segment. And there we have also then, it's one slide 16 by the way on supplementary information, here we have also then giving the split into how much is going into the liquids and then how much is not sanctioned. Also in the supplementary information at slide 13, we have then also then provided the exploration activity in 2012, the split between the Norwegian part of it and the international part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very useful. Thank you. And a follow-up on that. Given the &#x2013; even though your guidance is based on a dollar amount, can you tell us a little bit about the cost inflation in this, with flat exploration spending, does that mean lower volume? I guess rig rates are going and seismic day rates are going up and everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us indication of what's the volume &#x2013; how much is volume going down in exploration and in CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think it's what we have then experienced now in 2012 is a very good exploration results. We have spent $3.6 billion in exploration, drilling down 46 wells in 2012, and then adding on $1.5 billion. What we have said then for 2013 is that we expect around 50 wells and then being at a similar level. What we will then also see then now in 2013 is that we will drill quite a lot of appraisal wells to secure that we are maturing our resources into reserves so that we are then have the ability then to develop them into profitable projects. So appraisal will be more important then in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But given the exploration success you had lately and all the interesting exploration acreage you have available, why don't you boost exploration more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, John, it is a tempting question and so lots of opportunities, exploration opportunities out there. This is an optimization exercise based on all the rigs that we have available and all the prospects, and all the discoveries that we have made. The more discoveries you have, the more appraisal you need to do. So that's why there is quite a bit of appraisal this year. But I'll bring back home your advice, John. So, thank you.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:23) question, will we see a well in Angola for you guys in 2013?</p>

          <p>Excuse me. I think we need to move on to the next question now, John. We'll take one more before the break. And that is Lars R&#xF8;ren from SEB. Please go ahead, Lars.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, London. You hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do. Just one question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a clarification on your operating cash flow guidance from 2013 to 2016. As far as I understand, this is based on $110, but you also said that you have another budget price or internal planning price. Can you confirm that and can you also tell us what kind of price that is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yes, we have another planning price. If I can tell it? No. So I'm sorry about that. But we use different prices. We use a very low price where we sort of test all our projects and the profitability and the sustainability of the company. Then we have bit higher prices and then we use one price that is even higher than what we see today because <mark type="ph" /> there is uncertainty as well (1:04:31).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But very important for us to see to that we can sail safely through any scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But if you have an internal planning price, can I ask a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we actually have to round up for the break now, Lars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's just the beginning of the question, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Go ahead, one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But just to understand, because if you use your sensitivities and say that the dollar oil price will be $10 lower and with the current NOK-U.S. dollar price, then you will add on for the next four years approximately $6 million to $8 million in finance deficit. That will increase your net debt rate there by 10 percentage points to 12 percentage points, is that what you also include in your internal planning, that you plan for a higher debt ratio than your sensitivities or that you show us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on this issue we expect net debt to grow slightly during 2013. Then we are investing. And if prices drop significantly, we have, of course, to borrow money. I have no problems with borrowing money. It's actually a very tempting market out there. But everything needs to be balanced. To add some debt when you are growing, I think that is, at the outset, not perfectly fine.</p>
          <p>But the point is that we will run this company based on a very solid balance sheet. And I think you need to take a bit of comfort into the &#x2013; from the history here. For the last 10 years, we have seen oil prices between $17 and $147. We have paid a dividend, 50% in that period. We run with a AA minus rating and we have had a production growth of more than 100%.</p>
          <p>So things are changing and that is the art of running an oil and gas company. You need to take into all of these uncertainty and just see to that you sail safely and you are able to grow and you're able to create value. So we are in an investment cycle. We intend to do it. And then we have a lot of tools and we have also a lot flexibility in the investment program to address the situation.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. That will have to conclude this Q&amp;A session. We'll have a short break. There will be refreshments outside at the gallery, and we will reconvene again at 2:00 P.M. So I'll ask everybody to please be here on time in respect of the audio and webcast audiences.
