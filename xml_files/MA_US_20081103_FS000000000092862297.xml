          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the third quarter 2008 MasterCard earnings conference call.  My name is Stacy and I will be your conference moderator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stacy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today either by phone or webcast for a discussion about our third quarter 2008 financial results. With me on the call today are Bob Selander, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tara Maguire, our Corporate Controller. Following comments by Bob and Martina highlighting some key points about the business environment and our third quarter results, we will open up the call for your questions.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com.  The earnings release and slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier today.  A replay of this call will be posted on our website for one week until November 10.</p>
          <p>Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance.  Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today.  Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to Bob Selander.  Bob?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Barbara, and good afternoon everyone.  I'd like to start out by saying how proud we are that in the current economic situation, we have been able to deliver another strong quarter of earnings results.  We saw net revenue growth of over 23% and I'm particularly pleased that we were able to post a 41% operating margin for the quarter, an 8.4 percentage point increase over last year excluding our litigation settlement.</p>
          <p>However, it is the economic situation that everyone is interested in.  I'm going to leave the discussion of our third quarter results to Martina and begin by focusing on what we are seeing in our business.  The current economic crisis is like no other that we've seen.  When we faced the last economic downturn in the United States, we saw employment begin to rise.  Housing was driving the recovery. The financial institutions were in good shape. The financial markets were functioning, and there was very limited commodity inflation.  In some ways this time around, there are fewer economic and financial levers to be pulled.  And over the last month, we have seen unprecedented coordinated and structured responses from governments and central banks around the world, resulting in a large scale intervention into the financial markets and institutions.</p>
          <p>As credit markets have tightened and fears of recession spread, the last several weeks have been challenging for everyone: our customers, you as investors, and for us.  The concerns about a global economic slowdown have had an impact on spending around the world, primarily by the consumer.  We recently saw the US Conference Board's Index of Consumer Confidence fell to an all-time low since the measure measurement began 40 years ago. US GDP fell by 0.3% in the third quarter and consumer spending fell by the same 0.3% in the month of September. Housing prices continued to fall in the US, UK, and Spain and all of this has led to sharply declining equity markets.</p>
          <p>We've also seen unbelievable banking industry consolidation and the nationalization of others, and we're seeing trends in our US business that until now we have not seen.</p>
          <p>You've heard us saying in previous public forums that our business was holding at levels roughly equal to our second quarter gross dollar volume growth through July and August. This continued through early September but turned downward in mid-September following announcements such as Lehman's bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch's buyout, and several bank mergers or bailouts both here in the United States and abroad.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter, our total global gross dollar volume grew 12.3%. During the month of September, worldwide processed volume growth, our intra-quarter proxy for gross dollar volume, was high single digits on a local currency basis. US growth was in the low single digit range. In the month of October, we have seen a pronounced weakness in the US where our processed volumes were slightly negative versus last year.  On a global basis, our processed volume growth was in the mid-single digits on a local currency basis.</p>
          <p>Cross-border volume growth has also been slowing globally. For the third quarter, we saw growth of 18%. Through the first four weeks of October, cross-border growth was in the high single digits.  The decline has been primarily driven by a marked slowdown in cross-border volumes from US cardholders as Americans are cutting back on travel and cautiously spending if they do travel.</p>
          <p>From our perspective, we're seeing thoughtful and significantly reduced spending among our financial institution customers. They're shifting their focus away from marketing, account acquisition, and system enhancements towards retention and credit loss management activity. We're supporting their efficiency and optimization efforts. We're leveraging the strengths of our brand, technology, product innovation, and people while emphasizing the balance of intelligence and insight, risk management and cost management best practices. For example, customers are particularly interested in our data analytics and benchmarking capabilities. We anticipate these challenges continuing for the remainder of 2008 and into 2009.</p>
          <p>While we are fortunate to be part of an industry that offers tremendous opportunities for growth with the secular trends away from cash and check, we are not immune from the world's economic problems, our customers' challenges, and the increased competition we face. As are most companies, we continue looking for ways to control expenses as we navigate through these difficult economic times. We are using resources in a more thoughtful and efficient manner while trying to ensure that we remain well positioned for future growth. We have significantly ratcheted up our focus on our cost structure while making the investments necessary for future growth. For instance, we have established a hiring cap, essentially eliminating all open positions. We are also tightening up on contractor expenses, reducing travel expenses, and spending with suppliers and consultants.</p>
          <p>I'd like to stress that our global structure, the diversification of our business, and our solid business model are resilient. We are not directly exposed to consumer debt, so we don't have the risk of consumer credit write-offs. Also, it's important to consider that we do business in 210 countries and territories and over 50% of our revenue is generated outside of the United States.</p>
          <p>As we move forward, we continue to focus on supporting our customers as they address the needs of their businesses while we develop our pipeline of new business opportunities. We are already on the ground in emerging markets with the local capabilities to deliver our global product and service propositions. Payment trends are working in our favor. People all over the world continue to migrate toward electronic payments, but the biggest opportunity still lies in cash and checks.</p>
          <p>On the legal front, we recently reported that we reached a settlement in the Discover litigation.  I'm pleased that this settlement has closed another chapter with respect to our legacy litigation cases.  Under the terms of the settlement, we will pay Discover a total of $862.5 million later this month.  In the third quarter, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $827.5 million.  This includes receiving a payment of $35 million from Morgan Stanley and the total after-tax charge was $515.5 million.</p>
          <p>Before turning the call over to Martina, I'd like to provide you with some initial thoughts about our outlook for 2009, which are summarized on slide three.  We are still completing the work on our 2009 budget.  However, when thinking about next year, there are two items I'd like to highlight for you now.  First, we expect that our net revenue growth will fall below the average annual range of 12 to 15% that is in our longer term objectives.  Second, we are planning to hold operating expenses essentially flat over 2008 levels.  We still need to invest wisely for long-term growth while managing our expenses aggressively.  I already mentioned some of the cost containment and reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>In summary, for 2009 we would expect that high single digit revenue growth would be necessary in order to meet our margin expansion objective of three to five percentage points per year and average annual net income growth of 20 to 30%.</p>
          <p>Based on the recent strengthening of the US dollar, we expect that foreign exchange will be a headwind for us on the revenue and net income lines, keeping in mind that this same phenomenon results in a tailwind for us on the expense line. This is the reverse of what we've seen over the past several years.</p>
          <p>We are holding to our longer-term performance objectives. Currently, visibility beyond 2009 is difficult. But we will continue to work towards those objectives over the longer term, and we are pulling all the levers we can as we drive the organization to achieve them. Remember that our longer-term objectives are based on constant foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Also, while we feel very fortunate and comfortable with the growth prospects of our business model, the changes that are taking place in the financial markets globally are unprecedented and have certainly not been expected by anyone.  As we gain more clarity about these forces, we will continue to evaluate our objectives and adjust them as appropriate.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our third quarter financial results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. As Bob mentioned, we are pleased with our overall third quarter results. Turning to page four of the slide deck, in the third quarter we delivered net revenue of 1.3 billion, up 23.6% over the comparable period last year. This was driven primarily by strong growth in worldwide gross dollar volume [GDV] and processed transactions as well as growth in cross-border volume. Currency fluctuations of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the US dollar contributed 3.5 percentage points of the net revenue increase, resulting in underlying business growth of 20.1%.  Pricing changes contributed approximately five percentage points of the revenue growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As Bob discussed, we have taken a one-time tax-effected charge of $515.5 million for the Discover litigation settlement in the third quarter, which we are treating as a special item. Because the settlement will be paid as a lump sum later this month, there is no interest accretion that needs to be considered for modeling purposes. With respect to the American Express settlement that was reached in the prior quarter, we have already told you about the 23 million in interest accretion which is not considered a special item.  This represents about $0.11 per diluted share in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Excluding the Discover settlement, total operating expenses grew at 8.3% or $60 million to $790 million.  We continue to demonstrate the leveragability of our business model by delivering operating income of 548 million excluding the litigation settlement.  In 2008, we have consistently and significantly increased our operating margin, delivering 41% in the third quarter, an 8.4 percentage point improvement on a year-over-year basis, while strong revenue growth has enabled us to leverage our operating margin, combined with some efficiencies related to an accelerated company-wide cost containment and reduction program.</p>
          <p>We delivered net income of 322 million or $2.47 per diluted share excluding the special item in the third quarter.  Including the litigation settlement, we recorded a net loss of 194 million or a loss of $1.49 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>Turning to page five, we continue to benefit from the global diversification of our business with our ability to generate significant volume, transactions, and revenue from economies outside of the US.  Worldwide gross dollar volume grew 12.3% on a local currency basis in the third quarter and 14.8% on a US dollar converted basis to 662 billion.  While the local currency growth rate is very similar to the GDV growth rate in the same quarter a year ago, the US experienced slower growth, offset in Asia-Pacific, Canada, and Europe.</p>
          <p>Although not shown on page four, on a local currency basis worldwide purchase volume was up 13.3%, also slightly lower than the growth rate in the comparative quarter last year.  Cash volume growth was 9.5%.  Total US gross dollar volume growth was 4.7% and US purchase volume was higher at 6.6%.  US debit GDV continues to grow at a healthy 15.3% versus third quarter growth last year of 12.1%. Total US credit GDV growth declined by 1.3%, but credit purchase volumes grew at 1.5% for the quarter.  Therefore, the decline in overall US credit GDV was driven by negative cash volume growth as US issuers significantly reduced balance transfer acquisition campaigns.  This is the second consecutive quarter of negative cash volume growth due to reduced convenience check usage and balance transfer activities, which do not generate significant revenue to us.</p>
          <p>Cross-border volume, which is generated from cardholders who travel outside of the country where their card is issued, was up 18% over the comparable quarter last year.  This rate of growth was slightly lower than the growth rate of 19.2% for the third quarter last year.  On the whole, travel patterns remained fairly consistent on a year-over-year basis and we saw no significant change with the exception that there was less US travel to Europe, but US cardholders increased their travel to other markets.</p>
          <p>Overall, strong European cross-border volume growth did offset lower growth in the US, and a majority of the Europe cross-border volume was generated on an intra-Europe basis.  This pattern is consistent with the same quarter last year as Europeans traveled closer to home during the summer. While we are still seeing healthy double digit growth rates of both, consumer cross-border volume grew at a somewhat slower pace than a year ago, and commercial cross-border growth accelerated.</p>
          <p>Process transactions or the transactions processed across MasterCard's network increased 13% to 5.4 billion in the third quarter compared with the year ago quarter.  Net revenue yield, which was 20.2 basis points in the quarter versus 18.8 basis points in the third quarter of 2007, was driven primarily by pricing.  On a sequential basis, the increase was primarily due to higher revenues for authorization, settlement, and switch revenues and cross-border revenue.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to page six.  Here you can see that net operations fees increased 25.8% or 204 million to 996 million in the third quarter.  Gross operations fees increased 24.8% to about 1.1 billion.  This growth was driven by two factors: first, the growth in process transactions, gross dollar volume, and cross-border volume that I previously described on page four; second, new pricing changes implemented in January of this year on cross-border acquiring volumes and on retail purchases in the US by non-US cardholders.  In the third quarter, net operations fees were 90.8% of gross operations fees, slightly higher than the same quarter in 2007 due to the slower growth in rebates than gross revenue growth as a result of customer performance.</p>
          <p>On page seven, we show that net assessments increased 17.5% to 342 million versus the third quarter of 2007.  Gross assessment increased 15% to 604 million due to strong GDV growth of 14.8% on a US dollar basis.  Net assessments as a percentage of gross assessments improved slightly to 56.6% due to the timing and terms of non-gross dollar volume based incentives.</p>
          <p>Finally, when looking at full year 2008 total net revenue growth, we expect to exceed the 15% upper limit of our longer term revenue growth targets, assuming minimal changes in current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page eight for some detail on expenses.  During the third quarter excluding the special item, total operating expenses increased 8.3%, of which 2.4 percentage points were related to currency fluctuations. This increase was mainly driven by the following.  General and administrative expenses increased 14.1%, of which two percentage points were related to currency fluctuations.  The increase was the following.  Higher personnel costs accounted for eight percentage points of the G&amp;A growth and were primarily driven by the hiring of new personnel over the last 12 months and increased contractor costs.  Three percentage points of the G&amp;A increase was due to foreign currency transaction losses, mostly due to the strengthening of the US dollar. And higher professional fees, primarily consisting of legal costs to defend outstanding litigation, accounted for a further percentage point of the G&amp;A increase.  For the full year 2008, we expect G&amp;A growth to approximate the third quarter year to date growth rate of 13.6%.</p>
          <p>As Bob mentioned earlier, we are making significant changes in order to maintain an essentially flat expense structure going forward.  In response to the current economic climate, we have continued implementing a number of expense management measures such as eliminating open job reqs [requisitions], reducing contractor spend, and reducing travel and consulting expenses.  In fact, we saw a 20% saving in T&amp;E expenses over the third quarter last year.</p>
          <p>While we had a slight increase in advertising and marketing expenses of 1.1%, approximately three percentage points of this increase was due to foreign exchange.  So excluding the impact of foreign exchange, advertising and marketing expenses declined on a year-over-year basis.  For the full year of 2008, we expect that our total advertising and marketing spend will be down versus what we spent in 2007.  Previously, we said that we expected 2008 spend to be flat relative to last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on page nine, we generated 388 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter and 931 million during the nine months through September 30, 2008.  Even after our first payment of $150 million to American Express in the third quarter, we ended the quarter with 2.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and current available-for-sale securities.</p>
          <p>We have a number of balance sheet accounts that are impacted by the settlement with Discover, such as our accounts receivable for the $35 million payment from Morgan Stanley and an increase in tax receivables and prepaid expenses.  The lease on our St. Louis facility and related off-balance sheet arrangements will change in 2009 by MasterCard repaying 149 million in debt.  This item has been reclassed from long-term to short-term in the quarter.  In conjunction with this payment during the first quarter of 2009, we will record the building as an asset on our books.</p>
          <p>I will now hand back to Bob to discuss some recent business highlights.  Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Before moving to the Q&amp;A session, I would like to share with you some of our recent business successes from around the world.  In addition to our strong top line performance, we remain focused on delivering best-in-class products and services to our customers.</p>
          <p>We continue global expansion of our credit and debit products and our acceptance channels including mobile phones and public transportation systems.  We are happy to announce a new partnership with Barclaycard, launching the first Barclaycard/ MasterCard commercial proposition targeted at UK small businesses.  We are very pleased to continue building our relationship with Barclaycard.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we continue to expand our relationship with Chase in the United States with the recent launch of the Chicago Bears Debit MasterCard.  All new and existing Chase personal checking customers in Illinois are now eligible for this program.</p>
          <p>We continue our tradition of innovation with mobile payments, which goes back five years when we first piloted the use of contactless payments on mobile phones.  Earlier this year, we announced our Mobile Money Send capability, delivering person-to-person mobile payment service to MasterCard cardholders.</p>
          <p>Just last week, we announced another competitive first, our Over-the-Air Provisioning service. This service allows over-the-air personalization of cardholders' mobile devices in an easy one-step process.  This will enable mobile devices to perform payment transactions at merchant locations with PayPass enabled terminals.</p>
          <p>And in Italy, we announced a strategic partnership with Telecom Italia to develop PayPass enabled mobile phones.  We signed a deal with HSBC for a co-branding partnership with Woolworths, Australia's leading supermarket retailer, to provide PayPass enabled cards to the retailer's customers.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we continue to see slow but steady progress on the SEPA [Single Euro Payments Area] front.  Over the past two years, we have concluded business agreements with approximately 30 banks across the SEPA area for their debit card business, adding to our already strong European debit position.  As a result, the majority of European debit cards are now branded with either Maestro or MasterCard.</p>
          <p>With banks taking a more gradual approach towards SEPA by maintaining local schemes longer than the end of 2010, co-branded cards will be in the market longer than originally foreseen.  We are making progress in unlocking the domestic debit business with acquirers and merchants now able to route domestic transactions across our network.  We continue to see an increase in domestic processing of Maestro transactions.  For example, earlier this year I told you that we were processing roughly 14% of all domestic transactions in Italy.  That figure is now approaching 17%.  While other countries are less mature in processing domestic transactions, we are beginning to see domestic Maestro volumes over our network in Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Portugal, Germany, and Ireland where before we only saw cross-border transactions.</p>
          <p>In summary, I'd just like to reiterate how pleased we are with being able to deliver a great third quarter with over 23% revenue growth and then a 41% operating margin.  We are seeing slowdowns that are affecting our customers and we expect some challenges over the next few quarters as we work through this unprecedented economic environment.  However, we are still confident in our business model and we'll continue to make the necessary investments to fund future initiatives while being mindful of making our cost structure even more efficient.  It is this combination that will position the company to continue to deliver growth over the longer term.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn call back over to Barbara so we can begin taking your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Real quickly on two things, both on pricing opportunities and headwinds as you guys think about the longer term trajectory, can you just spell those out in terms of what you're expecting on both fronts, pricing on one side and then FX on the other? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Julio, it's Martina, let me take that. In terms of the pricing opportunities, as you know, this year we were fortunate enough to have about five percentage points of impact on our top line from additional pricing that we were able to take in the market due to the kind of value propositions that we are actually delivering to customers.</p>
          <p>We did say in the past that we believe that pricing opportunities exist in the future that is completely connected to what kind of value we are delivering to customers. As you can appreciate in this kind of economic environment, we're certainly going to be very carefully evaluating what kind of pricing actions we will take. However, from what we said in the past, our views on pricing remains to be the same that at this point in time, we're really not having any change in thought on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a foreign exchange point of view, foreign exchange is obviously a moving parameter. You can see that in terms of our top line growth, we are always calling out what kind of foreign exchange impact we had. For this quarter, it was 3.5%. Maybe it's helpful if I can give everybody a guideline in terms of how to look at our foreign exchange impact and maybe what I'll do is I'll really hinge it towards the euro/dollar relationship.</p>
          <p>Let me lay this out for you. For every $0.01 of move in the US dollar to euro relationship, so for instance if &#x2013; and these are old numbers of course, but for instance if the US dollar instead of taking $1.50 to purchase &#x20AC;1.00, it's only $1.49 to purchase &#x20AC;1.00, so for every $0.01, the impact on our top line for the whole year would roughly be 8 to $9 million. With that, you have about 80% of our foreign exchange exposure captured. We are also exposed to the Brazilian real and a number of other currencies. But you pretty much have 80%.</p>
          <p>Now in addition to that, I would like to add to the guideline that obviously we also have an impact on our operating expenses, and that would be an offsetting impact. So with the appreciating dollar and you have headwinds on the revenue line, but you would have tailwinds on the operating expenses. And for that, the guideline I would say is about 4 to $5 million. So on operating income, we roughly can see for that $0.01 change for the whole year would be about 3 to 4 million. So with that hopefully you can make your assumptions where you think foreign exchange rates will go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great, that's very helpful. And then to clarify, the low single &#x2013; sorry, the mid-single digit for 2009, to get to the 20%, that was just what it would require to get to that 20%. That wasn't the actual number that you guys were targeting to for 2009. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>In fact, what we said is that we needed high single digit growth for 2009 in order to continue to have our operating margin performance objective of three to five percentage points as well as producing net income growth of 20 to 30% &#x2013; yes, 20 to 30%.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wanted to return to pricing. For '09, do you consider the amount of revenue growth you've gotten from pricing this year to be an anomaly? Do you expect to get a similar type of revenue growth from pricing, or how should we think about that over the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charlie, the comments that we are going to make are going to be very consistent with what we have said before. We actually did say I think on every earnings call we had this year that the 500 basis points that you are seeing in every one of the quarters is actually quite extraordinary. It's predominantly fueled by what we're seeing on cross-border volume. I think what we laid out is that at any point in time, we feel comfortable that we might be able to do pricing according to the kind of value proposition that we deliver to our customers of a minimum of 200 basis points per year, and we are not stepping back from that view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and as a quick follow-up, could you help us understand what a legitimate downside case is for local currency, cross-border GDV growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charlie, I don't know that there is anyone who can possibly give you a downside on that. If you go back and explore some of the things that happened in Asia-Pacific during the SARS crisis in 2003, as I recall they closed the Hong Kong airport for about six weeks.  So cross-border completely went away for all intents and purposes in that part of the world. If you can give me the exact amount of plane embarkations and some of the other things, I'll give you a shot of what the impact would be in cross-border.</p>
          <p>Now, what I did share with you was some of the things that we track other than the gross dollar volume, which we report out to you quarterly and that I did mention that we've seen cross-border transactions during the month of October fall relative to the 18% growth that we had in the third quarter. We had continued growth, but it was high single digit growth rates during the month of October. So we're already seeing a slowdown in that growth rate. I just can't tell you how low it may go or how long it might last.</p>

          <p>Thanks good afternoon, just a quick point of clarification before my question.  Are you saying that you think '09 revs will be in the high single digits and you were therefore not changing your margin or EPS growth objectives for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've said is we don't think we're going to be able to reach the 12 to 15% longer term performance objectives we have established, and that at this point in time, we're looking at needing high single digits in terms of top line growth in order to make the 3 to 5% on our operating margin and the 20 to 30% on net income growth, again excluding the adverse or positive impacts that foreign exchange might have in comparing it with prior years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So does that &#x2013; it's a point of technicality, but I know I'm going to get asked about it and I think it is the key item here for '09, but does that mean you do think you'll be able to hit your margin and EPS growth targets in '09?</p>

          <p>Okay, but for now, they still hold.  Thank you for that clarification.  My question is the quality of your credit card user base. Can you quantify for us just in terms of assessing their quality, what percentage would qualify as challenged from a credit perspective?  I don't know if you want use metrics like FICO scores or a percentage of revolvers or a percentage of credit lines being used or anything like that.  But is there anything you can help us qualify what your credit card user base is like?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, let me try and help you with that.  First of all, given that we are not an issuer of cards &#x2013; as you know, we would not be seeing individual cardholders' FICO scores.  However, what we do from time to time is we actually do an independent third-party survey of MasterCard and its major competitors, major payment card competitors.  And from this data, we can absolutely not see any appreciable difference in the terms of the percentage of cardholders in each category, and the categories are obviously subprime, prime, and super-prime, with the exception of one company, and that would be American Express, which certainly has a lower percentage in the subprime category, which is understandable given their business model.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks; if I could just ask one follow-up.  If revenue growth is lower than the high single digits, is there more room to cut costs?  Could we actually see operating costs go negative if you needed to in order to preserve the margins or some sort of margins and EPS growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam there is a point in time where you decide you're not going to chase something which will shortchange our investments in the future.  So we're trying to position ourselves with as much flexibility as possible as we did last year. As we complete our budget with a set of fixed assumptions, we'll go back and build contingency plans in the event we're wrong.  I'd like to be able to assure you that regardless of circumstances, we can do something, but I can't assure you of that.  I can only say that we're quite focused on flexibility. And to degree that revenues come along less rapidly, we'll be doing things in terms of working those expense levers to try and ensure that we produce better results than might otherwise have been anticipated.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi.  I just wanted to go back to the 20 to 30% net income guidance.  I think you said that is at constant currency. So if we do think currency is going to be a headwind, which looks pretty obvious at this point, could you then fall below that on a reported basis, which obviously is what the numbers in First Call reflect?  I just want to be sure I understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, it's Martina.  Absolutely, if we are going to get these kind of currency headwinds, and I gave you a little bit of a guideline in terms of where we would be coming in from an operating income or how foreign exchange would be impacting operating income then you have to take the tax effect, but on a reported basis, it could fall below that 20 to 30%.  That's why we made it so absolutely sure that everybody heard when we put out the long-term objectives back in May, at the end of May, that that is on an constant FX basis because we cannot call foreign exchange.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Greg, this is Barbara.  We've had a lot of questions about what constant FX means.  And one of the things we did was we've put together an illustrative example which we're going to be posting on our website under the &#x2013; where you go to get the third quarter call information with the press release and the slide deck and the supplemental operations table.  There will be an additional table there that we've worked through with an example.

          <p>Okay.  And then just one last question, you've obviously got a couple of big lawsuits behind you which is great, but we still have this merchant interchange lawsuit lingering out there.  Any update on timing of that lawsuit at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hold on just a second, I'm trying to reflect on the timing of that one.  To your point, we had three sets of legacy litigation: the foreign exchange cases, which are substantially behind us; the competitor cases, AmEx and Discover, which we've obviously taken settlement on; and also the merchant case.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, that merchant case is going to play out over the next couple of years.  We're in the midst of completing the discovery process as we speak, and there are some dates that I think are relevant.  Let me see if I can pull those up for you.  I mentioned discovery should be completed in November, in the next few weeks.  The class certification is currently scheduled for January of next year.  Expert reports are midyear next year, the June timeframe.  There will be further briefings and other motions that we expect would only be filed some time very late in the year, assume December 2009.  So there is no formal date set for trial yet, but I think we are imagining this thing is going to take a couple of more years to play out.</p>

          <p>We have shared with you that we've seen 18% growth in the third quarter and that it slowed in October to high single digit. I can't give you more texture than that in terms of the geography.  We did mention that US travelers in the third quarter were less active than European travelers and that the European travelers tended to be traveling within Europe.  I really can't get any more granular than that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of cross-border volume growth and the impact on net revenues, Moshe, first of all when you look at our net revenue growth of 23.6%, how I look at it, take out the 3.5 percentage points of foreign exchange to get to business growth down to 20%.  Then you take the 5% pricing out, so you're down to 15%.  While then you look at our GDV growth of 12.3%, our process volume, our purchase volume growth of 13.3%, transaction growth of 13%, added up that doesn't get you quite there to the 15% so it's really the 18% in terms of cross-border volume growth that bridges the gap.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, Bob.  Could you &#x2013; good morning everyone, good evening everyone.  Sorry, but it's nice that you guys gave us some guidance about operating expenses growth in '09.  I think that was in our view one of the most important features of today's results.  But could you also give us a little more color about volume growth in Europe, especially given that it seems that Europe is lagging the US in terms of just the general economy?  Thanks</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you take a look at the detailed attachments to the earnings press release, you'll see some breakdowns in terms of third quarter growth rates within the various regions of the world.  And we continued to have strong gross dollar volume and in this case I guess it would be gross euro and sterling volume growth in Europe.  For the quarter on a local currency basis, we grew 16.8% in Europe and purchase volume grew 17.1%.  So it was quite strong growth in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Given this amount of process transactions that we had in Europe, interim reporting in terms of our own monthly data is a little less meaningful in Europe than it is when we look at it on a global basis.  But I can just say that we are seeing generally a slowdown versus what we've seen in the third quarter around the world and that was the basis in which I shared that data point that suggested in the total GDV on a local currency basis, we're seeing in the month of October mid-single digits growth globally.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Bob. I was hoping to get some clarification on your comments with SEPA, and in terms of local banks holding on to the networks a bit longer.  I was wondering if that's any kind of &#x2013; is that being driven by the current economic situation.  And two, on our discussions with local banks, it seems that a point of consternation for those large banks out of Dover is the franchise fees currently being paid to MasterCard for local debit transactions to carry the bug that MasterCard isn't processing, and that's a big point of contention.  I was wondering if you can comment if there is any give and take in that subject that might accelerate conversion to local processing.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, from my perspective, what we have going on in the Single European Payments Area are a couple of things, first of all the reality of the economic environment that we're in.  Most of our financial institution customers in Europe and Western Europe have gotten their fair share or more of the issues that we've seen working their way through US financial institutions.  Just take a look at the landscape in terms of what's going on with the partial nationalization of several banks, with mergers of several banks in the UK with the Fortis situation.  So the economic impact there is very real, very serious. The consumer was already in recession &#x2013; I'm sorry; there was already negative growth in terms of GDP in the second quarter in Europe.  So Europe is a very trying environment for our customers and the investments that they are willing to make in order to get things done on multiyear periods not surprisingly are being cut back in favor of restoring their balance sheets, their capital accounts, and other shorter term priorities they may have that they think will give them more immediate impacts.  So I think that's the first thing that's going on, just the reality of the economic environment.</p>
          <p>The second thing has to do with the business case and what I'll call some regulatory uncertainty.  And as you know, we had a decision from the European Commission a year ago December, which resulted in our suspension of our intra-European cross-border interchange fee.  And as banks are looking at the business case for various things related to a single European payments area, clearly their models are in a state of flux as they look at the realities of what that might imply if that decision stands despite our having appealed it and taken it to the Court of First Instance or to the degree it might domino into the domestic marketplaces. So I think all of those variables are work here.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks, good quarter. I jumped on a little bit late. I just want to confirm with Bob the processed volume growth information that you gave for October. Is that inclusive of cash transactions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it would be anything that we process. So if we happen to process a cash transaction, we would. Those tend to be more cross-border, as you would imagine, because there are some domestic cash transactions. In fact, the vast majority are done at on-us ATMs. So we would not necessarily see those or process those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I was just curious if there was a way to get a better sense of what the purchased volume growth looked like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should just take them at face value, which is the best that we can share with you at this point in time, and that's where we had a third quarter total gross dollar volume growth of 12.3% globally in local currency. We're looking at mid-single digits in the month of October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, so we'll just use that as a magnitude...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And cross-border which was 18%, we're looking at high single digits during the month of October, so quite dramatic reductions relative to what we were seeing for the average of the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, and that's not too surprising. So in terms of I guess my question is this. What are you seeing in terms of processed transaction growth, ignoring volume here? I'm just trying to get a better sense of how much of the slowdown is really weaker average tickets versus fewer swipes. Do you have a view on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're going to be releasing spending pulse data in the next few days. And one of the things we've seen over the last several months has been a reduction in ticket size; i.e., dollar volume is growing less than the transactions. And if you think about it, if you filled your car with gas in the last few weeks, gas prices have fallen about 33% over the last several weeks. But you still wind up going in and buying just about as much gas assuming your driving is the same. So you keep the transactions, but you lose the dollar volume in that environment. And we've seen that across several categories. In prior months, we've seen that in airlines and hotels where we've seen if you will inflation driven related price increases, but slowing transactions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a couple observations. Obviously, we will be reviewing our capital position regularly with our Board. As we've indicated in the past and I think it's even more true today than perhaps it was over the last several quarters, we want to maintain flexibility. And at this point in time, we believe there is an extra premium to be placed on that flexibility and having a strong balance sheet given the nature of the credit markets and the environments we're in. Having said that, assuming we feel comfortable that we have more than enough flexibility, then we would look at buybacks if we don't have other opportunities or deals that would require us to use that capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then in Europe, you reported you lost a couple of a major &#x2013; Maestro, which is in the UK. Is that impacting your guidance at all? Is it a material change to lose HSBC and RBS and what are you planning on doing about your Maestro strategy?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those transactions or those deals were already reflected upon when we came out and gave you our longer-term performance objectives back in May. And so from that perspective, they've been built into our thinking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one quick follow-up. I think you said in the last quarter's call that you would expect processed transactions to outpace GDV as average ticket goes down.  Are you seeing that in October?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, we don't have the data for transactions for October. We really have only processed volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.  Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked, but I was just wondering if I could just drill down on cross-border a little bit more. I've asked this question before and I appreciate the commentary on the consumer is slowing and commercial accelerating a bit.  But have you ever &#x2013; have you guys ever drilled down on what part of cross-border volume growth has come from cyclical impacts versus secular impacts? My assumption is that both are slowing but cyclical more so, but it would seem &#x2013; your analysis would seem to indicate the opposite.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have any real insights to share with you. I don't know if Martina, you have anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a very hard thing to give you apart, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Sanjay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right, and maybe one follow-up. Obviously, we saw a lot of consolidation occur across the financial space. Have you guys had any discussions with some of the consolidatees or consolidators in your customer base to discuss the opportunity or their appetites for dual issuance on debit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, we're talking with our customers, whichever side of the table they may be sitting on, as consolidators or consolidatees.  Generally at the end of the day, it's consolidators who are making the decisions, so that's where our focus is.</p>
          <p>With regard to debit in the United States, we've already seen banks sign up for debit duality, and I gave you example today of Chase's and they were already dual in debit with Chase's Chicago Bears Card that they've launched. Obviously we also have previously referred to the various NFL and I guess Major League Baseball debit programs that the Bank of America is involved with.  So we continue to work with our customers to try and find ways to give them obviously more attractive products for their cardholders and merchants alike.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, I believe we've time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your final question comes from the line of Pat Burton with Citi.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you.  I'd like to follow-up, Bob, on your earlier comments about how far is too far to potentially cut back. On the advertising side, how far could you trim that back without getting let's say significant pushback from clients?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that we can give you a definitive point on that.  I think the process is one where we pay attention to several variables.  First of all, our customers and the degree to which they count on our brands and the related marketing support, that's a result of our budgeting process where we sit with customers and we're obviously in the midst of that right now and look at what they what to get done and that will vary from one customer and one market to another.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we believe that we should be investing in our brand, and that helps us drive utilization of our products, so that's a second dimension.  Obviously, the health of the domestic economy and what's going with consumers to the degree it hasn't impacted our customers' plans will then work its way into our thinking with regards to our marketing activities to drive the usage.</p>
          <p>I think probably the third dimension on that is what our competitor is doing.  Do we keep ourselves at a level of awareness, of advertising recognition and likeability and some of those other measures that we use in various parts of the world to ensure a vibrant, vital healthy brand; so all of those things would go in.  If everybody in the world stops advertising and marketing and all of our customers say we don't need any, the combination of the competitors and the customers telling us that, if we haven't already gotten a message from what's going on with the consumer in the marketplace, then that would clearly cause us to pull that lever and ratchet back further than we would otherwise have done.</p>

          <p>Bob, I think you have a few closing comments you like to make before we say good night.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I want to thank you all for joining us today. These are clearly challenging times.  And despite the economic environment, we are very excited with our results in the third quarter.  We believe our business fundamentals continue to provide a solid foundation, and we remain committed to growing our business while we aggressively manage costs in order to drive shareholder value.  Once again, thanks for joining us today.</p>
