        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, analysts, investors, good morning. We would like to start our presentation giving you some focus to the results of the second quarter. The highlights was the approval of the business and management plan of US$236.5 billion related to projects under implementation and US$27.8 billion projects under evaluation subjected to adequate return and financeability.</p>
          <p>In June and July, from the 25th of June, we had a price increase on diesel and gasoline, 10% for diesel and 8% increase of gasoline. Also very important was in June we did domestic refining throughput record of 2.01 million barrels per day, advances in contracting and the development of the local industry. And we solved many technological problems and a new technical partner defined for Atl&#xE2;ntico Sul Shipyard and contracts for construction of 12 drilling rigs by Sete Brasil, six at Brasfels and six at Jurong Aracruz shipyards. And we have also the construction and integration of the first topsides of eight FPSOs of the pre-salt and four foreign built drilling rigs which will arrive in Brazil in this period. I'd also like to include this is the end of this period.</p>
          <p>In 2012 we have increased the number of drilling rigs. On the right, we have a picture of our deck mating conclusion of the P-55 in the Rio Grande Shipyard which was again a successful operation showing the maturity of the shipyard from Brazil. This was an unprecedented operation involving a structure of 17,000 tons releasing 17,000 tons on operation recognized as the largest operation of this nature in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Regarding the results of the second quarter 2012, Petrobras had a loss of R$1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2012 versus a net income of R$9.2 billion in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>The exchange valuations influenced this. These factors are less likely to occur jointly and with the same intensity. That's a good quarter. So we would like to highlight here the exchange devaluation, which had an impact on debt and costs for our company.</p>
          <p>We also had a very significant point in the second quarter. Sub-commercial wells because of exploratory activities, which happened in &#x2013; from 2011 to 2012 and with activities that are mainly in new exploratory frontiers. 40,000 wells were classified as dry but mostly sub-commercial. We had a drop of output and this is expected by ourselves and they came especially from the work from the work that we are doing regarding scheduled maintenance, particularly with covering the Campos Basin. The growth is most into demand production, and price differential for oil products sold in Brazil as well as the effects of lower crude estimates of price on the 25th of June and the 16th of June and a significant import of LNG due to higher natural gas demand from power generation. We also had losses because of the drop of the Brent price. And here in Brazil, we work with a more expensive Brent in reals, that this &#x2013; some of factors led to this situation.</p>
          <p>This devaluation of the real, this started in September of 2011, and we have identified in the second quarter 2012 and this depreciation of the real brought to us some disadvantages particularly regarding the company's costs. For example, extraction costs and oil imports, oil products, their high demand for full consumption has led to have to increase imports. We also had a net financial income negative of R$6.4 billion and recently, we have seen in the last few weeks, at least in the last 30 days a containment of the less &#x2013; of the drop of the real.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> for the price of fuel will have a positive impact in this ongoing quarter, but not &#x2013; was not felt in the first quarter April, May and June, there is not the same effect of the adjustments of the fuel price of gasoline and fuel oil.</p>
          <p>I'll show you the reduction of the spreads at the end of June, as I had mentioned before. And we had a reduction of the production in the second quarter of 2012 and compared to this first quarter of 2012, this drop was managed by ourselves.</p>
          <p>But a drop &#x2013; drop is because of two elements, which in its totality were managed by ourselves. We must recover the operating efficiency and we have to be very disciplined regarding our scheduled maintenance and our stoppages. It is necessary to stop &#x2013; to go into an increase in production, which will occur, above all, in the fourth quarter of 2012 in a very sustainable way. So we still had our targets for 2012.</p>
          <p>And additionally, in a very positive way, we hope to increase our production 180,000 barrels a day. And in the next few slides, we will see our numbers and the physical complement of these projects, the Anchieta, and we have carried out our planning and following our initial schedules, which is June in 2012 and we have the evaluation, which we now have. We have throughput planned. We have nine wells &#x2013; out of 10 we already have nine ready &#x2013; this being &#x2013; we will be making the connections, according to our plan, gradually increasing the production of oil.</p>
          <p>Now, to Ba&#xFA;na e Piracaba, which will come into operation in October 2012, according to the original schedule October 2012 is being maintained. We still have some difficulty to overcome to have everything ready and ready for operation. Ba&#xFA;na e Piracaba, FPSO ITAJA&#xCD; and Anchieta will, in August and October 4th and we do have some additional 180,000 barrels of oil.</p>
          <p>Extraction cost, lifting cost, we have several expenses particularly in the recovery of operating efficiency. This is part of the business plan of the company and we have been very successful and very stringent in fulfilling the obligations of this plan at the core office and we have got &#x2013; so it is necessary to do &#x2013; what we think is necessary to do, we have done. Not really and we had also <mark type="indiscernible" />. So the increase in exploratory activities dry wells <mark type="indiscernible" /> well, here we have a line of 40,000 &#x2013; a write-off of 41 dry or sub-commercial wells. In 2012, 16 in the first quarter 2011, 37 wells. And now in second quarter of 2011 we are talking about 41 wells written off. These activities in new frontiers imply the lower success ratio than pre-salt over the last few years, higher logistics costs and consequently higher expenses related to dry/commercial wells. So 41 wells &#x2013; dry wells.</p>
          <p>By type, we have 21 dry, 8 sub-commercial, 9 cancelled projects, 2 abandoned and one due to mechanical accident. By area, 13 in post-salt, 15 onshore, 2 in pre-salt. And we have two wells in the pre-salt that changed our rate to success. The wells operated but opened up last year, we had 94% of success. FPSO and on-shore work this success rate was 59%.</p>
          <p>Oil and oil products, we had a growth of 6% in oil products in the comparison of this quarter with the same quarter of last year. We had a growth due to the increase in the fleet and lower prices also of ethanol, and imports of oil products are necessary to meet the value demand in Brazil. We had &#x2013; we encountered an increase in diesel volumes. Incremental volume was supplied by imports especially diesel and reduced downstream margins.</p>
          <p>We had less oil to exports and focusing more on &#x2013; more national oil. And all of this led to an improvement in refining, but we still maintained a number of short derricks.</p>
          <p>Higher thermal demands: LNG imports. Our refineries have had a lot of operating efficiencies and were kept in line, we have had in the generation of electric energy, thermo-electric, an average generation, especially in April of 5,000 megawatts and first stream had to go from import of 700,000, with it to import of 9 million cubic meters of LNG and the price that we paid to Brazil in the second quarter is US$15.45, whilst last year at the same period, we had a generation &#x2013; next-generation and also the price, the spot market is $8.95 in the spot market. So, <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
          <p>As of international production, our production has been in line with all the events that we had in the first quarter. I would like to highlight the Cascade production ramp-up in the U.S. that should be reaching a peak in September of 2012. Also lower sales volume in Nigeria due to lower participation in the Akpo field as a result of the termination of the recovery of the past costs.</p>
          <p>We had lower commodity prices in the second quarter of 2012 that resulted in the higher impairment of inventories based in the U.S. and in Japan, totaling a little over R$500 million and also caused a reduction in our results due to the provision related to the agreement of the Pasadena refinery.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to give the floor to Mr. Barbassa, who will continue this presentation, giving us the financial results and highlights.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all. We have here on slide 18 our operating income comparing the second quarter of 2012 with the first quarter of 2012. We see a substantial reduction in our operating income. We see an increase in sales revenues due to a higher domestic demand, 4% up. We also have a foreign exchange depreciation effect. We had to use our formal inventory, particularly in the end of the first quarter, and higher costs than those used in the first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>In addition, operating costs, when we paid for feedstock, abroad services, equipment all necessary for our operations, the costs were higher given the dollar appreciation. But the COGS grew significantly and with that we had a negative impact in our operating income.</p>
          <p>Something else that was quite analyzed was the fact of the dry holes and sub-commercial wells. There were loads and off, we lowered our operating income from R$11.771 billion to R$5.282 billion and then there was also the increase of COGS due to higher sales volume on domestic market, sales from inventories acquired at higher costs and the foreign exchange effect.</p>
          <p>Net income as you can see on the following slide was also impacted. The effect was relating to the exchange variation and the dollar appreciation, since we have quite an exposure to this currency. However, in the long-term, we have a hedge operation. We had some of a reduction of our operating income and our financial expenses of R$6.4 billion due to the foreign exchange depreciation on our debt. As you can see, tax rate also impacted our results and that's included in our financial results, a part that is in the hands of the minority shareholders of Petrobras.</p>
          <p>And that, all of that together, the operating income, financial results, the equity income, all taxes, and minority interests led to a net income of negative R$1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>On the following slide, we see a comparison of the E&amp;P segment, the year-on-year comparison second quarter of &#x2013; actually, the second quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2012, we see our operational results and we see higher operational costs that somewhat impacted the operating income for this period.</p>
          <p>Higher domestic oil prices due to the depreciation of the real, lower level of domestic oil production, as well as the higher maintenance costs and well interventions partially offset by lower government take. We also had increase in geology, geophysics and dry holes and commercial wells expenses. So we had operating expenses linked to those dry wells and sub-commercial wells. So that we can see the operating results fell from R$18 billion to R$16.172 billion.</p>
          <p>In the downstream segment, we already had a loss in the first quarter, and that result was worsened. We can see basically higher sales prices only at the end of the quarter. Lower oil and oil products exports, domestic oil production channeled to supply the Brazilian domestic market. We have to import new products and that entails more tariffs, taxes, et cetera. That worsened the situation. We had a loss of R$7.1 billion in our operating income, which was negative, and it went down a little bit further to R$9.968 billion. And also higher level of acquisition costs, internal transfer prices and sales of inventories acquired at higher costs, all of that led do this worsening in the downstream operating income results.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about the domestic output of oil products. We had excellent results in our oil products output. Increase in oil products output due to a higher throughput as a result of higher operational availability and higher utilization in conversion and quality units, lower operating costs of this segment had an excellent performance, and we can see the throughput and utilization factor in refining costs.</p>
          <p>Moving on, let's look at our debt. Our debt level grew, but when we look at the net debt over net capitalization, which is the [cost curve], it grew from 24% to 28%. But in the numerator of disruption, we had the net debt of the company, which grew because of the foreign &#x2013; because of the exchange deprecation. The denominator, however, did not grow. So this net increase is not going to affect the shareholders' value. We had an increase in the numerator of deflection because of the exchange variation. Therefore, the net debt over EBITDA ratio grew from 1.61 to 2.46.</p>
          <p>And here, this was due to the net debt that grew because of the exchange variation, as explained. And here, the denominator &#x2013; and we had a cash volume here [one year old], we ended up with an effect on the operating profit, it also dropped. So we can see the impact of the net debt over EBITDA and net debt over net capitalization but again the reasons were explained. The second quarter of 2012 had weaker results but they do not reflect the expectations for the remaining quarters. Our divestment plans continue, as targeted.</p>
          <p>We intend to maintain our debt indicators, leverage indicators and the &#x2013; our leverage limits established on the 2012-2016 Business and Management Plan.</p>
          <p>I will give the floor back to Maria das Gracas as we talk about our investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Barbassa. As for our investments in the second half of 2012, we'll have a realization in reals, which is higher in dollars compared to the first half, R$38.7 billion to be invested in the second &#x2013; in the first half of 2012. How are we going to invest that amount of money? We are devoted to not delaying all our projects. We have to have absolute capital discipline. We actually intend to have a higher CapEx than what was initially intended, though that requires a lot of devotion in commitment by our financial team. For exploration and production, we grew by 7% the investment for this quarter. But the investments have to be followed by even more discipline. The projects in our portfolio are being accelerated in terms of their completion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, that's my final message to you in this webcast. I have to tell you that we are disclosing our quarterly results, particularly because our net income was negative, we'll sustain incremental loss in the second quarter. Traditionally, in Petrobras, the CEO of the company would not come to &#x2013; for a teleconference for the quarterly results, but I am here today together with my officers and my staff to explain these negative results.</p>
          <p>I have my word and my attitude to support me and to tell you that I am truly convinced that we will achieve the expected results in the next quarters &#x2013; in the coming years. I believe &#x2013; I am convinced that one of the factors that negatively influenced the net income and this result &#x2013; well, there were many factors but they are less likely to happen again jointly. And most of all, I believe the company &#x2013; I believe in the company that I am leading. I believe in the strength of our people. We have qualified people. We know how to work. We know how to operate. We have invested our longer history billions of dollars in our development and we know what we are doing.</p>
          <p>Our results are absolutely true and legitimate. This year, we've had frequent, new discoveries. We are working strongly towards capital discipline, towards the completion of projects. We are very dedicated to improving the profitability of our company and to boost the production of oil and gas and to give the expected results to our shareholders. Thank you very much for listening.</p>

Each analyst or investor will be allowed two questions only. Please ask your questions &#x2013; with your questions together, you will be answered. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for the call. I have two questions. The first is related to the diesel price. With the last price increase of diesel where it was was positive. You had announced another price increase a little bit before. I would like to understand, how was that decision made? We know you are committed to quality, you also have a business plan focusing on quality, but we'll also understand that there is a political element there, so the last diesel price increase was due to <mark type="indiscernible" />, did the government finally understand that you take up the prices or was that due to a low inflation rates that gives you more space to increase the price. Can we expect other price increases until the end of the year given the differences in parity with the domestic prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Marcus. Petrobras increase supplies, but what we have done is systematically talk with and show our stakeholders the passing on the price increases to consumers. This has been done systematically over the past few years. This is the true demonstration of a need that we have to pass on our cost increases. Our Board members recommended that we follow some guidelines and this is what we did.</p>
          <p>In the last Board meeting, just last week, we presented the outlook for 2012. And again, we thought that there was a mismatch between international prices and domestic prices. And once again, we talked about the effect on the cash of the company. Definitely, the price increase was led by Petrobras. I don't know what the government was thinking about but it was a decision made by Petrobras. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My second question has to do with your debt level, how much do you intend to fund during the year? The operating profit maximum inflection point? But I would like to know if that will impact the company's will to have more funding activities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcus, we're going to fund around $3 billion a year. Most of it has been raised this year. But it won't happen necessarily every year. We are working with a considerable cash surplus. We have to adapt to market movements. As you'll see that any of these elements will impact our ability to raise funds. The results of this quarter will not impact our fundraising ability more than what happened in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our plan shows that the company will be producing a positive cash flow, already considering the investments until 2016. We are working currently with funds already raised; the company's very healthy financially and build a very strong and positive outlook and the expectation of a growing production and exploration. So, I do not think that our fundraising capability will be impacted just because of the results of this quarter. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Caio Carvalhal from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question has to do with write-off with the dry wells. I would like to know, why did the company decide to do this? Have you got any plan regarding before that this should be done, 2009, 2012, so what was the reason for a decision to write off so many in this quarter instead of doing it more gradually. And also, there is a trend to focus more in the third quarter. So, my question is to whether in the fourth quarter of 2012, there might be an increase of this number or do you think that this is the heaviest posting or the larger posting or do you think now it can move off? And then, also my other question regarding the debt, the two indicators on slide 23, debt equity and net debt of EBITDA, what about the second half of the strategic plan, the current one, 2014, 2015 or up to 2016, what is going to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Well, first of all, what about our flexibility regarding wells not &#x2013; dry wells in 2012; this has to do with the evaluation plans as you have in well, which drives up and then you have plans, so clearly new ones. You don't write-off the dry one immediately according to the profitability of the economic activity or not; some can be recovered, some not.</p>
          <p>And now in the second quarter 2012, there will be, let's say, atypical focus of wells that were not in fact and had dried up and Petrobras has a great number of drilling rigs on new frontiers. According to what has been published and although the new wells have more expensive logistic costs, so individually these costs are higher. Your second question has to do with the production through the end of this year, although we have not given you the detail of our throughput, the result of the second quarter had been atypical. We do not consider that this means in the fourth quarter of 2012, we will have a higher number.</p>
          <p>Well, in question to sensitivity, we are very sensitive to the flexibility and 41 wells have been already written off. They had to be written off and were written off and this is important for our accounting reasons and we have fulfilled our obligation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in view of the devaluation of the real, this is available which accompanies the economy from a structural point of view and a more depreciated real creates a buffer for the future for leverage, but besides that in the next two years, we have a scheduled investment for the company. So, this must be done. Graph 1 and 2.</p>
          <p>And finally, but not &#x2013; last but least, the question of price parity is important. So, these elements will be realized within the proposed leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Paula Kovarsky, Ita&#xFA; Corretora. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions, perhaps a follow up of the previous questions. First of all, with dry wells, I understand that there has been a concentration of projects, which we considered non-economic and this seems obviously that there was some blocks were given back to the regulator. I would like to understand whether it is reasonable to think whether the number of blocks to be given back should have a higher average from now on that we have four years with no auction and so we just have some confessions coming to the end of the exploration phase or new phase of evaluation and that says there's nothing new coming along. So, it might be reasonable to admit that the level of dry well should increase. It is clear that $2.7 million will not recurred, let's say, this quarter but I'd like to understand what is the reasonable level of dry wells that you could think from now on, therefore concluded the average of previous years might be a little bit conservative assumption because of the &#x2013; due to the lack of auctions.</p>
          <p>The second regarding the question of debt. You all said in the previous call and in the presentation of the results, that there will be a series of initiatives to try and release cash because of some other things that you were going to try and do to try and support auto finance and investment plan. I'd like to understand whether in this quarter if there is some benefits from these initiatives and if you manage to &#x2013; will you manage to do something by the end of the year so to release this indebtedness load because you are very close to the investment grade. So what are you thinking about &#x2013; can you &#x2013; will you be able to reduce the CapEx during the year. So what are you thinking about in terms of indebtedness, in terms of end of 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with regard to your questions, first of all, the dry wells &#x2013; in fact, the write-off of wells with the conclusion of the drilling of some new wells, this has nothing to do with the fact that we are not having new auctions. This was the work, which was completely within our plan and in our exploratory portfolio and opportunities within the best techniques from that part according to the exploratory success which we have had before outside of the cartel's controls, well above the average of the industry.</p>
          <p>The barrel will probably reach, I think, he said $2, but we have a volume of wells and we have controlled it that economically &#x2013; did not support a good throughput plan so the solution was to give them back a high number of rigs also and some of the basins of Santos and one at Amazonas, we had mechanical problem which led to the abandonment of this well. This is why we had a concentration in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As you had mentioned from the level that you should have ahead of us, we will have the same level as when &#x2013; which we had during 2011, normal at the level of the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say if I can remember the question a little bit. So it's reasonable not to think that this return of dry wells is not going to involve more capital. So following everything which has been said regarding the new investment plan and clearly a greater degree of objectivity on exploratory campaign where &#x2013; with greater success. So it would have been reasonable to think that this is a reflection of a greater objectivity of the company or focusing on the areas that have a greater probability of growing short-term and perhaps changing the former position &#x2013; the impression that we had with &#x2013; to abandon the wells at the last minute. Well, is it reasonable to think like that, does that make sense to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we will follow writing-off the wells according to accounting standards. The possibility of developing production &#x2013; greater production short and medium-term is what we will do. Today, we will focus on the increase in a sustainable way if it allows us to have a greater probability of success with wells, we will do this. Well, we always have our mind on success, but also the impact this will have on our results, and with same priority. So, company need to invest as we are investing and which is recovering confidence in production maintenance to be able to take a leap forward as from the end of next year.</p>
          <p>We hope to maintain this production in a sustained way and managing the drive &#x2013; well, we've also talked of this strategy and planning first of the new frontiers. This number would not &#x2013; it's in our accounting standards and has a very important effect on the net results of the company and in our success plans. So, we will step up our actions. Thank you, Paula.</p>

          <p>Well, regarding the debt, Paula, the investments regardless of the demand and we hope to be successful by the end of the year. And to start with the question on divestments, there's relatively optimization of our invested capital and our &#x2013; we have two cases of our working capital. We have two examples here. And we have deposited new collaterals.</p>
          <p>Today, we are giving the guarantee and in August we will have R$5 billion, which will have a positive effect. And beside these cases, we have here &#x2013; we've kept the Eletrobras system, a subsidiary wise, which excludes R$2 billion. We are trying hard to sell this case. And as of the 1, of September, we will be giving guarantees to Eletrobras, so we can allow that this volume of working capital employed will be well done.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Auro Rozenbaum from Bradesco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I would like to go back again to the dry and sub-commercial wells that were written-off. You gave some explanations and you said that everything was according to the regular policies of the company et cetera. So, what will you observe, if you clear fact, if the potential increase of these write-offs of dry wells and your sub-commercial wells in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we look at the CapEx of the company, some years ago, the results were for significant increased in that element. This quite suggests the fact by the amount of new discoveries. So, everything seems to be according to the routine of the company.</p>
          <p>In completing the information that we have and the explanations that we've received, it seems fair to assume that we are now going to follow to another level of drives or written-off to follow the increase of E&amp;P activity. And more than that, we should expect an increase in the costs of the exploratory activities, given the new frontiers and also the best in complexity challenges that were brought to Petrobras by the pre-salt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, there's one point that is still not clear to me, whether we reached a new level of well write-offs, do you think that this is the first segment that will reach a new level of write-offs of wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Auro, it is not true that we reached a level that will be perpetuated or that will be repeated after the second quarter of 2012. For sure, we can manage the portfolio that we have ahead of us in Petr&#xF3;leo. But we won't have as highlighted by Silva Gra&#xE7;as in her previous answer, a higher risk associated with the wells that are being drilled, which is to minimize the amount of wells that have been written-off or they were written-off in this past quarter.</p>
          <p>Now as for wells drilled in previous quarters, as we have said, this quarter had concentrations of dry wells and sub-commercial wells, but this is not expected to be repeated in the coming quarters. So, we are in a good position to manage our write-offs. So, that &#x2013; if we don't have an accumulation in one given quarter, it happened in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any way &#x2013; have you considered any way &#x2013; of helping analysts &#x2013; helping analysts analyze the portfolio of the company and help analysts &#x2013; have given to prevent this kind of event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Auro, I do not know any company that will give the analysts details about their portfolio of wells that have been drilled and that &#x2013; are being drilled &#x2013; that are being drilled and that will be drilled. We already give more detail than the rest of the industry.</p>
          <p>We indicated which were the wells that were written off, as was the case this quarter. Now you can &#x2013; you can do your research and you can read everything that is public information in our results. Historically, our yield is high, it will remain high, but when we have room to manage what's coming ahead, so as to avoid &#x2013; and we don't expect it to have such a confrontation of write-offs as well in the coming quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have to describe a valuation point that you can read.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is &#x2013; actually, if I'd like to ask it &#x2013; could you give us more comments and details on this phenomenon that happened in the second quarter in the area of gas and energy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is divided in two parts. Higher needs to import gas and the increase in prices. I understand that part of the energy was bought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd like you to elaborate on that, what do you expect for the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2012, we had an increase in export prices compared to the previous quarter and year-on-year with higher &#x2013; we had to buy LNG at bad prices to supply geothermo electric power plants and the prices of them &#x2013; of LNG increased a lot, because of the need of Japan to buy a lot of LNG.</p>
          <p>So, if you compare with the price of the past quarter and of the same quarter of last year, the significant price increases were atypical. And between import, we import more &#x2013; well, we import a lot more LNG and that will added to &#x2013; it to spend more than R$600 million additional to what we have spent in the same quarter of last year. But now, prices are stabilizing. LNG has been filled at, I think $13. And the energy prices are varying too.</p>
          <p>And we have to consider the middle-market conditions. We are now [smaller] than 960 megawatts. All of the effects that we expected in the second half of the year are generated in the &#x2013; for the coming quarters.</p>

          <p>In the third quarter of 2012, we're expecting much lower energy generation.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What can we do to reduce our exposure to the energy markets?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a strong growth in the electricity industry, after the generators &#x2013; more than we can expect, how much energy we can expect, but certainly days before. So, we are working with the regulatory agency as well and the goal is to have lower exposure. We have a commitment of energy generation but we need more predictability by the energy industry business than with the national electricity operator and with the conflict of the monitoring of the electrical system.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question is &#x2013; I'd like to understand what is leading to an increase in the depreciation for a barrel of oil produced domestically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had an increase of R$3 per barrel to R$16, around R$16 per barrel.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's leading to this? Well, my second question has to do with the balance sheet. A lot of people have asked about it, many answers have been given. But unfortunately, we feel a little bit uncomfortable, because in the past we used to hear production is going to grow, but in practice, it didn't. We want to understand whether production is going to be weaker or stronger in the future?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't really know what's going to happen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What can the management of the company do to give us a little safe margin in the balance sheet in terms what we can expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gustavo, before I give the floor to Barbassa, I would like to make a comment. I'd like to talk again about the dry holes and the exploratory policy of the company. In the foreseeable future for the [nominal] wells that this campaign that is underway and despite of our business plan, we have a very strict follow up well by well. We are following the movement of each drilling rig.</p>
          <p>Our oil production will accelerate as set forth in our business plan. So, just to mention the Plan B, because that's Plan A. But we have &#x2013; really you are in an exploratory campaign, you have to deal with dry holes, so it's part of our business.</p>
          <p>At the moment, we also have a dry well. At the moment, we calculate that the well is dry, we have to manage that and we are managing these dry holes and sub-commercial wells. Since December of last year and January of this year, we've seen a higher number of dry holes.</p>
          <p>We've gotten indication that we have to work in a more focused area in managing these dry wells. For the write-off that we are going to have in the next quarter, is practically already defined, but from then on in the fourth quarter of this year and for next year, we have to be managing the dry holes of sub-commercial wells so that the impact will be lower. We also have the PROEF operating efficiency improvement program. The PROEF is going to be launched in September, I believe in the first week of September and it is a clear indication that we will make this kind of truth to follow up a lot more detailed. We will be informing you step by step. We want to get money from the table and put it in the results of the company.</p>
          <p>Our management wants to have more predictability. And we have to figure out how many dry wells we can support in our business and management plan. And again I mentioned before, operating efficiency improvement program that will increase the profitability of the company and which is our operating expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I &#x2013; I'd like to do a follow-up question. How are you accounting for the dry wells or dry holes? In my view, the cash flow has been used, the investment has been made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A dry hole is just an indication that something that has already been done, to now work out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually this is a fab business that also has a good business, because you are taking risks to find things that in the long run will increase the market cap of the company. So, I have a management question. Some things are under control by you, something tell us and seems to be under control and sometimes they're not. Will this operating efficiency improvement program indicate the management action?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, it is a program that will indicate clearly where we're looking for higher efficiency. Not just Petrobras, but other efficiency programs as well. But we will indicate how we can optimize costs and how we can work step by step. We have it in the E&amp;P, energy, in gas, downstream and distribution company, there are a number of segments where we can work better, where we can use new interfaces to develop the businesses of these segments. This efficiency program is quite interesting. We are working on it, to make a very clear in [Brazil] where we want to get, and how to get there over the years, because it's not something that is done overnight. And this is management. Purely and simply it is management. Gustavo?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not that we have the dry well and we are going to neglect it in a given quarter. Now, if we find a dry well in a certain quarter, we will take it to the management that will go processed, that we'll decide whether I'm going to write that well off now or later. This is the kind of management decision.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. In fact, I have two questions. The first is &#x2013; in the first slide, you showed complete process of the operation. Can you tell us about the guidance for October 2013, there's a clear chance that that the units will be installed. Will it be finished beforehand the <mark type="indiscernible" /> this has happened. So, do you think this will advance in plan.</p>
          <p>The second question. There are some confirmations here, one of them still regarding the write-off of projects in the dry wells. In the projects that have been cancelled, whether the crossover would be investment plan? And on the asset sold, what is going to be invested in Brazil, and also the investment plans of recent visit of the President of Venezuela to Brazil. So, it was something you talked about and the project of your refinery and I'd like to know how this plan is developing. And in this quarter vis-&#xE0;-vis the negative results, we have had no dividends paid out. It there are any forecasts of this dividend payout will be handed out or will we have a rule regarding the payout, and so the payout of dividends will be much less than last year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the deck mating of the P-55 was back concluded in the Rio Grande. We say that the deck mating will refill several loading of modules, which are being prepared and on schedule, so according to schedule. So, that forecasts of the first oil by next year, September 2013, continues to hold, but will not be bought forward, that is the reality.</p>
          <p>Regarding the write-off of the wells, there's no relationship between investment and the write-off. There is no tie, no correlation, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I was in Brazil at the meeting of Mercosur and I was able to talk to the President of PDVSA and they maintained the position of an interest of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> to have a stake in the refinery, and they have until November this year to define what their share would be. And they have to make feasible their guarantees of this dividend. And there is nothing to do here. It is their issue. So, at the right time, they will solve this issue and decide the amount and they will present to us what has to be done to complete the project. So, they will participate in the PDVSA refinery.</p>
          <p>Regarding the dividend policy of the company, it has not been altered and we'll not have any alterations. We will continue to pay out at least 20% of the adjusted net income and &#x2013; anyway, there's been no &#x2013; a percentage of the market cap. The Board has approved this criteria. At the moment, 3% of the market cap and 10% of the adjusted net income.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for this opportunity. My first question was the PROEF in Campos. Could you elaborate on that, you mentioned R$5 billion in costs, R$1 million has already been scheduled and the net present value of 1.6 meant more than R$3 billion. So could you tell us what is the expenditure and how is it measured?</p>
          <p>And another thing I'd like to ask is about the due diligence process which you carried out to be comfortable with the signature of the drilling rigs. So the AISA &#x2013; EAS and <mark type="indiscernible" />. And the refinement, my third question, or the refining on slide 6, what is the fuel price which should be too regional &#x2013; reasonable for gathering and the timing. Could you say what you'd included because of the increase of domestic prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the PROEF program has already started. We have expenditures program of US$5.6 billion &#x2013; US$1 billion for operating costs US$9.6 billion and this amount &#x2013; of this amount almost US$500 million were already planned for and in the &#x2013; visibility in the planned CapEx. So what we are doing now is to work on the optimization of the costs through the program of cost optimization so this cost projection will have to be done. We'll have to improve 70% to come back to a historic level. This growth in efficiency can be seen in the growth of output, and production of oil and included in our business plan for the next full year plan up to 2016 including using the potential of the assets and that will be used in this program.</p>
          <p>The greatest parts of these costs are associated with marine installations and 26% are specific to maintenance and safety. So from next year, this activity also will be intense. You asked how we estimate the expenditures, well, we consider the same form of the investment of Petrobras in terms of minimum rates of bbl and remember 1.6 is associated to the fact that even if nothing were done in terms of PROEF which is improbable when we consider that this number should drop even more and that we have a number of US$3.3 million of net present value. You talked about the checklist. So what increases the probability of our projects, we have already tried to anticipate possible problems. This is the correct measure and some actions have been taken. So steps have been taken to act on the yards &#x2013; shipyards and positive actions and improve our proposals and anticipate problems.</p>
          <p>So when we have technological partners, who are they? We have to have objective criteria. Doesn't matter if they are Japanese or Koreans, you have to have completely objective criteria contracts signed, binding closes regarding the technological partnership. There must be a demonstration and there must be direct ties with the IBAMA and the Secretariat of the environment as well. <mark type="indiscernible" /> done also outside of Brazil.</p>
          <p>So, what is important that all that be done because otherwise we are the ones who will not be delivering and so on and so forth, there are &#x2013; it is a step-by-step process of objective demonstrations. It's not just to say that we have done this or done that but to demonstrate that this has already been contracted, that this has already been approved so as to minimize risks. When potential risks are manageable, then we will have an action plan to mitigate the risks so as to have a better outcome. Your other question?</p>
          <p>Well, it depends on many assumptions with the increase of fuel prices. Well, the diesel is being imported and after &#x2013; well, it depends in Petrobras notwithstanding the quality which is a target of us, even so when I &#x2013; it is necessary to reduce and it couldn't work with the inventories if necessary which is an advantage, a mark that we still have to reach to have parity. In slide 6, it didn't have the cost of inputs, so what would it be R$15 per barrel.</p>
          <p>And one last question, I just like to have your opinion. Is it worthwhile having a partnership of investment for refining and not with another player perhaps? Well, the question that we are having with partners is that they add value or they know more than we do. They have to bring some kind of an advantage. We have participated in dozens and thousands of building of wells and expansion of refineries starting from zero. So any partner who brings to us an advantage vis-&#xE0;-vis better knowledge or more knowledge is welcome. But there must be &#x2013; have been some differential so that we can do better jobs. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all. Thank you for this call. How do you see the inputs of gasoline and diesel in the third quarter, reduced oscillation of the economy or not? And your imports have negatively impacted the results of Petrobras. So is there any attenuating action in the short-term other than looking for parity given that the new capacities were only &#x2013; or refining capacities will only come into play in 2014?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been importing a lot. What are we doing to offset outside effect? Our CEO mentioned in the beginning of the presentation that we are trying to improve the quality of our refinement in addition to processing. We have been reaching record levels of quality in our refineries. We have production units that are now allowing us to significantly increase our domestic production to offset the imports, these are some of the quality initiatives that we are working on the new refineries, we will be concentrating on the refining of diesel and we hope to offset the imports.</p>

          <p>Do you see a lot of room to improve productivity or not or is it just a marginal increase?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see opportunities in the new units with additional, substantial volumes. The idea is to produce more quality products to offset the imports. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all. I would like to go back to the balance sheet. There are two things that I would like you to explain more in depth. You talked a lot about exploration expenses that grew a lot but other expenses also increased. For example, SG&amp;A increased 13% on an already broad base, legal expenses also increased to 34% vis-&#xE0;-vis the previous quarter and this is not a small number. So you know there was an increase in exploration expenses but other expenses also increased in the balance sheet. I would like to understand just like you were asked for other expenses, will these or will these expenses increase exceptionally or should this level be expected to be maintained in the next few quarters?</p>
          <p>Another question has to do with the financial results. It's negative, but it came out less negative than I expected and you mentioned a 7.8% exchange variation while the total exchange variation in the quarter was 10.9%. I would like to understand the methodology that you used?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will ask <mark type="indiscernible" /> from our accounting department to give you some detail about the SG&amp;A expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for administrative expenses, they were related particularly to personnel. We hired new staff compared to the first quarter and also were services to third parties particularly information technology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I understand that this level will be maintained looking forward, is this a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, unless which I have seen the effects, the positive effects of our operating efficiency improvement program, which has not been included in the plan yet.</p>
          <p>I would also like to make a comment also. With regards to the administrative and managerial costs, this is a program for our operating costs we'll also consider IT, not personnel. Personnel is not a discuss of the program, at least not in the current state of the program but all the information technology side the company will be optimized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello? Again, please. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I asked also about the exchange rate variation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> could you repeat your question about the exchange variation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I expected an even worse financial results because I was considering the 10.9% exchange variation, which is the official number. That you considered 7.8% exchange variation and I would like to understand what kind of methodology you've used?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Here's what happened. You were doing your math based on the figure that we showed in the end of the first quarter about R$76 billion. This R$76 billion became 83 &#x2013; R$84 billion in this quarter. Therefore, the base grew over which we apply the exchange variation. Not all of these funds are in dollars, smaller part of it is in local currency in Brazilian reals. And this accounts also for debts in other currencies, not just dollar, in some depth, we could reduce the exchange variation effect.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Well, I would like to thank you a lot for your attention, ladies and gentlemen, and our investors and analysts and those of you who stayed with us during this webcast. Again I'll stress my conviction and the conviction of our top management in the company.</p>
          <p>We are convinced that we've got the right actions in place for the short, medium and long run. Our results are real, new discoveries have been a constant and I'm convinced we are able to reverse these negative impacts of the quarter and turn it into a positive result so that we can bring to our shareholders all the value generation that you are expecting the moment you invested in Petrobras. Again, thank you very much.</p>
