          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is 10 o'clock. I think we are on time. I hope you all enjoyed the yesterday evening. We are so glad to hear that you were also impressed with the BMW Welt. Now, I hope you would agree with us that this location was truly worth the investment.</p>
          <p>My name is Maximilian Sch&#xF6;berl, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs. Welcome to the Financial Analysts' Meeting of BMW AG for the Business Year 2007. On the podium, this morning, Dr. Norbert Reithofer, CEO of BMW AG, and Dr. Michael Ganal, CFO.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look on today's agenda. First, Dr. Norbert Reithofer will give a report on the company's business developments. Second, Dr. Michael Ganal is going to talk to us on the financials. This will be followed by a Q&amp;A session. After that, we kindly invite you to join us for lunch. So, Dr. Norbert Reithofer, the mic is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Don't worry, it will be a shortest speech compared to last year, because we said it's better to have a discussion than to have long speeches. But of course, the speech of Mr. Ganal will be longer than mine, because you are interested in the financial figures of our company.</p>
          <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, once again, good morning and welcome at the BMV (sic) [BMW] Welt. One million visitors have already visited this building. First of all, the BMV (sic) [BMW] Welt is an investment for our customers, who can experience the BMV -- the BMW brand and its products here.</p>
          <p>Our success rests on the great popularity of our three brands -- BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce -- and, of course, their products. This popularity is also the foundation of our corporate achievements in the business year 2007.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell, 2007 was a good business year for the BMW Group. The facts support this claim. So what have we achieved? Retail highs for all three brands, record revenues, best earnings before interest and taxes, best profit before taxes adjusted for the book gain from the Rolls-Royce exchangeable bond, an improved return on capital employed in the Automobile segment, and we remain the world's most successful manufacturer in the premium segment.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group has met its 2007 targets. We have achieved everything we had promised. Let me outline the key facts and figures for the business year 2007. First, Automobile retail.</p>
          <p>For the first time in the company's history, the BMW Group sold over 1.5 million cars, 9.2% more than in 2006. More customers around the world decided for a car of the BMW Group than for any other premium car. All three brands achieved new record sales, and BMW is the world's best-selling premium brand.</p>
          <p>Second, Motorcycle retail. In 2007, more than 102,000 BMW motorcycles were delivered to customers. This is a rise of 2.4% over the previous year. Third, Financial Services. Once again, this segment recorded dynamic growth rates. Overall, the number of financing and leasing contracts with dealerships and end customers went up 15.8%, bringing the total up to over 2.6 million.</p>
          <p>So how is this development reflected in our financial result? First, profit before taxes. At &#x20AC;3.87 billion, Group earnings fell short of last year's record level by 6.1%. You know that our 2006 earnings included the positive effect from exchangeable bond in shares of Rolls-Royce plc, London. Adjusted for this book gain, we achieved profit before taxes above the 2006 level, which means that we met our target.</p>
          <p>Second, net profit. For the first time ever, we surpassed the mark of &#x20AC;3 billion. This is an increase of 9% compared to the previous year. I am certain you would agree that these are good reasons for us to be proud of our achievements. Obviously, we also want our shareowners to participate in this success with a significantly higher dividend.</p>
          <p>At the annual general meeting, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to increase the dividend by approximately 51%, to &#x20AC;1.06 per common stock. The increased dividend reflects our intention to put greater emphasis on the needs of the owners of the company's equity. This -- I would like to highlight -- is a first step. Many members of our staff also benefit from our employee stock program.</p>
          <p>Despite the success we made in 2007, we must not forget that we are facing tremendous challenges. These include stricter emission standards in different parts of the world, some negative impact of currency exchange rates, and a further price hike of raw materials. Being well prepared is the key in meeting these challenges head on.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group is the most successful European car company in the United States. So the breadth as a persistent weakness of the dollar affects us more strongly, of course, than competitors that sell fewer cars in the United States than we do. In the course of the year 2007, the US dollar depreciated by almost 10% against the euro. We are moving at full speed to achieve greater independence from the dollar.</p>
          <p>In the long run, our positive performance in the world's largest car market will, once again, result in higher contributions to our operating earnings. When stricter emission laws take effect, we will be able to offer the American customers environmentally-friendly premium cars, and this will enhance our strong position even further.</p>
          <p>In 2007, the rally in raw material prices continued with further increases for metals and precious metals. The average price for a barrel of crude oil went up 10% last year, and overall energy costs rose dramatically. I mean, if we have in mind the crude oil prices, then we should have in our minds at the same time the BMW program EfficientDynamics, thus, if you look ahead the next five years hand in hand.</p>
          <p>2007 was the year, in which the environmental message really hit home. Climate protection is a cause that we at the BMW Group have made our own like no other car company. The foundation was laid in the year 2000, and since then, we have applied a variety of innovative measures to reduce fuel consumption.</p>
          <p>We, thus, started to step up our investment in research and development earlier than any other premium manufacturer. Otherwise, we would not have been able to launch a comprehensive program such as EfficientDynamics. In the last few years, our annual investment in environmentally-friendly technologies averaged several hundred million euros per year -- several hundred million euros per year.</p>
          <p>Reducing emissions further is a key task for the future, and we want to be able to provide better solutions than our competitors. At the same time, we will streamline our research and development costs in order to operate with an R&amp;D ratio of between 5 and 5.5%. And my crystal clear message is, that is possible, and we will still develop more cars than in the past because we will be more efficient in our research and development division.</p>
          <p>We will -- I said it already -- continue to invest in our future, because a lot of investors tell us as well, "We are customers of your companies as well, and we are investors. And if you jeopardize your premium brand BMW, you will have a problem with us."</p>
          <p>We are convinced there won't be an alternative to the car in the next decade. People want to decide for themselves -- by themselves when to travel, whom and what to take along, which road to take, when and how often to stop on their way, and where exactly to arrive in the end. Individual mobility will remain a basic necessity.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group has developed very well in the last few years. We almost doubled our sales between 2000 and 2007. And despite increasing external burdens, we have always maintained our high earnings level. We have strengthened our international presence. Today, we operate 41 sales subsidiaries and 23 production locations in 12 countries.</p>
          <p>Given these achievements, some -- I don't know, I don't think in the room today, yesterday it was different -- some of you might want to know why we carried out a strategic realignment, why we want to improve our level of efficiency, and how this high earnings level goes together with our saving effort? I think you would not ask such questions, right?</p>
          <p>Such questions need to be answered, especially in light of the current debate about corporate responsibility. Our strategy Number ONE outlines the roadmap for BMW Group's long-term development. This is our main responsibility for the benefit of our shareholders and</p>
          <p>employees.</p>
          <p>All of these measures we take refer to our strategy's four pillars -- not only one pillar, four pillars. The first pillar is growth; the second pillar is shaping the future; the third pillar is profitability. And the fourth pillar is access to technologies and customers.</p>
          <p>Let me comment on two of these pillars. First, shaping the future. Today, we have the best technology in the market for reducing carbon emissions. Our current lineup includes 22 BMW and 5 MINI models that emit less than 140 grams of CO2 per kilometer.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we sold 450,000 vehicles equipped with EfficientDynamics in Europe alone. This year, we will raise this number, considerably again, to a total of approximately 830,000 units -- 700,000 BMWs and 130,000 MINIs.</p>
          <p>This way, our customers are going to save 150 million liters of fuel compared to 2006, which corresponds to a reduction in carbon emission of 373,000 tons. We are the only carmaker with a strategy such -- that has such a far-reaching effect.</p>
          <p>By the end of 2008, we will have reduced our fleet's carbon emissions in Europe by 25% from 1995 levels. However, I have to say to you, there are limits to what physics can do, even for the "Ultimate Driving Machine." It won't be possible to take this progress further only by implementing new technologies.</p>
          <p>We expect decision-makers in Brussels to create long-term solutions. All industry sectors have to make a contribution to lowering carbon emissions, including the automotive industry, of course. We accept responsibility. And within the automotive industry, all manufacturers have to do their part.</p>
          <p>Emissions have to be reduced for both small and large cars. This issue concerns premium and volume manufacturers alike, for what really counts is to provide the maximum environmental benefit.</p>
          <p>In the end, the automotive industry can only reduce emissions in the traffic sector further by cooperating, and this means that all car companies in all segments have to get involved. In response to this, I would like to thank the German government for taking</p>
          <p>such a firm stance.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group is further working at top speed to create dynamic cars that are also environmentally-friendly because our customers want both. We are introducing state-of-the-art, low-emission diesel cars in all 50 US states this year, in 2008. I know that you might have heard this before, but our diesel cars can bear comparison with today's hybrids.</p>
          <p>The MINI Cooper Diesel, for example, emits exactly the same amount of carbon dioxide, 104 grams per kilometer, as the Toyota Prius. And it even costs 5,500 euros less than the Prius base model. Which car is more fun to drive? Well, that's something everybody has to decide for themselves. I have a clear answer for myself.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we will launch the first BMW Hybrid. It will require 20% less fuel than a comparable car with a combustion engine. At the Geneva Motor Show, we demonstrated what else could be done with hybrid technology. By combining a diesel engine with a hybrid transmission, a large SAV or a SUV such as the X5 requires only 6.5 liters of fuel.</p>
          <p>I mean, from time to time, the people ask me, "Don't you feel ashamed to offer to your customers cars like an X5 or X6?" And if tell them, "Yeah, but the order bank is 4.5 to 5 months, the customer would like to have such a car." Then it is very sudden quiet in the room -- only as an example, because we have the discussion at the moment, and at the same time we have very good order banks, especially for these cars.</p>
          <p>So what else will the future bring? As part of the new strategy, a new organizational unit called "Project i" is working on completely new car and mobility concepts for megacities. This project is fully independent and even free to act beyond BMW structures, if necessary.</p>
          <p>The task of the "Project i" team is to present specific solutions already in the first half of the next decade. Whether this will require a fourth brand or not will be decided at a later stage -- later date.</p>
          <p>It is not yet clear, which alternative drive system based on which technology will come out on top. This is why we have decided to focus on a wide range of technological options. The challenges of future mobility will require customized solutions.</p>
          <p>Now, very good examples, because you have to know, a car company like the BMW Group, it seems to be -- will be a so-called large vehicle manufacturer in the United States from 2012 on. And that means you need at least one low emission vehicle in your portfolio -- in your car portfolio. That is the reason why we talked about what I will tell you next.</p>
          <p>An electric motor is an option we are looking into as well. It does not only work at a zero-emission level, the technology is now sophisticated enough to offer sheer driving pleasure. This is one of the reasons why we are evaluating the option of launching a battery-powered car. A decision will be taken this year.</p>
          <p>Second point of our four pillars of our strategy, improving profitability. Improving profitability is another pillar of our strategy. Profitability is necessary -- and I have to answer this question very often these days -- profitability is necessary to secure our successful future.</p>
          <p>It provides us with the necessary financial means and guarantees our independence. It is our goal to take capital efficiency and profitability to a new level by 2012. We are convinced that a company that only develops and builds premium products has to deliver an above-average return -- rate of return as well.</p>
          <p>Shareholders are entitled to receive adequate interest on their investment. This is a fair demand in a social market economy, just like the request of employees to have job security. All divisions are contributing to our profitability targets, and I will use production as an example today -- as my first example.</p>
          <p>The production network improved efficiency by more -- you asked us last year, are you still able to improve efficiency in your production network; yes, we are -- by more than 10% last year, despite a new record of 16 model SOPs. And for the next few years, we plan to raise our productivity target from 5% to 7 or 8%.</p>
          <p>The greatest potential for future efficiency enhancement lies -- we discussed this already -- in material costs, which are the lion's share of costs within the company. Please allow me a personal remark.</p>
          <p>Over the course of the years, the cooperation between the BMW Group and their supplier network has grown into a successful innovation partnership. We are a very good innovation partner for our supplier network, because we are a very innovative company.</p>
          <p>This is why we treat our suppliers fairly. Of course, our purchasing division negotiates prices with them. But it is even more important to us to examine their costs and, as well important, our requirements carefully together with our suppliers, because our requirements are sometimes responsible for the costs. And we have to ask ourselves -- are our requirements always right?</p>
          <p>This approach has helped us strengthen the corporation -- cooperation with the supplier network in the last few months. Our experience shows that the interface between supplier and in-house value creation offers considerable potential, which we plan to tap into for our mutual benefit.</p>
          <p>It is our goal to keep up our top level of quality, while saving costs, at all stages of the supply chain. We expect a lot from these efforts. And both partners stand to benefit. I mean, we have a very good production system. Why should we not help our suppliers to be better, if it comes to efficiency gains?</p>
          <p>Another issue in improving profitability is our knowledge management. To meet the various challenges ahead, we need highly qualified specialists and executives. Requirements are changing.</p>
          <p>Just think about the mobility concepts for megacities we are working on our -- on or intelligent solutions in the field of hybrid or electric drive systems. So implementing all our plans will require us to align our knowledge structures with these new requirement profiles.</p>
          <p>What this means for us is -- first, we want to work with the most creative minds. So we will continue our strategic recruitment efforts. This year alone, 500 new jobs will be created, and we will keep on training a large number of young people at the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>Second, we are becoming more and more efficient, as our production efforts have shown. There is no way around implementing efficiency enhancements, given the increasingly fierce competition among carmakers and global operations.</p>
          <p>But what this also means for us is that we need fewer people in some areas. As announced a few weeks ago, we want 3,100 permanent staff to accept voluntary redundancy and severance packages -- of course, on top, our flexible workforce, the 500 we discussed.</p>
          <p>We understand good management is acting with foresight. We are now creating the foundation needed to secure employment in Germany and at our international locations over the long run. We are one of the most international companies in our industry that means four out of five BMW Group cars are exported. But we are committed to Germany as our industrial base. Germany is where we are rooted.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we want to continue our successful development in the business year 2008. But there is something we must not forget. Look back the last two days, external burdens such as currency fluctuation and raw material prices will impact our earnings situation. Furthermore, 2008 will see particular uncertainties due to the effects of the subprime crisis in United States. One result might be a slowdown of the US economy, which could also hurt the whole automotive industry.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we have set ourselves again ambitious targets for the business year 2008. We want to achieve record sales for all three automobile brands. And I would like to highlight again, record sales not at any price. We would like to grow profitable. We want to stay in the lead as the world's most successful premium car manufacturer. We plan to outperform last year's earning before taxes, adjusted for the book gain from the Rolls-Royce exchangeable bond in 2007. And we want to improve earning quality in 2008.</p>
          <p>This will also be reflected in our key performance figures such as return on sales and return on capital. Our strategic details, our long-term goals, you know that by 2012 we want achieve a return on capital employed of 26% in the Automobile segment as well as an EBIT based return on sales of 8 to 10% in the Automobile segment.</p>
          <p>And keeping these goals in mind, allow me one final remark. It's not over till its over. There have been have been several times in which one of the other car company during the course of the last 10 years was very euphoric. But what matters most is who achieves the goals over the long-term and can hold this position. For all of us at the BMW Group one thing holds true. We deliver on our promises. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. You have been already warned that my speech might take a little bit longer. Yes. This can be the outcome, maybe up to 40 minutes. So what are the topics I would to address in this particular morning?</p>
          <p>For the 2007 financial statements with special regards to the sectors on our earnings. I will talk about this year, our outlook for the current financial year and the status of our efficiency enhancement program, which we initiated as part of our strategic alignment. This will be the three topics.</p>
          <p>Let me start with 2007 financial results. As Dr. Reithofer already explained earlier, we have achieved our targets for the year despite the ongoing difficult conditions. We increased Group revenues by 14.3% to &#x20AC;56 billion. We therefore passed the 50 billion mark for the first time. Adjusted for currency effects revenues rose even higher by 17.6%. We earned a profit before tax of &#x20AC;3.87 billion. In absolute terms, this corresponds to a decline of &#x20AC;251 million or 6.1%.</p>
          <p>But adjusted for the one-off effects of the exchangeable bond option on our shares in Rolls-Royce plc, as announced, we achieved a gain over the previous year of 0.6%. In 2006, as you know, the exchangeable bond had a positive impact of 372 million. We also felt a positive effect from the exchange of the last remaining shares. But at &#x20AC;97 million, it was very much lower.</p>
          <p>We increased earnings before interest and tax, EBIT for short, by 4% to &#x20AC;4.2 billion. This proves that we met our forecast. We kept our promise, but we still have for rather long road head of us if we want to achieve the targets we set ourselves by 2012. This rounds up my overview before we going to the Group's income statement and balance sheet in more detail. Let me give you a summary of the development of our three operating segments: Automobiles, Motorcycles and Financial Services.</p>
          <p>We start with Automobiles. We have already provided with extensive information on our positive retail trends. Nothing to be repeated, thanks to high customer demand, revenues generated by the Automobiles business rose by 12.7% to 53.8 billion. In sum, we were therefore able to increase our operating result.</p>
          <p>EBIT generated by this business amounted to &#x20AC;3.45 billion, which was 12.9% more than in the previous year. The main effects on earnings are presented on this chart. Once again, the strongest headwind came from currencies with the US dollar and Japanese yen leading the way. At &#x20AC;517 million, additional charge was below the &#x20AC;666 million experienced a year earlier.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we are still dealing with a huge magnitude here. In addition, we suffered heavier burdens because of higher raw material prices. In sum, we had to bear &#x20AC;288 million in additional costs. By comparison additional costs incurred in 2006 amounted to &#x20AC;178 million.</p>
          <p>Depreciation rose as well by &#x20AC;403 million and here is the reason why the investments. The investments we have made as part of our product campaign in recent years. They now lead to depreciation over the products lifecycle. We thus had to shoulder &#x20AC;1.2 billion in additional charges on the bottomline.</p>
          <p>This represents nearly 40% of our 2006 EBIT. This is some strong headwind but we wouldn't be the BMW Group if we didn't know how to compensate for this. We recovered &#x20AC;1.4 billion above all through higher retail and improvements in our product mix. And we realized another &#x20AC;351 million via efficiency enhancement.</p>
          <p>Therefore, all in all, despite additional burdens, we succeeded in maintaining the Automobile segment's EBIT margin at a constant 6.4%. We therefore achieved a stable return, despite the challenges, I just mentioned. As expected, we posted a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter combined with our efficiency in cost measures. This resulted in a strong EBIT margin of 7.8% in quarter four.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the return on capital employed or ROCE for short, which we consistently use as an internal key performance indicator. On this chart, you can see the fundamental methodology and the parameters behind it.</p>
          <p>There is one major parameter concerning the return on capital that I would like to talk about in some more detail. The capital turnover, it reflects the ratio of revenues to capital employed. The latter is defined as the difference between operating assets and non-interest bearing liabilities. Capital employed advanced by 7.5%. This growth was disproportionately lower than that of revenues which increased by more than 14%. Accordingly capital turnover rose as well. In contrast, the EBIT margin which is the ratio of EBIT to revenues was flat as explained earlier. All in all ROCE, which is the product of EBIT margin and the capital turnover, recorded a corresponding rise, increasing from 21.7% to 22.8%.</p>
          <p>Now, let us move on to the Motorcycle business. Despite retail growth revenues declined by 2.9% to &#x20AC;1.23 billion due to the change in the model mix. Nevertheless, EBIT was up 6.7% to &#x20AC;80 million. The decisive driver of this improvement was sustained efficiency enhancements which were successfully initiated by Dr. Diess. This is also reflected in the corresponding key figures. The Motorcycle business EBIT margin rose 6.5% from 5.9% in the previous year and ROCE climbed from 17.7% to 18.2%.</p>
          <p>Next on the agenda are our Financial Services operations. This is another field in which we can look back on a successful year. The business volume recorded on our balance sheet jumped 16.5% to &#x20AC;51.3 billion. The number of leasing and financing agreements concluded with customers rose by 15.8% to 2.63 million. The penetration rate increased by 2.3 percentage points to 44.7%, revenues advanced by one fourth to just under &#x20AC;14 billion and we lifted EBIT by 4.1% to &#x20AC;717 million. The fact that the rise in earnings was disproportionately lower than revenue growth is primarily due to the higher refinancing costs.</p>
          <p>In turn this development was driven by the two following factors. The generally higher level of interest rates and the crisis of the international credit markets. This was of course of substantial concern especially in the US, where it led to a rise in credit spreads. This had a tangible impact on earnings and on the return on assets, our key parameter in the Financial Services business, it recorded a slight decrease, slipping from 1.4 to 1.3%. In addition developments on our credit markets have an effect on the creditworthiness of our US customers as well. This impact is not direct since we are not active in the sub-prime sector but it does have an indirect effect since the sub-prime crisis affects the entire US mortgage industry.</p>
          <p>This is accompanied by the general slowdown of the US economy which will not fail to affect demand and consumer confidence. But one should not forget that one of the advantages of the premium segment is that most of our customers are wealthy and have strong incomes.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we recorded a marginal increase in credit defaults in our Financial Service operations. This was primarily driven by the developments in the US. The bad debt ratio increased by five basis points to 0.46%. Moreover, prices in the used car business are on a significant decline for the reason I mentioned earlier since customers active on this market react more strongly to the general economic slowdown than buyers of new cars -- new premium cars do. However, the situation is manageable at present. Our risk provisions cover the generally expected trend but we will continue to keep a close watch on this trend and in case react appropriately.</p>
          <p>To round off the review of our business fields I would like to give you a few comments on our reconciliations. This segment includes companies that are not assigned to any of the other three segments as well as consolidations between the segments. Reconciliations posted a pre-tax loss of &#x20AC;173 million compared with a pre-tax profit of 361 million a year earlier, quite an impressive swing. This drastic swing has two reasons. The exercise of the exchangeable bond option on shares in Rolls Royce PLC. In 2006 this had a positive effect on the bottom line but in 2007 this one-off effect was much lower, as I explained earlier. Moreover there were changes in the market value for some of our derivative financial instruments, for example due to changes in foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>This rounds up my presentation of the individual business lines. Now let us get back to the Group level and we start with the income statement. I would like to start with the cost of sales. They rose by 16.4% thus outpacing revenues. This was due to the explained effects of exchange rates, raw materials and refinancing costs. All told gross profit advanced by 7.5%. As a result the gross margin decreased slightly, slipping from 23.1% to 21.8%. Sales and administrative costs increased by 5.7% to &#x20AC;5.25 billion. This was due to the expansion in business volume. However the rise was disproportionately lower than revenue growth, since we took a more efficient and focused approach above all in marketing related communications. Accordingly the share of revenues accounted for by this cost block dropped for the fourth straight year from 0.7 percentage points to 9.4%.</p>
          <p>Research and development costs advanced by 14.8% to &#x20AC;2.92 billion. This figure includes depreciation on capitalized development costs in the amount of &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Most importantly however this item includes several hundred million euros for the important field of efficient dynamics, our technologies for lower CO2 emissions. After all we want to maintain our leadership position in this area. This is how we are securing our future productivity. Nevertheless the ratio of R&amp;D costs to revenues according to IFRS remains at 5.2% thanks to our more efficient development processes. Total R&amp;D expenditure according to German HGB totaled &#x20AC;3.14 billion and was thus 2% down year-on-year. The R&amp;D ratio according to German HGB thus declined substantially, dropping from 6.5% to 5.6%. The capitalization ratio decreased from 47.9% to 42.4% owing to the smaller number of projects in serious development.</p>
          <p>The next item on our income statement is other operating income and expenses. We had a positive balance of &#x20AC;200 million which represents a decline of 11.9%. The decrease is primarily due to the drop in other operating earnings. All in all, this results in a new record EBIT of &#x20AC;4.21 billion. As I said earlier, this corresponds to a rise of 4%. Since EBIT growth was disproportionately lower than revenue gain the Group's EBIT margin slipped by 0.8 percentage point to 7.5%. This brings me to the financial result. It decreased considerably from &#x20AC;430 million in the previous year to &#x20AC;339 million in the year under review. Once again, the contributing factor was the basic effect of the exchangeable bond option on shares in Rolls-Royce plc in the other financial result.</p>
          <p>In light of the development of the financial result, the profit before tax declined by 6.1% to &#x20AC;3.87 billion. Excluding the one-off effect of the Rolls-Royce exchangeable bond mentioned earlier, the profit before tax increased by 0.6%. The earnings trend results in 1.5 percentage point decrease in the return on sales to 6.9% compared with 8.4% in 2006.</p>
          <p>These earnings they are subject to &#x20AC;739 million in taxes, following 1.25 billion in the previous year. This corresponds to a decline in the effective tax rate from 30.3% to 19.1%. This significant change principally stems from the lower valuation of our deferred tax assets, which was cost by the corporate tax reform introduced on July 6, 2007.</p>
          <p>We expect that the effective tax rate will not remain this low. This was the result of a one-off re-measurement effect. After deducting the &#x20AC;739 million in taxes, we arrive at a net profit of &#x20AC;3.13 billion, this is 9% more than in 2006 and the first time we surpassed the &#x20AC;3 billion mark. This leads to earnings of &#x20AC;4.78 per common share and &#x20AC;4.8 per preferred share, an increase of 9.1%.</p>
          <p>Now let us put aside the income statement and dedicate ourselves to the consolidated balance sheet and cash flow statement. I will not go into the balance sheet items in detail, let me just address the key item on the assets side, changes in tangible, intangible and investment assets, which reflect our capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>In 2007, capital spending amounted to &#x20AC;4.3 billion, which was on par year-on-year. Property, plant equipment and intangible assets accounted to &#x20AC;2.93 billion corresponding to an increase of 5.7%. The lion's share of capital expenditure went to the production network. We were active especially in Spartanburg and Dingolfing. We are preparing for the integration of the BMW X3 and X6 in Spartanburg. In Dingolfing, we are gearing up for the next generation of the BMW 7 Series. Moreover, we made substantial investment in our sales network. The BMW Welt and hopefully, you are aware of this our flagship project in this area.</p>
          <p>Capitalized development costs totaled &#x20AC;1.3 billion. This was slightly less than a &#x20AC;1.5 billion recorded in 2006. As I said before, this was due to the lower number of capitalizable serious projects. The capital expenditure ratio dropped from 8.8% to 7.6%, we thus came pretty close to our target of less than 7% of revenues.</p>
          <p>This brings me to our cash flow statement. Operating cash flow namely cash inflow from operating activities in our industrial operations amounted to &#x20AC;6.34 billion. This represents an increase over the prior year to 18% or &#x20AC;1 billion. The cash outflow from investing activities in industrial business declined by 8.3% or nearly &#x20AC;400 million to &#x20AC;4 billion. Free cash flow from industrial operation thus grew significantly from about &#x20AC;8 billion to &#x20AC;2.3 billion. This includes one-off effect from the sale of property of &#x20AC;236 million.</p>
          <p>This strong cash flow trend results in an increase in net financial assets and industrial business of 31% to over &#x20AC;7 billion. In principle, this is too high for us. However, the high level of cash flow enabled us to internally -- refinance part of our Financial Services operations. We thus avoided the poor conditions on the capital market in certain cases.</p>
          <p>As you know, this loan from industrial operations to financial operations was a temporary measure. However, in light of the uncertainty prevailing in our capital markets, our financial power gives us some flexibility in refinancing the SF business. Nevertheless, we make use of our significant financial strengths in other ways as well. First and foremost to substantially increase the dividend payment.</p>
          <p>The Supervisory Board and Board of Management will propose to the Annual General Meeting that the dividend for fiscal 2007 be increased. We would like to lift the dividend by 51% to &#x20AC;1.06 for common shares. This means &#x20AC;1.08 for preferred shares. As a result, the dividend total will climb to &#x20AC;694 million. The payout ratio will rise from 16% to 22% of net profit, but we see even more potential here. This is thus merely the first step to increasing our dividend. Further steps will follow, in the future we want our shareholders to participate more in the business and earnings performance. Moreover, we want to plan for our pension obligation.</p>
          <p>This will lead to further cash outflows, all in all there will be three tranches. So far we have anticipated a total of &#x20AC;4.5 billion. However, due to a higher discount rate, the obligation currently amount to about &#x20AC;3.8 billion. Why are we doing this? On the one hand in order to further minimize usual pension risk for the benefit of our workforce. On the other hand, we are making use of our strong cash position today, to prevent demographic trend from having a negative impact on our cash flow tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentleman, my conclusion for the year 2007 is as follows. Once again, we kept our promise, the BMW Group stayed on its course despite unfavorable underlying conditions. We more than offset the significant negative effects of foreign exchange rates and raw materials. This is a clear proof of our operating strengths in earnings power. But there is always a but. But regarding our return figures, I will be very clear we can and we must do better. This is why we have lost a new corporate strategy and a program to improve profitability.</p>
          <p>I will come back to this later. This concludes my remarks regarding fiscal 2007 for the time being. Let us take a look at the development displayed in 2008 together. As Dr. Reithofer mentioned the environment continues to be difficult. We still face headwinds in terms of the raw materials in above all currencies. This is reflected in poor currency transaction rates. However, we are all most fully hedged against the main currencies for 2008. Therefore, a spot price of $1.50 per euro or more will not find its way onto our income statement. All in all, we thus expect that additional currency effects will be lower than in 2007.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, we believe risk will arise from the credit crunch in the US. In the last few years, we have put the BMW Group on a global course in order to capitalize on opportunities for growth and anticipate global trends. As you know, US has become our single largest market. We are convinced of the opportunities in the US they will be offered in the future over there. But today we are faced with challenges. I already described the rise in credit defaults and the pressure on used car prices seen thus far. This has been manageable so far but it remains to be seen how these areas develop further. In principle however we expect to continue our positive business performance in fiscal 2008. This means despite the difficult environment we aim to improve absolute earnings in the Automobile business. Furthermore we currently expect ROCE to increase as well in line with our company's value orientation, which we constantly push for. For reasons you are familiar with, Automobile segment's EBIT margin has decreased over the years. We put a stop to this development in 2007. We have stabilized it and now we have our sights set on landing between 8 and 10% on by 2012, by 2012.</p>
          <p>The Motorcycle business is another area where we aim to grow earnings. We want to achieve a slight year-on-year increase in 2008. Financial Services is expected to continue expanding its business volume and display a positive earnings trend. However, as I explained before, this will be against a backdrop of higher burdens and risks. In 2008 the capital expenditure and R&amp;D ratios will move towards the target ranges we communicated as part of our strategy. Furthermore we will incur a one-off personnel cost for the workforce reduction in 2008. Here the emphasis is on one-off. You already know the details. All in all adjusted for the one-off effect of the Rolls-Royce exchangeable bond in 2007 of &#x20AC;97 million, we intend to generate a group profit before tax which would be higher than in 2006.</p>
          <p>Besides this preview of our business then I would like to give you an extended outlook of a more technical nature. We will present you with the restructured segment reporting in 2008 financial statement. Why are we doing this? We want to offer you more transparency and deeper insight into our group target system. For example this regard to our internal ROCE parameters. I already presented to you the ROCE figures which are decisive for non-interest bearing liabilities and capital employed in the ROCE treat earlier on. In addition, this data has also been published in our current annual report. But we want to take this a step further in order to give you a better understanding of the qualitative and quantitative performance of our Automobiles, Motorcycles and Financial Services segments.</p>
          <p>Our resegmentation also came to the separation between industrial and financial operations. Above all this makes our Financial Service business more transparent. In this context we are also rearranging the target system in our Financial Services business. The return on assets, which was our former KPI is being replaced with the return on equity. As I said earlier, we will introduce a new report in 2008 financial statement. We have already started to apply all of the new parameters.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks on the 2007 and 2008 financial years. Let us look further into the future, setting our sights on 2012 and thus on the profitability and efficiency targets of our number one strategy. Because there is one thing I would like to emphasize once more. The BMW is a healthy company. Its market leader and innovation leader. But we still have to do our homework when it comes to efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
          <p>As evidenced by our key return indicators we are good but there is always room for improvement. This applies especially to a sector that is a competitive as, that is as competitive as the auto industry. Therefore we want to become better and more efficient so that we can survive in the face of global competition and thus cope with the responsibility we shoulder for our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>This is why, as we have stated frequently, we established a separate board committee for profitability alongside the board committee responsible for strategy implementation. This is -- this committee is where all of our efforts to improve our earning power are controlled. And we are talking about a large number of efforts because we have launched a large number of projects and activities. Roll-out is in full swing. The key questions are what do these activities look like and will there be an impact on the bottom line? Let me give you a brief overview of this.</p>
          <p>First of all, we will reduce our exposure to currency risks by stepping up natural hedging. This means we will increase our production output in the dollar zone from 150,000 to 240,000 units. We already published some details on this last week including the required capital expenditure of US$750 million. In addition we will expand sourcing in the US. At present only 9% of the purchasing volume for our global production network stems from the NAFTA. This is far too little. Furthermore, we intend to further increase our manufacturing output in Great Britain and China as well. Of course this won't happen overnight. It will take some time. But it will happen.</p>
          <p>The next major lever is efficiency enhancements. All told we want to realize an accumulated &#x20AC;6 billion in savings by 2012 on top of our former plans. This is an area in which we are picking up speed and will soon be going full throttle. In other words, the effects will be felt following a warm-up phase after which they will come into play sustainably.</p>
          <p>The lion's share, which would be two-thirds or &#x20AC;4 billion, will be achieved in purchasing, which easily represents the largest cost item amounting to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. Accordingly we created a board division for this which is going full steam ahead. In this context I would like to stress the following on behalf of Dr. Diess, the colleague of mine who is in charge of this division. We want to maintain our constructive co-operation with our suppliers. Only by joining forces we can maximize value for our customers at competitive cost. This is why we are not pursuing a one-dimensional goal to the disadvantage of our suppliers of negotiating lower prices. Instead we intend to work with our partners to reduce their costs as a basis for lower prices. For example, we are providing them with advice, drawing on our product and engineering expertise. This will benefit both parties lastingly and most importantly without facing quality risk. After all, customer orientation is the prime objective of what we do.</p>
          <p>But of course negotiate price cuts as well. That goes without saying. And these cuts are on top of our original budget. In addition we are exploring ways to leverage efficiency potential throughout our supply chain, not just at the first stage. Potential lies dormant here as well. This is why we are analyzing the entire value-added chain. In clear terms, everything that is not perceived by a customer as product performance or quality and that they are not prepared to pay for is being called into question. Once again, the maxim here is that these activities will take time and in fact will require a run-off period before they take full effect. Nevertheless, the first tangible results will be seen this year already. We expect the savings in 2008 will be in the three-digit million range. This rounds up my comments on the &#x20AC;4 billion in efficiency enhancements and cost reductions in purchasing.</p>
          <p>This leaves us with another 2 million, which we will realize by reducing fixed costs in streamlining development processes. In so doing we will continuously reduce the R&amp;D ratio to between 5 and 5.5% but it will definitely not fall below that. Investments secure the future, especially as regards environmental technology. Therefore we will continue to steer the company with foresight while strategically investing in important fields such as EfficientDynamics and defending and extending our competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>In line with our purchasing approach, we will not simply cut costs. Instead, we will look for an intelligent, creative solution. As a result, our motto is not fewer projects and future technologies, but less complexity and more efficiency.</p>
          <p>We are not just saving for the sake of saving. Instead, we try to find intelligent solutions to keep costs down. Let me give you a few examples. We will make more and more use of constructions kits for products and drive trains. For instance, by increasing the number of shared components in our current four and six cylinder engine generation from 20 to 35%.</p>
          <p>Engineering hardware, namely, test parts, testing tools et cetera, is a very big cost item in research and development. In total several hundred million euros per year. This is an area, where we have a very focused approach, for example, by refilling virtual processes in order to reduce the number of prototypes we use. And in term the development costs.</p>
          <p>We see huge potential in third party development work as well. This is why we are currently working with our colleagues and purchasing to come up with ideas for more efficient processes.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we will draw up the clear list of priorities. Which innovations are perceived by our customers? What are our customers willing to pay for? And what technical areas are of less relevance to the customers, which would open the door to standardize solutions. As you can see we are leveraging potential development as well. But with good measure. This takes time, too. Some projects have a long-term horizon and do not take full effect immediately.</p>
          <p>Already from 2009 onwards we will see a result in terms of personnel costs. As you know, starting next year we intend to realize annual savings of up to &#x20AC;500 million in this area. And last but not least we will further reduce the capital expenditure ratio to less than 7% by 2012. Let me give you a concrete potential scenario. By introducing a new painting technique in our Oxford plant we avoided making two-digit million investments when expanding capacity in 2006, 2007. Moreover, thanks to our flexible production system we will be able to achieve the targeted retail of 1.8 million by 2012 without a full new plant. Building on our existing structures, a strict orientation towards creating value and associated efficiency enhancements.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks on some of the activities through, which we will realize the envisioned &#x20AC;6 billion in cost reduction. The program's logical consequence will be the announced increase in margins and the sustained improvement of free cash flow. The objective is to achieve a level of approximately &#x20AC;2 billion by 2012. From 2012 onwards we want to clearly exceed to &#x20AC;2 billion mark.</p>
          <p>To sum up, ladies and gentlemen, we have set clear targets towards increasing our profitability and strengthening our competitiveness. In so doing, we do not intend this to be a flash in the pan. Our goal is to create value over the long-term.</p>
          <p>Accordingly our strategy is not a one-dimensional saving strategy. We want to grow first and foremost through new products, new services and new markets. We also want to become even more profitable. In line with this, we will make sure that our efficiency related activities are not one-dimensional either. Instead, we will always keep an eye on all stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Securing the future primarily translates into customer orientation. This is why we will not save on the substance or quality of our products. We continue to consistently invest in attractive automobiles and motorcycles as well as strong brands. After all &#x20AC;56 billion in revenues do not fall from the sky. Instead, they are an expression of the appreciation our customers have for us.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we are fully aware of the fact that our employees are the key prerequisite of our and for our success. Therefore, we want to continue to attract and retain the best people. The prerequisite for this is that we remain attractive as an employer.</p>
          <p>However, we will only achieve this if we ensure lasting success on the basis of ample profitability. And this also includes adjusting the head count to the necessities of our business operations as we are doing right now. And third of course, we intend to remain a good investment. At the end of the day this is why we want our shareholders to consistently participate in our company success through an increased dividend.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this was the attempt to inform you a little bit about 2007 achievements, brief outlook to 2008 and now we look forward to your questions and answering them properly. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now, it's time for question-and-answers. Use the microphones in front of you, and please raise your hands. Arndt Ellinghorst [Credit Suisse]. Okay, let's start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse. I have two questions. So, one is more operational, the other one is a bit more strategic. Maybe, if I start with the first one on Financial Services and you -- Dr. Ganal highlighted a couple of times that this is a potential risk given the end markets and what they are. Now, if we look at your business it has changed considerably over the last couple of years. Your leased assets have increased from something like 9 billion to 20 billion within three years only. And at the same time depreciation on these leased assets hasn't really increased with the same speed. So could you talk a bit about how mature is that business? How much further do you want to expand, especially leasing? And also overall in Financial Services how much of a risk is there really if markets continue to turn down? Is that a significant risk for BMW for the next two years or is it something -- just a couple of &#x20AC;100 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Arndt. I think we start with Michael Ganal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I already tried to elaborate a little bit on a risk in my speech. In beginning of 2008 we are really confronted with some challenges. Looking into our balance sheet, we have to learn that there are &#x20AC;17 billion -- there are -- the value of our cars is reported with &#x20AC;17 million. So starting the first question to be answered is, are we on the safe side with this 17 billion? So there are basically two arguments why I think we are prepared for the development one can expect today. It starts with the fact that we take these cars in our balance sheet on our internal production cost calculation. So we have taken out our contribution, and therefore, the depreciation internally starts clearly on a lower level. Second, the value of these cars is not focused on the value assured via the contract. The value of these cars is still based on a market prognosis. These both together should lead to a situation where these 17 million &#x2013; 17 billion do form the lower end of the volume. And this is why we -- despite we are confronted with deterioration we -- you could learn out of the Mannheim chart. Why we think with this 17 billion, we should be on the safe side at least. The development we experienced in the last three, four months did not lead to an increase of our risk provisions.</p>
          <p>Talking furthermore about the lease and financing business, yes the delinquency rate is going up. So we have increased our provisions accordingly. Why I can repeat that the risk out of the delinquency rate we should be prepared to cover in case properly. I think these are the two main aspects which one has to take into consideration to judge are they prepared for the difficult situation. To cut a long story short, we did what we could do in accordance with our auditors and we have to watch the situation closely. And we don't know what we will be confronted from tomorrow onwards but for the time being whatever we know we are prepared.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, I think, I had a second question I wanted to follow on with. Sorry. For Dr. Reithofer, a more strategic one. You mentioned that was interesting that most of your shareholders are also your customers. So it's very important, your corporate image and so on. And I mean, now, your corporate image not only in capital markets due to the underperformance of your shares has suffered a bit I would say. Also the press coverage of the last couple of years has been in a way just very simplistically Audi has been perceived as very strong, Mercedes has been recovered very strongly. At what point do you believe there's a bigger risk of being perceived as a constant underperformer that this is also flipping over to your customers? And I think that's one of the strongest assets of your company and you should be really careful of being really perceived as a very strong and outperforming company. At what stage does that really start annoying you to a point that you have -- will have to take more drastic steps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in my opinion a very valid question you ask. At the moment we cannot see that we have a risk that a lot of our customers say BMW is on the financial side an underperforming company. Because you have to know that BMW has a real fan community around the world. And an interesting part for me of an investors meeting was we discussed financial figures and then he said to me, by the way I'm a BMW customer. And you're not allowed to jeopardize for example the quality of your cars. And then I said, what do you mean? And he said, from a efficiency point of view, where are you in your manufacturing operation? What about your discussion with your supplier network and are you still on the right track if it comes to product quality and to let the cars have the right feeling -- a premium feeling if I go in? And I asked further, I said again, what do you mean? He said, I was driving a car of one of your competitors. A lot of plastic he said to me. And Mr. Reithofer, I would like to invest in your company and you are not allowed to put so much plastic into your cars. If you do so I don't buy BMWs any more. Then you will lose customers and then of course you will lose investors as well.</p>
          <p>It was not my comment. It was his comment and it really surprised me. But I would like to go a little bit further. Because part of your question is are we prepared to change, right? Are we prepared to change as BMW? And I made a few notes and first of all if you see our dividend development, an increase of 51% to &#x20AC;1.06. And I would like to highlight really amongst us here, it was the first time in the history of our company to make a dividend increase by 51%. I would like to highlight, it was the first time.</p>
          <p>Then if you listened to Michael Ganal that we will in future, starting with the business year 2008, be more transparent for you. That you can see deeper into our segments. It is as well, in my opinion, a very important step. Then, I think you listened very carefully, especially to the currency exposure. It was the first time that we said we have already hedged nearly all of our 2008 currency exposure, and I am using these three items as an example that we really are prepared to move forward.</p>
          <p>And let me mention again, to come back to your starting point, if I go for example to the United States of America, and I had a meeting last year in September with our most important dealers and they said to me Norbert, BMW is such a good brand, a very good brand in the United States. We love it, our customers love it. It's the ultimate driving machine. If I go, for example, to a country like China, to give you a couple of figures. We were able to increase our sales figures in China by 40%. And if I go to Russia we were able to increase our sales figures by 50% in 2007. All these things give us confidence that we are definitely on the right track.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would address three topics. First you said at the outset, BMW wants to remain an attractive employer. We had one famous departure in the recent days and looking to the annual report and comparing the board payment levels to competitors and the future employer of your departed colleague, do you feel the need to have an options program and a revalued pay scheme so that everyone remains onboard and committed to the 2012 plans? And secondly, what payout levels could you aspire to? Is it imaginable that you pay out 40 to 50% of net profit or net free cash flow of the automobile or industrial division? And the third question is the productivity gains are obviously three years away because maybe lead times. Is it the same with the purchasing development? How many years do you need to change the volume in the US to save 15, 20%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. We'll start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the stock options, you know stock options are at the moment, I say at the moment not an option for the BMW Group. But we will change our pay scheme for the board members starting with the business year 2008. I mean I said our target is clearly to improve the quality of our financial business, I mean our finance figures. So, and a new pay scheme will move towards the direction to improve the quality of our business. It means if the quality of our business is not getting better, we will feel it in our pockets, but not just we will feel it in our pockets, our senior vice president will feel it in their pockets and the next two management levels further down will feel it as well.</p>
          <p>So, that means we have a so-called long range plan in the BMW. In our long range plan are the key figures of our business development and the most important financial key figures will be part of our future scheme for board members, for senior vice presidents and further down.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may continue commenting on this question. I would like to say that the fact that the management and senior executives together did agree on to freeze the bonus level, and start with savings just out of this group for reasonable two-digit million, a reasonable two-digit million figure. I think this sending a strong signal to our workforce. And I think this might be a further example that BMW quite often behaves differently.</p>
          <p>So, let us continue what about the dividend and your strategy to further increase. Yes, 50% increase is quite an impressive figure. Nevertheless, we -- I told you this takes us to 22%. This is still far below the average. The average was 35% and we expect the average to move further up. This is why we are basically approaching the topic from two sides. We are far below average. On the other side, the management in particular is very confident about the future of this company, and this is why we said this is just the first step. But this first step is now subject to be approved by our shareholders and then we will continue. I think it's already a courageous announcement and I would not speculate whether the next step is a little bit bigger or little bit smaller than the first step. But we will see more steps towards this direction.</p>
          <p>Purchasing in US is -- this is in the background of your question I do assume. Purchasing in US is clearly a challenge. We are coming from 9%. To increase the figure is doable without any question, but what magnitude can we grow our local sourcing for the global production network. We don't talk about procurement for just this part but; we talk about the global network. Here, one argument is we are not the only one. The other German European car manufacturers prepared or already prepared to move to US or already producing have basically the same agenda, the same target. So altogether we are convinced that we can qualify the existing supplier industry to some extent and to some extent we can convince European suppliers or wherever they are to follow us to the US and to make use of the advantages available.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would like to add is if you see the United States of America then you have a car industry in the Detroit area and you have a car industry in the Southeast of the United States. The car industry in the Southeast of the United States is BMW, is Daimler, is Honda, is Toyota, and other car companies they ask themselves as well, should they open locations in the Southeast of the United States?</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we have a very good supply industry in Southeast of the United States, because the Japanese car manufacturers asked their suppliers to come with them to the United States. We asked our suppliers to come with us to the United States, and we talked, for example with Daimler, can we not do the things together in the United States to have a stronger push towards increasing, first our local content for our local plants in the United States, and then buy more components and goods in the United States. It's important to know, from my side it's in principle from the horse's mouth because I was running Spartanburg for three years.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Breitsprecher [Oppenheim Research GMBH] and then Adam Hull [WestLB].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hello. Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim. Firstly, maybe more a statement than a question. We definitely all agree that your efficiency program offers a lot of potential is needed but, I think, we also share a big frustration with the targets that you have set, particularly because the numbers are just internally inconsistent. I mean you talk about an EBIT margin of 8 to 10% and an ROCE of, now you say more than 20% -- more than 26%, yes. I mean you would be above the 26% even without any improvement in capital efficiency. And you're talking about a &#x20AC;2 billion free cash flow target, approximately &#x20AC;2 billion by 2012. You've already generated more than 2 billion last year.</p>
          <p>In London you talked about a free cash flow between 1 billion and 2 billion and you told us how great it would be to achieve 1.5 billion, so there are a lot of numbers out there that you have put forward that are just not really internally consistent. And it would be very helpful if you could give us more consistent target numbers that would allow us also to model the prospects a bit better.</p>
          <p>Secondly, two smaller questions. One on the financing operations that you're going to split up. I think financing, that's according then to the automotive business and the financial services business. What is going to be approximately the impact on the profitability of the automotive business by reallocating part of the financing operations to that business? And thirdly, can you tell us anything about your currency hedging position in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Christian. Norbert Reithofer will answer the first part of the question. Please Norbert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will give you a straight answer, you ask regarding return on sales and ROCE. I mean the answer, and it was already in your question, is very simple. If you are able to achieve a return on sales between 8 and 10% on the basis of EBIT, then of course your ROCE will be higher than 26%. Because you would like to be better on other parts of the ROCE tree as well, 8 to 10% means definitely, and a crystal clear answer from my side, a ROCE definitely better than 26%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next, Michael Ganal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you said these figures are to some extent inconsistent. On the other way, with all these figures announced to you, this is quite a courageous attempt from our point of view, given that the environment is, to some extent, in quite a difficult shape as you know. You could have started the question the other way round, where does your confidence stem from to commit to these kind of targets in 2012, given these challenges from the environmental front, from the markets, the finance markets? And yes, if you just add up one-to-one all these subordinated targets, you end up with a higher ROCE, so we have to admit there is, to some extent, an in-built provision.  Yes, because we are still a company which is under promising and over deliver and Norbert Reithofer already told you 26 has to be achieved at least.</p>
          <p>So now you continued, what about your new segment reporting, will it affect your performance figures? In particular in the Automobile segment we already have made internally a dry run and I can tell you to my best knowledge, it does not affect the performance indicators of the automobile segment.</p>
          <p>The third question was hedging 2009. Yes. It remains an ongoing challenge and having said that 2008 we are more or less fully covered, for 2009 we would like to say today we have already made some first base hedging, so we stepped -- we went forward, so we are on track.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Adam Hull [WestLB] and then Mr. Buckland [DAIWA Institute of Research Europe].</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Adam Hull from West LB. Three questions. Firstly on foreign currency. In '07 you obviously had some benefit of some hedges, but you also had some costs of taking out new hedges. Could you give us an indication of what the net impact on 2007 pre-tax profits is of those two? What's the net benefit of your FX situation relative to spot?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if I look on other provisions on note 32, I look at provisions, I think obligations linked to sales operations. That fell from 3 billion to 2.818; that's a 6% decline year-on-year. You also seem there to have utilized provisions more than the addition on provisions. Your revenues obviously rose 14% last year. And if you can talk a little bit about that, which I presume is linked to warranties. And thirdly, just maybe a little bit more going back to an earlier question on Financial Services. You tell us you're well provisioned, you tell us you've been conservative, but could you give some specifics on that? On new business are you assuming much lower residual values? Are you assuming much higher cost or credit losses? Could you just give us a little bit more detail why we should feel so confident on Financial Services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Adam. Michael Ganal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So starting with the hedging 2007. So there are basically two aspects to be mentioned coming from the past tense. We had some forwards in place, which could be used in 2007 and they more or less gave us a positive impact, a positive support of around &#x20AC;200 million, which were mirrored in the cost of sales. And on the other side, since we are to some extent, or not -- more or less fully covered, some extent was a little bit cautious, it's not according what we finally did. We are -- this refers to options and these options we put in our profit and loss, in our income statement, a mid-digit two million figure which is mirroring this option element. So then we continue Financial Services risk. Why so confident? This was, if I remember rightly your question. Why so confident? I think I already told you this is to our best knowledge what I said. Maybe you have seen in a chart in January our residual values of the cars sharply went down. So what should we assume? In February we saw, to some extent, a re-swing. So we learned from month to month that our business is quite a stable one. One argument I already stressed, our customers are not in the focus, not in the centre of the sub-prime crisis. We had built over the years a very professional certified pre-owned business. This is why the residual values of our cars develop by far better than these of our competitors. We always approach this business very conservative and this altogether it's a question of perception. I couldn't argue this is given. Future will tell us but this altogether led us to the assumption that we can rely on what we did in the past tense. So the third question was? What was the third question? I have to admit I already prepared the answer for the first whilst listening to you. May I ask you to repeat the third question? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sorry -- it's relating to other provisions on note 32. You had last year in 2006 you had exactly 3 billion of provisions I think linked to sales obligations. That came down to 2.818 in 2007, a 6% fall, a sharp contrast to your revenue rise of 14%. I presume this is mainly warranties but could you just go through what exactly is going on there. Because I noticed your additions were actually lower than your utilization in 2007 as well. So maybe if you could just expand a bit on what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Referring to the warranty provision, so I would like to start with the fact that the quality of our cars did improve substantially within the last three or four years. You're referring to these provisions and indeed they are the warranty expenses incorporated. I think on balance the provisions for ongoing operations declined because as in prior years drawings were higher than the amount of newly accrued provisions. The higher accrual is due to warranty provisions and this is basically the answer. This is volume driven. So the car part which is within these warranty commitment or however you would like, did grow within three years from 6.5 to 8.5 million cars. So yes, warranty expenditure's bought per car went down sharply but since the car part is growing and we would say fortunately the car part is growing, here you have some compensating effects. But I have to say on the warranty side we are on track and there's nothing extraordinary.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question from Mr. Buckland [Daiwa Institute of Research Europe] and then Max Warburton [UBS].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just want to ask about the marketing and development of the BMW brand. When you look at, well the first question is, with the departure of Mr. Krause what impact that will have on your marketing strategy? Is there going to be any changes or any delay? What differences you see from that? I mean is it significant? Then when I look on page six and the chart which you say shows that your development of residual values is much better than your competitors. If you were to start the Index in January 2004, rather than January 2001, then you'd see that BMW residual values went up to the middle of 2007 at a similar rate to your competitors. So really you didn't develop any better in that last three or four year period. But in the last few months the residual values have fallen much quicker in this difficult market. So I wonder if you can explain that and really does that show you that the BMW brand is performing better with your customers?</p>
          <p>And then, the other part of the question, in looking ahead, and trying to really improve the position of BMW cars relative to your competitors, you say in your speech that you want to look at which innovations are perceived by customers and what are customers willing to pay for. And which technical areas are relevant to the customers and, again, what can be standardized and what the customers will pay for. What were your findings on that survey and how does that -- and how can we relate that to future pricing, the -- EfficientDynamics, what are your findings in terms of what customers are doing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. We have understand. We'll start with Mr. Reithofer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to say a couple of words to Ian Robertson. Ian Robertson is now our new Head of Marketing and Sales, was over successful, as a Manager of the BMW Group. If I see his results as Managing Director of BMW South Africa, the annual volume was improving year-by-year. The profit figures were improving year-by-year and when he was announced to be Chairman of Rolls Royce, more or less the same was coming true. The volume was going up, the profitability of our Rolls Royce business was getting better and better. If I have to describe Ian Robertson he is one of our best retailers, if not the best retailer of the BMW Group. He has really passion for marketing and sales, it is his real passion and you ask me regarding marketing strategy. I mean I had a discussion with Ian Robertson and I said to him, 'you need your own organization'. 'You need your own people, that means first line management, and you do exactly as your first decisions what suits to you because in one year for now I will ask you for results'. And that is what I said to him.</p>
          <p>And I mean, we made a couple of new organizations in the BMW Group and organizational changes in production. I mean we have now a new division for procurement. We made a couple of organizational changes in our marketing and sales division of course, and we are right on track. But if you have a new manager, he can say what are the right people for me and what is the right organizational structure for me. It's fair enough because otherwise I cannot ask him to deliver results because he can have excuses. It's fair enough I think.</p>
          <p>And you asked regarding innovations and standard parts. I would like to answer as well. What we started to tackle is, we ask ourselves, one example. We have 27 different parts and a BMW7 and a BMW5 and BMW3 and the 27 different parts they do exactly the same, exactly the same. So -- and we have a table in the middle of our factories, I don't know the English word, we call it in German [German spoken], you can help me. It's a table where all the stuff lies so -- and we have quite tough discussions when I ask the research and development people, 'why do we have 27 different parts and they do exactly the same?' 'What is the reason? Why are you not able to change it?' So because you hear it very often from other car companies, of course, we have those meetings as well in the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>So and our crystal clear target as part of our combined research and development and procurement strategy is to reduce those parts we don't need seven different ones and have one if it is possible. So that is the answer of your questions and these meetings are not very nice ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Can I just follow-up on that? The question is, in your surveys of customers, what is it that they are prepared to pay for and what is it that they're not prepared to pay for that is causing perhaps you not to deliver the profitability that you want to deliver, that's, and what have your marketing surveys told you about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean our customers they would like to have, first of all I mentioned, if I look into the United States, the ultimate driving machine. I mean, interesting for me is most of our end products we sell in the United States and we can only drive 60 or 70 miles per hour on an interstate. That means that our -- the sense for example of our M Divisions, they like high powered cars with very good acceleration. That means the engine is the very important part. If I come to 7 Series customers for example, they like to have a premium feeling, as they drive the car, what they would like to have is a good feeling as they drive the car. They would like to have safety for example if they have an accident. I receive a lot of letters as well, especially from our customers in the United States. They thank us for the safety of our cars when they have accidents. And they say to us we survived because we were driving a BMW.</p>
          <p>Reputation. Mr. Ellinghorst you asked me regarding reputation, we have the reputation that we deliver very safe cars to our customers. And what they would like to have is advanced technology, but technology they are still able to be able to handle. And we have to have to come to the party. We have to deliver advanced technology and innovations but our customers they have to be able to handle the technology. But if you see BMW, our customers would like to have from us innovations. And I mean, if you know the German magazine Auto Moto Sport, we were able again to improve by the way reputation as well. It was the first time that the BMW Group was able to improve again innovation. Are we able to build sporty cars? Our design competence improved and a couple of other points. So that means we are at the moment in a position to say we are getting closer to our customer, we know more what our customers would really like to have.</p>
          <p>And if I see market studies done in the United States and in Europe, the market studies they show us the same in principle. I mean, when we started to introduce iDrive for example and you ask me marketing campaign, we said 700 different functions, that is what we pointed first and we didn't say to our customer the car is fun to drive as well</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. The second part will answer by Michael Ganal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer to your residual value questions. Three elements I would like to point out. First discussing the provisions built for the upcoming challenges, let me put it this way. One has to know that we improved the magnitude in particular for the US business. On the other side, we had to reduce the provisions built in Germany since not only our auditors could, or had or did, convince us that our provisions were, according to the market situation, too high. So we could not continue in our balance sheet with the provisions built for lease cars in Germany. There to some extent we had to reduce. This is why the net is a little bit lower than what we did in particular in US.</p>
          <p>But even in US what did we learn over the years? The ALG forecast was always below the final outcome. Our cars finally sold did deliver a higher value than ALG did forecast. So this is one reason where our confidence stems from. But even your observation in this chart that take another year and it would look totally different I try just the exercise and yes we have taken January '01 and there we both started with 100. But if I then just talk about the difference so the difference is slightly growing and it stays more or less open, and the difference has widened up to 12 base points if I might refer to 100 then we are at the end 12 better than our competitors. The competitors are after this given period of six or seven years are at 94 and we are at 107, it's even 13 if I recalculate.</p>
          <p>So bottomline I don't see the fact that we have taken just a year which is favorizing our figures, whenever we would have started these comparison I think we have a confirmation that our residual value development in US is better than this of the competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next two questions from Mr. Warburton [UBS Warburg LLC] and then Mr. Burgstaller [Goldman Sachs].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. It's Max Warburton, UBS. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two, both on 2008 guidance. The first one is on interest rate swaps. I think one of the surprises in the second half of '07 was that operating profit improvement was very strong particularly in Q4. But you yourselves point to the impact of interest rate derivatives harming the financial results and therefore pre tax at the end of the year. You actually say in the annual report that movement in interest rates can cause disruption and write-downs. We're seeing globally, obviously, massive moves in interest rates and in your accounts I think to talk about having 15 billion of interest rate swaps. Could you just give us some guidance on how this works? With big, big cuts in US rates, probably in UK rates, what kind of negative impact should we be thinking about for these financial results in 2008?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, actually on your guidance statements. I think both Dr. Ganal and Dr. Reithofer talked about BMW sticking to promises but you have chosen your words carefully and used words like we are aiming to, and our objective is that for 2008, and I think that's quite clear what you're trying to tell us. But if you look at the detail of your outlook statement, which I guess was written a few weeks ago you talk about the pace of growth in the US in '08 being similar to '07. You reference the decline in sterling but say you think it's stopped. I mean, is it fair to say that the economic context has changed considerably since you prepared your guidance statement? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. We'll start with Mr. Ganal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm really reluctant to start speculating about the interest rate development, so for the time being what we see is credit spreads are moving up. On the other side, in particular, US, the interest rates are going down. In Germany and Europe the increase of the credit spreads and the turn down, or the movement downwards of the interest rate is more or less leveling it out. So what I say is we are fully hedged and I think to my best knowledge, we are okay, but I don't want to continue to speculate about the development.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you ask me the economic context changed. Let me say we have and it was the first time ever that the Board of Management was sitting together during a budget process and we said we don't want to have senior vice presidents amongst us. We would like to have a more -- I know it's a medium term decision to create a budget, not a long-term decision, but we said we have to see the budget of 2008 more strategically. And we ask our self -- you mentioned the dollar for example and you mentioned the pound. We ask our self, what does it mean if something happens, for example, in the United States of America and we can, let me say, sell 20,000 cars less.</p>
          <p>We looked into other markets and we ask ourselves, what are the contribution levels in these markets and how much time does it take to move cars for example, into these markets? I mean, we ask ourselves as well, is it from a profitability at the current situation better to move cars from our plant in the United States of America, for example, X5 or X6 to other countries using the exchange rate advantage exporting out of the United States. And we realized that if we are able to move cars into other regions of the world the contribution level will be better.</p>
          <p>That means if we look forward into the year 2008, I said and it was a misunderstanding after the Detroit Motor Show. I said at least in the United States the volume level of 2007. I said at least and a lot of people afterwards said, Reithofer is conservative. But I mean, we had very often discussions amongst us here in the room and you always said Mr. Reithofer, we expect from you profitable growth. When you cannot earn good money in a market then move your cars elsewhere. So and we were looking into contribution levels, we were looking into cost of retail levels and if I see the German market in year 2007, we sold 10,000 cars less in the German market in 2007. And we were able to earn a three digit million amount more in the German market.</p>
          <p>So what was the strategy behind? We said not the German market is our home market, the European Union is our home market. And we looked in to cost of retail levels for example in France, Spain, Portugal compare it to our cost of retail levels in Germany. And said what does it means if move, let me say in a country like Spain 0.3% up when we can move down in Germany? So and the overall result was a very good one, and now we have to do the same, what we have done in Europe on a worldwide level having in mind of course currency effects and having in mind, we often forget import duties for example. So and it was quite a strategic approach for a budget year, but we will stick to the approach, of course, in the business year 2009 and 2010. If we have to do so. So that is very important for me. And that is how we were building up our budget.</p>
          <p>I mean, you mentioned if the world economy collapses, I mean then a lot of companies will have problems or not. So and that is different story for all of us in the room, for all of us. But of course, that you cannot plan, that the world economy ends in a collapse.</p>

          <p>So it is 12 o'clock but I think we have time for three more questions. We'll start with Burgstaller [Goldman Sachs] and then Mr. Raab [Landesbanki Kepler] and then Frank Biller [LBBW].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Stefan Burgstaller from Goldman Sachs. Apologies, I'm going to have four questions, but I'll try to be quick. First Dr. Ganal, what do you mean by improving earnings quality in 2008? Second Dr. Reithofer, you state you want to increase the independence of the US dollar. You mentioned natural hedging as a strategy, not that purchasing goes up, US production goes up. At the same time you mentioned that US is the key market for you. So I guess your sales volume will go up. So I would put it to you that by 2012 your net loan position will be similar to 6 billion as it is today. If that's correct I would be disappointed. So the question therefore is, what's your target net loan position inbuilt in the plan by 2012? What will bring the step change? Wouldn't moving the additional value add into North America, i.e. power train operations an obvious step sharing it with partners? The press speculated about Daimler, the press speculated about GM;, some comments would be nice.</p>
          <p>Third, Dr. Ganal, how should we think about the next two years? I think we all appreciate if you give a bit more clarity on the headwinds, currency 400 million in '08, raw materials maybe 300 million, so a total headwind of 700. In '09 if we mark-to-market the dollar and the pound and the yen, probably another 700 million headwind again from currency. Are you confident that the purchasing savings, efficiency gains, head count reductions are basically allowing you to offset these headwinds and that therefore the volume and the market will be the differentiating factor to the upside or the downside? And then finally, given that you emphasize ROCE as a key target for your company, why are you not starting giving EBIT margin guidance for 2008? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked independences from the dollar. Of course, in the year 2012 we would like to sell more cars in the United States. You're absolutely right, and of course you know that. And I would like go more deeper into the subject. You have to know last year we were able to manufacture in the United States about 150,000 units. We will produce more units in the United States already in the year 2008. I will come to power gen operations, suppliers and so on later.</p>
          <p>And we asked ourself where do we have plants, and the plants are an advantage for us if it comes to currency effects and if you have in mind as well effects like import duties. And we say to ourselves we have a car plant in South Africa and we built in South Africa 3 Series Sedan for export, for example to Australia, to New Zealand, and so on. And we made a decision already for the year 2008 to produce more 3 Series Sedans for the United States in South Africa. Because of two reasons, as you know the rand, if you see the rand development, the rand is getting weaker and weaker like the dollar. And to United States of America and South Africa they have a free trade agreement. That means if you export cars from South Africa to the United States of America you don't have to pay import taxes. That means we have two advantages if we do so already starting in the year 2008, that is only one example how we handle the issue.</p>
          <p>So by the way our plant in South Africa was able to win the JD Power Gold Award in the United States and it was the best plant of Europe because JD Power didn't know how to place it in Africa, our plant in Rosslyn. Only an example that the quality is right as well. So if it comes to a question powertrain, I mean, you have to have in mind if I export an X5 out of the United States to the European Union I have to pay 10% import duties. And you should not underestimate import duties. So if I have an engine from our engine plant in Steyr in Austria in the car, I pay 6% import duty if I re-import the car into the European Union. So and our finance people and our planners, they were sitting together and it is -- how should I say it in English -- it is a very balanced system that we created in the meantime having in mind currency effect and having in mind things like import duties.</p>
          <p>But more important Mr. Burgstaller for you is Dr. Diess started to ask major European suppliers, do you have a factory for example for part A in the United States? And they said yes, we have a production plant in the United States and the production plant produces part A. And just talk to us should we supply you from the United States for your parts in Germany or should we supply you from France or from Germany. That means the possibility is there, so and what is important for us as well, I mean, if you see our plant in the United States we have an additional advantage. I mean, we sell in Canada as well cars and the market is developing very well for us. If you have a local content in the United States in your car plant of more than 60% you can export duty free to Canada and you can export duty free to Mexico. So what we have done as well of course we moved a part of our supplier base, because of the NAFTA regulations, from the United States to Mexico, so to have an efficiency gain as well.</p>
          <p>So and I mention already and you're absolutely right and a straight answer from my side the European car manufacturer, especially the premium car manufacturer, we have to work together more close than we have done in the past because in my opinion we have lot of commodities. And we have to look into the commodities to achieve first of all better economies of scale and of course buy more goods in the dollar region. That is my answer and the rest we discuss during lunchtime Mr. Burgstaller, if you allow. Mr. Ganal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You ask for more guidance concerning our qualitative targets. In particular I think we have already given quite a strong outlook. Others in the same field and this confronted with the same questions and challenges, they don't give any indication at all. And this why I think you are to some extent on solid ground listening to us.</p>
          <p>You asked about the qualitative side. What we internally to guide the company to better performance what we internally separate it. On the one side we focus on the Automobile segment, just the Automobile segment, the operational business where we are comparable, where we would like to be compared and where we think here we have the performance indicators to be compared against the others. Here we have the operational business. What we said is, we want to improve in the operational car business. We would like to improve the EBIT in absolute terms, and what we said in 2007 we could stop the deterioration of the EBIT margin. We would like to end up in 2012 around 8 to 10% and what this does mean to the EBIT margin, we said at least not worse than in the year 2007. Then on the other side, and this is where at the end of the day the shareholders are looking from, we have the group earnings and the group profitability. Here we once more committed to a higher profit in absolute terms and we indicated that we would like to increase the ROCE on Group level as well. This is what we said in our speeches and I think this could -- should give you quite some guidance what you can expect from us in 2008.</p>
          <p>Then you continued asking about 2009. You calculated the headwinds and I would just repeat what has been said so far. We said after the headwinds from the currency side in 2007 we would like to end up below 400 and the next element, which has been discussed, was the raw material increase. Here we have the 287 in 2007 and we said we would like to end up below. So this adds up to maximum headwinds if try stay within this calculation of 687 or less. So what can be done to counter it? I think on the purchasing side, here once more let me repeat, we said we want to see and we won't see three million digit saving in 2008 so to end up with 4 billion in 2012 altogether. We should see higher savings in purchasing. We are on track. Another figure I would like to repeat, we announced a 400 -- 500 million full year savings on the personnel side in 2009. So altogether today we cannot speculate about the headwinds in 2009. I talked about the headwinds in 2008 but we cannot speculate the headwinds about 2009. But what you see, the speed and the result out of the profitability program should provide us with higher savings in 2009. This is so far what we can say today.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi gentlemen. Michael Raab, Kepler Equities, three quick questions if I may. Firstly Dr. Ganal I have to come back on the FX hedging. You point out that you had carried out already some base hedges for 2009. Would it be fair to assume this is 20%, 25% of the then expected net exposure? Then secondly, again on your guidance for this year. The improvement in overall earnings as well as the quality of the earnings looked at also include any eventual charges for head count reduction or is that before EO items so to say? And thirdly, there were a couple of reports in the German press most recently stating that apparently the willingness of your employees that you're approaching to leave is pretty low. Would you be confirmative of that? And apart from that would you give us, inter-year an update on how many people have taken up the offers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the employees because I have to answer the question. As you know 5,000 are temporary workers and we are well on track, it's already done 2,500. That means 2,500 temporary workers will leave our company during the course of the year. And now that we come to our own head count it can that in the middle of the year we need additional tools in our toolbox but definitely take it from my side we will make the figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may follow up, when you say additional tools in your toolbox would that mean more financial incentives for people to go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. For example what we don't want to do, look we have people between 55 and 60, and we have a very, very good performance amongst our people between 55 and 60. And of course an additional tool can be that you widen your -- help me in English, you widen your -- to ask your people to retire, to go on early retirement, early retirement packages, now I have stated the English word to use. Additional early retirement packages. That is what we have in our mind. But what we would like to tackle and it is very important for me, we have to tackle the poor performance and our first focus is to tackle our poor performance and to ask with packages these people to leave our company. And as an additional tool in our toolbox can be early retirement, additional early retirement packages. Michael Ganal.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You ask for the effects of the -- one off effects from the employee adjustments. Coming back to what I said early, that we have the operational business where we compare ourselves to the competitors and where they have quite often taken out their one off figures. What we would like to confirm is that bottom line in the Group we said we want to improve our absolute profit adjusted about the Rolls Royce impact. And this announcement, this commitment does include any effects from these one-off measures. And then base hedges, you'd asked for additional guidance, I would like to stay where I was. I said there is some base, they have some base hedges and we will inform you accordingly.</p>

          <p>Last question, Frank Biller [LBBW].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Frank Biller from LBBW. Just three quick questions, may be the one concerning these provision side from personnel and measurements, may be you can be a bit more specific what you are estimating as a burden for 2008, included in your earnings guidance? The secondly is also confirmation about this US$6 billion a long position and calculating a ForEx net effect of minus 400 million or bit below, that leads to an estimated of US$6 billion long position in 2008. Maybe you can confirm this magnitude and say something about improvement in the next years? So what magnitude is it staying or increasing or declining or what numbers we have to calculate here with? And the last question is on your development in the fourth quarter, seeing your pre-production in the first nine months, its seems to me that in the fourth quarter there was a sharp increase in profitability coming from selling those pre-produced cars. May be you can give us a figure of what was the positive impact from this side. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Ganal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me start with the question these expenditures of head count reduction. I don't want to go further than just confirming that we expect several &#x20AC;100 million in 2008 to be spent in this particular program. Net exposure, we basically don't announce these figures. We don't talk about despite the fact that they can be easily recalculated. But I would like to say at least that my least -- that my first analyst conference to one or the other experience and moves in place in BMW. But according to your expectations, this exposure whether it is 6 billion or not has to be reduced and this is the core element of our natural hedging program. And we have to reduce this exposure as far as possible. And having said that we cannot confirm today that it will go to zero but it is our target. We said that we would like to become independent from these currency movements and if we want to become independent then the exposure, at least in theory, has to go to zero.</p>
          <p>In quarter four, your observation is absolutely right. The profitability, the margins were driven in quarter four by a clear reduction in our internal stock. But this is nothing extraordinary. Over the years we always have seven -- certain waste in our stock development since the retail performance in the different months is differently. For example, the stock in end of February, where we have produced and until end of February clearly more cars than retail, end of March it will look differently. But our very strong EBIT margin in the fourth quarter 2007 was clearly driven by this effect. On top, as you know, at least, it was said that there were extraordinary cost saving measure in quarter four. We had favorable support from the hedging side in quarter four. These altogether are arguments why our EBIT margin in quarter four went up to 7 point something. And this is a level which for the time being at least we cannot confirm for 2008.</p>
