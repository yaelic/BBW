          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Novo Nordisk's 2010 Results Conference Call.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and welcome to this Novo Nordisk conference call regarding our performance in 2010 and the outlook for 2011.  I'm Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo Nordisk.  With me I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer; and present are also our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release and the slides I'll be using for this call are both available on our home page, novonordisk.com.  The conference call is scheduled to last approximately one hour, and as usual, we'll start with the presentation as outlined on slide number two.  The Q&amp;A session will begin in about 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number three.  As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements.  Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations.  For further information on the risk factors, please see the earnings release and the slides we've prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Please note that this conference call is being webcast live, and a replay will be made available on the Novo Nordisk website after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number four.  We are very satisfied with the performance in 2010, not only from a sales and financial perspective, but also with our end market performance and the progress of our pipeline.  During the year, we have expanded our leadership position in the global diabetes care market, strong performances primarily driven by the modern insulins and Victoza.  Victoza was launched in the U.S. in February 2010 and has since captured the majority of the new GLP-1 patients and driven growth of the class.</p>
          <p>Within R&amp;D, we are today happy to announce the final results from the Phase 3a program with Degludec and DegludecPlus.  We are quite encouraged by the results of these trials and we now focus on securing a fast submission of the regulatory dossier to the agencies.  Within haemophilia, have made strong progress in the pipeline in 2010, and we now expect to file for Factor XIII for the congenital deficiency indication in the first half of 2011 and start Phase 3 trials in 2011 with a fast-acting Factor VIIa analog and a long-acting Factor IX derivative.</p>
          <p>The robust business performance is reflected in our financial results for 2010.  Operating profit increased 27% as reported, and earnings per share grew 38%.  For 2011, we expect sales growth of 8% to 10% and operating profit growth of 15%, both measured in local currencies.  A solid performance has also led us to revisit our long-term financial targets, which has resulted in an upgrade of three of these.  Jesper will provide more insight into the revised targets later during this call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number five. Our portfolio of modern insulins continues to show strong performance.  2010, the portfolio of modern insulins was the main growth driver and accounted for close to 60% of the total sales growth in local currencies.  This reflects the steady penetration of our modern insulins in the expanding insulin market.  Victoza sales reached DKK 2.3 billion 2010, representing 32% of our sales growth in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Sales of NovoSeven increased 14% in Danish kroner to DKK 8 billion, and by 8% in local currencies.  Sales growth for NovoSeven was primarily realized in North America, but also Japan and Korea, and International Operations contributed to the growth.  Sales of Norditropin increased 9% in Danish kroner to DKK 4.8 billion and 4% in local currencies.  Novo Nordisk is still second-largest company in the global growth hormone market, with a 24% market share measured in volume.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the regional split.  2010 all regions contributed to growth measured in local currencies.  North America was the main contributor with 62% share of growth measured in local currencies, followed by International Operations and Europe contributing 24% and 12%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in North America reflects a continued solid market penetration of the modern insulins supported by the Victoza sales.  Novo Nordisk maintains its leadership position in the U.S. insulin market, 42% of the insulin market and 37% of the modern insulin market. European sales grew 5% in local currencies, driven by continued progress of the portfolio of modern insulins and solid performance of Victoza.  Sales in International Operations increased 17% in local currencies.  The main contributor to sales was modern insulins, primarily in China.  Please note that as of January 1 this year, the fifth Novo Nordisk region, mainland region China, has been established.  This region is comprised China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Region China constitutes 7% of total sales and grew 20% in local currencies in 2010.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number seven. The global insulin market continues to show double-digit annual growth rates, last year around 18%.  The volume growth of 7% is driven by increased prevalence of diabetes as well as higher diagnosis and treatment rates.  The additional growth in terms of values is due to the steady upgrades to modern insulins and increased use of disposable pen devices such as FlexPen.  Novo Nordisk continues to hold a stable market share of 51% of the global insulin market by volume.  The remaining part is divided between our two main competitors and a smaller portion held by a number of regional competitors.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the Victoza performance in the United States.  In the U.S., Victoza performance continues to be encouraging.  Today we hold a market share of more than 40% of filled monthly GLP-1 prescriptions, and we're capturing around 65% of new GLP-1 patients.  Importantly, since Victoza was launched in February last year, the GLP-1 class has expanded by more than 25%.  The majority of new patients are OAD failures in line with the positioning as an early treatment option.</p>
          <p>Finally I'm glad to announce that the U.S. FDA in December 2010 revised the approved label for Victoza.  Consequently the label now includes data from the LEAD 6 study comparing once-daily administration of Victoza with twice-daily administration of exenatide.  As you may recall, the LEAD 6 study amongst other findings demonstrated a significantly large HbA1c lowering effect of Victoza compared to exenatide.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Mads, who'll give you an update on the development within our clinical pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars.  Please turn to slide nine.  Novo Nordisk is extremely pleased to announce today the outcome of the Phase 3 development programs for both insulin Degludec and DegludecPlus, the two new generation insulin products.  With 10,000 patients recruited in 17 Phase 3 trials in 40 countries, it is not only the largest single core development program in diabetes to date, but it has also set a new standard by full completion in less than a year and a half from the first patient being dosed to reporting headline results from the full program.  This rapid Phase 3 execution implies that the new drug applications can now be submitted for both products in U.S. and EU during the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>While we have not yet completed full data analysis on all trials, we do have a reasonably clear picture of the key outcomes to be able to present an overview of the top line data that define the efficacy, safety, and convenience advantages of these improved insulin products.  Specifically Phase 3 set out to confirm that these insulins can achieve the recommended target of glucose control, but with a reduced the risk of hypoglycaemia, most common adverse event associated with insulin therapy. Hypoglycaemia often limits the willingness of the physician or the patient to increase doses to achieve the therapeutic goal in a real-life setting.  Among hypoglycaemic episodes, those that are the most feared by patients occur during the night time, so-called nocturnal hypoglycaemia, when the patient may not awake from sleep with a potential serious increase in the risk of complications, short and long term.  Generally speaking, we have in BEGIN and BOOST compared Degludec and DegludecPlus to the most frequently used insulin analogs.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for a review of headline results.  I will initially focus on the single largest study to date, i.e., the 52-week insulin initiation trial known as NN1250-3579, comparing once daily Degludec to insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes, as this trial provides exposure for a long time, one year, in a large number of subjects.  It therefore assists both titration and extended steady-state treatment in patients from 12 different countries equally split between Europe and North America. A total of 1,030 insulin na&#xEF;ve type 2 diabetes subjects previously treated with between one and three OADs were randomized three to one tried the Degludec or insulin glargine, both given in addition to metformin plus-minus a DPP-IV inhibitor.  The one-year dropout rate was below 25% in both arms.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for a review of the study results.  In the 3579 study, Degludec effectively improved long-term glycaemic control, achieving the primary objective of showing HbA1c non-inferiority to insulin glargine.  From a baseline of 8.2%, HbA1c decreased by more than 1 percentage point to around 7% in both treatment arms as requested for a regulatory treat-to-target trial.  For Degludec, the fasting plasma glucose level was lowered to less than 6 millimolar at the end of the study, which was statistically significantly lower than observed in the glargine arm.</p>
          <p>Degludec also demonstrated a lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared to insulin glargine.  Specifically, the rate of confirmed nocturnal hypoglycaemic events, i.e., need for third-party assistance or plasma glucose level below 3.1  millimolar, was statistically significantly lower in the group treated with Degludec, with a reduction of more than 35% compared to the insulin glargine group. Degludec also reduced the number of daytime hypoglycaemic episodes, leading to a reduction in total hypoglycaemia of slightly below 20%, albeit it statistically non-significant.  Degludec demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile, and there were no apparent differences between the treatment groups with respect to adverse events and standard safety parameters.  Specifically QTC and anti-drug antibody analysis was performed with no adverse findings in this large patient population.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide.  Having established top line results from all 17 trials in the BEGIN and BOOST programs, it is appropriate now to summarize key findings and the implications for the future of these two products, findings which were highly consistent across the trials.  The pharmacokinetic and dynamic profile of Degludec with an ultra-long duration of action, coupled with a very flat and predictable profile, is reflected in the efficacy and safety results from the Phase 3 programs.  Thus, when compared to insulin glargine, once-daily administration of Degludec has in many trials shown a larger reduction in fasting glucose, and in spite of this, caused less hypoglycaemia during the night.</p>
          <p>In addition, once-daily administration of Degludec offers convenience benefits to the patients such as a completely flexible dosing regimen, that unlike other basal insulins, allows the patients to voluntarily or involuntarily vary the time of day of administration without a untoward effect on efficacy or safety.  This is expected to enhance real-life convenience and compliance with the treatment.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the U200 Degludec formulation offers a possibility to reduce the injection volume, thus allowing type 2 diabetes patients to administer even doses above 80 units in a single injection.  Roughly one quarter of the patients needed doses above 80 units in, for instance, the 3579 study. Finally, Degludec will be provided in a new and improved disposable pen, for now called the PDS290 pen.</p>
          <p>Continuing with DegludecPlus, this is a unique formulation of insulin since it represents the first basal-prandial combination product of two insulin analogs, each of which retains its own characteristic time-action profile.  In type 2 diabetes studies versus the leading pre-mixed insulin NovoMix 30, DegludecPlus has been shown to lower fasting glucose more effectively and to achieve titration targets faster at a reduced insulin dose. Importantly, the superior fasting glucose control was accomplished with lower rates of <mark type="inaudible" /> and nocturnal hypoglycaemia.  Benefits as regards nocturnal hypoglycaemia and reduced number of injections were also observed when DegludecPlus was compared to basal bolus therapy in type 1 diabetes.  Just as for Degludec, DegludecPlus will be supplied in new superior disposable pen, and in contrast to pre-mixed insulins today, there will be no re-suspension step prior to use, as this is a fully soluble formulation.</p>
          <p>We are highly encouraged by the safety, efficacy, and convenience demonstrated for the use for these two new insulins, and as mentioned, we are now working intensively on securing high quality regulatory dossiers of the two new insulins in the United States and in Europe, all targeting submission during the second half of this year.  Finally, a number of the clinical studies will be presented at the major diabetes conferences later this year, and further analysis of the BEGIN and BOOST programs are also expected to be provided at the Capital Markets Day in the month of May.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide.  Within our diabetes and obesity pipeline, another important achievement is worth noticing.  After end of Phase 2 meetings with the regulatory agencies, the Victoza-Degludec combination product known as NN9068 is now ready to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials during the first half of 2011.  The program is comprised of two trials and will include approximately 2,000 patients, building further on the documented safety and efficacy profiles of the liraglutide and Degludec molecules.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 14 for an update on our haemostasis portfolio.  We have, as mentioned by Lars, made strong progress in our haemostasis pipeline during 2010, allowing us to reach three important milestones in the near future following close dialog with the regulatory agencies over the preceding months.</p>
          <p>Firstly, Novo Nordisk has decided to submit recombinant Factor XIII for approval of the congenital deficiency indication based on the Phase 3 data communicated in August last year.  The submission is expected to be filed in this quarter in the U.S. and in the second quarter in Europe.  Secondly, Novo Nordisk has decided to progress the ultra-fast-acting recombinant factor VIIa analog NN1731 into Phase 3 based on the Phase 2 data communicated in August last year.  The Phase 3 trial for 1731 is expected to start mid-year.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have successfully completed a Phase 1 study for the very long-acting Factor IX product known as N9-GP.  Based on the positive results we now expect to initiate the first pivotal Phase 3 trial in the middle of this year.</p>
          <p>With that, over to Jesper for an update on the financials.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mads.  Please turn to the next slide.  We're very satisfied with the financial results for 2010.  The sales of diabetes care products increased by 22% measured in Danish kroner to 45.7 billion and by 16% in local currencies compared to 2009.  The gross margin was expanded by 120 basis points to 80.8% compared to last year.  This improvement primarily reflects a favorable product mix impact due to increased sales of modern insulin and Victoza and the positive currency impact of 40 basis points.</p>
          <p>Total non-production-related costs increased by 18% to 30.9 billion compared to 2009. This development primarily reflects the cost associated with the global launch of Victoza impacting sales and distribution cost, the continued expansion of sales forces and the ongoing Phase 3 program for Degludec and DegludecPlus impacting R&amp;D costs.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in 2010 increased by 27% to 18.9 billion compared to 2009.  In local currency the growth was approximately 16%.  Net financial showed a net expense of DKK605 million in 2010 compared to a net expense of around DKK945 million in 2009.  The average number of full-time employees has increased 5%, primarily reflecting the expansions in the markets in international operations including China.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide.  This slide shows the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner.  Further, the expected annual impact on operating profit of a 5% movement in our key invoicing currencies and the current extent of hedging for the same currencies are shown.  During 2010, the average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner have both been above the average levels for 2009 which is reflected in the positive contribution to reported performance from currencies.  Please note that the positive impact of the higher exchange rates during 2010 compared to 2009 on our operating profit to a large degree are countered by a loss on our hedging contract which is reflected in our net financials.</p>
          <p>For 2010, the foreign exchange result was an expense of DKK 1.341 billion, compared to an expense of 751 million in 2009.  This development reflect losses on foreign exchange hedging of especially U.S. dollar due to the appreciation versus Danish kroner in 2010 compared to the exchange rate level prevailing in 2009.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial guidance for 2011.  Novo Nordisk expects sales growth in 2011 of 8% to 10% measured in local currencies.  This is based on expectation of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk's key products as well as expectations of continued intense competition, generic competition to all antidiabetic products and an impact from the implementation of healthcare reforms, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is expected to be 1.5 percentage point lower than the growth measured in local currencies. For 2011, operating profit growth is expected to be around 15% measured in local currencies. Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the reported operating profit growth is expected to be 2.5 percentage point lower than the growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2011, Novo Nordisk can expect a net financial expense of around DKK 100 million, whereas the effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be around 23%, with a free cash flow expectation of more than DKK 16 billion for 2011.  All of the above expectations are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not significantly change business conditions for Novo Nordisk during the remainder of 2011, and that currency exchange rate, especially the U.S. dollar, will remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide.  At the Annual General Meeting in March 2011, the Board of Directors will propose a 33% increase in dividend to DKK 10 per share of one, corresponding to a payout ratio of 39.6.  Adjusting for the impact from the divestment of shares in ZymoGenetics where the related cash flow was returned to shareholders by an expansion of the 2010 share repurchase program, the payout ratio is 42.8.  In 2009, the payout ratio was 40.9.</p>
          <p>A new DKK 10 billion share repurchase program will be executed during 2011.  Novo Nordisk expects to conduct its share repurchase program in accordance with the Safe Harbor regulation.  JPMorgan will act as lead manager of the program and will, in this capacity, repurchase shares on behalf of Novo Nordisk for an amount of up to DKK 2 billion during the trading period starting today and ending on the 26th of April 2011.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the updated long-term financial targets.  Novo Nordisk introduced four long-term financial targets in 1997 -- 1996, sorry -- with the goal of balancing short- and long-term considerations and thereby ensure focus on shareholder value creation.  The four targets have since been revised and updated in the Annual Report for 2000, 2005, and 2008, respectively.  Novo Nordisk has now reached the performance levels stipulated in the four long-term financial targets and has consequently revised the target levels.  The revision is based on an assumption of a continuation of the current business environment and given the current scope of business activities, and has been prepared assuming that currency exchange rate remain at the current level.  Should any of these assumptions change, the time horizon for achieving the long-term targets may be prolonged, or it may be required to revise the targets.</p>
          <p>The four targets focus on growth, profitability, financial return, and generation of cash.  With this revision, three of the targets have been increased, while one, the operating profit growth target, remains at the historic growth ambition level of 15%.  The target level for operating margin is raised from 30% to 35%.  The enabling factors are expected to be product mix development, further productivity improvements in the manufacturing and administrative areas, whilst at the same time ensuring investments in research and development, as well as sales and marketing.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that the achievement of the operating margin target may be influenced by significant changes in market condition including regulatory requirement, pricing environment, competitive environment, healthcare reforms, and exchange rates.</p>
          <p>The target level for return on invested capital measured post-tax is increased from 50% to 70%.  The raised target reflect the expectation of a continued lower growth in invested capital relative to operating profit as well as a stable effective tax rate. In setting the new target level, Novo Nordisk has assumed that proposed new accounting rules regarding the treatment of operating leases, the draft International Financial Reporting Standard leases, will be implemented.  It is currently anticipated that the introduction of this new accounting standard for Novo Nordisk will have approximately 10 percentage point negative impact on return on invested capital.</p>
          <p>The target level for the cash-to-earnings ratio is raised from 80% to 90%, reflecting a sustained lower tangible investment level and an improved cash conversion ability.  As previously, this target will be pursued looking at the average over a three-year period.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation of the financial results.  Lars will now moderate the Q&amp;A session.  Please note that there will be a maximum limit of two questions per individual, with the objective of allowing as many conference participants as possible to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper and Mads, and please note this conference is being taped and a replay is made available on our home page after the call.  Operator, we're now ready to take the first question, please.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take the first question from Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, gentlemen.  Congratulations on a strong quarter.  First, two questions here, one on the R&amp;D and one on the accounting.  In terms of the hypoglycaemia having at night, have you looked into also the severe nocturnal episodes, noticing that the German authorities looked quite a lot into this?</p>
          <p>Secondly, also Mads, would you reveal the size of the fasting glucose lowering you've seen with Degludec versus LANTUS?</p>
          <p>And then just thirdly to Jesper, your provisioning went up about DKK 500 million in the quarter. Can you elaborate a little bit on that, on how much went over the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Henrik.  Mads Krogsgaard, with severe hypos and fasting plasma glucose lowering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay, Henrik, first of all, severe hypoglycaemia absolutely is something that you want to study.  The overall, across BEGIN and BOOST, against all the comparators is such that we numerically had few of those, and the way that you can analyze those in a meaningful way is not on a trial-per-trial basis probably because the numbers are very low, but in a pre-planned meta-analysis where you can compare numbers.  And that you cannot use for regulatory label purpose, but you can use it for health economic assessment towards the health technology assessors including those in UK, France, Germany, and elsewhere. So that we're looking at now.</p>
          <p>What you can say broadly speaking Henrik is that we have on nocturnal hypoglycemia, a highly consistent finding that is equivalent to or greater than the average decrease in nocturnal hypoglycaemia that we saw for LANTUS versus a human in-patient scheme in the old days. And for severe and total hypos, we do see that across the trials, there are reductions, but it's not as consistent on a trial-by-trial basis as it is in the highly robust way for the nocturnal.</p>
          <p>In terms of fasting glucose, we do see basically numerically in all the trials against LANTUS, that when we're comparing apples and apples, we lower the fasting glucose more with Degludec than you do with LANTUS.  In some studies, it achieves statistical significance. In others, in particular the smaller trials, it is more a numeric benefit.  And again here, a pre-planned meta-analysis is of relevance to measure overall fasting glucose control across all the comparable Degludec-versus-glargine trials, and that is being conducted alongside with the other things I mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, and then over to Jesper. The accounting question was fourth quarter plus DKK 500 million in provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The increase in provisions all pass through the P&amp;L and are related to primarily a continued expansion of the activities in the U.S., and sales provisions in the U.S. are on the rise, also related to the implementation of the U.S. healthcare reform.  And in addition, legal provisions have been increased to cover ongoing legal disputes primarily also related to the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, gentlemen.  Thanks for taking my question.  So first of all on Degludec, in the 3579 study, could you just comment on the baseline number of sort of nocturnal hypos that were seen in that study, and really what does a 35% reduction equate to?</p>
          <p>And just on -- in terms of the titration speed in both arms of the study, could you just comment on really what the speed between LANTUS and Degludec, and whether we're seeing the nocturnal hypos at the start of the study or more consistently throughout the whole study?</p>
          <p>And then just a follow- up on the sales and distribution question, with the provisioning, just on the legal provisions. Could you just say what that's relating to, and also sort of try and quantify that?  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Mads Krogsgaard, Degludec, what -- any comments on the baseline Hb1Ac numbers where we recorded the 35% reduction of nocturnal hypos, and comments to the titration speed and where we start to see the impact on hypos, from the beginning or later?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, those are excellent questions, and actually the 3571 -- 79, sorry, was one of those trials where there was a relatively low event rate, but since the numbers are high, and here we are speaking kind of a quarter to half a nocturnal hypo per patient year, and in other studies, those numbers are actually quite a bit higher.  But the reduction of more than 35% achieves significance because of course it's a big trial with 1,000 patients.  Do bear in mind that the greater-than-35% reduction is identical to what we saw in two other identical trials, both a U200 formulation trial where a greater-than-35% reduction was seen, and a Japanese replica of -- Asian replica of the 3579. So it's a highly consistent finding.</p>
          <p>The titration speed is generally, for Degludec, also in this trial, actually faster than for LANTUS, i.e., we do see achievement of the fasting glucose target of 5 millimolar blood glucose achieved earlier for the average Degludec patient than for glargine, also a consistent finding.</p>
          <p>In terms of what nocturnal hypoglycaemia evolution looks like over time, which I guess was your last question, is indeed so that, because of the fastest titration speed for Degludec, basically we in the very early part of the study tend to see slightly more hypos, not limiting titration actually, but slightly more hypos on Degludec, but then as the study progresses, there is a bigger and bigger widening gap, such that the biggest difference between Degludec and LANTUS in favor of Degludec is always at the end of the study, and those studies that would have been extended would have been predicted to show a wider margin over time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Michael Novod from Nordea Markets.  Two questions. Could you try to comment on what you think the consequences will be competitive-wise when we might see a launch of Bydureon later this half in Europe?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, say with -- facing  all the Degludec data, and also Lars' comments in the media that you have the best insulin now, likely going to the market next year, how confident do you feel in the commercial profile of Degludec, also based on what you hear from the <mark type="inaudible" /> leaders and study centers that participated in the studies and what would that mean for the five-year market decision in the insulin market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  This is Lars Rebien here.  First question was one off, and then I'll defer Mads to comment on how he sees the commercial profile versus the profile that we've seen and which is basically a regulatory profile, and there are significant differences here, and I'm sure he'll be pleased to talk about this.</p>
          <p>In terms of the launch of Bydureon, you have to recall that 75% of the business that Novo Nordisk is generating is coming from United States, the remaining 25%, or let's say 20%, is coming from Europe.  It is anticipated that that number will decline as we are rolling out in significant overseas markets with Victoza also.</p>
          <p>In fact, we would not mind so much to have some help in terms of building the interest in the GLP-1 segment by having Lilly and Amylin out there promoting Bydureon. As long as it's in Europe, it's fine.  We would prefer to have the United States for ourselves for as long as possible.</p>
          <p>Mads, the difference between the regulatory profile and the expected commercial profile of Degludec?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so very briefly, if you imagine you can compare the degree of HbA1c control to the occurrence of hypoglycemia, I think we all know that the better your glucose control is, i.e., the lower the HbA1c goes, the higher the rate of hypoglycemia goes.  And what we have with Degludec is a curve that is below the LANTUS curve. And that means that in the Phase 3 trials, we have essentially been asked by FDA  and other agencies to treat all the patients to the same HbA1c level, and this means that we see a hypoglycemia benefit.</p>
          <p>But in a real-life setting, what we expect to see and are setting out to prove in the post-marketing studies is also that in the real world, people stop titrating when hypoglycemia becomes a nuisance. And that essentially would mean that you look at it from the other end of the curve, saying that you treat to the same kind of level of hypoglycemia, and here you will get improved blood glucose control including A1c for Degludec compared to glargine, and this of course we're setting out to do.</p>
          <p>I'd like to emphasize also that the flexible dosing regimen that we have proved and intend to -- will intend to get into the label, allowing any time of day dosing on any day, as opposed to same time every day for the existing insulins, is a clear convenience factor  we believe, and will also enhance compliance for the patients.  Also the notion that we can offer a U200 formulation, decreasing the volumes by one half and the shots and injections from two to one in those patients who need more than 80 units per day, which is quite a few actually, we think is significant.  And then obviously, we are delivering a product that has a high building molecular safety in a device that will also be superior, both to what we know today as FlexPen and Soluzar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we start to look at this combined commercial profile, what obviously is of interest to us is to look at all the patients that are coming into insulin therapy, and that's where we hope to be able to catch the majority of patients on this. Today patients starting up on basal insulins have of course basically three different options, NPH, the old fashioned human basal insulin, Levemir or LANTUS. With the demonstrated much better profile, much more flexibility, much more convenience, much greater device, we are actually quite certain that we will get a lion's share of the new patients coming in. And you will recall that it has been somewhat of a struggle for us to grow the market share on Levemir in recent years, and it would have taken us 15, 20 years to get on par with LANTUS as it were. And therefore, we think this is a very, very significant development for Novo Nordisk.</p>
          <p>We're not going to give you five-year projections of the market share of basal insulins based on this yet.  We need to get an approval first, and we need to get in contact and provide this profile to all the key opinion leaders, get some more real-in-life use of it in clinic -- in daily practice, and then we will start to guess about what market shares we will develop over time.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for those two excellent questions.  The next question, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Thanks for taking my questions.  Firstly, given the operating income guidance has moved up to the top end of the range that you'd given previously, it seems that you're a bit more confident now in further margin expansion in 2011.  I'm just wondering what led to this change?  I think you saw a 2% pre-R&amp;D margin improvement in 2010. I'm wondering if that's repeatable in 2011?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, excluding Victoza, I'm just wondering roughly how much of the growth you're seeing in the U.S. is coming from price and how much is volume, and how you see that trend moving going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Jesper, will you try to answer this, operating income guidance is now on 15%, which is in the upper part of the range, indicating a greater degree of certainty on our ability to improve margins, obviously as a result of modern insulins and Victoza?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you take this as a local currency ratios, then you get some feel for the underlying improvement. We would anticipate that the gross margin improvement in 2011 will be in the 50 basis point range.  Of course, one of the elements that is attached to the improvement in gross margin is the actual prices in the U.S., and I know that the impact from the U.S. healthcare reform to Novo Nordisk in 2011 will be bigger than the impact that we saw in 2010. But in &#x2013; at the mid of the sales growth range we've given of 8% to 10%, we believe that there will be, in local currency terms, around 50 basis point improvement in gross margin.</p>
          <p>As for the selling and distribution cost, we believe that we will see a gradual decline there, to probably somewhere between 29 to 30, so let say 40, 50 basis point improvement, basically coming from a critical mass economy, so scaled economy in our global selling and distribution setup.</p>
          <p>In terms of R&amp;D, the completion of the significant investment we've had in Degludec and DegludecPlus Phase 3 trials will imply that we expect our R&amp;D ratios to be in the ballpark of 15%, and with a 15.8% ratio for 2010, a slight improvement in the R&amp;D ratio in terms of cost to sales we'll be seeing. And then also expect to see a continuation with a 10 to 20 basis point improvement in the admin ratio.</p>
          <p>Do bear in mind that we in 2010 had a non-recurring income on other operating line to the tune of DKK 100 million, and our expectations for the operating income for 2011 is now around DKK 500 million.  If you add these performance elements up, then you should get very close to a 15% growth based on the underlying growth of 8% to 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if we look at the U.S. market in Q4, we're looking at a growth which can be decomposed to approximately 50% market share, 50% growth, and 50% net price impact, and that is a combination of price increase and increased rebates as a result of the U.S. healthcare reforms. So 50, 25, 25.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.  I have two, if I may.  One, as is it relates to the 3579 study on Degludec, can you remind us again when Degludec was dosed in the study? Was it in the mornings or was it in the evenings? And might that have an impact on the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia versus overall hypoglycemia in the study?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on the revenue forecast for next year.  Your original guidance was for 10% growth in local currency, new guidance is for an 8% to 10% growth in local currency. Can you help me understand better why that might have changed over the course of the last three months?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  This is Lars Rebien here.  I'll take the last question first and then I'll defer it to Mads the 3579 trial.  Actually in our own optics, what we have been guiding here is the same numbers as we guided last time we gave you guidance.  Last time we gave you guidance that sales expectations for 2011 was up to 10% growth, in de facto indicating a number like 9%.  We are now indicating 8% to 10%, which is 9% is in the middle, and this is actually on a higher number.  So you could argue that this is a slight increase in guidance in terms of top line, and I think somehow the market has misunderstood this, because we got the same questions several times over today already.  So it's a good question, and the answer is that it is not a downgrading in top line growth. In fact, it's a slight upgrade. Mads Krogsgaard -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Well first of all, you can say that it was given in the evening, so it was in the evening, whereas the LANTUS was given as per label, and that means that, if anything, you can argue that giving Degludec in the evening, which could be at supper time or later, if anything would -- it actually, as you know from the steady state pharmacokinetics and dynamics, does not have a peak action profile, unlike LANTUS and Levemir.  However, if you were to see anything that even remotely resembled a peak action profile, that would typically occur within the first 10, 12 hours after administration, and hence actually not favor Degludec in a trial where it was given in the evening.</p>
          <p>But overall I have to say, we've studied Degludec in morning, in the evening, any time of day, even with intervals between 8 and 40 hours with a forced flexible, we call it, dosing regimen, and we do see that there is true dosing flexibility and that we can preserve benefits on nocturnal hypoglycaemia.  So it's an excellent question, but the fact is that the analog is so long acting and so flat in its action profile that it doesn't really make a big difference when you administer it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great, and if I can actually just follow up with an additional question there, Mads. Do you expect the label for Degludec to suggest superior nocturnal hypoglycaemia over LANTUS, or is that something that you don't expect in a label?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, you really fight for anything you can get.  What I for sure expect is that all the data tabulated in nice tables showing benefits on nocturnal hypos, on the fasting glucose, et cetera, will be there and stated in such a way that that can be used by the company as we bring this product out to the patients, that is for sure.</p>
          <p>Second of all, of course you also strive to have wording in there as much as possible, but we do know that at this point it's premature to speculate on that, because it is truly a negotiation with the agency.  May I finally remark that we are doing pre-planned meta-analysis, and it's a unique factor that Novo Nordisk has designed these many trials in so identical ways from trial to trial that we actually can do this in a statistically meaningful way, and that will allow us to get even more robust data on the various hypoglycemia parameters before we submit.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  This is Carsten from Carnegie Bank.  Two questions to you, Mads.  First of all, on the weekly GLP-1s, while you seem to postpone one more time the decision about which drug you want to move forward with, could you highlight to me which one, semaglutide or liraglutide once weekly, that is your preferred drug to move on with?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on obesity, how long a trial would you suspect is needed ahead of an approval of an obesity indication for Victoza?  We saw Contrave struggling significantly here yesterday in gaining FDA approval.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much for these two good questions.  The weekly GLP-1 option mess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I do not like to correct analysts, which is not a thing I should do.  I do however wants to state that when you say postpone one more time, let me clarify the situation.  What we have decided to do is actually generate multiple dose data on the once-weekly formulation of liraglutide to enable an even stronger decision base for which one to take further into pre-approval trials. And that actually then you can say extends the analysis period by six months, but we will be generating more firm basis to make the decision because we have realized we can do this in a such a short period.</p>
          <p>Which preference? Well, depends on who you are.  If you are a guy who likes new molecules and likes to do cardiovascular outcome studies pre--approval and all the uncertainty about toxicology, et cetera, et cetera, then you would clearly go for the inherently once weekly acting analogue semaglutide. If you actually prefer to take the risk at the level of the formulation chemist and not so much the cardiovascular outcomes and the toxicology programs, then you would go with liraglutide, because there is a lower cost burden in Phase 3, there's going to be a lower exposure, because we can piggyback on the existing database both from the LEADER trial but also from the URS and other databases that have reported post-marketing adverse events for liraglutide.</p>
          <p>So obviously I would like to see the lira-depo formulation make it all the way, but it's too early to speculate.</p>
          <p>In terms of obesity, I think what we are doing is a huge trial.  It's 3,600 patients, it's starting in the middle of the year, and it will actually be such that we get a lot of data, maybe in about 1,000 patients, that are continued for a total of three years.  They are mainly the ones who have pre-existing pre-diabetes at the onset of the trial, while those who do not but are just obese, they will be only continued for one year, and that means that we can submit on one-year data.  So we submit on one year, but supply the agency with follow-ups during the regulatory review.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Peter Verdult from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, afternoon, everyone. Peter Verdult here from Morgan Stanley.  Two questions, Mads on Victoza, and then Jesper on financial guidance.  Just following up from the previous question, Mads, given what we saw yesterday in the obesity setting, in terms of discussions you've had to date with the FDA going into Phase 3 for Victoza and obesity, should we be concerned at all that there is a risk they come back to you and require a full cardiovascular study pre-approval? Or are you hinting that you're going to be able to rely on the LEADER program in diabetes, a kind of vascular outcome study?</p>
          <p>And then a quick part two to the first question.  I see that -- it's good to see the Victoza Degludec combination moving into Phase 3. Could you just then discuss for my benefit, I'm not sure if it's well known out there in the market, how you've overcome some of the sort of technical difficulties with respect to allowing the insulin dose to be adjusted whilst keeping the GLP-1 dose fixed?</p>
          <p>And then Jesper, this may be a bit unfair, given you've just raised your financial guidance 500 basis points, but when we think about the flexibility of that 35% and potentially think about upside, your R&amp;D budget in absolute terms is approaching $2 billion.  You said in the past that you're targeting an 18% R&amp;D margin, but when you actually think about that in absolute numbers, that's basically from an already high level of R&amp;D spend, factoring in maybe a 70% increase in R&amp;D.  That to me seems quite a lot incremental R&amp;D, given what you're already doing. So I just want to try and sort of just confirm that that 35% does assume that you're moving up to 18% of R&amp;D going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien here. Yeah, I can tell you that Mads is smiling based on your analysis.  He is drooling over the funds that are seemingly coming in his direction.  But first of all, he has to explain the <mark type="inaudible" /> obesity study and then maybe give a comment on the combo, how we intend to deal with the issues, inherent issue of having two active ingredients in one mixture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, both of your, excellent questions, and I do have to say that that specific question has been discussed with the Food and Drug Administration, to the extent that we have asked specifically with the LEADER trial doing whatever we can do in terms of interim analysis without losing statistical degrees of freedom, et cetera, combined with the existing adverse event databases that we will have at that point for liraglutide, do they perceive there to be a need for a cardiovascular outcomes trial for the obesity indication, and the response was no, it would suffice what we had ongoing. However, I cannot predict about the future, and you can never know if new changes were to happen within the agency, but as it stands today, we've been guided towards adequacy of what we have and are doing currently.</p>
          <p>With regards to the fixed ratio combination product, what we're utilizing is the notion that liraglutide at -- and Degludec for that matter because of the long smooth action profiles, actually can be titrated up and down without too many untoward side effects being seen. This means that we clearly prefer to have a fixed ratio combo, where you titrate according to the insulin, and then we've adjusted the ratio between the two such that for the majority of the patients, and here we are thinking potentially 80%, we will have pharmacologically active GLP-1 concentration. However, they will, from a day-to-day perspective, actually of course be minuscully changing as we change the insulin titration index.  We do not want to operate with very complex devices that rather than enhance convenience, actually distort convenience.  So if you want the ultimate free titratability of the two individual components, you should use a Degludec pen and a Victoza pen side by side.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Mads.  Then onto the guidance. Are there in the guidance, the long-term guidance of 35% operating margin, included an expected growth of R&amp;D ratio from current close to 16%, to 18%. Lavishly funding Mads Krogsgaard's project.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No I --  I think there is a expectation of continued investments in R&amp;D, and I think it's interesting, when you look at actually the lifted performance in terms of return on invested capital, there on that line you actually see the impact of Novo Nordisk organically continuously being able to innovate on our portfolio.  So where can you feel that we historically have received a very good on those investments in R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>The baseline for setting these long-term targets is a R&amp;D to sales investment level of around 16%.  I cannot see, in the next two-, three-year horizon, that we will be approaching the 18% level, but of course to some degree, it will depend on how the -- also the inflammation pipeline is evolving, and as we, with that pipeline, hopefully begin to get some clinical proof-of-concepts, and if we're successful there and the commercial value of these compounds merits it, then of course that could be a factor that would increase it. Currently we are spending about 10% of our overall R&amp;D spend on inflammation, and that of course could be increased.</p>
          <p>In the haemophilia area, I think we are well invested and we have a full portfolio, so that looks promising, and likewise within the diabetes care arena.  So I think you should assume that we will be at the 16% ballpark.  There will be flexibility in the target, and that will depend on the regulatory requirement, the sizes of the Phase 3 needed, and we are comfortable with setting the 35% market and still organically being able to push forward a broad portfolio of diabetes and haemophilia products.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  The first question, could you just remind us what if any ambitions you have for the thrice-weekly Degludec dose, given the results we've seen?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, and apologies if this betrays my misunderstanding of HbA1c, but people generally assume this is a measure of sort of medium-term average blood glucose concentration.  If you're tied &#x2013; if you're going to the same level as LANTUS with Degludec, and your fasting plasma glucose is lower, doesn't that mean there must be some other times when the blood glucose is higher with Degludec, for example, around meal times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Excellent two questions. Mads Krogsgaard first, the trice-weekly, and then a scientific question on how on earth you can have the same HbA1c for the difference in fasting plasma glucose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, really good questions. On the three times weekly ambition, do bear in mind that one of studies actually showed that when people who had pre-existing LANTUS theraglargine therapy went into a four-week titration period with glargine actually improving their glucose, we could then add three times weekly Degludec -- or, sorry, shift it to three times weekly Degludec, and actually further improve glycemic parameters over a 12-week period.  So actually three times weekly does work. It nicely reduces glucose, also in a safe way, yet it just lost or missed the non-inferiority margin versus glargine in these two studies simply because they were not dosed high enough to give the total weekly insulin dose that was comparable to that for LANTUS.  So what we will do in the lifecycle management phase of this project is further investigate options to reduce injection frequency based on the increased insight that we have into the molecule at the current time.</p>
          <p>In terms of HbA1c, it is so that at poor control levels, 70% of the HbA1c contribution is deducted from fasting glucose contributions, and 30% from PPG, postprandial glucose, when you are around 10% A1c.  As you move towards normality A1c of about 7%, it's the reverse. That 70% is postprandial contribution and 30% is fasting plasma contribution.  And here you can say the --</p>
          <p>your remark is absolutely true.  When we go to the -- a same A1c, how the heck are we able to actually have a improved fasting glucose?  It is due to the notion that glargine has a peak profile which builds into the next day.  So during some of the day hours, you do have more glargine present because of the peak, and this then can contribute to some of the meal time regulation but also daytime hypoglycemia.  Obviously, what you want to do in a real-world setting is combine Degludec, which we have not done in these studies, with a prandial glucose regulator such as the GLP-1 agonist or a DPP-4 inhibitor, and this has, for all practical purposes not been part of the program, but it for sure will in Phase 3b, because there you will level out the playing field in that regard while preserving the benefit of the fasting glucose superiority of Degludec.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much for taking my two questions.  So a first question, just on some IMS data from the U.S. I think looking at the latest NRX trends on NovoLog and NovoLog Mix, it appears to be a share loss to Humalog in the U.S.  Now I think the dynamic share is showing stable market share.  So question is, does this mean the products are under pressure for -- and are you losing share for those people who are already on brand, and has this anything to do with the loss of the United contract last year?  So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question's just looking into the profit margins in the biopharmaceutical division, they were quite substantially lower in the fourth quarter.  Could you explain just a bit generally why this is? First thought is that the Phase 3 trials for the Factor VIIa and the Factor IX only start in 2011, so it wouldn't seem to be R&amp;D, but if you could give us an idea of what's going on there, and then idea of the profitability of that division going forward, that would be very useful.  Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. This is Lars Rebien here.  It is correctly observed that when we isolate and focus on the mix segment in the United States, Lilly has had some success and with their Humalog mix at the expense of our business, so there has been a slight decline in share for our business.  I'd like to recall your attention to the fact that we have been focusing on launching Victoza, and we have now redirected salesforce to the modern insulins as well, and so we are expecting to see that trend change in the future when we have established our new salesforce in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Jesper, is this correct that there is a margin impact in the fourth quarter of our biopharm business? To what extent can you explain this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The margin impact is partly coming from investments in R&amp;D in the final quarter, and it's partly coming from the previously discussed legal provisions which also are partly hitting the biopharm franchise, so these would be the two factors.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So with that, ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to conclude the call.  A webcast is going to be loaded on our home page, and as you know, we will be getting on the road as we speak, and hopefully we'll be seeing more of you in the days to come, either in London, Copenhagen, New York, Boston, Chicago, wherever you may be.
