        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us in this conference call, related to the third quarter of 2012 of Petrobras. During the period, we delivered a net income of R$5,567 million and EBITDA was R$14,375 million, both substantially higher than the ones that we delivered in the second quarter of this year. Oil production in Brazil was 1.904 million barrels per day, 3% lower than our production in Q2 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, we will be talking about the reasons for this decline. Nevertheless, the production of natural gas grew by 4%. Also during this period, we've installed a new platform FPSO Cidade de Anchieta with a production capacity of 100,000 barrels per day and full production should be achieved in March 2013, around six months after the production startup. And today we are already producing 43,000 barrels a day from three wells. In this period, we also made important discoveries in the post-salt, particularly in the Northeast of Brazil, in the Sergipe-Alagoas and Cear&#xE1; basins.</p>
          <p>In refining, we broke a record in the output of oil products, 2.026 million barrels in the quarter vis-&#xE0;-vis 1.866 million one year ago. This was partially driven by the startup of the recently installed units. The REPAR coking unit, for instance started operating in this period. And Petrobras also maintained its participation in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the seventh consecutive year.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about our oil and NGL production in Brazil. As I mentioned before, in the quarter we saw a drop in production of 66,000 barrels per day corresponding to 3% of production. And the main drivers were the scheduled maintenance stoppages that lasted longer than expected: as was the case in the P-52 and P-19 platforms. And a major part of the downtime happened particularly in September.</p>
          <p>The total impact of maintenance stoppages in the quarter was of 77,000 barrels per day and when compared to the second quarter, which was 52,000 barrels per day. We see the growing effect of scheduled stoppages on production and the result, a lower efficiency in this period, with stoppages and major workovers, which reduced production by 35,000 barrels due to inefficiencies when compared to previous quarters.</p>
          <p>The natural production decline also accounted for minus 57,000 barrels. But now if we look at September, we have a production estimate which is 1,941,000 barrels. And as we are getting close to the end of October, we expect this forecast to materialize. And it tends to &#x2013; on an upward turn until the end of the year which lead us to believe that we will be achieving our production target which is 2,022,000 barrels or more or less 2%.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we analyze domestic prices vis-&#xE0;-vis international prices. Domestic prices went up at the end of June and beginning of July. We saw price increases both for diesel and gasoline. However, as we can see on this chart, the curve that shows international prices, that is to say the blue line at the top, shows a marked increase at the beginning of the quarter, expanding this price gap by the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Also in this period, we saw an increase in gasoline importation, due to the high demand of the domestic market which led us to supply the market by means of import. Diesel on the other hand had a somewhat lower average than the last quarter, on account of new equipment that we now have in our refineries.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the lifting cost on the next slide, we see that lifting cost net of the government take vis-&#xE0;-vis the previous period, or quarter-on-quarter. We can see that there was a growth of 17% and those were primarily due to personnel expenses coming from the Collective Bargaining Agreement that was signed in September. And we took this as a single payment event resulting from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:45) in this quarter only.</p>
          <p>We also had more <mark type="ph" /> workovers (8:55) and recovery efficiency, and this leads to a greater resource allocation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:02). And this can be measured and one of the main factors, which is the application of rigs. We do repair and recovery of our production capacity. And in the second quarter, we applied 762 rig days on this activity; and in Q3, 942 rig days.</p>
          <p>All this, added to a lower production, led to an increased average production cost. Domestic output of oil products went up as I have already mentioned, hitting a record mark in the period. And by upgrading our refining products and the better performance and efficiency, we have been able to increase the production, which is one of the oil products that has an increasing demand particularly in this quarter, in the third quarter as we will see in a moment. And with this efficiency we were able to reach a utilization factor of 98% of our refining capacity.</p>
          <p>However, our refining cost went up and this was driven from payroll expenses, as I have already mentioned, the Collective Bargaining Agreement, and which is also a partial impact on refining and also scheduled maintenance stoppages which occurred more often in the third quarter than in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's see the oil products sales in Brazil. Our domestic market continues to grow, and in the last 12 months we grew by 6.4%. And this growth was achieved mainly due to the increase in the demand from gasoline. And several factors came into play, such as fleet increases and also competition with ethanol, because gasoline partially replaces alcohol. And the demand for diesel also grew by 4%. But on a quarter-on-quarter comparison, we had a 5% increase. And there you have seasonality and the effect <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:42) strength of the economy overall.</p>
          <p>And quarter-over-quarter, the demand for diesel grew by 8% and gasoline, 2%. And our trade balance ended up with a deficit, and the deficit was even greater than the second quarter. And the gap of imports minus exports amounted to 271,000 barrels per day. And this was driven by a reduction in exporting oil, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:20) or import of oil to supply the domestic market now that our refineries are equipped to better refine the product for which there is a domestic demand. Part of that is supplied by oil import and also gasoline, which is imported directly to supply &#x2013; to keep with the demand.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we see our operating income. The operating income grew by more than R$3 billion quarter-over-quarter. And it was impact in a bigger part by the price increase and part by the sale of volume that grew compared to the previous quarter. But the sales volume, as we mentioned, was primarily supported by import. And this brought about higher cost for the segment.</p>
          <p>Refining costs also contributed to push the cost up for Petrobras products both from refining and from E&amp;P. Production cost for these two segments went up and this brought an upward pressure in the cost of goods sold and therefore partially bringing down our operating income. And in this period, we also saw a lower number of dry wells written off. And this was partially offset by the Collective Bargaining Agreement, which entailed an additional cost as well.</p>
          <p>Now looking our net income, we see the effect of the operating income, R$3.318 billion. And the financial result which were the main factors coming into play. And the currency stability gave us a greater stability as well in the quarter. And therefore we didn't have a change in the currency and the exchange variation or cost impacting our debt. And with all that we delivered a net income of R$5.767 billion.</p>
          <p>Now talking about E&amp;P, our operating income also had a slight increase, but the price was favorable to us and the difference between Brent and heavy oil that we produce &#x2013; or this gap was reduced in this period. And we had a lower production, we had lower revenues and with a higher production cost that brought about an increase in the cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>With that and with a smaller number of dry holes written off in the period, all that took the operating income for this segment to R$16.380 billion. And for downstream, we saw a price increase. The price increase was the main reason that led to a reduction in losses which dropped to R$8.600 billion. We sold more <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:18) higher sales were partially offset by the cost increase of imported goods. And we also had a higher depreciation because of the new equipment such as <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:39) and REPAR coking unit that started operating recently.</p>
          <p>And finally on this slide, we see the company's debt. Overall, it went up from R$179 billion to R$186 billion quarter-over-quarter. But the debt increase was practically all to our cash and cash equivalents since our net debt remained stable. And this was possible because we negotiated with our pension funds with which we had R$5.800 million worth of Federal Government bonds and that guaranteed <mark type="ph" /> actuarial (17:44) debt of the company and it was replaced by another debt. We were therefore able to increase our cash equivalent without incurring more debt.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:55) &#x20AC;2 billion and &#xA3;450 million which are not included in our cash equivalent <mark type="audio gap" /> (18:06 &#x2013; 18:12) because we only came in the month of October while we completed our funding process. But this shows that we have a great appetite from investors for Petrobras.</p>
          <p>And finally we have reached our investments. This investment that you see on the slide lead us to conclude that by September they seem to confirm the priority identified by our business plan., our 2012, 2016 business and management plan to focus on developing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:51) production. As you can see, year-on-year we saw an increase from 48% to 52% in investments made in this segment.</p>
          <p>And with that, we would like to close our remarks and in case you have questions, we will be available to answer them. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Good morning to all. Thank you for this conference call. I have some questions about production. In the Roncador we had marked reduction in production. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:19) longer stoppages? What was the problem in P-52? And the number for October, is that considered completely normal like the production in the field of Roncador?</p>
          <p>My second question is about the S-curve presented in the business and management plan. I would like to understand that the oil projects for 2013, if they have the same timeline. Particularly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:46) and the one in the and the one in the Northeast, the ones that will have an operational startup in the beginning of the year. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bruno. As for P-52, we completed the scheduled maintenance stoppage in September and in the beginning of October. We will no longer suffer any effects on this production. What happened there? Both in P-52 and P-19 the longer stoppages were linked to weather conditions. We had have a workover in the two units for these workovers we required a maximum wind and wave conditions and those conditions were not there in September and that's why they had to prolong the stoppages in these two units for a few days longer than we had initially forecast. That led to an additional impact coming from scheduled maintenance stoppages and this is why the September production contributed more, because of the stoppages of these two units <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:05) productions <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:13). There are no problems in the platform or in the wells.</p>
          <p>Moving on to your second question about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:28). These two projects continue 100% on target. We expect good performance in the shipyards, as they will be doing the integration <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:46), there is no indication of delays in the units. In the subsea units in terms <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:55) connect for first oil. Everything is under control. All the projects for oil production in 2013 are fully on target.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all and thank you for the call. My two questions are related at the overall increase of other operating expenses in the quarter. A strong increase compared to the same quarter of last year and quarter-on-quarter. In case <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:46) and if not, could you perhaps identify the main factors that contributed to this increase?</p>
          <p>My second question has to do with refining. With all the interest of the company to increase output <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:05) 70% of their capacity. My question has to do with downstream and logistics for distribution, transportation and storage. With an increased demand, if the demand continues to grow, is there any bottleneck that we should expect for the distribution and transportation of fuel in the county? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcus thank you for the question. We will have one of our officers to answer the first question and then we'll &#x2013; regarding your second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed, we are increasing the output of our refinery. They are reaching a very high level of production. They don't <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:07) refinery output <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:12) gasoline, diesel distribution point. In other words, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:15) to the market, the distribution part is most important. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:20) everything is perfectly satisfied, we might have some difficulty looking forward. It invests inventory <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:30) of inventories asset in refineries. So, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:35) and production is comparable with market demand. And we're basically supplying market demand even at this moment and this pick-up demand should continue in the last quarter of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcus, This is Barbassa, again. As for your second question regarding other operating expenses. These are non-recurring items. At least the main factors are recurring which is the payment resulting from the Collective Bargaining Agreement with our workers which was signed in the first quarter of 2012 and which was also paid in the third quarter. This is a non-recurring item and it is the main factor to be highlighted accounting for this marked increase in operating expenses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all. I have two questions going. First, going back to our discussion related to production. Actually, I continue finding it very difficult to understand the increase of local <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:07) and the increased maintenance stoppages versus the depreciation levels that we see in production. I would like to better understand how much of that increase in workover cost was normal <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:25) just perhaps catching up with a period where there was a lower focus on increasing production and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:31).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps these workovers are late perhaps that's why we see a more aggressive decision now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much of that can you still catch up? What would be the additional cost for you to effectively recover this production decline <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:55)? We are trying to understand for how long this investment will have to continue so high and when we should see some effective improvement in the company's production. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:12) very specific in terms of depletion because I understand that the maintenance <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:17) but in terms of depletion, what is the cost increase? What was your expectation perhaps last year? And when can we see effectively an improvement in that aspect? That is my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question has to do with the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Most of that expense is actually recurring, right, because your manpower and training cost will be higher. Could you perhaps give how much is bonus and how much is an increase to payroll for the next few quarters? And I agree <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:52) understanding of this comparison year-on-year because according to the space, quarter that that payment happened which that you haven't increased year-on-year but you said this was recurring. If you could please explain this effect better? And a quick follow-up, if you can comment <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:14), why is it that we have such a good variation in the supplies in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, you asked for two questions, right? Okay, let's try to answer the first one, related to production and cost of recovery. We'd like to &#x2013; Officer Formigli is here to answer your question, and then I will try to answer the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Formigli. Paula. Good morning. With regards to a production decline, as you know, a production is a combination of the potential multiplied by efficiency. And with that, we get to an <mark type="ph" /> overall (30:15) production. Obviously, when there is a production decline <mark type="ph" /> which is to other <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:21) not able to recover oil or because it is due to a higher inefficiency, higher than we had before. So what drove the decline? The decline that we've seen is a couple of things and for Petrobras as a whole. Let's think about Petrobras as a whole, which is a decline of 10% to 11%. The decline is perfectly aligned with the best practices &#x2013; corporate best practices. With regard to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:58) that we have, we should look at what is considered an adequate number <mark type="ph" /> where the decline will be 17% (31:08). Our number <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:11) is around 11%.</p>
          <p>But there is a decline. That has been partially offset by a number of actions in new wells. I'm not going to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:25) new wells in new systems, I'm talking about supplementary development where we put more <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:31) production in a certain field, <mark type="ph" /> total (31:35) drilling all through the Varredura Project where we look for deeper water over there.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" />We didn't yet get the (31:45) production of all of these wells that will be announced with the Varredura Project <mark type="ph" /> that was just (31:52) 100,000 barrels per day. <mark type="ph" /> That's offset with (32:00) so-called well decline.</p>
          <p>There's no way that we can avoid well decline. But you have to identify all <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:10) that exists, even after we injected water and this is what we have done to try to offset that decline. Okay, so I talked about decline. Decline is under control. I will now talk about the other part of the equation, efficiency.</p>
          <p>We all know that and we make it very clear &#x2013; we made it very clear in the second quarter &#x2013; that we have an inefficiency issue associated to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:43). On the operational units <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:51), but in order to adopt an operating efficiency improvement program, which is already getting results. Had we not adopted the program, today we would be producing 16,700  barrels less. So we are already reaping a benefit from this. And we estimate <mark type="ph" /> and it's in greater (33:16) benefit, close to 25,000 &#x2013; 24,000 barrels per day on average of this year resulting from this production, from the efficiency improvement program in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:30).</p>
          <p>So you might ask &#x2013; okay, if the efficiency is improving, how come production declined in September? Well, the reason for that was that in addition to scheduled maintenance stoppages as I mentioned, and they were scheduled, they lasted longer than initially estimated because of weather conditions. But it was also, in this case &#x2013; in the operating unit Rio de Janeiro, there were one-time <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:00). And once in a while problem linked to the equipment in <mark type="ph" /> P-67. The P-63 (34:18) problems have all been solved, the <mark type="ph" /> P-67 (34:23) problems, where more than half of the wells <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:30) resolved in terms of submersible equipment and it is &#x2013; we have the rigs to solve those problems.</p>
          <p>To conclude, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:47) operating unit in the Campos Basin, we are improving. You have the results of that improvement and less about costs <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:56) operating cost, we invested almost $400 million there, $396 million to be exact and we have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:15) of $350 million. So we have been thinking, you are spending more <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:27) the efficient equipment problem, it is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:29) program. We are intending to invest [$26 billion (35:35) in operating cost by 2016 and another $1 billion in investment until 2016. [indiscernible] from $1.635 (35:46) billion. This is all dollars by the way. I forgot to say which country I was referring to in [ph] NPAV (35:50) so invested, as I said, $396 million and we are having a return slightly above $351 million.</p>
          <p>So we were able to prove the benefits that we are going to derive by investing in these wells. This supplement incremental efficiency, we are at this point completing the operating efficiency improvement program called the UO Rio de Janeiro. You might wonder why. In <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:35) operating unit <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:36) Rio de Janeiro in terms of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:38) unfortunately, in one to two years we might face a situation similar to that of the Campos Basin. The UO Rio de Janeiro handles higher production partly from the Campos Basin.</p>
          <p>So we'll continue to detail specific efficiency improvement program for it and on November 19th, we are going to internally launch this program in Petrobras <mark type="ph" /> relative to expected return (37:07). In November 19th, we will inform all the investments and expected results so that we will not face the problems that we are facing in Campos.</p>
          <p>Is it going to be at <mark type="ph" /> at the best (37:24)? Certainly not. In that UO RJ, Rio de Janeiro, it is a lot smaller than the UO Campos Basin. But we need to have a firm structured program of action focused to both on clients, particularly on clients and a little bit less on the wells <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:45) we will be facing an issue from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:51) of the Campos Basin and we do not want that <mark type="ph" /> talked about decline (37:53), I talked about efficiency. And later on, if there's time, we can talk about the operating cost optimization program for the company as a whole. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>To continue with your question, in terms of the costs linked to the collective bargaining agreement for the workforce and that recurring piece, 16% to 20% of that cost is recurring, 80% of the cost will be seen only in this quarter. That would be the breakdown for a salary increase. It is calculated in this way.</p>
          <p>And for the account suppliers, if we go back to the chart that shows our trade balance, you will see that there was an increase in our imports and then the chart of the prices is actually better because you see how fast prices grew and imports grew between July and September. We see how gasoline imports grew on that period so there was also an increase in the imports of oil in this quarter. This is linked to a higher currency value that leads to debt with suppliers, which is also higher. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions for Formigli. The first one is regarding production decline, he talks about the decline but I'm not sure if he was referring to Campos. If not, I would want to use Campos as an example. I would like to know what is the decline you're using and how you calculate this decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Auro, can you hear me? Good morning, Auro. I will explain how we calculate the decline. Decline is calculated field-by-field. That is the first data point. Obviously, we have an average decline. And we informed that average decline probably 11% for all fields. The decline potential is calculated field-by-field. Every field has its own characteristics. There are fields where we have &#x2013; I'll just concentrate on the major fields okay? So there are fields where we have an average decline of, let's say, 10%, today we have a 10% decline in mining. How is this calculated?</p>
          <p>There is <mark type="ph" /> the potential number of (42:13) reservoir for all of the wells that you have drilled and <mark type="ph" /> encased. Let's assume (42:24) that there are no restrictions in terms of what Christmas tree, in terms of subsea equipment and related to platforms, in terms of runoff of production. So given these things, it depends on our operating action is 100% available. What is the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:45) potential for that field. So you compare year-on-year, what is that potential or what that potential is.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> 100% (42:54) decline &#x2013; if you ask, do you do anything to offset that decline and the answer is yes, because over time, the potential of a year ago, especially recovered or offset by new wells that are added. Well, because of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:14) development in Petrobras. How did we do that?</p>
          <p>In managing the reservoir, I'm going to repeat some things that I mentioned in the previous answer. We are managing in your action in terms of pressure in water arrival and most of our offshore projects, we have to inject a lot of water and this is among the best practices of the industry in managing this water, if we don't inject water the decline is going to be very accelerated because in the reservoir there's a separation between oil and gas <mark type="ph" /> and this should have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:57) decrease in the volume of oil produced.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:05) what you call a reservoir fluctuation, <mark type="ph" />each of them (44:10) having more oil in that volume and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:11). And this is having a very low recovery factor. We will always able to get a recovery factor certified for proven <mark type="ph" /> reserve <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:26) of 58%. I'm going to say recovery factors certified, <mark type="ph" /> the proven reserves <mark type="indiscernible" /> of 58% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:31) inject a lot of water <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:41). So that decline is measured with the amount of water you have compared to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:49) conditions at the reservoir because of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:52). Because of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:55), it is a 12% decline per year and we offset that by new wells in the production area coming due for decline. This is the dynamics of controlling decline. Did you have another question?</p>

I mean what we observed is that in the last 12 months <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:44) in June of 2012, <mark type="ph" /> this Campos <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:46) 560 wells with the <mark type="ph" /> achieved steady (45:49) production. <mark type="indiscernible" /> Petrobras as any other operator (45:51).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions. Barbassa, the first one is for you. I would like you to speak about management, cash production and dividend. The same ROI that we haven't seen sort of <mark type="indiscernible" /> to reduce the tax bar, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:53) today.</p>
          <p>I would like to understand from you a little bit by the mindset of the management and the mindset of the Board for dividends payout looking forward. Will you tend to migrate to the minimum dividends payout or the mindset remains to pay the same dividends for <mark type="ph" /> &#x2013; come on and take care of your shares (48:21). So I would like to know about the dividends payout policy for Petrobras looking forward.</p>
          <p>That is my first question. My second question is <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Cosenza (48:31). I just want to understand, the way we are doing our own math about the Petrobras refining result, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:47). We'd still see a large loss so I would like to understand if <mark type="ph" /> such release, thinking, using <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:58) unable generate a positive result or perhaps we are doing the wrong calculations here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for your questions. Regarding your first question, this isn't about interest on capital, take into account some important variables and the cash management is one of them, a very important one and what do I mean by that? What you see in our income statement in terms of taxes payable, these are the taxes that we had to pay during the period. And, our accounting department has the competence and the responsibility for the calculation and the disbursement with &#x2013; on a cash basis. And, this is how we deal with that with our internal revenue service and the reason that we do have time to optimize results until the end of the period. So, this is one of the points and the other point has to do with the preference and the common shares and the dividends, whether we're going to pay the same dividends which is a decision made by our Board. Only after the Board decides, we will be able to inform you. And, our dividend payout policy continues to do the same. There is no change in this policy. So, I would like to give the floor to Cosenza to answer your second question.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gustavo, in general, we see many opportunities to offset these prices. Cost reduction is an important discipline and we have the Procop program that is established in the company; it's in force. And, we intend to continue working with a lot of determination to achieve important cost reduction. And, we have many new facilities in the pipeline. And, we would be first increasing this with the integration of our refining parts and the integration of the new units to the existing refining parts. As Barbassa said, the REPAR's coking unit is a very important gain and it started operating in June &#x2013; August with an important contribution <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:34) substantially change the refining process in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:42). This is where we are creating our best in the new refinery with a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:50) management we intend to offset that, bringing our refining to other levels, higher than the ones that we have in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:03) that is being built and with very strong operations and the support we are looking for in order to cope with the difficulties as you mentioned yourself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I apologize for the third question. You mentioned that the depreciation of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:28) ended up increasing due to the new equipment installed. Could you revisit this point? You had a 30% increase in depreciation in the refinery operations. Would this be consistent, every quarter, should we expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This has to do with accounting of the assets that were under construction and when they started out with depreciation <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:08) started and in a scenario &#x2013; in terms of depreciation, already counted on most of the equipment already depreciated so the coming into play of a new unit &#x2013; the startup of the new unit and that having a high relative effect and this is a fact that occurs over the next quarters. We have other units that will be started up and the investment that we make in the improvement of quality. And, also we have higher complexity in these units. So, our forecast is that by the end of the year practically everything should be concluded. And, during this period, we should see the inclusion of new units started up but as these are added <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:21) higher values so we have all the assets we depreciated and we are adding new assets as I said. So, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:38) start to decrease gradually and as they are ready to be started up then we have to add them and this will have an effect on depreciation.</p>

          <p>Good morning. My first question is referring &#x2013; you mentioned $400 million in the quarter. Is it possible to separate what was maintenance cost from your lifting cost, and what was the additional cost &#x2013; the contribution of the REPAR's new coking units? And, maybe it would be better to ask a second question <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:03). Could you make a general evaluation about the project to release cash for the company? The first one is the sale of your assets in the Gulf of Mexico and should we expect something similar to that? And, in the past you mentioned the acceleration of the recovery of your accounts receivable which is close to R$4.4 billion and the improvement in the working capital as well. So, could you talk about these three projects please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pedro, good morning. It's something &#x2013; it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:06) R$357 million in net present value but this has happened only in the third quarter. This has accumulated <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:37) locally since April, although we have announced PROEF externally, I think it was in June. We had already implemented PROEF in April and so we followed this up very frequently to be sure that the actions are bringing about the expected results. And, regarding the assets of the Campos Basin, we have over 72% ready today and we can say well this is very good because in the past our efficiencies were lower than 70% and to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:24) is very difficult and it's quite a lot of work that is necessary too. We intend to improve this in the next few quarters. You also brought up the expenses. I can tell this in relative terms. This is a characteristic now due to the PROEF. What I can tell you is one-thirds approximately of our costs in reals has to do with maintenance. And, two-thirds, we have the Collective Bargaining Agreement and it is associated to what you call the direct operating costs which is the lifting cost for Petrobras. The maintenance cost is very much impacted by the operating improvement activity in the Campos Basin. And, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (60:37) no, this is not the situation. But, this is what you should consider. I am not going to talk about absolute figures but one-thirds maintenance and two-thirds operations. So, you can do the math yourself, okay? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The impact in terms of costs, I'm talking about positives in the Bargaining Agreement, 95% is represented by the stoppage cost and the collective agreement. So, these are the major impacts. We have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:37). And, to answer your third question, it has to do with the release of funds for the company cash. In the third quarter, we added the funds that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (62:12) as a guarantee <mark type="indiscernible" /> (62:14) our pension fund that allowed us to improve our debt level. This is something very important for Petrobras, the fact that we could release the funds. In the electric industry, for example, we continue to negotiate with them <mark type="indiscernible" /> (62:46) deal with them. We managed; we had a rollback in October so this is not included in the balance sheet. We were able to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (63:06) issue. We intend to materialize our production forecast. In our investment area, we structured our whole organization here at headquarters, concentrating those activities here in order to optimize <mark type="indiscernible" /> (63:43) to optimize our working capital. Our program is very mature, with a high level of activity. And, we have a program also available to our suppliers so that we can work with cash anticipation for the company in a right and adequate way. And, at this point, we are planning to release as many times as possible to have our cash with us. Our cash is quite liquid. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (64:50) does not include their funding for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (64:53), &#xA3;400 million and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (65:04).</p>

We <mark type="indiscernible" /> (65:43) at the end of August so you should consider actually that those expenses from April to August <mark type="indiscernible" /> (65:50).

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. My question was on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (70:52) of how that is going. This is <mark type="ph" /> before indiscernible (70:58) Gulf of Mexico assets and while net debt-to-cap is already at a high level if crude prices fall and divestments are coming in a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (71:09) fashion, what would you do? <mark type="indiscernible" /> (71:20)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try to answer your question as much as possible. There has been a technical problem and it's very hard to hear your question. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (71:44) relating to our debt level, looking forward, we are looking at our investment in production. In our business and management plan, you have to look at the production of <mark type="ph" /> 3.022 million (72:10) barrels per day more or less 2%.</p>
          <p>We should exceed that production. We estimated an increase in prices, which has not totally happened. They continue <mark type="indiscernible" /> (72:36) a price increase so as to maintain our debt level lower. Therefore, these are our price policy <mark type="indiscernible" /> (72:58) be able to go over the 2.5 times net over &#x2013; net debt over EBITDA. But <mark type="ph" /> we are approaching this issue (73:16) right now, will depend on some variables <mark type="ph" /> and realign the variables (73:28) we can project the result but only project on that. So we'd like to stick to our business plan. We are working very hard on other variables so that we can release funds to our cash as mentioned before. And with that, we would be able to achieve our level and maintain them at the most adequate level possible.</p>
          <p>Now, again, it depends on a lot of things that can happen on several fronts looking forward. But we're working on those variables. They are strictly under our control. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a follow-up for the question that has already been asked. I would like to understand what is the reason for the non-payment of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (74:51) equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (75:02), have on the balance sheet, return on capital <mark type="indiscernible" /> (75:13) has already been reimbursed. As I said before, the inclusion of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (75:32) in our balance sheet where you will see the balance sheet by accrual basis, but anyway, we can optimize this over the year. This doesn't mean that we are changing our policy. This means that we are optimizing our analysis and our cash management. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question has to do with the greenfield refineries. I would like to understand what is the stage of the negotiation with maybe partners? And whether this is a reality or not? And in what way this could impact your pricing policy for oil products? And afterwards, I will ask the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are going to answer the first question. A partner is always welcome in this kind of operation as we are in the oil industry and the pricing with the partnership <mark type="indiscernible" /> (77:23). We have considered that this has to be a win-win situation. It is impossible to make a view feasible if it is not a win-win situation. A win-lose situation is not acceptable. So a partnership has to be a true partnership where everybody gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the answer. Just a follow-up question. So in the sense that you're looking for partnership based on your answer and having said that, could we imagine something even more concrete by the end of this year regarding a partnership to be signed? And now my second question, how do you see the role of fuel distributors in Brazil? This is a very high consumption of oil product as <mark type="indiscernible" /> (78:28). Are you working on this or changing your relationship with distributors? Be it in terms of fuel orders or investments or tanking or logistics or whatever. So this is my second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (79:00) looking for new markets due to this high demand and this needs further construction of new tanking facilities and companies are moving in this direction. So we already see that is another part of company. They don't see this as opportunity for our business that with this growing market what we are doing is the following. We have to work even closer to them in order to avoid any <mark type="indiscernible" /> (79:38) something that we have to do every day and our commercial department is working very strongly on that hand-in-hand with distributors. And we are doing our best in this regard and consumption in October is also extremely high and we expect no difficulty whatsoever with this very strong integration between our company and the distribution people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about the follow-up of my first question? Could we expect anything regarding partnership to be announced still this year or the first half of 2013, a definition about the partnership?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any partnership depends on two parties. If I say, yes, I would be making a decision on behalf of the other party as well, so it's a very tough question to answer.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
