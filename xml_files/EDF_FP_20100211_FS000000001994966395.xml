      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So, good morning everybody. Thank you for joining today. I will do my presentation in English, since I understand there is a webcast and <mark type="inaudible" /> makes life easier for those of you who are based in London in particular. So I will do my presentation in English.</p>
          <p>So glad to present the full year numbers 2009 of EDF. I think good and strong numbers. If you look at just briefly at the key figures; sales at 66.3 billion, basically flat on a constant parameter; EBITDA at 17.46 billion, this is an increase of 22%, obviously including some of our recent acquisitions, the U.K. venture in particular; net income at 3.9 billion, very close to net &#x2013; to the recurring net income level since this year. The net of all recurring &#x2013; non-recurring items is at 18 million, plus, minus, that's basically the same number; plus 12% on a reported basis, minus 10% on a recurring basis. Operating cash flow including British Energy, 12.1 billion FFO, and FFO without British Energy, we're talking about 10.9 billion. Total, an increase of 20%.</p>
          <p>2009 was an important year for EDF, as we met several times last year to review some of our strategic steps, explaining them. Some of them are pretty significant and they will change and have changed the profile of the company outside France. The acquisition of British Energy, where we remain shareholder to the extent of 80%, 11.1 billion net of the divestiture to Centrica, and a first contribution of EBITDA &#x2013; to EBITDA, 1.7 billion. We had indicated we would at least be at 1.5, we did better by 200 million last year; good start, good progress of synergies. If you have questions, Vincent is &#x2013; Vincent de Rivaz is with us today.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of SPE, majority in SPE with the final clearance of EU in November 2009 for total amount of 1.3 billion, but really with hardly any impact in the 2009 accounts, just minor; the full impact will be next year. The acquisition of close to 50%, 49.9% in CENG, I mean, five reactors in. As you know, a transaction, which kept us pretty busy throughout the year, last year, but really successfully completed and closed in December, a total amount of 3.1 billion, and I think that franchise is progressing well. I've seen yesterday, Constellation released its capability factor &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> at 95.1% capability. It is the number one company in the U.S. by far in terms of capacity factor.</p>
          <p>The debt situation of EDF, I think some explaining. I mean, we basically concluded the year with a 42.5 billion debt level, slightly better than what we had planned initially, by close to three billion, helped by I think a better working capital management throughout the second part of the year, but basically, it's pretty much flat in terms of cash consumption. CapEx, 600 million lower than planned; and in particular, the reimbursement after the addition of the EU of 1.2 billion that helped also that situation. The two important statements in that table is essentially that we were initially anticipating a negative net free cash flow of a magnitude of 2 billion. We have roughly 1 billion positive dedicated assets. We restarted another funding for six months last year and the net of all acquisitions, BE minus Centrica plus SPE plus Constellation at 14.7 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of ratio, I mean, the debt itself doesn't mean it, all of it, but the two key ratios and it was pretty much tracked and measured by rating agencies in particular this year and debt-EBITDA of 2.4 and better than expected. We had provided a guidance between 2.5 and 3, you may remember. We're slightly below that range, 2.4, because of the better cash flow. And FFO to adjusted net debt, a classical computation at 17%, which is 1 percentage point above what we were initially planning.</p>
          <p>So this will be pretty important, because as you see at the bottom of the chart, so basically we were the second issuer of bonds last year worldwide, I think after Roche. So we've issued between EDF SA and EnBW and Edison, the amount close to 19 billion. And really it's within our fixed rate portion of 84% and a coupon of 4.4%. And maturity pretty much extended since we issued in pounds and dollars to 10 years, 30 years a few times. Overall, I think a good and solid rating and a good solid financial structure helped us really to place those bonds in the market and refinance essentially, all of our acquisitions of last year.</p>
          <p>CapEx, this has been a year of significant financial commitment, both externally and in terms of organic growth. So you see that 14.7 billion of acquisition debt, but also the CapEx, 12.4 billion with 7.2 billion in France. In France, a number to keep in mind, this includes a so-called contribution, participation to the Plan de Relance, really recovery plan. I don't know what you call it in English for &#x2013; to the magnitude of 2.3 billion. And an overall French, which is a topic we will address later on, two-thirds of that amount is essentially maintenance, both in our plants and networks.</p>
          <p>Sales growth, not much to say there, pretty much plus 4%, flat on an organic growth basis. Next is EBITDA break down, there I think a clear and important statement. You see that despite our very difficult year in France and we will get to it in a minute, this is showing a decline of 9% over a &#x2013; over the year. So we said we would be in decline, but we are clearly minus 9%, offset organically. I'm just talking about organic growth of 18%, plus that helped us to meet our guideline regarding recurring EBITDA year-to-year.</p>
          <p>So below EBITDA, just two or three words on financial results. Financial results shows a decrease or deterioration of 1.4 billion &#x2013; let's say if one, round number is &#x20AC;1.5 billion out of it, essentially an increase of the cost of debt of 1 billion &#x2013; 1.5 billion exactly, so it's related to the additional debt and 430 million related to the inclusion of long-term provisions, in particular related to BE.</p>
          <p>One piece of slight good news on the tax rate, the effective tax rate is at 28.9% versus 33% last year. Thanks to an optimization on debt location related to BE. Basically some debt pushed down into the U.K., into EDF Energy that we have organized by the end of the year, so small plus on the effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>I pass very quickly, on non-recurring items; you see nine &#x2013; 18 million in total net-net. At least it includes a number of components, maybe plus and minus, but the most important plus that you should keep in mind is the impact of the Brussels reimbursement, as you may have remembered in 2003, the 1.2 billion was split into two parts, the core parts and interest charge which goes against equity, 800 million plus; and a 220 million, which was the interest charge at the time that was charged to the P&amp;L non-recurring and is taken back into the P&amp;L non-recurring. This is the most significant positive exceptional. And we have done fewer depreciations across.</p>
          <p>It's another breakdown of EBITDA by region. If you look at this table, I think it shows it clearly. The international business has been driving our performance throughout the year, plus 18% on organic basis and plus 28% on EBIT, really with a really good strong contribution of British Energy. That over delivered compared to our, let's say, initial bid case.</p>
          <p>And overall, that's a small box to your right. We said basically we were just about to get to 50%. We are there, close to 49% in sales, 46% in EBITDA and in excess of 50% in recurring net income outside France. And I think its good news as such, because I think we now have a quite balanced portfolio and it does not even include the consolidation of CENG and SPE, we just did one month. So that goes into 2010.</p>
          <p>This is international activities. This is an area where we also commit significant resources in terms of CapEx projects. If you look at this number, it's good news. So the good and positive statement in that table is that we have a self-funding mechanism or ratio, 5.3 billion of FFO, 5.2 billion of CapEx. Basically, the growth of our portfolio outside France is now being self-funded.</p>
          <p>We have quite a few projects in front of us. I mean you see nuclear projects; the four priority countries that we have identified, U.K., U.S., China and Italy, with key dates indicative at that stage where that will consume resources over time. The magnitude to keep in mind, in total over a period of three years those projects will need 2.1 billion cumulative resources over three years, roughly 700 million per year, so if you want to keep a number in mind. Other projects that are non-nuclear are listed here; important, because they are big capacity to some extent in the magnitude of six gigawatts for the Group.</p>
          <p>Review by key countries; U.K., I think the best performer clearly last year, and our thanks to at least several factors, but thanks to a consistent output out of the plants of British Energy. As you know that some of them have been in outage for a long time. They all started as planned and they've all produced and delivered, since a good work that have been done at that time under Bill Coley. And you see a 40 &#x2013; 54.5% terawatt hours, slightly above what we have planned initially, consistent and a clear strong group. British Energy itself increased organic, just you take year-to-year, you have an addition organically of 865 million of EBITDA as a result of additional production.</p>
          <p>Second factor is obviously synergies. As you know, part of this acquisition we have an ambitious &#x20AC;220 million of synergies over three years. We already have &#xA3;65 million at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>EnBW, I think resistance is certainly the word that would characterize their performance last year. The German market and most industries have really suffered. I'm sure you've followed that from different companies and industries. In total, electricity demand decreased by 6.5% and gas demand decreased by 5% last year. Despite all that and I think through a mix effect and despite the gas sales decrease of EnBW of 22%, they have been able to show an increase of roughly 6% of EBITDA last year.</p>
          <p>Italy, very reactive, very poor start. Most of you know the Italian economic situation, where basically with decline of output in many industries, minus 20 or minus 30%. Basically, Edison sought to be extremely reactive. They were at minus 35% I think at the end of Q1. They finished at minus 13%, and overall I think OpEx controlled. They've been reactive in the pure sense of the word, let's say cutting OpEx that is at minus 1%, excluding book year and CapEx has been cut to protect their own rating. A year, I think that is as good as it could be in Italy. I think the business is still, for us, very satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Other international include still significant, I mean it's 3.4 billion of sales. EBITDA is close to 700 million. You see that we just decided to outline the contribution, I mean the 22% increase. I mean this is really significant momentum. We outline here the role of Poland. We never &#x2013; slowly &#x2013; we already talked about these three major countries of EDF, Switzerland is another one, but Poland is probably slowly emerging as an important country for us. We have five or six entities there that we're just combining with sales close to 1 billion now and an EBITDA of 240 million in Poland. And I think with all kind of interesting undertakings, in particular with biomass that has improved our position and really improved profitability.</p>
          <p>So, so far for other international, other activities essentially include two businesses, EDF Energies Nouvelles and EDF Trading. And EDF Energies Nouvelles, they published their numbers yesterday. I'm sure you have read all of them; all good news, close to 3,000 megawatt gross capacities, an enormous amount of projects. The problem is to be selective; more balanced risk and profitability. But I think there's a clear push and a strong focus now on solar energy this year and I think an increase of more than 50% last year. EDF Trading, a solid and recurring contributor; 900 million of EBITDA last year in those numbers included.</p>
          <p>Now we come to France. Frankly, France certainly experienced one of the most difficult years we ever experienced for several reasons. I mean you see the net decline of 9% of EBITDA and minus 15% EBIT. Two or three issues to be addressed here. The first one, the first impact is obviously the drop in the nuclear output to 390 terawatt hour. We had a conference call you may remember early in November, we said 390 something. We had exactly 390 terawatt hour for the year. This is a decline of 6.7% to the previous year.</p>
          <p>We have 28 terawatt missing, 17 of them results with S1 issues, and overall, with an availability factor of 78% final compared to the 79.2% of the previous year. Clearly, this is a disappointing and not satisfactory situation. In total this element alone has basically contribute to a missed EBITDA in the magnitude of &#x20AC;1 billion missing for us last year. That has been offset by the international activities of the Group.</p>
          <p>So storms by definition unpredictable, 160 million in our accounts also last year. And last, but not least, you see just to address, as you know, France is an area where we've decided to basically accelerate CapEx over the past few years, in particular in maintenance. We more than doubled, I mean 2.5 times I think the level of CapEx of four years ago, some of it is maintenance. But really if you look at the full self-funding picture of France, we have really an issue last year. So FFO at 6.7 billion, CapEx at 7.2 billion, I mean already we do not fund the CapEx plus we have a significant commitment in dedicated assets. Net-net, we have a deficit, let's say, of funding basic. I'll make it simple, funding mechanism in the magnitude of slightly in excess of &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>Since we have presented that slide in November, I'll just make a quick update, since I know some of you track it extremely precisely. This is a starting point 2008, 418 terawatt hours, 390 at year-end. You have here in grey &#x2013; you have in orange the technical aspects of the availability factors, those accounts in the competition, and those, as you know, we had three series of events that impacted to the magnitude of six terawatt hours that translates into the 78%. But in addition, we had an impact on nuclear production. Those in grey on &#x2013; and this at the end led to that 28 terawatt decline. Utilization factor was at 90.6%.</p>
          <p>I think an important table that you track at every closing, is let's say, the energy balance of the Group. To the left, generation and purchases, you'll see two key information in that table. You see again the 28 terawatt hour decline of nuclear production, but you'll see also the decline of 3.2 terawatt hours in hydro. Those are clearly missing at year-end. We basically have 30 terawatt hours of production missing.</p>
          <p>No surprise when you look to the other side of chart, the arrow should be turned the other way. It's not going up by 8.1. It's declining by eight terawatt hours. We have a decrease in the global demand approximately by 2% last year. And if you take the large industrial companies, it is minus 5%, and if you take very large industrial concerns, it's 9%. Net/net final customers minus eight terawatt hours, no surprise.</p>
          <p>Power available for sale on the wholesale markets declined 23.5, and what's also the most important statement in that chart is that for the second year in a row, we have been a net purchaser of electricity, clearly something that we want to turn around. But it is also the direct consequence of the outages that we experienced throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Now this is for the non-regulated world of EDF. Now, one word about the regulated part of the business. You'll see here, this has not been a good year either, minus 10% total. If you take out the storm impact, it's minus 6.7%; distribution down 13%; transport down 9%. You have the other factors listed on right hand side, the impact of the storm, the impact of the network losses. Basically the losses bought at 2008 prices coming into our P&amp;L in 2009, 340 million. And the postponement of TURPE3 to August that has cost us 250 million, six months has cost us 250 million in those numbers.</p>
          <p>Now just to conclude, a few words about the overall P&amp;L of France. I don't know if you have those detailed charts in the room, but basically sales, you have asked us to give us a bit more transparency on those numbers, we tried to this time. Sales are relatively flat, 260 million minus, but you'll see a positive price/tariffs impact that is 2.1% plus. A decline in volume, I outlined some of it before, minus 3.7%, and gas and services, additional sales generated by those new activities.</p>
          <p>The second part of the chart is fuel and purchases and net of CSPE, network losses 340; natural gas sourcing, the counterpart of the previous and the positive of 670 million of CSPE, not to consider one second that this is a plus for the Group, it's neutralized in the first line and basically it's plus/minus neutral for the average performance.</p>
          <p>One word about the OpEx in France. OpEx you'll see it increased by 890 million. Storms, again a contributor. External purchases 380. Mainly there's 200 million dedicated to the fixing of those technical difficulties on the fleet. Personnel expenses, 350. Wage increase out of this was 2.7%.</p>
          <p>So for the breakdown of the P&amp;L, we just provided you with the way the P&amp;L &#x2013; that would have looked like, results of social unrest impact result, the storm impact, basically to put that in perspective, because clearly we want to consider that this is of an exceptional nature or non-repetitive nature. You'll see that the comparative would be at 10.1 billion.</p>
          <p>One word about operational excellence. We're clearly committed to that program. We concluded 2009 slightly above the target for the year, 680 versus 600, and we're clearly committed to deliver the 1 billion EBITDA improvement by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>The dividend, we will propose a dividend, we said to you. We would work along the benchmark practices. As you know between 50 and 60% pay out, we're proposing a 54% pay out which is constant to the previous year, &#x20AC;1.15 per share with some additional &#x2013; with an additional payment of 0.60 in total, 2.1 billion to be paid. Out of 0.55, I just remind you that 93% of it was in form of shares that came as a capital increase at the time.</p>
          <p>I will conclude with, before I pass it on over to Henri to give some perspective for 2010. Clearly, we expect a significant increase of EBITDA in 2010, the result of various factors. The first one organically and clearly we're very focused and very dedicated to an improvement of our French operational performance, in particular as it relates to nuclear outputs, and Henri may elaborate a little bit on this afterwards. We will have the perimeter benefit of SPE and CENG coming on top, as a first consolidation if you wish, and the benefit of the third leg of operational excellence up to one billion.</p>
          <p>So we'll give you an indication of an objective. In the last year we didn't do it. We said ultimately the dividend will be obviously defined ultimately and later in the year, but we said in all cases, we have at least objectives to maintain a steady dividend this year.</p>
          <p>One word about, since it is a concern sometimes, about the balance between CapEx consumption and cash flow generation. I just want to stress here the fact that we think that in 2010 we will have FFO plus/minus one billion adjusted for the additional CapEx of new consolidated entities, U.S. and Belgium that should be slightly &#x2013; more or less in balance in self-funding out of the FFO generated by the Company.</p>
          <p>In terms of ratio, you have seen we're better than the one we planned. We maintain to give you also a framework of this stability basically in a range of 2.5 to three times EBITDA for the debt.</p>
          <p>So far for the key numbers, we can address questions afterwards, but maybe Henri would like to address other issues now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll speak to you French for a few minutes and then maybe back to English for the questions. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I'm really happy to be with you this morning. This is a new professional life for me. I think I met you before in a previous life.</p>
          <p>I'd like to say a few words, if you don't mind, about my feelings and my priorities, the priorities I've decided to pursue within the framework of this incredible Group, which is EDF. I joined EDF very enthusiastically but also with passion. As I said, this is a grand company, which has a major role to play in the field of energy, and in general, to serve the interests of our country.</p>
          <p>Now, 2009 is a cornerstone for us. As you know, it is not yet fully mirrored in the pictures &#x2013; in the figures, sorry, because this is just a snapshot of the situation of the Group. But EDF today is going through a major transition phase due to the fact that we're more international, we want to be more international, and also we have new plans in terms of our organization.</p>
          <p>And also, if we look at the electricity market and the rules that govern the market, we have to adapt to the world market. We have ambitions as well and plans because we contend that we have an essential role to play on the energy market and mainly in terms of the nuclear output, but not just the nuclear power generation. We're very much aware of these challenges and also totally aware of the fact that the Group has great potential. And in the recent past sometimes I've expressed myself very discreetly in some very select groups on a number of topical issues, and I think that is essential for the future of our Group. It's even more than essential for the Group.</p>
          <p>This is very much connected to the essential interests of the EDF Group, and this in our field, which is the field of energy. Now as far as the nuclear business is concerned, this is particularly the case and also the efficiency, the economic efficiency of the nuclear or the electricity base in France, the electricity generation in France, as we said a minute ago, and we'll dwell on this in a few minutes when you ask your questions I suppose.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I think we have a mission, which is the mission given to the special group in terms of power generation and energy. In terms of nuclear power generation, we're not the &#x2013; this is not the only element that counts in terms of the expertise of the EDF Group, but still it's one of our assets. And as you know, EDF has the biggest nuclear output in the world, 58 nuclear power plants in the world, 82 all over the world.</p>
          <p>So from far, we are the first nuclear power generator in the world. We are the company that has the highest level of expertise and the best experience if you look at the number of years when we've operated and run the nuclear power plants in our Group. And from time-to-time, I've been thinking about this situation and I was thinking about how close we are to our customers and the quality of service rendered to our clients. I'll come to this in a minute as well.</p>
          <p>What is certain is that the quality of service is essential. Our Group is based on a mission which is that of public service. This is part of our culture, it has also impacted the identity of the Group, it has also impacted our organization and this is a considerable asset that we have in the Group in terms of our international development. We need to continue the development of these businesses. So we couldn't set aside these elements. We couldn't just oversee the aspects that deals with services and the quality of services given to our clients. And also, I made a few remarks which will surprise you, concerning the way the competitive market is organized on the electricity market in France and I will continue to say things. If I am allowed to say things, not officially, of course, well, this is done regularly, but I'll do this sometimes, and I'll say what I think about these topics which are very important when it comes to protecting the interests of our shareholders and our stakeholders, that is our clients, our co-workers, our people, but also the interests of our nation.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, what counts is to fight for these interests, when I have the feeling it is my duty to do this. Here's an example. The way the electricity market is organized in France; you might have perhaps one or two questions on this. This project, which is being discussed at present in our country concerning the reorganization of the electricity market and the fact that it's going to be open to competition.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell, I'd like to recall first, my position; second, the underlying principles that I've always followed, that have led me to expressing a number of views on this. What I contend is that competition is something absolutely necessary on all markets and I am fully convinced and totally convinced that what we need is a competitive environment, but this means that since I chaired this company I love competition, but of course, as you will easily understand, I think competition is all very nice as long as we can prove that we can beat the competition. You will never hear me say that our ambition is to lose market share; so yes to competition, but yes to conquering new markets.</p>
          <p>Second thing, what about the underlying principles? Now you see, today, what we're looking at is setting a number of rules, the rules of the game. And I would like these rules to be realistic and easily understood. Any stakeholder or player should understand the rules, mainly the ones that have a key role to play in this business. The first principle is that any company has to focus on its number one priority, that is to invest in power generation, which is absolutely necessary, so that we can cover the needs of our citizens and so that we can be independent in terms of energy.</p>
          <p>So priority will be given to those who can invest in power generation, which is obvious to me. Number two, we need to maintain a consistent power generation base and to have a &#x2013; an integrated approach for each stakeholder and for EDF. Of course, that's tool for the nuclear generation, but also it's two of other forms of power generation, which is also what we have in our Group. We have a number of brands and that operate on our markets.</p>
          <p>Number three, we have to look at our economic ability to guarantee power generation over the longer run and &#x2013; in France, this means that our number one priority is to expand the life cycle of our power plants, so if we get to go ahead for this, it's all very nice to look at the longer run, 10 years, 15 years, but we need to be in a position to generate power, to generate electricity.</p>
          <p>So we have to have enough wherewithal of resources, either individually or collectively, to expand the life cycle of the existing power plants. And we could be even more ambitious, we could think about the longer run, even longer run. We could even renew the power base, the power generation facilities. I think this is a consistent objective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Lastly, any new economic market organization must comply with economic considerations naturally, combining all of which I just explained. In this context and after nearly two months of presence here although I have been focusing on the company for many years, when I look at our key challenges for the future, I would say there are six main categories that will be more naturally, but I would say, six key priorities, six key challenges.</p>
          <p>Number one priority will be, of course, efficiency and industrial performance of our existing asset base. I'd like to get back to my preliminary comments and Daniel's explanations earlier. Clearly in that area, we have clear progress to make. 2009 was a bad year. You've already been told that. The figures were confirmed, 78% availability factor. And the overall macroeconomic status is one of dependency &#x2013; independency of France due to the fact that France is an energy importer. My goal is to ensure that the trend is reversed.</p>
          <p>In other words, on the one hand, EDF has to pick up and recover, turn around its operational performance, starting with availability factor and nuclear output, and for EDF to become once again an energy exporter. In terms of availability factor, our ambitions are very clear, very straightforward. And my intent is, as early as 2010, is to keep the commitment and to improve the Kd factor by 2 points. That is the target that I have set for us in that perspective without mentioning improving the performance of other generation assets, whether hydropower, fuel fired plants or renewable energy is incorporating combined cycle, gas turbines, co-generation and so on and any other factor that can help the Group improve its performance in terms of generation output with a number of operational levers at hand to support this ambition with already by 2010.</p>
          <p>The Group has skills and expertise. I've decided to further bolster these. I have reviewed somewhat the Group's governance organization. I have requested the creation of an Executive Board that will both be select committee, but strengthened. We'll have &#x2013; we'll see the emergence of new operational managers within this Executive Committee. Herve Machenaud has been interested with responsibilities on production generation.</p>
          <p>He will be in charge with all the ambition to further boost the Group's capacities in the field of generation starting with nuclear, but not exclusively, as I said earlier. He will be charged as well with strengthening our engineering capabilities, new and existing assets, and to give us even more potential than what we have, even though that level is already far from negligible, since in this respect in engineering, we have the best expertise anywhere in the world today.</p>
          <p>Second key challenge is international business. You have understood that this is a determining factor within the group. It already accounts for &#x2013; already back in 2009, it already accounted for nearly 50% of the group's business and this will be continuing &#x2013; the trend will be continuing over the coming years. We want to be the global reference, a key player and naturally, international business and, I have to mention, plays a major role in view of the importance of France in the world of energy and of our ambitions in the world of energy. So international expansion in all our business sectors.</p>
          <p>The first one that comes to mind is to strengthen our ability to develop new generation assets throughout the world, nuclear power if there is a nuclear revival in a given country. And of course, this is a trend that seems to be confirming over time this renaissance of nuclear power, a mystery that's behind us. And due to our history, due to our expertise and performance, due to our international presence, EDF is intended to play an eminent role.</p>
          <p>Particularly starting with our role as in turnkey engineering architect, we are indeed the only ones in the world to play that role, and a view of the existing strength in terms of personnel and expertise will enable us to play determining role backed once again by the tremendous tool we have in hand, namely our current asset base. By capitalizing, by leveraging the expertise and the feedback from experience will be useful, experience that means that EDF has now become the global benchmark in this area.</p>
          <p>And all of those we have even &#x2013; we have been there &#x2013; we have been in China, as you know, since the creation of the Chinese nuclear program. And of course, EDF has been walking by the side of China throughout the development of the nuclear program there.</p>
          <p>This role will continue to support and coordinate an industrial sector, no group can go alone with, in such an adventure. So our concern will be to bolster to support the creation of industrial sector in the field of nuclear power, as well as hydro power or fossil fuel plans, or in renewable energy, we ambition and we intend to do so.</p>
          <p>If we were asked to support the creation of the French nuclear industry, naturally, we would be available to do that as well. All of this means, of course, that we need &#x2013; in the field of generation still we need to be able to develop means and resources that are compatible with the needs of our clients and customers.</p>
          <p>Compatible means a full range of generation assets, i.e. power plants and reactors and for hydro power plants this is the same way, in fossil-fired plant, we also need to develop clean coal power plants, renewable energy, all of this ability, all of this expertise and capacity must be developed in the context of our industrial sector.</p>
          <p>The corporate organization that I intend to set up and that has started to set up illustrates perfectly this ambition. I intend for EDF to be a genuinely international group. A full fledged industrial and service provider, organized around main division, business division, around global expertise and fields that have been identified under clear duties and responsibilities, with a strong geographic structure. So a matrix base, if you will, geographic responsibilities, expertise in various countries and in major regions.</p>
          <p>Within the Executive Committees, I have combined business expertise, or cost cutting expertise. This will be backed by major geographic responsibilities in such a way that the group will be closer to the field, more responsive, can make better leverage of global expertise for exemplary efficiency. Give you two examples, two major businesses, naturally business lines of major importance, generation engineering and construction, of course that will be entrusted to <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>The downstream sector business line that is optimization and trading services, customer, this will be entrusted to Pierre Lederer, both of whom have an extensive international experience in highly competitive markets. They will be backed by highly experienced people. Bernard Dupraz, for instance has accepted that my request to take care of all the technological added value in the industrial approach in the field of smart grids, smart tools and so on, I'll come back to that later on.</p>
          <p>Smart grids, smart meters and all smart application that will be absolutely essential in our industrial world tomorrow. Third key priority is financial performance, naturally, Daniel has explained the major lines for 2009. In the short-term for 2010, our ambition is not limited to 2010 only. But our financial performance must naturally be improved on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>The first step will be 2010. You've heard Daniel Camus. You have understood that we have set a goal to grow our economic performance since 2010, particularly in terms of EBITDA. Both by extending our scope, naturally, this is easy, well to a certain point, but even on a constant call by improving our EBITDA on a constant scope, on a like-for-like basis, we wish to improve the financial performance of the group.</p>
          <p>My financials is a key topic in the service of an industrial ambition and will play its full-fledged role to improve the group's performance and to increase the group's performance to have in the necessary flexibility to build our ambitions, to guide our expansion and support our progress. This is linked to operational performance.</p>
          <p>Our ambition is to continue this operational performance program and our ambitions will be continuing as well. Add to that financial flexibility with coverage ratios and so on and obviously, access to the capital markets to ensure that group has the means and resources and flexibility to support and build a strong ambition, both in terms of expansion and creation of value for the shareholders.</p>
          <p>Priority number four and challenge number four is labor HR performance. There is no company's, there is no adventure whether economic or industrial that can be successful with &#x2013; in the absence of a major labor and HR ambition. We need to be over-ambitious and pragmatic in terms of human resources.</p>
          <p>The reason is that, well, we have to &#x2013; take stock of the fact that in this area EDF is, indeed, faced with a genuine problem namely the turnover and replacement of a generation that will be retiring soon. 40% of the nuclear workforce will be retiring within the next five years. And this is similar in all other group divisions. So we are truly faced with a major issue, a crucial issue of creating skills, expertise, taking over transmission and transfer of know-how's and knowledge.</p>
          <p>The very first decision I have taken was meant to improve this. We are going to create campuses, training centers designed to build up the tool to transfer our skills from generation &#x2013; between generations.</p>
          <p>With an international ambition, we will be commuting &#x2013; we will be reinforcing the French campus and will be creating a new campus in the U.K. This should back the nuclear ambition. We need to meet our needs with efficiency, we cannot expect the outside world to supply the necessary workforce with the right competence and then for we must take over this ambition. Adding to this, it means that this boost &#x2013; the motivation for all employees. This is an excellent tool for social and geographic and professional mobility and career advancement, and we intend to become a major global benchmark in the field of creating and developing skills, expertise, as well as promoting professional and career advancements.</p>
          <p>In addition to the international issues that I addressed earlier, there is one more key element that deserves mentioning, namely we need to leverage the value of the existing asset base. This wonderful jump that we've made to internationalize ourselves mean that we also need to back this with synergies to be built, integration, development of the geographic platforms, which match the major milestone of the company's life.</p>
          <p>I spoke earlier about the U.K. Let me focus very briefly on this tremendous challenge that is the United Kingdom. Vincent de Rivaz, who is with us today, has been one of the major players in this expansion. He's been heading British Energy, or rather EDF Energy, and EDF Energy has become the major British player in the energy industry.</p>
          <p>We will be investing 50 billion pound sterling in the U.K. to build a formidable industrial and development platform in the country. We are regarded by the British authorities as the British benchmark operator. This is a tremendous challenge for us. The first steps in building this have already proved successful, but looking backwards is not enough. You've seen that the U.K. has performed extremely well, but it's not sufficient. The U.K. will be a key component of the Group, but I think there will be other countries of this type. These elements will be building our Group. This Group has truly become a genuinely full-fledged international group, not just a French group developing internationally.</p>
          <p>Next challenge is proximity, customer service, in the very notion of what we call public service or a mission of public service in France. The quality, responsiveness, the efficiency of customer service in the field is an absolutely determining factor. In view of the new rules that will be dictated to the new players and particularly EDF that is unbundling on the one hand and self-reliance and autonomy on the other side. All of this has had a number of consequences.</p>
          <p>Together with adjustments that needed to be made in terms of internal governance and management, all of this has clearly caused a perception of lower service qualities and complaints in the customers' minds, and on the other hand, have also been the cause of a labor climate that is not ideal, to say the least. Together with economic performance, that is far from being satisfactory.</p>
          <p>We, therefore, intend to react. There is no reason and it is actually out of the questions to have a wait and see attitude. It is neither my culture, nor my personal attitude. We want to ensure that the company will regain consistency, a feeling of belonging, which are indeed the only guarantees to successfully work together and to improve the performance in all of these areas. We'll comply, naturally with applicable regulations. It would be out of the questions not to do so.</p>
          <p>We enjoy very efficient drivers to this purpose, all of which will be mobilized and used. I spoke earlier that about downstream services that will be integrated in terms of value-adding and trading with Pierre Lederer, in particular via Bernard Dupraz. And this will be supported as well and backed by a number of actions that will be conducted to improve the system and to make sure that the system is much more efficient than it is today.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, and six challenges for the time being actually is environmental issues. No one will be surprised for those of you who know me that this is a very touchy subject for me. But when you are the leading energy player in the world, or among the leading global electricity operators, there should be no surprise that our decisions might be both &#x2013; would be both financial, geopolitical and linked to the main challenges of the planet; demographic density, scarcity of resources, environmental protections &#x2013; protection and mitigation of greenhouse gases, fight against climate warming, and so on.</p>
          <p>No need to make long speeches to convince you that we &#x2013; this is our concern &#x2013; key concern and we intend to become a determining player to respond to these social ambitions throughout the world. We intend to position ourselves as the international benchmarks in terms of energy efficiency, in terms of improvement of the behaviors and energy demands and requirements throughout the world and in all the countries where we operate.</p>
          <p>In particular, we're talking about optimizing energy consumption, optimization of unit consumption, load shedding and so on. As I said earlier, we intend to build all of this and to develop in smart grids, smart meters, and ongoing research and experiments will be extended throughout the world, and boosted as well. This naturally will require major mobilization of all of our R&amp;D teams. This is true for the upstream and the downstream sector.</p>
          <p>Determining factor here, again, were organization efficiency of the teams in the field and our R&amp;D teams will require &#x2013; will be required to work together. And of course, we will be the determining player in the field of energy savings, in terms of mobility, electric vehicle and so on; determining player as well in the development of decentralized energy generation, particularly renewable energy sources, solar PV, wind field, offshore and onshore, or coal combustion in close association with Dalkia and/or Veolia and so on. There is a huge field out there to develop and grow. This means that in the future, we will be among the industry operators and the proactive players in the field of environmental protection and major environmental challenges.</p>
          <p>These are the priorities that I have assigned to myself as short-term priorities. Challenges ahead of us are considerable. The Group enjoys remarkable resources, virtually unique in the world, with the potential of growth and strength that is, once again, unique, both for shareholders, but for the country as a whole. I am very determined. My determination is great, our ambition is great. I have surrounded myself with a dedicated staff with huge ability to mobilize professionalism and experience. People from different horizons, many of whom coming from EDF, naturally with a few outsiders to back up the staff.</p>
          <p>Over the coming weeks I will announce the full organization of the general management &#x2013; Executive Management team that will be working with the Executive Committee. I will be establishing the geographic organization, as well as the management and steering of the main business lines.</p>
          <p>Together with my entire staff, we will be addressing immediately, and focusing immediately the topics that are linked to economic efficiency and we'll be working on the future prospects. Let me share with you my optimism and my determination to succeed in this tremendous human and industrial adventure.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. We'll now open up the Q&amp;A session.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are quite a few people connected from London. More than 210 connections on the web and I've at least 50 questions, so I will try to pilot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] . Can we ask questions in French as well? So, I work for CIC. Well, congratulations for these results. And by the way, Daniel, thank you for this cooperation, it was really excellent. Now, something more itchy, if I can use the image, something about wages and salaries. Sorry about this, because it's going to be connected to my second question that is, if we look at the wage to sales ratio, there is a big drift between the first half and the second half. That is two points during the second half of 2009 versus 2008. And one point for the full year, that is 2009 versus 2008.</p>
          <p>My question has to do with the second half of the year. What happened? Is it an instrument that you've used? I mean wages, is it a tool that you've used in order to have a stronger Kd. Is this part of the so-called social or labor compromise? Will we have to have this type of trade-off to have a better availability ratio or Kd ratio in the nuclear power plant? That is my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I answer this? There will never be any compromises or trade-offs. There will always be discussions, but never compromises. The word compromise is a word in French I've never understood. So do you mean negotiations, because the two point drift? No, no, no, this is about economic things. Should we reward people who overshoot or meet their objectives? It's an open question. We can ask you and is this a compromise? Would you call this a compromise? My answer is no, therefore. Now, we can answer the other points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First half, second half, we didn't do anything special. Now, by the way, if you look at wages, globally speaking, and these are just the salaries because there's salaries plus the welfare system. Now, if you look at wages, the wage increase was 2.7% for the fiscal year, which is reasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Here's another question. Your Kd availability ratio is 78%, right, for the second half of the year, I suppose, or the full year? Full year, right. Now, as we speak, how many power plants are off-line, five? Five, okay,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not power plants, but reactors. I wanted to answer your question immediately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question number, three, the French Nom law. Nobody knows what's going to happen if we are going to have another parliament hearing or not, or special session of the parliament. Would you rather sell terawatt at a reasonable price? Or would you rather sell the buildings, the power plants as buildings? I don't know if this is what you intended to say or not. Would you rather sell 120 terawatts or one or two power plants, saying okay go for it, but then you will do it yourselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know who said I should say what, because I never said this. Words were stolen from my &#x2013; not my mouth, but from someone else's mouth. People usually tend to steal things from me, but I don't usually yield and give anything. And now, it is not connected at all with the Nom law. We have &#x20AC;250 billion worth of assets, so we have to make financial decisions, but it has nothing to do with Nom law; that is the disposal of assets has nothing to do with the Nom law. We are not here to sell our assets. We are not here to rent our installed base either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I have another question concerning the French TaRTAM; that is the transition tariff. Now let's imagine, which is not going to be pleasant, that the TaRTAM will be extended. What about the impact during the second half? And if it's a 12-month extension, what's the impact for 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we made this unpleasant simulation and TaRTAM is always unpleasant, because for the time being we have a &#x20AC;2 billion provision for this between 2006 to 2008. Last time, it was &#x20AC;1.2 billion, so that was the amount. Even for the EDF, this is a huge sum of money. So &#x20AC;2 billion were provision. Now, if we have a six month extension, the cost would be &#x20AC;300 million. After 12 months, a 12 month extension, it would be 300 plus 200, equals 500 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Camus, we have received one or two technical questions, because you have colleagues on line in London. We have received questions concerning the debt guidance and the dividend guidance, so I'd like to explain these two things. Eric Lopez has asked these questions. Number one, the question is, what about the debt to EBITDA guidance, 2.5 to 3.0? Is it for the long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is our guidance for 2010 is my answer. This is it. It's our guidance for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the question is, what about your rating ambition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of rating, our ambition is always to be to have a solid A. And it is going to be a solid A, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now what about the dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was asked to clarify the stable dividend, and the stable dividend is for 2010, of course. You know at the time, we did things in a different way, but we thought that this year, the minimum objective is to look at absolute values. I mean, in terms of absolute values, it's going to be stable per share.</p>
          <p>Right, any more questions in the room? Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Emmanuel Turpin, Morgan Stanley. I have two questions to ask. Number one, a question concerning the reform of tariffs. You have said that what you're in favor of is to protect the interests of the shareholders and stakeholders. Now, Nom is a new law, you've received a copy of this. And the question is, is this consistent with interest that you're trying to protect that is the shareholders, the clients and your labor force.</p>
          <p>Now, in the press, it seems that you said, you were against the Nom Act or law, but I'd like to know what you would like to change in the French law. And what are the levels of tariffs or pricing that we should consider to respect the main balances that you've mentioned; that is the economic balance for the power generation base? And in order to motivate future capital expenditure that you've mentioned? That's for the new tariffs in France.</p>
          <p>And secondly, what about 2010? What about your nuclear output? What have you budgeted so far? You have talked about Kd, but we also have Ku that we need. Ku was down in 2009, do you think we are going to go back to the historic levels we had in the past? That is 93% or 95%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, there's a law which is being discussed at present. It is called the Nom law. And it is true that people have said that I have said a number of things, like I was against the initial draft or project, the one that I had read. Well, this is not totally wrong. There's ongoing consultation, there are ongoing discussions and we are from time to time consulted. This is it. I've shared with you the main principles on which we base our position, which I think is reasonable. What is dear to me is that, I want this discussion to be fruitful and abide by these principles. This is more or less all that I can tell you today.</p>
          <p>What is essential is that, these principles should be clear to start with and then the technicians &#x2013; the discussions between the technicians should take place so that everything becomes more tangible with figures. Figures, which would cover I hope all of these underlying principles plus the term, the duration, the amount, the figures for the generation base that would be impacted. So all this is being discussed at present.</p>
          <p>And here again, we're quite open, we are here to discuss these points. And today, I cannot tell you what the dates are or when the parliament is going to discuss this. We will see as we go. We will see how often the members of parliament will have to discuss this topic. As you know, this is very much connected to French law making practices. As far as the Kd ratio is concerned, I hope we're going to reach the 95%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked another question about 2010 sir, concerning the Ku. Yes, so therefore, Jean-Louis, would you like to answer this Ku question and then I'll answer concerning nuclear power generation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, these strikes had a cost, 17 terawatt hours plus some environmental event that have had an impact on Ku. So 4 points in terms of usage and this might not happen again, we'll see to it that it doesn't happen again. So Mr. Camus says more or less 20 terawatts. Yes sir?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, Societe Generale, I have a question to ask. The EBITDA guidance which is three to 5%. I looked at the figures, we have non-recurrence costs for the weather &#x2013; for the storm, the network items and also the use you make of Kd. More or less you should reach &#x20AC;1 billion, which means 5% more or less. Does this mean that you think that tariffs will not change at all in 2010? Or do you think we'll have a cost drift, which is usually the case for EDF, to offset the tariff change? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Question number two, a very straightforward question concerning the debt level. In this table you've given us, there's &#x20AC;3.1 billion that I don't really understand. These are negotiations or something like this between Areva and EDF? It all started in 2008 and I think this is very much unclear, could you perhaps shed light on this? This would be very kind. And I have a third question, if you allow me. I was about to forget it, is do you think that Dalkia's shareholding structure could change during the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Dalkia International, the capital structure, the equity structure, the shareholding structure, Mr. Camus, no. The EBITDA for the Group and France, this is the question I'm going to answer. Now, it's true, some people could draw a number of conclusions saying that we would go along the assumptions that you've mentioned, but we've included the OpEx change, which would be lower than the developments we've taken note of in 2008 and 2009. It was six to seven in 2008, and approximately five or 4.8 in 2009. So a decrease, yet a certain type of progress or improvement. It was &#x20AC;890 million this year, as you've probably noticed. So this should be taken into account. Please remember this, we're not going to go through each assumption and all of its detail, but between three and five today I think is a reasonable and cautious assumption. That's our trajectory on an organic basis taking into account tariff changes in France.</p>
          <p>We never want to go into all the particulars in France about these and you know why. Now, I was looking at my colleagues, I can tell you that we have no debts, no &#x20AC;3 billion debt from Areva, I can tell you that we signed a week ago &#x2013; well, we finished sorry our negotiations with Areva concerning the downstream part of the cycle. You probably read that in the press yesterday and this will not lead to any extra debt for EDF. There's no need to set aside any provisions for EDF. This is a stable and balanced agreement. It was extremely technical in terms of its negotiation, but I can tell you that in terms of debt, there's no extra provision that was set aside. And that's 2.3 billion, that's for the Areva final payment that had gone down, and that had decreased the non-monetary items. That was in 2008. We'll give you technical details later on, but that's not a debt vis-&#xE0;-vis Areva and the third aspect for Mr. Proglio. The third aspect will be answered by Mr. Proglio.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, we don't want to change the Dalkia equity structure in 2008 or 2010. No, what about the changes that will take place? No, you know that EDF has been partnering with Dalkia since the year 2000, more or less. To cut a long story short, since the year 2000, we &#x2013; that is Francois Roussely, the Head of EDF at the time, and myself, I was chairing Veolia at the time. We thought that maybe in the future, the environment business and the energy business would converge, would envisage converging. Should energy and environment go together? Should they need to cooperate? And this in the light of the major global challenges that we are faced with, could have been seen immediately at the time.</p>
          <p>Now 10 years down the road, as you can see, we were not totally wrong in saying that. If I look at all these global meetings, I think we were probably amongst the first ones to have thought about these changes. So this partnering which is based on a stake in Dalkia, partly at international level, partly at French level, at the time this partnership worked well. And today, well, you know we wanted to develop Dalkia strongly at the time in partnership with EDF within the framework of this transaction and this is totally compliant with our business plan. And we even we did better than our business plan that we drafted in 2000, and today we are in 2010. So as you can see, we outperformed. We did better than planned. Any more questions?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm Vincent de Blic. I have three questions to ask. First, the EBITDA guidance for 2010. I'd like to dwell on this. I'd like to clarify this point. Could you tell us what the starting point was in 2009? Would you say that there are non-organic items like IAS 39 or assets to be disposed of in 2010, like <mark type="inaudible" />? And what about the assets that were bought during the year, that is SPE and Constellation? And for 2010, could you confirm that for the time being there is nothing concerning the TaRTAM in your guidance? And secondly, what about the full year contribution for SPE and Constellation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, can we? The starting point is something very important. What I can tell you about this is as follows. The mark-to-market, the IAS 39 aspect, the main factor was in the U.K. It was positive. It was a &#x20AC;150 million in 2009, that's my first point. Number two, we have not thought that the TaRTAM would be extended in our Group forecasts, the TaRTAM being the transition tariff. We've always said that this is an exceptional item in the past. So there's nothing at all in any of our guidances. For SPE and Constellation, the figures are important as well, that is the total is, let me see, in one case its &#x20AC;270 million; in the other case 250. So in between 450 and &#x20AC;500 million, in terms of extra EBITDA and these are fully consolidated for the whole year; by whole year I mean 2010. Here's another question to you <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The impending price war in U.K. retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The press is not with us this morning, what a pity, but the answer is that we are competitive. We intend to remain competitive and we are always looking very carefully at all market developments.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for this answer, Vincent. This is exactly the type of answer I thought you would come up with. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. My second question is the Kd, for 2010 you've targeted 79 or 80% in the past, your objective was 85%. What about the timeline? When do you think you could reach this level? And what's your strategy so as to replace the major units that have been a bit problematic in the past two or three years? And I have a third question concerning asset disposals up to a level of 5 billion. Is this still on your agenda or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for the Kd we would need to have all the technical details and this would be perhaps a bit too boring. So yes, we want to reach the objective of 85%, two or three years more or less. This was our commitment. We had said 1.5 or two points in 2010. So we're going to continue on the same tracks. 85% is a historic figure that EDF never met. The best availability rate for EDF was 83.6 for the nuclear output. And as you can see, even though the power plants are ageing we are quite ambitious. And also what we need is preventive maintenance, plus the fact that we need servicing and maintenance, which is on the ten-year basis. Plus also, the work to be done to expand the life cycle of these power plants. I'm not going to give you all the details, but the posted ambition we have for the Group is quite a stretch goal. We don't want to sit back and think it's all easy.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we've decided to bolster and support our organization and then we'll see on a case by case basis. We'll look at each site, and we'll look at availability figures, but generally speaking, as you know, it varies a lot between one plant and the next plant. Some have availability rates that are extremely high, others have lower availability figures. So the objective for us is to improve availability rates in the power plants that are lagging behind. Yet we don't want the availability percentage to go down for the nuclear power plants that are doing well.</p>
          <p>So all this is quite difficult to describe, but we're going to improve our KD. We will improve by 1.5 to two points this year and we'll continue in the future. Right ,now you've talked about the disposal of some units and also rehabilitation work and renovation, now it is very much connected to the industrial supply chain and sometimes, some of our contracting parties don't live up to our expectations. Sometimes also the competence, the skills they have are not sufficient, so we've taken this into account in our global plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the second question had to do with the asset disposal plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so far <mark type="inaudible" /> yes, we have a program. But I said earlier, we have &#x20AC;250 billion in asset base; we'll make choices. We've looked at or envisaged a number of assumptions in the past. We've spoken about the British networks naturally since I'm sure you're alluding to that. That process is underway. It will continue and then final decision naturally will be submitted to EDF's Board within the next two months to find out whether or not and how that decision might be made. And there again, this is not exclusive, there will be other investigations in the framework of optimizing our asset management. And once again, this industrial asset base is extraordinarily huge. So we're talking five billion is only 2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three questions. First of all, on the gas strategy, since you didn't mention it as a priority. Gas prices were low. I'm sure there are opportunities in France to seize perhaps. Is this something that you'll continue to consider to want to leverage? And regarding your upstream strategy, are you interested in a stake, perhaps, in Aboukir?</p>
          <p>Second point regarding Edison in Italy. Are there any changes in Edison capital structure which you believe would be appropriate to optimize EDF's presence in Italy?</p>
          <p>Third point, nuclear provisions have increased a lot in your balance sheet, is this have to do with the consolidation of British Energy or do you have an organic difference in France? Could you give us more details on the calendar for the provision estimated per kilowatt regarding decommissioning and waste treatment and spent field treatment in France?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gas, I didn't mention it, but I should have, because this is one of the key businesses of the Group. Of course, EDF Energy published their results yesterday. Gas is fully integrated, so we didn't have a specific conference on gas. But since Bruno Lescoeur is with us, maybe he can say a few words about the current status, ambitions. Since he is in charge of the gas business for the Group. Bruno Lescoeur, would you like to respond to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are progressing in gas. Henri Proglio last November signed an agreement with Gazprom that positions us as a reasonable gas stakeholder in the European energy system. We're progressing in gas as well, in terms of developing the gas infrastructures that are required to guarantee the security of supply in Europe. We're working hard to see if we can make a decision on an investment in Dunkirk. We're also working to improve our ability to make gas offerings to our customers since once the domestic market allows for competition to grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to respond to nuclear provisions. They've gone from 29 billion to 38.2 billion. That's nuclear decommissioning, and I confirm that the change of 7.7 billion is linked to scope effect. 7.2 billion for British Energy, 90 million for SPE, and CENG accounts for 430 million, with a number of technical plus and minuses and provision recovery. But this is purely a scope effect, actually.</p>
          <p>Regarding decommissioning costs, this is, of course, one of the main topic every time we close negotiations. We recently had a meeting of the Nuclear Commitment Committee that confirmed that, based on information, what we call the Don Pierre estimate, we now have an in vivo simulation, if you will, of what will be the real cost of decommissioning. And based on international standards, German, U.S., that is cost per megawatt, all of this confirms the provisioning levels that we have made at EDF.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Italy; Italy, well, we don't have much clout on what the press is saying. In any case, we're very happy, satisfied, with our position in Italy. We're a member of a partnership which, like any other partnership, is intended to continue on living. But we don't have any particular concerns or stress regarding the Italian position. We're comfortably settled there within Edison, as well as in cooperation with Enel in the nuclear sector. And in any case, we will be and will remain one of the major players in the Italian Peninsula.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding value creation, this is a question received in writing. We have no intention to split from Edison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's, basically, the short answer given by Daniel Camus in response to the written question that we had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for responding to that.</p>

          <p>Perhaps I am less of a diplomat than you are, Chairman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question from Natixis Security. I have an additional question on Italy &#x2013; excuse me, to go on really in Germany. What about investments? You've given us two billion investment over the next three years. There is a major milestone arriving in Germany. What can we expect, and what are your perspectives in Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a shareholders agreement with a timeline of 2011, so it's quite stable for the time being. Regarding the nuclear power in Germany, naturally there is a possibility of a possible extension of the life span of the German power plants with a new coalition government. There were some different views, as you know, but that's not for us to comment on German politics. For the time being, our EBITDA forecasts actually includes an assumption of all things being equal elsewhere, i.e., an extension of the current legislation, and if the lifespan is, indeed, extended it will be a plus for EnBW as well as other players in Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a few questions for you. Number one, you said several times that there &#x2013; you have &#x20AC;250 billion in assets. It makes me feel like you absolutely want to tell us something. Are you talking about &#x2013; when you were talking about selecting assets for disposal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to put things in perspective, regarding the question about this five billion asset disposal plan. All I said is that when you talk about five billion out of a total of 250 billion in asset, that puts things in perspective, you see. So whether we sell or don't, there is no pressure behind. We will, let's say, adopt an approach of natural optimization of our asset base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, regarding your cash flow management. When we look at the figures between the cash flow generated and what is needed to cover investments there is not much left after that, or, at least very little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can look at it this way, but you can also look at it more positively. We're actually one of the rare industrial companies capable of self-financing virtually all of our investments in both development and maintenance. That's the way we look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Problem is that you have a lot of debt. Or do you consider that reducing your debt is not one of your targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our debt management is very much under control. We've gone through a peak in 2009 that was linked to a number of acquisitions. But that was previously planned &#x2013; perfectly planned, with investments that were made. Centrica, for instance, took over some of that. We are an industrial company. There's a normal industrial cycle for expansion capital spending. We borrow, we create capacities. Then we collect EBITDA when things do well. Take the nuclear, for instance. The two cycles will be coming together in 2013. That is, basically, tomorrow/day after tomorrow. So, we invested significantly. But starting in 2013, the Flamanville EPR will be generating EBITDA, so we have a cash fueling, if you will, that is natural.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have capacity to create cash flow on the very long-term, naturally. But that means that when you have a high &#x2013; a period of high ramp-up in our generation capacity, when &#x2013; then we can &#x2013; we can finance that. And this is a perfect proof of the fact that we are cash positive in our existing scope and should continue in a longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question, Deutsche Bank; three questions. Number one; let me go back on the CapEx budget for 2010, with details on maintenance, expansion and perhaps acquisition. And so, over the next two or three years, focusing on the short-term, do you have higher CapEx cost in the generation sector in France that we could be expecting over the next two or three years?</p>
          <p>Question on debt &#x2013; cash generation for dedicated assets. What can we expect in terms of calendar for 2010, 2011, in terms of cash contribution? And in terms of earning, we have &#x2013; you're expecting a stable dividends, earnings per share stable. Should we expect also a net income that should be stable over the coming years? Can you give us some details?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a lot of question. Regarding the CapEx pace, if you will, today we've reached a high point in capital spending, which we have speeded up overall at Group level. So, we're not going to continue to grow this CapEx spending exponentially, obviously.</p>
          <p>Regarding dedicated assets, we have not speeded up anything. We've a law that was voted two years ago that planned for a faster rate with allowance of approximately 2.8 billion annually, per annum. That's the limit we fit into. But for one-year, due to the financial crisis and the total lack of visibility in terms of investment, we adjourned this allowance for CapEx. We took it over again in July, hence the 2.9 billion that have been allocated this year, we have &#x2013; the full target is &#x20AC;17 billion in CapEx by 2011. Now, there could be other things that get better and we could speed it up a little bit, but we're not speeding up the pace at all. We are continuing along what was planned up to 2011.</p>
          <p>The guidance we've given you is on dividends rather than on EBITDA this time, so that you could have a better visibility on the remuneration over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of, hopefully, simple questions. Firstly, on the EBITDA guidance, just to do the math in terms of the organic growth and the new assets, you seem to get to about 18.1 to &#x20AC;18.5 billion of EBITDA. As an absolute number, is that a number that you would be comfortable with? Secondly, in terms of the Kd, the utilization, excuse me, the availability rate, you said plus 1.5 to 2% this year. There is the 85% aspiration. Should we think of it as something you'll reach year-by-year, so, maybe 1.5 to 2% per year, because I think, originally, the target was for 2011? And, thirdly, one of your priorities, which I think is absolutely right way to go, integration of the group, looking for synergies across the different geographic region, given that you have major partners in Italy and in Germany, do you think you're actually going to be able to deliver those synergies in those areas? Historically, federated structures don't always yield all the benefits that you would necessarily want in that regard. Obviously, for the U.K., it would be easier, but I'd be interested to see whether you might think you would need a change in structure in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the guidance, on EBITDA at 18.5, you may be on the high side. I think I would go for a lower number than this. And I'd just stick for the three to 5% that we have indicated, I think is the right way to look at it. On the 18.5 you're way above, so organically, I'm just talking. So if you add perimeter, so you have another impact. On the synergies, I think we stick to the synergy program. We have not put forward any new synergy program, beside the one included in the 1 billion of operational excellence. So we still have 320 million to go to that. And there are much of it is synergies, yeah, in 2010. So, it's one-third outside France or one 600 million, out of this you have, I think 50, 60% in that synergies derived from that. So we stick to it. And your comment about the shareholding structure, I think we used to live with it. So we have sometimes joke and says we are probably one of the company with the best experience in managing joint control in Germany, in Italy, in the U.S., in Switzerland. So, we deliver those synergies despite that shareholding structure. Yes, sir?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to come back on the EBITDA question. I mean, 18.5 billion including perimeter effect, not just organic?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One more question, okay, yes. Okay, two then. There are two hands, so two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions. Number one; what is the currency impact on the variations of our sales benefit, profit and debt? And can you tell us about the negotiations, the status of negotiations on the renewal of concession contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding renewal of concession contracts, Jean-Louis Mathias will answer.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. The first call for tenders for renewals of hydropower concession contracts should occur in late 2011, early 12. For the allocation of new concession contracts, that should occur in late '13 and early 2014. Now, this concerns, overall, approximately 5,000 megawatts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, monetary impact on sales and EBITDA, 1.2 on sales, &#x20AC;150 million impact on EBITDA. And impact on debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I lost my figures for the debt. I'll find it again and give it to you later on. That was currency impact on the debt amount. It is included in the line that says others. 750 million negative, that is the impact on the debt level.</p>
