      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Yang Fong. And thank you for joining us today for SingTel's results for the quarter and nine months ended 31 December 2009.</p>
          <p>We had a great quarter, and if you look at the group's numbers net profit up to 24%, underlying net profits up 18%, and we've got improved performance across Singapore, Australia and the associates. Top line growth was 20%, and that was helped by the strong Australian dollar.</p>
          <p>Very quickly, Singapore revenue was up 2%, and that's driven by strong growth in mobile, partially offset by lower international telephone revenue, and if you exclude the extra month SCS revenues that were consolidated last year, Singapore revenue growth would have been 4%. EBITDA was up 3% to $580 million.</p>
          <p>Australia revenue rose 5% with strong results in mobile, but the growth rate was moderated by weaker corporate telecom spend in the business and wholesale areas. EBITDA was up 4% and that was driven mainly by mobile customer growth. The group and its associates continue to register strong subscriber growth. We added 11 million mobile customers this quarter and we now have 285 million mobile customers in the region. Earning from the regional mobile associates increased 21%. That's driven by significant improvement in Telkomsel's performance. We also had fair value gains on the associate foreign currency liabilities.</p>
          <p>As a result, overseas operations now contribute 73% of our proportionate EBITDA. And before I hand off, I should just highlight that during the first half of 2010 we have been conducting LTE trials across Singapore, Australia, Philippines and Indonesia. We would like to work towards getting a regionally compatible network for LTE.</p>
          <p>So with that maybe I'll hand over to Yang Fong and we can start the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thank you Sock Koong. I would like to remind the participants that this call will last for about an hour.

Our operator will now assist you to put through your questions.</p>

          <p>Laurent Horrut, JPMorgan Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I had two questions mostly on Optus. The first one with regard to your LTE trial and spectrum requirement, I noticed you've obviously acquired some spectrum from Qualcomm recently. Question is how quickly do you think you could, the seven to 800 megahertz band sort of poised for LTE services globally, could become available in Australia and hence being freed up by the broadcasters that hold the spectrum today? Second question, on the NBN Paul, I was just wondering what sort of process do you expect when it comes to future prices on the NBN and specifically would you think that NBN future prices would be subject of a special access undertaking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's two fairly interesting questions, Laurent. On the first one on LTE, in fact if I talk generally about our spectrum overall and what we've been doing with the mobile network, we've now got our HSBA across 96% of the market, or footprint, which makes us the only really large scale alternative to Telstra in terms of high speed wireless access.</p>
          <p>We're still focused on expanding that and we'll be making announcements in future quarters on how we're expanding that footprint because, as you know, we have a goal of increasingly closing the gap on our main competitor. I think it's also important to point out that we're not all using the same metrics in the industry for coverage. Our understanding is that the incumbent uses an antenna for measuring its geographic footprint area. If I look at where we're heading moving forward the acquisition of spectrum that we've announced in the last week is designed to help us in the short term as well as in the long term and you'll see us deploy that in the short term particularly as a priority in areas where there's extremely heavy wireless broadband traffic today. Subject to ACCC approval, we'd expect to be rolling that out into the relevant sales within three to six months of the approvals coming through and being able to use it effectively from then. That will be very important to us in allowing us to provide ongoing high quality and also carrying extra capacity on those sales.</p>
          <p>If we move forward beyond that into the world of LTE, as Sock Koong said we're running trials in the group and in Australia through this year. From the soundings we've done overseas, actually the major constraint on LTE, we believe, is going to be devices and commercial applications which run on them. And from what we're seeing given some of the delays in the European rollouts and the European operator commitments, from talking to vendors in the last few months it's unlikely we're going to see much movement in this market before 2012 and probably a little bit later than that would be based on some of the discussions we've had. The timeframes we're hearing from the federal government at the moment for clearing TV spectrum, is still seeming to be under debate and under review. Certainly wouldn't expect anything pre 2010 but hopefully it will align more closely to the commercial availability of devices once the discussions are finalized.</p>
          <p>On your second question which is on the NBN, there's two very important areas for us that we are hopefully getting some clarity over the next six months. The first of those is all around the wholesale price as you said. We think it's really critical that everyone's got a level playing field and I think you know our views on all of this. We think it's essential that if the federal government does a deal with Telstra that that's visible and transparent and that there are no payments or cash flows which would alter the economics for the incumbent versus those of the other access seekers. Putting that more bluntly, if there is a cash payment to be made either upfront or ongoing to Telstra, we think it's essential that it's visible and that it's also not used in a way that can distort the market and that the ACCC has a key role in regulating this.</p>
          <p>In terms of the other access terms, obviously we're all working with Mike and his team to assist them in designing the network and to make sure that the way it's rolled out is both the best cost for money of the taxpayers but also allows competition. In that sense some of the comments they've made, I think I mentioned this last week to you Laurent, around where they have aggregation points and their aim to provide layer one and layer two services, I think they'll be very supportive of and that we think will help drive competition.</p>
          <p>Have I answered your question Laurent, are there any-?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you have. Just a quick follow up in terms of where do you think you might have an input in the process specifically on prices. If it's a special access undertaking lodged with the ACCC expect something industry consultation et cetera. I suppose that from where you were in the RFP process in 2008 it's a bit more exposed to there because the conversation is not obviously occurring in a public forum like it was before.</p>
          <p>I'm again interested to have your view as to when do you think you're going to be having an input in these discussions on things like pricing, on things like points of interconnection et cetera. And I'm aware NBNCo is having a number of consultation rounds. Just interested to get your views on what sort of formal process do you think there will be at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you said there's already informal input. And indeed, we've spent quite some time making visible some of our costings and assumptions, and indeed our views on the economies of an NBN. Although this is a fiber-to-the-home network other than fiber-to-the-node, there are large elements of the economics that are common. And therefore we think if it does move to a special access undertaking or some other form of investigation or agreement, there is a significant benchmark being created by our own FTTN bid by some of the regulatory submissions we've put on the record.</p>
          <p>I feel fairly confident that there's such transparency and detailed modeling being done already, that there shouldn't be a large scope for there being a gap between the parties on debate but obviously we'll have to wait and see how that finalizes. Certainly we've been very actively involved so far in providing data and information to the NBNCo as well as to the government.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon everyone. I've just got a few quick questions. Unfortunately they do relate to Optus. First of all, I noticed just in the cash flow statement there's an intercompany loan of 555 million back to STAI. I just wonder whether you can shed some light on that, and as a result what that does in terms to the interest line going forward? The second question was in the commentary there's talk about an HSC upgrade. I'm just wondering given &#x2013; could you give us a bit more color in terms of the cost of that upgrade, and as a result why that's happening now? And then just lastly, in terms of actually just the guidance where you continue to do EBITDA growth for the business, if we go back to the fourth quarter last year there was a big tick up in profitability as mobile margins rebounded, principally as subscriber growth and SACs dropped off. I would assume that based on the current guidance, we would expect that similar pattern to happen but I just wanted to confirm that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I maybe get Jeann to talk to the STAI loan line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first of all, let me just explain. STAI is actually the immediate holding company of Optus and STAI has a long term loan from Optus, which was a result of acquisition financing of Optus at the point in time when we did the acquisition. Now as you know we manage our group's debt &#x2013; we've managed that on a group basis, so whether that sits at Optus level or sits at STAI or at the SingTel Group, we look at it from a group basis.</p>
          <p>So basically SingTel would receive cash from both the business subsidiaries and that would include Optus, and the cash can come back in various forms, either through dividend, interest, capital reduction or loan repayment. Okay, so this is really part of our overall capital management strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeann, just on the &#x2013; I mean, the regearing of Optus, I mean in terms of those proceeds to be used for the rest of the group, has that cash been earmarked for anything in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have got a bond series that is coming due in June so that's part of the overall financing strategy and as you know, we are also diversifying our funding sources so rather than just rely on bank debt, we are looking to the bond markets as well. And that is consistent with the financing strategy that we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeann and Sock Koong maybe &#x2013; it's Paul here. I might pick up on Richard's other question. By the way Richard, you never need to apologize to us for asking questions on Optus. We love to talk about it. In terms of the EBITDA performance, I'll take that as the next one. We've been driving very strong mobile acquisition, especially in postpaid over the last 18 months and indeed this quarter is a record with our highest ever postpaid net adds. And we've been very clear and transparent in the fact that this is a good strategy for us.</p>
          <p>We will expense obviously the cost of that acquisition in the quarter as we do it, and therefore as we accelerate its inevitably having an impact on our percentage margin, so the fact that it's a strategy that is paying off in terms of high value customers, it's certainly visible in things like our operational EBITDA in absolute terms, is up over 5% the quarter. Or indeed if you look at the ARPUs, ARPU for our postpaid customers if you exclude wireless broadband because it muddies the picture, so our voice based customers, that ARPU's up 6% year on year so you can see some of the impacts coming through.</p>
          <p>So therefore the answer as to where we see Q4 going, seasonally it is traditionally a better quarter than others but actually the final results will be driven by the volume of acquisition that takes place in the quarter and the mix. And certainly I would say to all of you that management believes that it is the right thing to do, to take the volume and take the market share if it's profitable. And we'd almost encourage people to look as much at our expansion of the absolute EBITDA as at the percentage margin. So we absolutely accept that both are very important metrics, and we need to manage them both. That's probably as much guidance I can give you without qualifying what we've already given.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I just wanted to be clear, because obviously there was a $60 million lift in the mobile EBITDA in the fourth quarter over the third quarter last year. And clearly if we don't get that rebound this year and it actually stays at the third quarter level that you've just produced, then the EBITDA growth is sort of not going to be in line with where the guidance is. If anything, you'll be basically lucky to grow so I'm just wondering whether if you are continuing this market share push, whether the guidance is consistent with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I want to be careful not to start qualifying the guidance on the call, I think we've sort of given you a sense of the trends and metrics. There is usually a seasonal impact on Q4, but I think it's important that we don't start giving you absolute guidance or absolute numbers on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, it's Murray. We're reaffirming guidance today so there's no &#x2013; let's call it indicated variation from the guides we've previously provided to market. And as Paul indicated, there is a seasonality impact in quarter four, normally as a result of the holiday period through January and the shorter month in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. The HFC question Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the HFC. I think we previously disclosed the number on that. Regardless of &#x2013; we've just got some confusion then as to whether we have disclosed or not. We don't believe so. Okay, all right, we haven't disclosed then, apologies, on the HFC. Look, that's an upgrade, which is designed to provide speeds of up to 100 meg in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane areas. It's on track. You can expect us to announce over the next six months the pricing rollout and the terms of that. And obviously I don't want to give any more of a precise mark on that, because I don't want to flag it to our competitor. But it's on track and there's no major update we need to &#x2013; well we have to make to you today in terms of the progress of that. Was there a specific issue in there Richard, that you were keen for me to address?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just wondering why the upgrade relative to your discussions with NBN, I just wondered whether you could add any color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see it as a standalone investment that works on its own merits. When we look at the business case for doing that, that makes it a very competitive network. It will be NBN comparable, though not necessarily exactly the same as NBN in terms of what it offers. It's a strategy that stands on its own merits. If anything happens subsequently with NBN, then that's an opportunistic deal but we've actually made the decision to roll ahead based on the business case standalone for that investment and we think it's the right thing to do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the opportunity. I actually had a couple of questions, first on Singapore where you have managed to continue to grow your revenue market share for several quarters in the mobile space. I'm just wondering now with both StarHub and M1 having started offering iPhones as well, do you see any pressure points there, I guess starting from this year? And I guess your general approach towards balancing market share versus margins in Singapore, if you could throw some light on that.</p>
          <p>Second, there have been several rumors about Optus IPO. I just wanted to understand your thoughts on that, not specifically on that, but I guess broadly in terms of managing your various investments, optimizing the value there and your general philosophy towards acquisitions for this year, if there is anything that you're looking at. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Allen, do you want to take the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Regarding the mobile market share and the questions because now StarHub and M1 have got iPhones as well, I think firstly let me explain that I think for us, competing with the two of them is not an issue with us. I think if handset providers want to give us exclusivity for a period of time that's a bonus, so I think our competition is based on a couple of things. We know our brand can command a price premium in the market, and a premium of about 10% is normally put on top of our pricing, so if you see what our competitors are pricing today for the iPhone and what we have, we have a slight premium there.</p>
          <p>The second important thing is that the competition on iPhone is not just about pricing; it's about applications. There is now about the 30,000 applications in that store. With SingTel, we have developed two pretty unique applications that's only available for our customers. One is on music, and bearing in mind that iTunes is not available in Singapore, our AMPed product creates a significant differentiator for people who want music on their iPhone as well.</p>
          <p>And secondly we have a traffic product, which allows our customers to view it on their iPhone and know where are the congested roads before they pick their journey. So the second important differentiation that we have is in terms of the special apps that people can get on the iPhone with SingTel and not with our competitors. Of course, the third one is in the area of customer experience, where we ensure that our hot lines are well manned and that our customers get access to these hot lines and have better answers to questions that they have, compared to our competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the Optus IPO, I suppose what you're asking for is our general philosophy towards how we view our investment stakes in our associates and our subsidiaries. Our position is that on an ongoing basis, we do review the investments that we have, and we would assess if it makes sense for us to bring in new partners or shareholders or to do an IPO. And it's all driven by principle of &#x2013; it must be something that is very lucrative. So for example if it makes sense, we may bring in a strategic partner in say for example our IT business, if it allows us to access the new market or new customers. So that would be a basis for wanting to bring in new partners for the various investments in our associates and subsidiaries that we have. And of course we will look at valuation, because that would be a significant driver of shareholders value.</p>
          <p>Maybe I'll pass on to Chuan Poh to talk about acquisitions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your question especially on Optus which I think Sock Koong has addressed it generally, insofar as acquisition is concerned, we remain focused on Asia Pacific, but we have also stated quite clearly that where there are adjacent markets of Asia where we believe that either on a standalone or with our associates we can deliver value through the acquisition, we will also consider.</p>
          <p>But going beyond that, I think at the last investors meeting that we had, we also mentioned the fact that going beyond that investment will not be purely focused on acquisition of assets as it was in the past. But going forward there will also be other acquisitions to in a sense enhance the value that we are now having across the 280 million customer base that we are now seeing. So it's not just about acquisitions, more new companies, but also looking at acquiring new capabilities and to facilitate the future growth transformation of the company.</p>

          <p>Yes hi. Good morning and thank you for the call. Just one question on Indonesia and Telkomsel &#x2013; I was wondering if we could get a little bit more data &#x2013; financial and/or operating in terms of the fourth quarter, and the full year 2009. And in particular if there is any, you know, important non-cash or exceptional items that were included in the results.</p>

          <p>Hi Tim, it's Yang Fong here. I would love to help you, but because of official disclosures that Telkomsel itself hasn't quite announced yet, our hands are really tied on this. So what we have really disclosed is really just the share of profit before tax that the group has equity accounted for, and it's all in the results pack. So I really would like to help, but this is beyond us.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I've just got a few questions. Firstly, for Singapore, Allen, we've seen quite a significant jump in the IT margins. I think it's gone up to 17%, so I was just wondering is that just a one-off, or that something that can be sustained?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I guess in Singapore we have two casinos or two resorts coming up, coming on-stream this year; just wondering what are your expectations for the roaming revenues? Is that something that could potentially surprise on the upside?</p>
          <p>And I guess moving to Australia, Paul, just want to get your thoughts on the consumer business. We have more than one million on-net subs now, just wondering what's the strategy for this business going to forward, with or without NBN?</p>
          <p>And lastly for Sock Koong, both TELKOM and Bharti have been talking more and more about acquisitions now; just wondering if they start venturing into markets where SingTel already has a presence, does that change the way you actually view these investments? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first two questions on Singapore first. In terms of the IT margins, our IT business is very much head count and human resource dependent, so the margin that we are seeing, a lot of it is primarily because of the job credit scheme that we have here in Singapore, and there's also some effect of the cost effectiveness that we're driving in terms of the process to develop software for some of our customers. So those are the two main reasons our IT margins have improved.</p>
          <p>In terms of roaming revenue and where it's likely to go in 2010 with the IRs, I think the roaming revenue is a big function of the economy, the GDP and the regional economy, so we've already seen a lift in roaming revenues in Q3, and if the global economy starts to recover we will continue to see strong growth in the area primarily because, number one, for the outbound roamers we have a big share of such high ARPU customers, and secondly I think for inbound roamers we also have a large share. So I think it all depends on what happens with the global economy and sentiment in region more than just the IRs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question on the acquisition ambition of our associates, I think we have to accept the fact that our associates have come of age, and in certain of the market practices they have gained a lot of human capital as well as knowhow in terms of how they can do business in certain geographies. We have to acknowledge that, and in all instances of Bharti's overseas acquisition, we have always been in close consultation with them, and when it makes sense for us to be going together just in the case of MTN we would. I think so far there's only one instance where they have gone into a market where we are already there and that is in Bangladesh, with the recent announcement of the deal being considered.</p>
          <p>But that is quite a different consideration. First of all we believe that the adjacency of Bangladesh to India would give Bharti a certain competitive advantage. Secondly, we are in CDMA setup in Bangladesh, and having been there for a few years we realize the difficulties of competing against a GSM player. Bharti is acquiring into a GSM license, and I think there are prospects for us to be able to work together in the country. We don't see that as a conflict. We see that as an opportunity.</p>
          <p>As for with TELKOM, we have not come across anything that TELKOM has considered that would be considered as a conflict. I think the last target TELKOM was looking at what was somewhere in the Middle East where we were not looking at. Other than that, you know, we do talk to them quite a fair bit, also in areas where we believe that there could be mutually beneficial opportunities.</p>

          <p>Paul, would you like to take the question on Optus Consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Yang Fong and thanks Sachin. I'm actually going to get Michael Smith, who is our Managing Director of Consumer to talk about our focus in terms of broadband and how we see the future playing. Just before he does that, I just wanted to follow-up on Richard's earlier question and confirm that we have disclosed a cost of $25 million for upgrading the HFC to DOCSIS3. I just wanted to clarify that. But Michael, maybe you could just talk about our focus in terms of our broadband business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi Sachin. Thanks for the question. I guess it's a story in three parts. Firstly, we continue our focus on on-net. That's twofold. We have alluded to the investment that we're making in HFC to bring that product back up to customer expectations, and drive demand, and the utilization of our ULL network is the other part. So we continue to focus on the on-net business.</p>
          <p>The second part in fixed business is for us to help or continue to drive costs out, and we've seen the margins improve in our fixed business over the past few periods, and we continue our focus on cost in that area to make sure that we can continue to improve the margin. I guess the last part of the question is making sure that we're fully prepared in advance for NBN. We think it's pretty critical in the fixed business increasingly going forward customers will be interested in sort of integrated communications across fixed and mobile, and making sure that we ready ourselves for that, that sort of digital world if you like, so that (a) we've got the customers, (b) we've got the solutions, and (c) we're ready then to deliver when NBN comes into play is the key sort of focus for the Optus Consumer business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Chris Vagg in for Phil. I also had a question on Optus Consumer. You just talked about it briefly, but we were just looking at, you know, given the amount of on-net customers, you're looking at over 90% both in telephony and in broadband, and yet margins are only around 15%, albeit they're up year over year. We're just wondering what's keeping margins around that level? I mean, should we expect it to get high given that percentage of on-net customers that you have now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, it's Murray King, the CFO of Optus. In relation to margins you've obviously got to look in relation to the on-net business. We've got a HFC, our own cable network, and our ULL business. The HFC has minimum costs associated with access arrangements, however the ULL network has access arrangements that are regulated through the ACCC, so there are access costs there which dampen or dilute the overall margin impact.</p>
          <p>So our focus is continuing to drive market expansion here through managing our own cost structure and continue to advocate with the regulator to bring the overall access costs for ULL down, and over time look to expand the margin for this particular business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi congratulations on good set of results. Just two questions from me. One relates to the Singapore side of the business. I'm just wondering if you could give us some flavor of what you see in terms of NBN impact on the Singapore business longer term, I mean more like five years out and beyond from a EBITDA revenue standpoint as well as a EBITDA margin. I mean, just help us think directionally where the trends could be going there, and lets us set more reasonable expectations on our side here?</p>
          <p>And the second question, I just note that the net EBITDA is already down to 0.9 times lowest levels in almost five years. What are your thoughts on managing the balance sheet there? If you could give us some color on that, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, your first question was on the NBN impact on the Singapore business say five years out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at this time it's difficult for us to give you specific guidance on this, because the date of NBN rollout has not even been finalized by the government. But I think at a very, very high level I think basically what NBN means to the Singapore business is that we lose our competitive differentiator of being the only fixed network that can reach across the entire island.</p>
          <p>So for SingTel what this means is that yes we will get some margin pressure on our basic products, basic carriage products primarily in the business segment, but it also creates opportunity for us to move beyond just being a carriage provider to being a provider of entertainment and information services for the homes, and examples of that they are seeing is things like mio TV and acquisition of the BPL content which will certainly give a good reason for people to take up our fiber if they need to when this rolls out.</p>
          <p>Then of course on the business segment it also allows us to go beyond just carriage provider to being a provider of solutions and software. So with the NBN and the high speed fiber parts that goes to each business, you will see us being more aggressive in selling software as the serviceability to bundle software with your basic carriage service and to sell that on a per month basis per user basis.</p>
          <p>So I think there are ups and downs. SingTel has also on the NetCo side cut a deal with OpenNet where they will use our ducts and in return for that we will get a revenue share, and also we have a 30% share in OpenNet. So overall from NBN there are challenges. We are transforming the company and there are lots of opportunities as well, but I think specifically in terms of what this does for margins five years out, et cetera, I think perhaps when we get greater insight on to when NBN will be launched we'll come out with something a bit more specific for financial analysts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Allen. Maybe just to clarify my understanding, if I hear correctly, am I correct to think that while it's sad to say that you can't really guess where margins will go longer term but the challenge at least or what is within your control is what you're trying to do is trying to drive up your revenue opportunities in the medium term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that is one key thing. The other important thing, and I should have spoken about it a little bit earlier, is that we're also driving our costs down and you can see even from this set of results, there are a lot of areas where we are driving our cost effectiveness and our ability to deliver in a cost effective manner very much down in this business because we expect with NBN that there will be a lot of competitive pressure on the basic carriage service.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Allen. If I could just put one just addendum to that; I mean the IT, as in Sachin's questions, you were saying that there was some job credit scheme to help boost the margins in this last quarter? How sustainable is that? Is that the kind of margins that we should be expecting in the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The IT business is one where we benchmark our costs against the leaders in the IT business, so that is something that &#x2013; the job credit was a one off and it will decline as you will see as the government has announced in the next financial year, but we do have cost based initiatives internally within NCS to make sure that the level of activity that goes on does not deviate significantly from its global competitors. So we will be pushing these to make sure that the margins in NCS start to rise towards the levels that are expected of a SI company globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thanks so much, Allen.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeann, do you want to take the gearing question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think well the gearing is at healthy levels and it is within our target and we have maintained that we would like to have the financial flexibility to pursue growth. So I think as we have done historically, we will review on a regular basis the need for capital management initiatives if there are no imminent acquisitions.</p>
          <p>I think if you look at our dividend payout ratio, we have revised it not so long ago from 45 to 60% payout and I just want to highlight again that while it is 45 to 60% of payout and our associates, most of our significant associates are returning significant dividends. Bharti has not yet &#x2013; Bharti just paid a maiden dividend last year but the company is committed to look at giving guidance for its dividend policy. So that is something that we'll work through and communicate to the market in due course.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions. First, Sock Koong or maybe Jeann, could you outline what the process might be for deciding whether there might be a special dividend or capital return given where the balance sheet is and the cash position and so on and, in particular, whether there's an opportunity to canvass shareholder views on that? And secondly, for Paul O'Sullivan, I just wonder if you could just reiterate what the Optus fixed line strategy is because I'm struggling to reconcile what you're doing there when you're declining revenue on just about every fixed line service and declining margins apart from when you're moving on-net. Surely that suggests that you should be expanding the on-net capability and yet I see CapEx going down pretty much for every fixed line service, notwithstanding what you're doing in HFC. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, we look at &#x2013; we obviously every year when we do our budget and we go to the board we will look at our sources of funding and the level of cash that we would generate versus the investment plans and the capital plans that we intend to pursue and of course we also look at the associate dividend payout plans. So it's all done on a very regular basis and we will look at our gearing ratios, we look at the level of financial flexibility we would like to have. I think historically if you look at our cumulated payout we probably paid in excess of 35% of the net profits. So we'll continue to review that on an ongoing basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Paul here. I might pick up on Ian's question on the fixed line strategy. Ian, I think we've been pretty public about this but it is a good opportunity to reinforce it. We are a product of the regulatory environment and for that reason without being able to get a level playing field in much of the market we focus our strategy on areas where we have existing HFC or where we can make an investment in URL and expect to be competitive.</p>
          <p>I think you will recall, as I'm sure many others will on this phone call, what happened, the disgraceful events of the late '90s when Optus looked to invest in HFC network and the regulatory process failed to protect it in that environment. Indeed the precedent of that situation has led to today's action by the federal government in looking to reform the sector. But if we look at where we are present today in the HFC, what we're doing currently is upgrading that network with a view to making it even more attractive and competitive. Our estimate of our market share, well actually I should also <mark type="inaudible" /> URL, we've invested heavily in URL where it is capable of giving us a reasonable return allowing us to be competitive.</p>
          <p>Overall as a result of those activities, we have today almost a million households out of the eight million in Australia who are Optus customers on broadband. Our estimate of market share in the areas where we have network today is in the mid-twenties and climbing. And indeed that's up significantly over the last few years.</p>
          <p>We've also expanded margins as a result of our focus on that. The fact that we have declining revenues in our retail business is a conscious strategy. We've been choosing to exit that business because again as a demonstration of the challenges of a regulatory environment it's a no profit business and we're merely-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not just retail Paul, it's pretty much every fixed line business we see a negative revenue there. And yet I look at several other smaller fixed line carriers that have been able to take some risk and grow there and not just grow revenue but grow earnings and cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well actually I differ with your view of the numbers there, Ian. If you look at page 47 of our MD&amp;A, what you can see is that in our on-net business we have growth of 4.8% and in fact if you look at voice and broadband outside of Pay TV our growth is up 8% in the period. It's a conscious strategy to reduce our off net and we've been articulating that now for a couple of years. And I think the fact that our profitability has gone up as we've exited retail and our free cash flow has gone up makes a point that in fact it was a bad business in a flawed regulatory environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...in saying that we reflect some of the softness in the market in our Optus Business numbers this quarter but we have been focusing the Optus Business over the last two years in areas where you have network and indeed our nine months' revenues in Optus Business are up 2.4%. Very significantly our margins in that business have increased steadily over the last two to three years. They were in the high teens and now they're in the mid 20s. And we see that as a very significant area for us to go.</p>
          <p>If you look at the performance you've had in some key markets there, we are now a significant player in insurance and in banking and in federal government in Australia. We've targeted those sectors because there are heavy data users and they're therefore pretty appropriate for a challenger like us who's investing. We are investing significantly in both businesses. We've been investing hundreds of millions of dollars both in upgrading our IP network, expanding the footprint of Optus Business through Ethernet-over-copper and in the core network, enhancing the IP backbone. And in the consumer business we're not only investing in the HFC upgrade as I said, we've also invested over the last four years about $150 million in expanding ULL. And that's a core thing, knowing the investment we make in advertising and in acquisition.</p>
          <p>So I think it's important to understand the difference between our on-net and our off net strategy. As you get a level playing field in NBN you can expect to see us apply the same philosophy that we have in all of our marketing to where we can get a level playing field. And I would argue that with a 30% share or thereabouts in the mobile market, with a mid-twenties share on-net and broadband hopefully they are the lead indicators of the sort of scale that we can drive where we're given a fair go and where we can compete on a level playing field.</p>

Correct me if I'm wrong but it strikes me that you're not really generating any meaningful revenue yet from this segment. If I look at your other revenue line where mio is classified as only up 7% year on year for the nine months and actually down for the quarter. Would you be able to indicate what the ARPUs are fore mio TV and where you potentially seeing this going over the long term? The second question I had again is with IPTV. If you were to do a standalone analysis of the IPTV business, can you view this as an eventually profitable business or do we need to view this on a group basis where it includes fixed line and broadband and what parameters would be needed to make this profitable?</p>
          <p>The last question I had is with regards to the NBN. I just wanted to get your thoughts on whether the service will be commercially launched by April 2010. I've been hearing rumors that there may be delays on this. I just wanted to get your thoughts, at least on your consortium side, if this will launch on time and if there are any potential financial penalties if it's not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your first question was on mio TV and how you should be looking at it. I think right now we do not disclose mio TV revenues separately, so I think the conclusions that you made by looking at some of our other revenue lines regarding the mio TV may not be wholly correct. At some point in time as it starts to become a significant part of our revenue, we will give analyst better visibility on the mio TV revenue line. In terms of how you should be looking at mio TV, I think mio TV is a service that runs off our fixed line network. Today that is copper, in future that will be fiber, so I think we look at our fixed line businesses as a whole, whether it's broadband internet access, whether it's TV and entertainment services or whether it used to be voice in the past.</p>
          <p>I think what we have to look at in terms of profitability is that the ARPU that is generated from this network, either from business customers or from residential customers, and see how that is growing and look at the profitability of that. So I think the short answer to your question is that we don't look at mio TV on a standalone basis. We look at it as one of the key products that we use to sustain or if not increase the ARPU that we get on our fixed line.</p>
          <p>With regard to NBN, can I just clarify your question? Your question to me was that will it be launched in April and are there any delays, am I correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think this is something you need to get a better answer from the regulator. The regulator is in control of the NBN timeframe because of the way it has created structural and operational separation in the network here in Singapore. Our latest feedback that we have does indicate that it will be more the start of the second half of this calendar year, rather than in April.</p>
          <p>With regards to financial penalties, I think right now, I think the finance &#x2013; there are some commitments that are required from the NBN OpCo and NBN NetCo. I think the financial penalties regarding delays from their part is not that significant, but there are some financial penalties.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you everyone. A question for you Paul and your team. I notice that wholesale subscribers to your mobile business have increased to 8% of users. I just wonder if you can give us some comment on that and whether some of that's related to the Woolworths MVNO?</p>
          <p>Secondly on mobile churn, I see that it's down 1.4%, which looks like a good result. I'd just like some color around what the underlying 3G and it can go even further into iPhone churn starting to look like? And then lastly on the 3G network upgrade, it looks like about 85% of spend is on the HSPC upgrade &#x2013; HSPA I should say upgrade. Can you just give some color again around how much of that expansion in the network versus infill? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, we'll see what we can do as we try and answer the questions and I'll use Murray and Mike to help me as well. There's going to be some limits, Daniel, on what we can tell you based on disclosure constraints we have. Just on wholesale, we don't disclose the individual customers for obvious competitive reasons, but I think I would say that if you look at our business over the last two to three years, we put a lot of effort into rebuilding a pretty diverse range of retailers and channels. So that growth is coming from more than channel and is actually coming from work we've done with a number of retailers. Beyond that for competitive reasons I really don't want to get too much into it. I might pick up on the second question, which was relating to churn. I might let Murray talk a little bit about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Daniel. We've obviously seen a reduction in churn over the quarter and over the last couple of quarters, in part due to iPhone because obviously the iPhone base is relatively new to us. We obviously don't disclose individual churn rates for cohorts of particular customer bases. We've also seen in our Virgin base some reduction in churn as they have continued to migrate the previous base or couple of customer bases into Virgin Mobile, so that has reduced the overall churn rate as well. So those couple of factors has continued to bring churn down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third question was relating to our mobile CapEx. Again, we don't break that down but I can probably focus on what have been the three areas of activity for us. The first of those has been on providing back haul to our existing mobile sites and our new sites to cope with the extra requirements for broadband demand. And on average, I think I've given the stat before to many of you, where we would have traditionally had a site that was on our own network it might have had one to two <mark type="inaudible" /> back haul. The average across that network today is six, and that's increased largely over the last 18 months.</p>
          <p>The second major area of investment for us has been expanding footprint, and that's been using 900 megahertz technology and 3G in regional areas. We're getting very good performance out of that network and significant extra reach. As I mentioned earlier, we've now got a 96% population coverage with that network and we're continuing to expand.</p>
          <p>Now the third area of investment, which at this stage is fairly minimal but it will become more visible in the coming quarters, has been to start adding extra sites in metro areas. We're doing that because as we grow traffic, both voice but very much wireless broadband and data services, we feel the most efficient way for us to carry some of that growth in metro, will be too dense up the network. Most of the capital you'd see to date would only have really gone into site planning and release for that. The construction phase of that would be happening more into the next fiscal. Hopefully without getting into specifics, that gives you at least a sense as to how we're focusing our mobile CapEx.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for your time. I have three questions, one on the group and two on Optus. Firstly on the group, I'm just wondering Sock Koong whether you could maybe talk us through your philosophy in maintaining guidance for the group at low single digit given the strong performance for the first nine months. If you could please just discuss what sort of factors you're looking at in the 4Q that might affect their performance that would be great?</p>
          <p>Secondly Paul, two questions for you on Optus. Firstly, in terms of business and wholesale, you're talking about the ITTN market conditions in Australia and you talk about cautious spending intentions from corporates. And that's a little bit different to what for example the NAB survey has been saying, which is I think through September, October, November, December, it talked about a very strong improvement in both business confidence and business sentiment in Australia.</p>
          <p>And my last question on Optus, it's probably more of a general question on the fixed line broadband market in Australia, where you guys obviously saw subscribers go backwards in the quarter and I think Telstra will probably report the same thing on Thursday. Just wondering if you could maybe give us your comments on what you're seeing out there in the fixed broadband market, whether or not you think the market has peaked in terms of growth and maybe talk about the wireless broadband threat, given that you guys have obviously had a record quarter. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Christian. There are no exceptional 4Q factors and you follow the company over a fairly long period of time. You know that the third Q for us is seasonally the strongest quarter in terms of sales because of the Christmas period. Fourth Q tends to be a lower period, particularly in Australia because of &#x2013; again, because of the holiday period. So there are no exceptional items. We have looked at our full year forecast and we have affirmed our guidance accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, it's Paul here. I might just pick up on your business question. Actually, I think our view of the trend line is more consistent with what you said is on the NAB survey. We've done a bit of a deep dive as to what's driving some of the performance in our business area. What we've seen is that we haven't lost any more accounts or at any greater rate than traditionally, but we've seen fairly significant rationalization of heads within a large number of our customer base.</p>
          <p>We're pretty heavily exposed to insurance and financial services and that was definitely an area, which we saw some significant rationalization in. I think one line to look at on our numbers, which is probably a good way to see this trend line, is to look at our voice business revenues. That's on page 45 of the MD&amp;A. If you go back a couple of quarters we had minus 11% growth, then last quarter we put in minus eight. This quarter it's minus 1.2, so the rate of decline is starting to flatten and that's probably consistent with a view that maybe that rationalization has now swept through and we're heading back towards a more stable set of metrics.</p>
          <p>We make the comment in the MD&amp;A that we've been working quite hard on the transition phases of some of our big wins, notably ANZ and the Australian Tax Office over the last quarter, and so you'll start to see those carriage revenues begin to flow over the coming quarters. So I would hope overall what we're seeing is some stabilization. I'll pass over to Murray to talk about the mass market broadband. I think if you look at our overall broadband numbers, we're seeing a different trend to the one that you might have mentioned, but we can maybe talk about it and then see if we've correctly understood your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Christian. So you've actually seen our fixed broadband customer numbers grow on-net from around 905,000 to 913,000 for the quarter. At the same time you've seen wireless broadband increased for the quarter by 111,000. So the growth rate in fixed broadband is somewhat moderating because of some of the competitive environment, but also the wireless broadband market. There is a substitutional element but predominantly it's complementary at this point in time. So we can certainly see growth in the fixed broadband market, and we believe again as a result of our strategy and focusing on-net, there is further capacity to grow our fixed on-net broadband customer base. But at the same time, we will be able to continue to see growth in our wireless broadband customer numbers consistent with this quarter and prior quarters.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for the call. I have three questions. The first one's on the &#x2013; if we minus OpenNet's CapEx going forward and given that it's probably a big chunk of &#x2013; big contributor to the IT business of SingTel. That will be helpful in terms of your guidance in terms of CapEx going forward. Secondly is on the announcement by &#x2013; or the agreement between Optus and Dodo. Could you help us, especially those outside of Australia, understand the level of agreement and is the company a MVNO? And is the 160 million going to be recognized linearly over the next four years, or is it based on a take up arrangement? And the third thing is on the effective tax in Singapore. You had some sort of tax credits. Could we expect the same thing in the fourth financial quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just regards to your first question, regard to OpenNet and the CapEx of OpenNet. I think that is something that OpenNet is an associate of ours. I think they haven't formally come up to announce what is their CapEx for either next year or their total CapEx. So I think once they do that we will share that information with you. I think if you are asking also whether &#x2013; what is SingTel's revenue that we get as a result, being a contractor of OpenNet, you can see that year to date we've recorded a revenue in our MD&amp;A of about $100 million. Next year will be a peak year for construction. We can't give you the number now because the numbers are still being worked out together with OpenNet, but when we announce our full year results if it's appropriate we'll disclose that number.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the other questions were on the arrangement or agreement between Optus and Dodo, and is the company an MVNO and how's the $160 million going to be recognized? Is it going to be linear or is it going to be based on the take up by the company? And lastly on some sort of &#x2013; perhaps some sort of guidance on the effective tax in Singapore. You had a tax credit recognition in the third quarter. Could we expect the same in the fourth quarter? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kelvin, it's Paul here in Sydney. Just to pick up on Dodo, no it's an MVNO. Optus has had a wholesale service provider business going back since pretty much our foundation, 16-17 years ago. That's where the wholesaler buys our services. They market under their own brand but it is visible to the customer that there is a relationship with Optus. They do the billing and customer care. The estimate we've given of forward revenues is an indication of what we'd expect them to achieve, but obviously we will book the revenue each quarter as it occurs. And that number was merely an indicative amount as to what we would expect it to be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kelvin, the group tax rate, the effective tax rate for the nine months as you can see is about 23%, relative to 21% last year, last financial year. And I think there were some tax credits that were recorded in FY08-09, and then of course that the effect of withholding tax on dividends from associates, and that's not consistent on the quarter-on-quarter basis. It really depends on the timing of the dividend payments. So I think the effective tax rate is generally around the 21 to 23% mark.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but for Singapore since it was a bit lower, partly because of could I safely assume that's because of the lower statutory tax and you're recognizing some of the...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well yeah, the Singapore &#x2013; the tax rate for &#x2013; the corporate tax rate for Singapore has been reduced to 17% and there was some tax credit and because of the reduction in corporate tax rate, you do some deeper tax credit adjustment coming through on the reduction in corporate tax credit &#x2013; on the reduction in corporate tax rates. And clearly we've got to wait to see what the government dish out in February for the next year's budget.</p>
