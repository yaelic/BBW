      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to the Celgene Third Quarter earnings call. Your host for the call is the Vice President of Investor Relations, Patrick Flanigan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mary and welcome everyone to Celgene Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The press release reporting our third quarter results in addition to the presentation for today's webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website located at www.celgene.com</p>
          <p>As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook, in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actually results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risk can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them.</p>
          <p>Finally, a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure is available as part of the earnings release.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Celgene's Chairman and CEO, Bob Hugin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick, and welcome to your Celgene first quarterly conference call. In addition to Patrick, I am joined this morning by Jackie Fouse, our Chief Financial Officer and for the first time by Mark Alles who has been an invaluable member of the Celgene leadership team since 2004. Mark leads our commercial organization in the Americas and earlier this year added responsibility for our Asia Pacific operations. He will become our Global Chief Commercial Officer in January. Welcome, Mark.</p>
          <p>Before Jackie and Mark review the financial and operating results of the quarter, I would like to provide my perspective. It was outstanding quarter for Celgene. Our team continues to deliver excellent commercial and financial results while advancing our regulatory, clinical, and research programs all designed to produce sustained, long-term growth and value creation.</p>
          <p>The strong global performance of multiple products drove our outstanding financial results. These exceptional results support raising our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. Jackie will review this with you in just a few minutes.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we also made substantial progress of all of our strategic initiatives. We strengthened and expanded the global reach of our hematology and oncology franchises, significantly advanced our development pipeline of 25 Phase III and pivotal clinical trials and progressed our robust early pipeline of nearly 20 compounds in preclinical and clinical development. All of these initiatives are designed to enhance industry-leading growth well into the future, and are all the more impressive as they were achieved while simultaneously successfully navigating an Article 20 process in Europe and overcoming strong economic headwinds.</p>
          <p>Importantly during the quarter we advanced critical programs that have the potential to be significant near-term drivers for our business. As I just mentioned, the REVLIMID Article 20 process was successfully concluded. This allows us to update our European newly-diagnosed marketing application with analysis from the Article 20 process. We are also updating the filing with more mature data from the trials, including the survival data from the CALGB study which became available during the review period.</p>
          <p>We're moving forward to complete this work and file the data with the responses to the 120-day questions as rapidly as possible this quarter. We're optimistic that the review process can be completed in the first three to four months of 2012. It's also our intention to file this updated data in multiple countries including the United States throughout 2012.</p>
          <p>There were a number of other important regulatory filings that are being finalized for submission. All have the potential to have a meaningful impact on our commercial results in the coming quarters. We'll follow the submission of our responses to the 120-day questions on the myeloma application with our REVLIMID MDS del 5q application in Europe.</p>
          <p>Also during this quarter we expect to support the expansion of our solid tumor franchise with a supplemental new drug application to the FDA for ABRAXANE, for first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and are reviewing our filing options in multiple international markets.</p>
          <p>And before the end of this year, we also plan on enhancing our global expansion initiative with the submission of a new drug application for REVLIMID in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in China. These are some of our near-term drivers.</p>
          <p>Our Phase III programs reflect our long-term investment in R&amp;D in the areas in which we believe we have a competitive advantage and can deliver innovative breakthrough therapies to patients suffering from serious, debilitating diseases.</p>
          <p>The trials depicted on this slide have the potential to transform the way patients suffering from diseases are treated. Our myeloma program is designed to definitively establish REVLIMID as the backbone of therapy in all segments of the disease, with pomalidomide positioned as a potential breakthrough in relapsed and refractory disease.</p>
          <p>Our MDS trial is going to extend our MDS/AML franchise to broader patient populations with global potential. We also have an encouraging pipeline in Phase II studies in MDS with oral azacitidine and ACE-536. Our lymphoma and CLL programs are advancing rapidly, capitalizing on our increasing knowledge of REVLIMID's mechanism of action related to B-cell activity. These are extraordinarily high potential programs, which are accruing well.</p>
          <p>Mark will provide some additional insight on our progress in advancing ABRAXANE but as you can tell from our Phase III program, we believe in this unique drug's potential and are investing accordingly.</p>
          <p>We're making outstanding progress in our immune inflammatory franchise with the accelerating accrual of our Phase III trials of apremilast in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.</p>
          <p>In the last few weeks we have fully accrued several significant trials including our REVLIMID pivotal study in prostate cancer and our first two pivotal apremilast trials. Overall, our apremilast pivotal trials are now over 80% accrued.</p>
          <p>I have to note that over the next 12 months we'll see a steady flow of apremilast data, beginning with data in ankylosing spondylitis in the next two weeks at the American College of Rheumatology meeting, followed by controlled Phase II data in rheumatoid arthritis in the spring and in the summer pivotal data from the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis trials will begin to be available. We are approaching a major inflection point here.</p>
          <p>The progress that we're making in our earlier stage programs is consistent with that achieved in our Phase III programs. Though we will not go into depth on these programs in this call, we are making excellent progress advancing our early critical programs as evidenced by the acceleration of our oral azacitidine program and early clinical work in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cutaneous lupus, and systemic sclerosis.</p>
          <p>And for those of you who follow our cellular therapy program PDA-001, we have completed accrual of our multiple sclerosis trial and expect results from at least three, if not four, proof of concept studies in multiple indications in 2012. In our drug discovery organization, we are capitalizing on the knowledge gained from our clinical programs and from our investment in translational research, significantly enhancing our research productivity.</p>
          <p>In September we initiated our first clinical study with our latest anti-cancer compound, CC-122.  This is the second new compound from our labs to enter clinical trials this year. Outstanding productivity. Across the board, tremendous progress from the quarter. We're well positioned for continued outstanding performance. Let me now turn the call over to Jackie for her review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today.</p>
          <p>The Celgene team and business model continued to deliver superb operating and financial performance fueled by multiple value drivers. In the third quarter our non-GAAP total revenue grew 37% and product revenue grew 38% on a year-over-year basis. All key product lines demonstrated strong growth and performed well in an overall difficult macro environment. Across the board, expenses grew slower than revenues and operating profit grew 43%.</p>
          <p>Mark will cover the commercial aspects of our business more in a moment, but in general all regions around the world were solid as we continued to execute on our global expansion and leverage our business model.</p>
          <p>We once again produced these results while investing in our own internal R&amp;D as well as the expansion of our collaboration agreements with partners so that we maintain our commit to the research and innovation that will sustain our strong growth trajectory well into the future.</p>
          <p>90% of third quarter revenue growth year-over-year came from volume. REVLIMID and VIDAZA continued to perform extremely well and VIDAZA grew in the U.S. despite the loss of exclusivity back in May. We have demonstrated our ability to deliver growth in the face of increasing price and reimbursement pressures, especially in Europe, as fundamental demand for our products remain sound. In addition, as we have mentioned in the past, we have relatively low volatility in our revenues as a result of changes in exchange rates given the nature of our hedging program.</p>
          <p>On a sequential basis, revenue growth remained strong and our momentum very good. As you can see from the webcast slide, we started 2011 with a strong first quarter and we are maintaining that trajectory on a larger base of business, including now the full integration of the Abraxis platform. On a 9-month year-to-date basis, 2011 revenues grew 39% including ABRAXANE and 38% excluding ABRAXANE, an excellent result.</p>
          <p>36% year-over-year third quarter growth in EPS mirrors revenue growth. The $0.27 absolute year-over-year increase in third quarter EPS was driven by $0.31 of growth from operations. The impact of net financial income expense in the quarter was $0.07 negative as we had net financial expense in 2011 versus net financial income in the period in 2010. The impact of a lower effective tax rate was $0.02 positive and the impact of a lower share count was $0.01 positive in the quarter.</p>
          <p>You can therefore see that the clear driver of our year-over-year EPS growth is strong operating performance.</p>
          <p>Turning to non-GAAP product sales, in the third quarter REVLIMID posted very good year-over-year growth of 28%. REVLIMID is now a $3.2 billion plus product and maintains a strong growth trajectory. REVLIMID's sequential growth was a solid 3.1% coming on top of quite strong 7.8% sequential growth in the second quarter. We did see some impact in the U.S. on REVLIMID sales from buyer behavior late in the quarter. Demand for the product is strong and Mark will talk more about that in a moment. I will cover the split of sales between the U.S. and international for REVLIMID and the other key products in the next slide.</p>
          <p>VIDAZA growth continues to be propelled by exceptional growth outside of the U.S. and the product grew overall by 35% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. In solid tumors, ABRAXANE posted 20% sequential growth Q3 over Q2 2011 on top of strong sequential growth in Q2. Commercial momentum for the product is strong and we increased our share of voice for ABRAXANE globally. The U.S. commercial platform for solid tumors is now fully in place and we continue rolling ABRAXANE out across Europe as well as promoting in it other markets around the world.</p>
          <p>Looking into the U.S. and international split of sales for the major products, we can see the solid contributions across the regions. U.S. growth in REVLIMID revenue remains strong. U.S. sequential growth in the quarter was 2% after a stellar sequential growth of 9.6% in Q2. International growth was also excellent as markets outside of the E.U. 5 more than made up for some softness in Europe.</p>
          <p>We previously told you that France was down sequentially from Q1 to Q2. That market was stable from Q2 to Q3, but not yet growing. We are seeing signs of a return to growth there in Q4.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter, total international grew sequentially by 4.7%. VIDAZA grew by 10% in the U.S. despite the loss of exclusivity and growth outside the U.S. was outstanding with 58% growth as markets like the U.K., Australia, and Japan ramped up their sales following approvals earlier this year. Sales in Japan were particularly strong in the third quarter. As a reminder, these depend on our local partners' buying patterns.</p>
          <p>ABRAXANE momentum in the U.S. is excellent, with 29% sequential growth and Mark will talk more about that in a moment. You may remember that last quarter I mentioned a modest amount of pipeline fill for ABRAXANE in Europe and you see that reflected in the quarter-to-quarter figures here for international.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the key line items in the P&amp;L, we are seeing modest leverage in our gross margins in line with expectations. R&amp;D expense for the third quarter includes a $7.5 million milestone payment to Acceleron and during the quarter we expanded that agreement to include a new compound.</p>
          <p>I will talk a bit more about SG&amp;A in the next slide and would only mention here the downward trend in SG&amp;A spend as a percentage of revenue during 2011. We see our non-GAAP operating profit margin improving by over 100 basis points in 2011, consistent with the expected leveraging of our business model.</p>
          <p>Last quarter I told you that we could see a somewhat higher effective tax rate than our original guidance of 18.5% due to the mix of revenues in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., mostly impacted by VIDAZA, and we updated our guidance to a range of 19 to 19.5%. Further analysis of the impact of that mix on the full year leads me to confirm an expected full-year tax rate of about 19%. During the third quarter we utilized a tax credit for which the impact was booked in the quarter, thus pushing the rate down in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking a little bit more at SG&amp;A expense, I would like to briefly highlight the trends that we have seen in the periods before, during, and after the acquisition of Abraxis. These expenses include integration costs as well as ongoing SG&amp;A for the solid tumor platform. On the webcast slide, you can see that these expenses jumped as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2010 when we closed on the Abraxis acquisition, and since then have trended downward over the course of 2011, including the impact of integration costs which were heaviest in Q1 and Q2 of this year. These expenses also include stepping up our global share of voice for ABRAXANE and the staged build out of the solid tumor commercial platform in Europe. In addition in the third quarter of this year, we incurred some launch-related expenses for ISTODAX PTCL in the U.S. Overall SG&amp;A expense is on a positive leveraging trajectory and you can see that in both the expected fourth quarter run rate as we end 2011 and in the nearly 100 basis point reduction in SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenue expected for the full year 2011 versus 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, our cash generation is strong. In Q3 alone, operations generated just over $600 million. As a result, our financial position continues to be excellent and cash and marketable securities are stable at about $2.6 billion while we redeploy capital into both the business as well as return funds to shareholders via share repurchases. These repurchases totaled just under $900 million during the third quarter, about 15.5 million shares. Year-to-date we have repurchased 28.1 million shares for $1.57 billion all while maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. During the quarter, we launched a $1 billion commercial paper program so that we have access to the short-term debt markets as a low cost, flexible source of debt capital.</p>
          <p>Turning to our updated financial outlook, given our operating and financial performance to date, we are updating our full-year non-GAAP guidance as follows. We are increasing total revenues to a range of $4.8 billion to $4.85 billion including that we now do not expect to see a generic competitor to VIDAZA in 2011. We are increasing the lower end of the range on REVLIMID revenues by $50 million to $3.2 billion on the solid global performance of the product and strong demand thus far in the fourth quarter. We are increasing earnings per share to a range of $3.78 to $3.80 with the expectation of strong momentum in our P&amp;L through the end of the year and continuing into 2012. This is an increase of $0.29 to the midpoint of the range, of which $0.23 comes from operations.</p>
          <p>This guidance includes our estimate for the full-year impact of health care reform in the U.S. in line with the lower end of the estimate we provided you back in Q2, and we assume approximately 451 million weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and 463 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>To summarize, the main drivers of our growth are operational. These are complemented by added value from financial management. We see this reflected in the strength of our operating profit growth and operating margins and in our EPS growth. Our performance is robust and broad-based covering all of the key operating and financial metrics.</p>
          <p>Not only are we producing industry-leading growth in both the top and bottom lines of our P&amp;L, we are doing that while investing for the future in multiple research programs and strong product franchises, all as we generate robust cash flow that allow us to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jackie; thank you, Bob, for the kind introduction and good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to be part of the team reviewing our operating results with you today.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter and through the first nine months of this year, our global commercial teams consistently produced excellent top-line sales results. REVLIMID sales in the quarter grew 3% sequentially to $820 million, and an impressive 28% year-over-year. Year-to-date sales reached $2.35 billion, representing a 34% increase compared with the same nine-month period in 2010.</p>
          <p>The primary commercial drivers for the expansion of REVLIMID sales remain constant: market share gains, increases in total prescription volume from demand and duration of treatment, and continued geographic expansion from new market approvals with favorable market access.</p>
          <p>In the United States REVLIMID now has an approximately 52% share of the overall myeloma market, an increase of two points from last quarter. Our share in second line remains strong at 44%. International REVLIMID sales grew 32% year-over-year, line two share of multiple myeloma in the four major European markets with full reimbursement grew to approximately 52%. The combined third line market share of our five major European markets is steady at just over 40%.</p>
          <p>REVLIMID demand is strong. Prescription volume growth across all regions met or exceeded our third-quarter targets and we see continued growth into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Of course, extending duration of therapy is an important contributor to sales growth, but even more importantly continuous treatment is critical for patients if they are to realize the full clinical benefit of REVLIMID. Duration continues to improve. Increasing the total number of patients treated with REVLIMID until disease progression remains a key clinical priority and commercial opportunity.</p>
          <p>Our global regulatory clinical commercial teams are making good progress expanding market access to new markets. Our launch in Japan is on track. We plan to submit the deletion 5q MDS marketing application to European regulatory authorities in the first quarter of 2012 and we are aggressively pursuing full reimbursement in Russia next year.</p>
          <p>Our team in China has made solid progress. Their focused efforts led to the rapid completion of the REVLIMID Phase II bridging study MM-21, creating the opportunity for a late 2011 submission to the State Food and Drug Administration, or SFDA. The clinical results of MM-21 are consistent with our current global label for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. We think these promising results, coupled with the mature data from MM-009 and MM-010 will support an expedited regulatory review and approval followed by an immediate commercial launch by late 2012.</p>
          <p>Third quarter VIDAZA sales are a clear demonstration of our commercial capabilities. The teams are maintaining excellent momentum in key international markets including the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Australia. Sequential quarterly sales grew 18% to $191 million, up 35% year-over-year. Importantly, international sales grew 58% year-over-year. As Jackie outlined, a generic entrant did not launch in the U.S. market during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Expanding our global leadership position and franchise opportunity in MDS is a core strategic imperative. We are making strong progress. Several key development programs for VIDAZA, REVLIMID, and oral azacitidine are advancing and we expect these therapies to deliver improved outcomes for patients across all MDS risk classifications.</p>
          <p>We completed the acquisition of Abraxis Bioscience one year ago this month. We are beginning to realize the full strategic and financial value of ABRAXANE and we continue to aggressively pursue additional areas of growth. ABRAXANE net sales grew by 20% quarter-over-quarter to $114 million. In the United States our solid tumor commercial team grew sales 29% quarter-over-quarter to $94 million. Our dedicated team in Europe continued to make progress launching ABRAXANE in key markets, expanding reimbursement, and advancing commercial programs designed to accelerate sales in 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>New clinical data for ABRAXANE will be the primary driver of future growth. In breast cancer, the final results of our randomized Phase II trial, CA-24, will be featured during the San Antonio Breast Cancer Conference in December. This is another head-to-head comparison of ABRAXANE to Taxotere, now generic docetaxel in first line metastatic breast cancer in which ABRAXANE produced significantly improved outcomes. These results will provide the clearest evidence yet that the ABRAXANE clinical profile in breast cancer improves when a higher dose is used on a weekly schedule.</p>
          <p>Planning is ongoing for major early and late stage breast cancer pivotal studies built on weekly ABRAXANE. We are also advancing additional studies in subsets of first line non-small lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and other solid tumors. Once completed, these studies should provide multiple opportunities for significant additional growth. Establishing Celgene as the global leader in oncology is a long-standing objective and ABRAXANE is rapidly becoming an internal and external driver for us to achieve this goal.</p>
          <p>Turning to the American Society of Hematology meeting, which is just a few weeks away from now, important new data on each of our hematology products REVLIMID, VIDAZA, and ISTODAX and pomalidomide will be featured. Data presented at ASH is one of the best indicators of the breadth and depth of our ongoing research investments. This year's meeting will be no exception.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the final results of our pomalidomide Phase II study MM-002 will be presented. We expect other important abstracts to provide updates to many of the REVLIMID Phase III studies in newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma, Phase II studies of REVLAMID in novel combinations across blood cancers, VIDAZA and REVLIMID in MDS, and ISTODAX in cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. With an abstract count already well over 100, ASH will again showcase the tremendous benefits our products offer to thousands of patients worldwide.</p>
          <p>I would like to thank our global commercial team for producing excellent third-quarter sales results. We look forward to delivering a strong fourth quarter and to the transformational data that we think has the potential to substantially increase our commercial prospects for all brands in 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Please welcome back &#x2013; Bob back to the call.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Mark, and thanks, Jackie. Exceptional operating results and tremendous progress in advancing important programs all with the potential of enhancing our long-term growth. We're strategically positioned to capture our full global potential.</p>
          <p>These results were accomplished by our teams across the company and across the globe, unified by our mission of addressing the unmet medical needs of patients through innovative research and breakthrough therapies and delivering value to our shareholders through operational excellence in all aspects of our business.</p>
          <p>The advances that we have made this quarter and in the first nine months of this year have laid a solid foundation for the fourth quarter and for 2012. The coming quarters will be exciting as we deliver on key development milestones and value drivers for our portfolio, many of which are outlined on this slide: significant label expansions for REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed myeloma and MDS; expansion into China; ABRAXANE in first line non-small lung cancer; new data in other indications for REVLIMID and ABRAXANE; potentially transformational data for apremilast, pomalidomide in PDA-001; meaningful milestone across our portfolio in the very near term.</p>
          <p>We're making excellent progress and are well positioned for sustained high growth and value creation in the months and years to come. Thank you very much for joining us today. And operator, would you please now open the line for questions.</p>

          <p>Hey, thanks so much for taking my question. Really appreciate it. So, maybe a question for Mark first. Just help us understand that a little bit; it sounds like you said there were some "changes" in buying patterns for REVLIMID in the U.S. and we're hoping maybe you can help us understand that a little bit. And then maybe a question for the group. Just help us understand a little bit; it looks like just that the timing in Europe for the decision it sounds like you are expecting in March, April, and I don't know if you can help us understand a little bit what are some of the outstanding issues that you guys are still talking to the EMA about and are they waiting for your mature survival data from your first line study for approval? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi Yaron, it's Jackie. Let me jump in quickly because it was me who said something about buying patterns. So as we moved through the quarter, we saw buyers behaving in a certain way. And as we got to later in the quarter, right towards the end of the quarter in the last few days of the quarter, they adjusted their buying a little bit right towards the end of the quarter, so there are probably a few days in there where buying was a little bit lighter right at the end of the quarter than it had been throughout the quarter before that. With that backdrop, maybe I will let Mark make just a couple of comments about demand.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that is exactly right. We saw just a little shift towards the end of Q3 as Jackie said and then our fundamental picture in terms of our forecasted and expected trends in prescription volume around the regions of the world are very much on track.</p>

          <p>And then to your second question about the application of newly diagnosed myeloma and maintenance in Europe, I first want to assure you that nothing has significantly changed in the overall tone of the application or what we're doing. We're just simply ensuring that any of the analysis we have done on the newly-diagnosed maintenance trials and the Article 20 process is included in the application and obviously we have some important new data from the trials that are part of the package that have matured during this Article 20 process, so we're putting all of that in the package and ensuring that we have the strongest package for review. So there really hasn't been any significant change to the review process. Now we're going to get this done as quickly as possible and we anticipate a good, rigorous expeditious review during the first quarter of next year and hopefully late this quarter and certainly in the first quarter of next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; in our discussions there hasn't been any change in the expectation of what's in the application and we're going to obviously update it with all the mature data. But there hasn't been any change in the scope of the requirements of our filing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys, for taking the question. When you look to the U.S. filing in first line for 2012, as the maintenance data matures, is there any change as to what data will go in the filing? And then from a commercial perspective, do you think that first line approval in the U.S. will be a gating factor? And I have one more follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously we clearly are prioritizing the newly diagnosed and the maintenance filing in Europe, where the importance for reimbursement and access to those patients is dependent on having the label and then the subsequent reimbursement based on that label. That is absolutely the number one priority. And our regulatory teams are working on many fronts simultaneously.</p>
          <p>As you heard, we want to get the MDS 5q filed in Europe as soon as we can get the 120-day questions completed and the application moving on myeloma. And one thing we didn't mention on the call also, we're finalizing hopefully our label discussions with the Swiss on the MDS 5q. So we're making good progress on MDS and we're going to expand that globally.</p>
          <p>Sp we want to take the newly-diagnosed application and apply it as broadly across the world as possible, so we're &#x2013; we have an opportunity to expand MM 15 and the CALGB and IFM studies; we're going to do that. And we want to ensure that's in the U.S. label, and that is going to be throughout the process as we see the data.</p>
          <p>Ultimately as we think about the overall REVLIMID label, MM-20 has a very important feature to it.</p>
          <p>And as you remember, a year ago or in December of last year, we fully accrued the 1600 patient study. So that trial is also maturing nicely and so we could see data in 2012 from that trial. But we wouldn't wait for that data for filing in any market but we would supplement it because overall we do believe that there are clear patient populations where RD is absolutely the best therapy.</p>
          <p>And so, I think we have a good program. We're moving forward with so many applications of non-small cell lung cancer, the China filing. So we have got a very robust regulatory program in the coming months that really are important revenue drivers for us and newly-diagnosed myeloma starting in Europe is at the top of that list.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Maybe a two unrelated part question really quickly on E.U. austerity; just wanted to know Jackie, if are you seeing also around a 5% price pressure like other pharma companies are seeing? But just separately on ABRAXANE can you just give us a little bit more color? You didn't talk about any generic Taxotere manufacturing issues. Do you think this didn't have anything to do with the gains in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rachel. Thanks for the questions. In the E.U. we do continue to see across-the-board average price declines. I think we have talked about that somewhat in the past, that in any given year for the last couple of years we have seen declines of 5%, 6%, 7%. We baked that into our forecast. We continue to see that over the course of 2011, which is why the growth is even more impressive. And I wanted to highlight the volume contribution from that. So we continue to see that in the E.U. It's roughly in line with the experience this company has had for the last couple of years now, so we're very attentive to it.</p>
          <p>Regarding ABRAXANE in the &#x2013; I think you meant the generic chemo shortages, mostly paclitaxel in the U.S. that we have seen in the market recently. We probably are benefiting by a few million dollars from that in the quarter. So there is a little bit of that. At the same time the core performance by ABRAXANE is very strong and the momentum there continues to be good and I'll just let Mark add to that if he wants to do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rachel. It's Mark. So Jackie is exactly right. We benefited somewhat, a few million dollars, from the shortages broadly. Ironically, it was not necessarily the taxane shortage but other products that are used in solid tumors, particularly in heavily treated ovarian cancer. In the case of the Taxotere comparison, of course we have been working our way through a marketplace where multiple generic entrants of docetaxel/Taxotere have launched. And so going into 2012 one would expect that the ASP that catches up over time with the actual price of the generic will no longer be a headwind for us. And so these market dynamics around pricing, reimbursement, but then importantly, the value proposition of ABRAXANE as a novel agent in the space and what we're doing commercially, clinically, and from a regulatory point of view, we think that we can advance in that environment quite nicely.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Hey, Bob, great hire of Patrick Flanigan. It's good to hear Mark on the call as well. I was just wondering, I heard you say on 020 that that could be out next year? Could you just &#x2013; would that be an interim if we saw the data next year? Or would that be an actual final analysis? If you could please clarify that. And then on Apremilast I just had a simple question; is it your current thinking, Bob, to go alone commercially or to partner? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. On MM-020, it is obviously an event-driven analysis, but one of the things we're extremely sensitive to is that if you look at the history of REVLIMID and the pivotal trials that we have done the results have been so significant that the trials have often been stopped early. And in many ways we're hopeful that is the same case with MM-020. But it is such a pivotal trial in the sense of really defining the upfront therapy of Rd as being an important component of that upfront therapy that we really want to make sure that the trial does answer definitively the questions it seeks to answer. So we're optimistic that even though it is an event-driven trial that we will, when we get the results, it will give us a clear and definitive answer on the questions that we're focused on.</p>
          <p>And our Apremilast, it's a very good question because as we continue to observe the marketplace in the arthritities and psoriasis, it is a changing marketplace with some increasing competition in some areas where some of the competition has fallen to the wayside. And so we're doing right now in the next few months is really examining the range of data that we expect over the next 12 months and understanding what our capabilities are, and where we should be focused.</p>
          <p>I would say that our base case is that we believe and the indications for the most part will be in the specialty areas where we can commercially access those patient populations and those physician communities. So we think this is a tremendously undervalued asset and we are going to ensure that we take the strategy that maximizes the return to us and to our shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and congratulations on a good quarter. So question on Apremilast; I've definitely noticed a change in your tone, Bob, when you speak about Apremilast, just the confidence that you have. Can you just give us a sense of what gives you that confidence, what aspects of the trial provide &#x2013; are providing you information that would lead you to start thinking about not only Phase III data but also what the market opportunity could look like and how you capture that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think there's numerous factors and we all have to recognize that it is the Phase III data that will matter. But in the trend, the accrual has been accelerating. As I mentioned, two of the pivotal trials have already accrued and we're 80%-plus accrued on all the pivotal trials that we need for filing in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We fully accrued the important controlled rheumatoid arthritis trial. We're going to see data in the first &#x2013; next couple of weeks at ACR on ankylosing spondylitis. We're going to begin a Phase III trial on ankylosing spondylitis likely in January based on what we expect and hopefully are encouraged by what we'll see in the next couple of weeks to support that.</p>
          <p>And I think that as we've done market research and ad boards around the world, if we maintain the kind of encouraging side effect profile that we've seen in the Phase II data and what we hopefully will see and what people are telling us they're seeing in the blinded basis on the side effect profile in the Phase III trials, there is a very attractive marketplace pre-biologics for a drug that is less expensive than biologics, orally available with an attractive side effect profile. Clearly the Phase III trials have to produce that, but we're encouraged by what the anecdotes are. But again, that's not something I would count on. It's the Phase III data.</p>
          <p>But we're now in the very near term, ankylosing spondylitis data in the early next year, in the first half of the year we're going to see the rheumatoid arthritis data and we're going to see in the second half of the year psoriasis and the psoriatic arthritis pivotal data out there.</p>
          <p>So we're encouraged and we're obviously hopeful we are going to see a great relationship between the activity, efficacy and the side effect profile and if this program &#x2013; this product has the profile we think it has the potential to produce, there's a great marketplace opportunity for it.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I just wanted to circle back on the REVLIMID changes in buyer behavior sort of at the end of the quarter. To the extent you can, can you maybe  give a little more color on what specifically these buyers were doing and maybe just describe, is this a phenomenon that might crop up again? And also, could you maybe put some brackets around specifically what from a dollar standpoint that impact was, and if we should just assume it's just a carry through of revenue into Q4 or something else. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris. Thanks for the question. So what we think went on is a little bit of balance sheet management on the part of the distributors right at the end of the quarter. So, you're talking about a product here that has a couple of weeks of inventory. We're talking about days here. And on a $3.2 billion product, I think we should just put that into perspective. But as we saw what looked like that bit of balance sheet management by the buyers towards the end of the quarter, we figure that that probably impacted from a negative standpoint REVLIMID sales in the quarter by $10 million to $15 million or so, more or less.</p>
          <p>Underlying demand volume is very, very good and strong as Mark already said. I don't think that this is an issue that particularly I would consider to be something that will repeat itself every quarter. Again, we're talking about a couple of days, few days here and there, and it's just going to be something that's there. But I just again will remind everybody that the base for this product is now over $3.2 billion, and that little bit of impact is not something that I would be too concerned about. And perfectly understandable given the overall economic environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could ask a follow-up, you talked about the taxane shortage sort of pulling ABRAXANE into ovarian. Can you tell us if you have seen any use in lung, and if so, how durable that you think that might be due to the taxane shortage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no it is an important question. There is a little post-ASCO improvement in the use of ABRAXANE in lung cancer. We don't think that that is linked to any shortages because docetaxel as far as we understand is not in a short supply situation, Paclitaxel, as you pointed out, is.  So I think there's an easy switch in that study because of the base drug, carboplatin. Now having said that, we, of course, are looking forward to the submission of our application for first line non-small cell lung cancer by the end of the year, and expect that at the point we get approved that we would see a substantial uptake in ABRAXANE in lung cancer. But of  course we're limited today to our current label which is only metastatic breast cancer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. I think this is Jackie's question, but perhaps you could tackle it Bob. You are going to spend $1.2 billion approximately on R&amp;D. You've got 24 or 25 Phase III trials. You are suggesting that most of them will be accrued by the end of the year. It's hard to understand why your R&amp;D wouldn't be essentially flat for next year. I know you can't give us guidance at this point, but could you give us a sense of, are there additional Phase III trials that you are going to roll into next year that might occupy the budgetary space but you are going to sort of run out essentially with all these Phase III trials either fully accruing or in the middle of the year ending at some point? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Geoff. This is Jackie. Let me start and Bob may want to come in and complement my answer. So just with respect to next year and obviously we'll talk a lot more about that when we give the 2012 guidance, but when you are in a situation with this many late stage Phase III trials hitting their peak enrollment and then when you have the data coming out of those and the preparation and all the work that has to be done to actually run the trial successfully, finish them up, get the data, analyze the data, process the data, prepare the number of filings that this company is looking at being able to produce next year, that means that that spend is not necessarily going to come down in a relative sense.</p>
          <p>That being said, you are right that as we continue to move things forward, we will have more and more hopefully trials moving along and moving into the later stages, But when we look out to maybe between 2013, 2014, we should have additional capacity to absorb those trials that would then be coming through the pipeline given the large number of Phase III trials that we are going to be wrapping up or are seeing come to conclusion as full read outs next year. And I would think about that a little bit more as an impact beyond 2012.</p>
          <p>And as we've said, I think on multiple occasions, if our R&amp;D spend continues to be at the relative levels it is today, that would be because we're so successful that we're going to be very happy to see that. And otherwise we will be creating capacity to take on appropriate additional projects or we would see some leverage in that metric as a percentage of revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I certainly do compliment that answer. And I absolutely agree; I think it was exactly right on. And I think that we benefit today because we've invested for 10 years in R&amp;D to be able to be in a position to have 25 pivotal and Phase III studies and so it didn't happen by accident. But this is a risky business, and that is why we are continuing to accelerate development of early stage programs so that in the 2014, '15, and '16 program at that period of time we are in the same positive position that we've got multiple late stage programs that are going to produce high growth for this company into 2020 and beyond</p>
          <p>.</p>
          <p>So we do not &#x2013; we're not going to change our standard as to what we invest in and what we don't. And if we don't have programs that can invest, we're going to get P&amp;L leverage out of that. And if we can invest for the future, we will as long as we continue to maintain the growth trajectory that we're on.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. I had a couple of quick questions, just the first one was just if you can give us an update on the U.S. FDA safety review for REVLIMID. When should we expect that? And the second was the potential for pom [pomalidomide] to get an accelerated filing.</p>
          <p>And the last one, quickly, Jackie, is for you is the $10 million to $15 million in the buying patterns, should we expect that to come through in 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Sapna, what U.S. safety FDA review are you referring to? I'm not aware of anything that is ongoing safety review. We obviously keep the &#x2013; all regulatory agencies around the world, but we're not expecting &#x2013; we've completed the Article 20 process in Europe and we updated everybody and we're not- there's not any process underway and we don't expect any significant changes to anything in the label in the U.S. at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, just a few weeks after the Article 20 when the U.S. FDA had started a safety review for REVLIMID and THALOMID; is that completely concluded as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; I don't think there's &#x2013; there's always &#x2013; there is a new process at the FDA over the last few years that we have obviously been a party to, like all companies, that they make sure that people are aware of any data that comes out about all products, but there is not anything specific in term of a safety review. We are moving forward in reviewing the label indications as we produce new data and put it out there. So I don't think there's any issue to be &#x2013; anything to be finalized or completed. There is nothing formal that is going to happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Sapna let me jump in on the buyer behavior. So as I mentioned, what we saw as we went through the quarter the usual buying behavior that we would see. It was a normal quarter, it's just that as we got to the end of the quarter, it looked to us like distributors did a little bit of their own balance sheet management by adjusting maybe a couple of days versus where they had been over the course of the quarter. Again, we are talking about a couple of days issue here, but that would have impacted REVLIMID by $10 million to $15 million in the quarter. It's the only thing that people are looking at is the quarterly sales on a $3.2 plus billion annual sales product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just emphasize; we want to make sure we're transparent about these issues, but when you think about what the daily sales are for REVLIMID in the U.S., one day plus or minus. And this is something that happens all the time, right? Some quarters you may have a holiday at a certain time at the end of the quarter that will lead to people having a little bit more inventory at the end of the quarter versus others.</p>
          <p>And again, as Jackie pointed out, we had &#x2013; we distribute REVLIMID through specialty pharmacy. We do not have significant inventory and the type of little amount we're talking about here is just to make sure people understand that thing cans be $5 million, $10 million, $15 million plus or minus in a quarter by just actions that naturally happen from quarter to quarter. And it is not something that is either a trend one way or the other. It goes back and forth and over the last eight, 10, 12 quarters we have seen little pluses and minuses both ways throughout the period of time.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Just a question on the frontline filing in Europe and I want to understand your confidence that you'll get a frontline approval for REVLIMID. And in answering that, I'm wondering if you could address the following and that is, is it your sense that EMA is focused on RMP+R versus MP? If they're not, what's the chance that RMP will separate from MP in 015? Is there any chance that ECOG and SWOG data could be used to support a Rev/Dex approval and remind us in 020 what Rev/Dex needs to do to show superiority over MPT. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all on the filing in Europe, no change to the expected review of strategy, process. It's the label for successful and obviously we have got to be careful about the discussion of ongoing regulatory discussions; but there is no change to the fundamental assessment here and the label for successful would depend on the data that's been submitted and that's MM-015, the IFM 0502 and the CALGB study and you saw consistent, very powerful TFS and OS data in the CALGB and other pre-specified patient population trends, et cetera. But there is no change to the regulatory process and review requirements, et cetera, et cetera, in that regard.</p>
          <p>And so that to us is &#x2013; there isn't anything new we can tell you there. The review process will run its course. And we think the data and those three trials is all very strong patient positive impact with very attractive hazard ratios and so we'll work hard to ensure we have a positive outcome and then leverage that commercially.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On 020, the assumption built into the performance in 020 is that Rev/Dex would improve progression-free survival by 50% over MPT.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the data continues to mature and as it is presented to regulators and once that's completed, it will be presented at major medical meetings. So there will be a continued update of the maturity of that data following updates to regulatory agencies on that data.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow-up on Sapna's question about the FDA label. Bob, do I understand then that you do not expect an update similar to what you have in Europe for SPMs; we shouldn't expect the new data to come on the U.S. label as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we talk about regulatory interactions and we have to be careful. Those are generally private discussions between agencies around the world and companies. But I think if you look at most actions by the FDA, that any actions that would refer to labels would be based on data for the label's indication. And when you look at the analysis that we saw in the Article 20 process in the relapsed or previously treated myeloma population, we were very pleased by the outcome of that analysis; it was very clear &#x2013; as we were pleased with the analysis of the newly-diagnosed and maintenance population on the SPM issue. And so the Article 20 is in our view and the SPM issue has been so thoroughly studied and we believe has reached the kind of conclusions that are appropriate and that this rigorous analysis produced.</p>
          <p>So I personally can't predict all regulatory actions, but we don't see any reason why you would expect to see any label change for the approved indications. When we submit newly-diagnosed applications to regulatory agencies, you would expect that whatever the data is in those filings would be represented in the label; both activity, side effect profile, safety, et cetera, and we're very glad to have any and all data that we're aware of that has been uncovered and researched and analyzed in this process to be in the REVLIMID label because it is a very positive benefit-risk profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regulatory review is critical. Of course we embrace all that. Importantly, in parallel to all of these questions, the global myeloma community has been very well aware of all of the benefit-risk questions that we're referring to here. And I think it's a very, very important almost compliment to the group that they are out ahead of this almost as much as we are and the regulators are.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I was wondering if maybe you could comment a little bit about volume-based pricing contracts given that you are awaiting approval in Europe and that is getting close.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, REVLIMID. So, REVLIMID is growing and then you are going to have E.U. approval in earlier lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Generally in Europe when we look at reimbursement and pricing, et cetera, there isn't a standard practice. There are in fact multiple practices among payers and they're from the same country &#x2013; and within countries. And so we believe we should have a very proactive discussion with payers based on the value proposition. We have been very successful in being able to articulate the value proposition of REVLIMID throughout countries whether it's <mark type="indiscernible" />, (1:01:14) Germany, France, Australia, Canada, U.S. payers.</p>
          <p>So REVLIMID has had a great value proposition. And as we get new data and we get regulatory and label expansion, we want to be and are proactive in discussing with payers around the world, but there isn't one formula to ensure that we balance the increased access of REVLIMID to patients in broader populations and understanding how to ensure that value proposition works for payers around the world. So there isn't one model for it.</p>
          <p>We want to be proactive where we should be proactive, and we'll engage in a wide range of the discussions as we expand the label. But there isn't one specific activity. But it is an ongoing, everyday proposition to maintain and defend the value proposition of REVLIMID.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Most of my questions were answered. Just a question for Jackie. You gave a great breakdown on the contributors to your beat in the quarter. I wanted to ask you about currency. Was there any effect and how should we think about currency going forward as far as its impact on EPS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mike. Thanks for the question. Well, what you saw in terms of &#x2013; on the webcast slides in terms of the year-over-year growth just in the Q3 comparison of the 37 percentage points of growth, I highlighted that 33 were volume, 2 are net price on a global basis, and 2 are net FX, and that is again on a year-over-year comparison. If I look at the change in our guidance, almost nothing came from FX in that.</p>
          <p>Again, we hedge our net operating profit exposure &#x2013; we hedge our revenues to the extent of our net operating profit exposure. So you will see less volatility for us in our revenue line and very little volatility in our operating profits and net profits because of currency.</p>
          <p>On a go-forward basis, we are relatively well hedged, I would say, against potential weakness in both the euro and the yen as we move into 2012. And we put those hedges into place some time ago. And so again, our objective is to take volatility out of the P&amp;L as a result of FX.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking the question. Interesting to hear you guys a little bit more vocal on the Chinese opportunity here; I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you visualize the review timelines there, the sort of approval process, reimbursement, negotiating for price, and then finally adoption. What sort of segments of the Chinese market would you expect to hit? And then lastly and related, would you point to any other particular drug launches in Europe as a proxy for the way you are thinking about the uptake of REVLIMID? Thanks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>China is obviously a very, very important market with the size of the population, the growing coverage, and the growing wealth and increasing upper and middle class. I think that anyone who worked closely in China &#x2013; I spent time in August in China &#x2013; that you have to look at the Chinese market as a unique marketplace and the metrics you set need to be appropriate for that marketplace. So I think we have to all go into that with our eyes open.</p>
          <p>That being said, it's very clear that to Chinese thought leaders in the hematology space, REVLIMID is a much-needed product for Chinese patients. And I think that the fact that we've been able to, as Mark pointed out, finish the MM-021 bridging study and produce results consistent with the label that we had proposed and discussed with them from the '09 and '10 data in myeloma that we are being led to believe that we'll have a very expeditious review, get it submitted before the end of the year, and have the opportunity for in the second half of next year to have an answer, and hopefully an approval there.</p>
          <p>And we have &#x2013; because of the Abraxis acquisition, we have a commercial force in place that is making good progress with ABRAXANE there. And it's a very highly skilled organization led by multiple physicians and well trained. So we do think that the Chinese opportunity is unique, and I don't think you should look at other countries as benchmarks for what can happen in China. We're taking it and looking at it as a unique and discrete opportunity. And we'll set the metrics based on our view of exactly what's available there. And we'll try and keep you up on that, but we think by the end of next year we'll have a good idea of what that potential is going to be.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on pricing and sort of how you think about reimbursement, if &#x2013; whether or not it's a subset of the Chinese market that would be addressable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's obviously as there are complex markets there, there's provincial pricing. There is federal opportunities also and often start at the provincial level. And we are fortunate that we have been through the process or our team has been through the process with ABRAXANE. So I think we understand where the priorities are and where we're going to go first. But I think we have got to get the label approved and throughout 2012 we'll be engaged in those discussions. And if we see clear issues, we'll keep you up as that develops.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey great, thanks for the question. Question on the Article 20; first, kudos for getting through it. For clarity's sake, do you think that one of the conclusions that we will get out of that is that duration of therapy is not related to SPM? I know that Palumbo has obviously stressed that point in his presentations. But do you think that that's the conclusion we will get when we read that? And secondly for clarification, do you expect to have it resubmitted &#x2013; the 120-day questions, before year end? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thanks for the question. And certainly we obviously are &#x2013; we are sensitive that we don't want to have too much discussion about dialog that goes on between us and regulatory agencies, but our analysis of the data is pretty clear, that there is no correlation between dose and duration of REVLIMID and any kind of second primary malignancy issue, and absolutely it is our goal and intention to have the 120-day questions submitted as soon as possible, and certainly before year end.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you just help us in figuring out more of your pomalidomide strategy? Do you think accelerated approval is still on the table or do you anticipate doing another &#x2013; a Phase III trial, randomized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously the base case for any company, you really want to make sure you have a Phase III program in place because even if you are fortunate enough to get an accelerated filing in whatever countries you achieve that, you are going to need to document that and validate that with a Phase III study. So Phase III is clearly always going to be the base case that certainly we operate with.</p>
          <p>That being said, we certainly believe that relapsed refractory multiple myeloma remains an unmet medical condition and we think the data with pomalidomide is very compelling and we are working with regulatory agencies around the world to ensure that if there is any potential with the existing data or augmented data &#x2013; and ultimately if it has to be Phase III we're, as I mentioned earlier, the myelofibrosis study in Phase III will be fully accrued in the next few months and we're accruing a Phase III study that we are expanding around the world in multiple myeloma with pomalidomide.</p>
          <p>So it's clear a high priority for us. Myeloma is an important business for us. We're very close to myeloma treaters. We understand the need and urgency and intensity for patients in myeloma to have access to new drugs like pomalidomide and I can assure you we're doing everything we can to accelerate its availability to patients and as soon as we have any more clarity on any marketplace, we will keep you up on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks for taking the question. Jackie, I really appreciated the transparency and granularity of your presentation. I think during the call the strength in Japan was highlighted and I just wanted to follow up on that. Can you guys I guess characterize the use there, and talk a little bit about what the strategy is for frontline maintenance in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so we are progressing nicely in our launch phase still and I think that this market is unique in that REVLIMID is almost the if there is such a thing as a perfect product for a cancer market, REVLIMID's unique mix of efficacy and safety is very much an ideal therapy for the Japanese market.</p>
          <p>So we have had the logistical steps of the launch really covered well from risk management through educating the marketplaces and now we're entering a phase we think of the launch where those logistical steps around regulatory risk management, having the team get in place and get traction are more behind us than in front of us. And we see a very, very strong future for the brand in Japan, including newly-diagnosed myeloma.</p>
          <p>Remember, we are, as Bob pointed out, in a position where for Japan we may be in the fortunate circumstance of bringing not only Rev/Dex to the market in relapsed disease but on the strength of MM-020, we would be relatively early in the launch in relapsed refractory and have data from MM-020 come into the market and we think in that space would be a cornerstone for a newly-diagnosed approval.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the prospects in France are very positive. Clearly you have tough economic conditions, which are a backdrop in many countries. Certainly France is no exception from that. And France has been a unique market with what's happened with the Servier issues and a lot of the changes in the marketplace because of those issues. And it was the center of the discussion of where the Article 20 process began. So I think all the pieces are in place for over time to continue to have that as a very attractive growth market for us.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With ongoing research. I mean, the important part about the French market including the IFM, as Bob said, the center of much of the discussion and analyses, they continued to conduct trials globally including the RVD induction trial where RVD is being compared as an induction; then versus autologous stem cell transplant, and both arms of that trial will get REVLIMID maintenance. Now there's still some debate about the true ending duration of maintenance. But that's a very, very positive example of how we continue to focus on research out of the French market.</p>

          <p>No, and as I said in the call, Maged that we were to get the 120 questions and the updated data submitted as soon as possible and that we're optimistic that we'll have the review in the first three to four months of next year. So is it a month or two? It is going to depend on how long the review takes. So we don't know the exact date. Could it be in the second quarter? Absolutely. Could it be at the end of the first quarter still? Possibly. But I think if we do get more clarity on it, we'll provide it, but we're getting the 120-day questions done as quickly as possible and we'll hopefully going through the review expeditiously.

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking our question and our congratulations as well to Mark and Patrick. Question on U.S. REVLIMID sales, recognizing that some of the slower quarter-over-quarter growth stems from purchasing patterns, but bigger picture, can you talk about what you see as the key drivers for continued U.S. growth? I'm just sort of wondering, how much of the positive data in the induction and maintenance settings has already been digested and practice patterns adjusted accordingly? And then separately, are you seeing any changes in use patterns in Europe since the Article 20 was resolved and the label updated? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so as we have outlined and I think we are as transparent as we can be, the U.S. market has broad access to cancer therapeutics like lenalidomide REVLIMID, as long as the value proposition presented by the data is very clear. And that's the case in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now, with respect to opportunity in the U.S., there is no question that continuing duration of therapy across patient segments is a critical driver. In addition, the use of maintenance post transplant as a way to treat myeloma is an area of high growth potential. The use of lenalidomide REVLIMID in that space is relatively strong, but the overall use of maintenance therapy remains very low on a relative basis.</p>
          <p>And then finally, getting a newly-diagnosed approval would allow us to commercialize directly the value proposition of REVLIMID as an induction therapy for all new patients, including high risk smoldering patients and elderly as well as young patients. We don't do that today because our label is limited to the relapse population. So from induction, whether patients go to transplant or not, then maintenance therapy as a way to treat patients post transplant and duration overall. These are strong growth drivers for the future.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously those drivers are augmented by a lot of the critical research we're going that Mark didn't mention: follicular lymphoma, nonGCB NHL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma. We just finished accruing the prostate Phase III trial; now we don't have that in our forecast but if that turns out to be positive in the next year or so, that's dramatic upside that is not in our model or I don't think anybody else's model. We have got upside from our existing business and we have invested to fully capitalize on the potential of REVLIMID across indications across the globe.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Liang from Leerink Swann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. A question for Jackie or Bob; the EPS guidance for this year implies a 35% year-over-year growth I think. Can you talk about whether if you have a philosophy of managing bottom line growth within the range over the long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question. No, I mean, I think &#x2013; no, what we want to do is appropriately invest in the business so that we maintain our long-term growth trajectory and that's primarily going to be with respect to the right investments and the right R&amp;D projects as well as making sure we invest appropriately in commercial infrastructure around the world but do all of that while running a very efficient business model.</p>
          <p>So with that in mind, the bottom line growth to some extent is going to be what it's going to be. We're not trying to "manage" that growth to a particular level. We have a business model that is able to deliver the best growth in the industry with, I think, a very modest risk profile. And we're in the fortunate position of having multiple drivers of that growth and a continuously larger base of business with more diversification.</p>
          <p>But again, we will invest appropriately for the long term in R&amp;D and commercial infrastructure and if you look at this business model, the largest driver of growth is revenue growth and then operating profit growth. And I think that's a very, very healthy situation to be in.</p>
          <p>And I think operator, I believe we have time for one more question please.</p>

      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Looks like you had a very good quarter with this 3Q; you said you don't expect a generic for the rest of the year, but what is your thinking around 2012 in terms of a generic coming in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously the longer there isn't a generic filing the better it is for us, but we are not in possession of any information that is uniquely available to us on the issue, so we continue to monitor the market closely and &#x2013; but again, we don't have any information that's available to us and not available to others. But we're optimistic that VIDAZA will continue to be for at least for a certain period of time an attractive part of the revenue model of Celgene.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the important part is as time goes by, the international footprint for VIDAZA becomes bigger and bigger. That is a big message from the quarter. And in fact, we see this brand internationally with the time and the investment we're still making in it being a meaningful contributor despite or if there is a generic entrant at some point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and if I can just remind everybody as well that the VIDAZA incremental contribution for the full year 2011 from the lack of a generic entrant is probably something on the order of $0.07, $0.08, $0.09. It depends a little bit on what you assume for the margin on the product and the tax rate, but the incremental dollars are taxed at a higher rate in the U.S. So if you look at a full year, it's probably more like a $0.10 to $0.12 contributor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>And with that if I can just maybe close off the call, I know there's a couple of people who have maybe got back into the queue for a second question. If you don't mind, we'd rather follow up with you outside of the call.</p>
          <p>So we're going to wrap the call up now. And thank you very much for your attentiveness and participation with us this morning. And we'll see you soon.</p>
