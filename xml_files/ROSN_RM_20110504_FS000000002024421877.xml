        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Rosneft's first quarter 2011 financial results conference call. My name is Alexander Palivoda.

        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Alexander and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Happy <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:24) and welcome to the call. First of all, I would like to remind you that we are going to hold our AGM on 10th of June at Krasnodar in Southern Russian. The agenda for the AGM will include the approval of annual reports, financial statements, and dividends, as well as election of members of the Board of Directors. You are most welcome to attend this event in person. In case, if you wish to do so, please contact Alexander and our IR team. Voting ballots will be sent out shortly. So if you're a shareholder at the record date of April 21st, 2011, do not forget to put your vote in.</p>
          <p>Secondly, let me turn to the financial results. The full set of financial papers for first quarter, MD&amp;A and press release, as well as presentations, were available on our website yesterday evening. I will try to focus very briefly on key highlights and will try to spend the majority of the call in the Q&amp;A format.</p>
          <p>As you know, the oil price environment was very favorable in the first quarter, oil price reached the highest levels since mid 2008. The export duty that we had to pay led the pace, of course in prices which allowed us to benefit from increasing option margins, which were about $5.5 higher, quarter-on-quarter basis. At the same time, in the refining business, the situation that we faced was not as favorable, as you will appreciate domestic prices continue to lag export net backs, due to a variety of factors which somewhat depressed our refining margin.</p>
          <p>We continue to post leading oil production growth rates, crude oil output increased by about 3% on the year-on-year basis, which is almost 2% ahead of the plan. Our largest production Yuganskneftegaz were the key growth drives in this performance; at Yugansk, we saw better flow rates at mature wells as a result of combination of geology and efficient well interventions, as well as well stock management. The number of new wells was in line with the plan, as well as our CapEx in CapEx plans.</p>
          <p>Vankor is now producing about 190,000 barrels per day. That is a number that's 8% ahead of the plan. We do expect further capacity ramp up at the field in second half of this year. We believe that the outperformance will allow us to increase annual production growth guidance from 0.6% to 1-1.5%.</p>
          <p>Refining volumes were slightly down in first quarter, due to scheduled maintenance works at some of our refineries and commissioning of the crudes distillation unit at Tuapse. This is a scheduled part of the upgrade program. We plan to launch the first stage of the upgrade that will expand the Tuapse plant next year. Construction speed and volume of foreign investments is basically on track, that's reflected in the CapEx numbers, which are substantial. Tuapse CapEx in the first quarter this year also &#x2013; includes about $100 million of the investment tariff that we are paying to Transneft for expansion of the capacity in crude pipeline which will feed the plant.</p>
          <p>Overall this year, we plan to spend $2.5 billion on the upgrade for our refineries to comply with the technical regulations on motor fuels and enhance our long-term output structure.</p>
          <p>In terms of costs, just couple of words. We have managed to keep the tight control over expense in first quarter, despite a number of negative external factors. First, a depreciated ruble did <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:42) and that was largely accelerated due to the high oil price environment. Second, the inflation process accelerated and that was reflected in our cost structure. And thirdly, and it's probably the most important factor of impact, electricity tariffs for Rosneft were about 30% up in quarter 1, 2011. We managed to compensate for electricity tariffs growth through our other cost items, including some of the work on the volume of well repairs.</p>
          <p>As a result of all these factors, external and internal, we reached EBITDA level of about $6.7 billion in the first quarter. We did generate record high free cash flow of $3.3 billion, and reduced net debt of the firm to $11.1 billion. That EBITDA number of $6.7 billion was in the overall majority earned in our upstream business. And if we look at the segmental composition of the number, we lost about $100 million of EBITDA. We did record a growth in our retail business.</p>
          <p>So, that is &#x2013; those are the highlights. The firm is going strong, and we hope to keep on the momentum going with a number of other <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:18). I will stop now, and thank you for your attention. We will be ready to take questions with Peter, Alexander and the team. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Karen Kostanian of Merrill Lynch. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have a couple of questions. First of all, your <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:59) given the taxation breaks on Vankor have been removed and also on telecom and Verkhnechosnk. The question relates to the following, given the taxation uncertainty, what is your plan for the development of the Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye field? Are you still going ahead and what are basically your plans for that?</p>
          <p>My second question relates to the 60/66 taxation regime. What are you hearing, and are you making any changes to your upstream CapEx this year in anticipation of those changes?</p>
          <p>And the last question, if you could give us an update on the BP arctic deal, are there any negotiations? Are there any progress on that, it would be great? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Karen thank you for those questions. I think on Yurbchen when you're asking the question, you did imply that our Vankor tax breaks were cancelled, which factually is incorrect. I think that's important point to get across. On Vankor the situation is as follows, we've had &#x2013; we have a number of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:09) with a number of ministries and agencies on Vankor. Our last meeting was sometime I think in early April with representatives of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Energy, as well as other high-ranking officials to discuss the Vankor.</p>
          <p>The decision that was discussed in that meeting was essentially temporarily suspending a tax break for Vankor and introducing a regime of what was called a compensation mechanism for export, i.e. we all appreciate and understand in the current tax regime, and with the current oil prices continuing, Vankor does indeed earn the rate of return that's sufficient to justify our costs, i.e. above 20% IR. But in case of the sudden fall in oil prices, the extra tax break will be introduced again, and that would compensate for the incremental development in the macro situation. So, that was the mechanism we discussed. We are now preparing a structure that would allow to address this point, and to put this in to a practical dimension. So, that work is currently being done and I think that's an important correction.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Yurbchen itself, we are waiting for formalization of the previous discussions had with regulators on the tax regime for Yurbcheno field. We didn't make an investment decision as of now. We obviously would need to see a formal tax break and a definition of what it required was a five-year break on the export duty from the beginning of the commercial production. So, that's the discussions we had, and again there was lots of agreement to support for this position. Now we are working on formalizing the decision, but before that it would be difficult for us to make the decision to invest and to justify the investment.</p>
          <p>Regarding 60/66, there is lots of work that's being done. There was I think some negative momentum in this discussion over the last couple of months, which was driven primarily by high oil prices because 60/66 did achieve the objectives of actually being revenue neutral solution for the Ministry of Finance and it did allow to stimulate upstream at the expense of downstream.</p>
          <p>Now with higher oil prices that solution got <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:03) and there is now a renewed discussion on what the right next steps should be, as the discussion is being held with Ministry of Economic Development and Ministry of Energy and representatives of key oil companies. We are very hopeful and are very supportive of finding the solution that does satisfy the need of the whole industry, and is essentially company neutral decision &#x2013; company neutral solution. So that's critical for us, and again we're doing lots of work on this.</p>
          <p>Regarding BP, I think we did achieve a number of objectives over the last three, four months. We did draw the attention of investors and actually of ourselves to the importance of offshore. The one that we've done I think in terms of understanding the offshore, lack of Rosneft business over the last call it six to nine months was very substantial, and as such we certainly feel that this is &#x2013; is going to take off and going to be a major, major, part of our story for years to come. We obviously see, and continue to see BP as an important partner for Rosneft and we'll be working towards ensuring that they play an important role in the development of our Russian arctic opportunity.</p>
          <p>In terms of BP's addition and contribute agreement that we have, I think it's difficult to comment at this stage. We do have a number of call it strategic, legal, and structural alternatives that are currently being considered, and the discussions that are being held on weekly, daily, and monthly basis. So, I think it will fall out in a favorable way for Rosneft shareholders, but I think at this stage, it's too early to comment conclusively on what the actual solution will be.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a quick follow-up. Could you &#x2013; can you name the price at which the export duties could be reintroduced, export duty tax exemptions could be reintroduced at Vankor, or you haven't clarified that with the ministries yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our basic point of reference <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:40) to the forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development that was used in Russian budget forecasting. I think the discussion we're having right now is for what number of years we should be looking and taking the benchmark. So, depending on <mark type="ph" /> that this (15:02) is at $105, or it's $95 or $90, and really it's driven by number of year that you take into account and average it out, but that discussion is being had, and there is no final decision at this point.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Ron Smith of Citi. Please ask your questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen, thank you for giving us something to do on a Friday afternoon. Question, you'd mentioned at the very end of the presentation about that most of your EBITDA having been earned in the upstream and that you had actually, if I heard correctly, lost $100 million in retail in the downstream. And leads into a question I wanted to ask was, what is your ability &#x2013; what has proven to be your ability, so far, to try to pass on some of the higher excise taxes onto final consumers? And obviously this is something very much in the press. And I was curious if that was a good bit of the reason for your inability, or difficulty, in making profit in the downstream? That's one question.</p>
          <p>Second question I would like to follow up with actually goes to the upstream, and if you could give us some kind of idea of the &#x2013; any inflation dynamics in upstream costs that you might be seeing in the field so far this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, this is obviously very interesting set of questions. In terms of downstream, I think your assessment of us not making money downstream is not entirely correct. I think, the message we want to pass on is that our retail business is not making any money, and that's very important. Obviously, today, this is a very important time for the Russian market, it's very important time for the Russian agricultural industry, and as such, from our side, we obviously went a long way, and we will be going a long way, to ensure that there is high level of supply stability and provision of all products to the most important groups of the Russian fuel consumers. So the company actually has done tremendous amount of work on this front and will be doing quite a bit of work to satisfy the needs of the domestic market in the coming months. I think that's a critical point we want to register. And that's our retail business. In terms of how that will look in a few years' time, it will really depend on export duty differential in 2013-'14, once we start to finalize our upgrade program for refineries.</p>
          <p>We almost did &#x2013; the amount of money that we've been investing there is quiet substantial, and with completion of Tuapse refinery, with completion of modernization at Tamara group of refineries in the Far East, I think we'll see a very different set of assets and balance sheet. We have &#x2013; we do believe we'll realize a meaningful return to shareholders and will allow us to make some money out of this investments at the rates that do fit our required minimum IRR.</p>
          <p>In terms of upstream costs, if Peter would want to comment on this as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Ron, thanks for the question. I think if you look in years past, you can see that first quarter tends to be not always very indicative of whole year trends. I'd encourage you to look at annual numbers over the last three to four years, and what we've aspired to do every year is maintain unit cost growth below inflation. With the exception of the jump in electricity cost growth, we think we're going to be able to do the same again this year, and we might even be able to fulfill it, even with the electricity cost growth, if we have the volume growth that we think we will above plan. So, other than electricity costs, which Pavel already addressed as being in the range of sort of 30%. In other areas, we're seeing at approximately inflation, and trying to improve in different areas in productivity.</p>
          <p>Okay, just one thing to add to Pavel's answer to the first part, who's paying the incremental excise duties, if you will. I think Pavel answered that for the most part, but I would just add that, to the extent we're being required to sell products at below export net backs domestically, it's hard to say that the consumer is paying the excise duties.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the presentation. I have a couple of questions on the Yugansk, actually. Out of how many wells drilled in the first quarter were horizontal in Yugansk? How many wells drilled were hydro fractured, and what was the efficiency of the hydro fracturing at Yugansk in the first quarter? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is the Ruhr Oil refinery acquisition. As far as I remember, you were targeting the first quarter of this year to complete the acquisition. What's the status? And probably the last question is, what are the opportunities for the cooperation with Lukoil, apart from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:58) and the Yumal and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:57) where you supply gas from Vankor and in the case you receive gas condensate, what are the other areas for the cooperation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for the questions. I think, if you don't mind, I'll ask Alexander Palivoda to come back to you on the details, with the breakdown on the Yugansk drilling activity, as you requested.</p>
          <p>On Ruhr Oil, I think you'll hear, over the next several days, news from us with respect to regarding a closing of the transaction. Actually, in the agreements initially signed in the fourth quarter of last year, it's understood that closing should happen by the end of May, so we're entirely on schedule, but I think you'll hear soon from us with respect to that question. And I'll hand over to Pavel on the Lukoil question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Lukoil, we did sign in this time the memorandum of understanding. I think there is quite a bit of work that is being done to substantiate the key joint &#x2013; the aspects of joint work. I think what was important for us is to, actually, do a number of joint projects with Lukoil, both Russian onshore and offshore. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:22) is one area where we'll actually be cooperating, I think, quite closely, given the closeness of our infrastructure facilities. And some of the offshore projects that we might pursue just off the coast of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:35). I think, with Lukoil, we'll also be looking at a number of offshore joint projects that we can complete right industrially. Things like Norway fields in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:52) There is a number of other offshore projects where we have licenses, we are looking to potential developing them jointly with Lukoil, but again, this is a subject of negotiations and continued talks between the companies. I want to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:07) bit on the working level cooperation <mark type="ph" /> and really this was in the (23:09) table number of opportunities for jointly assessing and tracking.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can ask, just for Yugansk, I'll ask to bring down from Alexander, but what were lifting costs for Yugansk in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Specifically for Yugansk, I don't have it in my head, but it's going to be right around the number for the whole company. I think it's probably somewhere around $2.70 or $2.80 per barrel on a GAAP basis, but we'll come back to you on that specifically.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Pavel. Thank you for presentation, I have couple of questions. Actually follow-up. Just to follow on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:04) question about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:06) could you please give us some timeline for this discussion with the government? When do you plan to finalize? I mean approximately: half a year, year, or two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no I think Svetlana, on this one, we will try to make it brief and neat. I think few months would be too crazy, but I think next six months we'll have clarity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, great. Thank you. And the second question is about EBITDA distribution. You said that the majority of EBITDA was earned due to &#x2013; because of options business <mark type="ph" /> clearly (24:44). Do you mind to give us this distribution and percentage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is &#x2013; given that EBITDA from a number of segments such as retail was negative, the share from upstream was overwhelming majority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>It was well above 90%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one more question. I did some calculation on the possible losses from &#x2013; let's say, from the different dynamics on oil products in domestic versus international markets. According to my calculation, you could lose around $200 million at the top line in first quarter, but as you said, it was $100 million on EBITDA level. So on revenues, it was much higher, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it was much lower, because of the fixed cost in this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Thank you. And on gasoline, so yesterday the government said that, apparently, they are going to increase export duty for gasoline to 90% from export duty for crude. Once again, I did some calculation and it turned out that you might lose around 1% of 2011 expected EBITDA. Did you make some calculation; if so, is it close to the true?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Svetlana, the answer on this is really depending on how you actually see the rest of export duty picture coming together, right, because obviously introduction of the export duty in the gasoline only, and from what I understand for May only, maybe even the rest of the year, I mean doesn't really tell the whole picture because you need to understand further 60/66 becomes implemented or maybe a 55/80 becomes implemented, etc., right? Because people as you saw the announcement obviously coming out, some people immediately pointed out to the fact that you actually could implement after that a more broader solution, right, which would involve increasing the export duty for not only for light, but also for dark products just to one high level, right, of call it 80% plus, right?</p>
          <p>And some would decrease upstream export duty to levels at say 55%, which brings us an increase in production, bringing more profitable resource into production in the industry as a whole, eliminating the subsidy you are currently giving to producers of dark products and owners of the refineries that were not modernized, right? Because obviously creating an incentive &#x2013; a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:08) incentive to build an industry &#x2013; in refining industry, that in our view given the portfolio of assets that we have would be more efficient, right? So, I think the question after this decision that was announced last night, what are the next steps of the government vis a vis the rest of light oil products, what are the steps with the dark oil products and what are the steps going to be to upstream and mineral extraction tax &#x2013; upstream mineral extraction tax.</p>
          <p>So, I mean, those questions I don't think they were fully answered at this stage, and depending on how that holds, we'll see what's the impact on our EBITDA numbers is. I think, if you take the decision from last night just in by itself and I think that's the one and only one that's made, I think your number is probably somewhat over stating the truth, and the impact would probably somewhat smaller even though we would see a smaller negative impact.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes you're right, and I fully agree, and behind my calculation, the logic was that it was the pure increase of export duty for gasoline and it is only a direct &#x2013; direct impact, so I didn't calculate it indirect impact of let's say lower domestic prices. et cetera, et cetera. And as far as your mentioned a compensation &#x2013; a possible compensation in the form of increase &#x2013; in the form of a decrease of mineral extraction tax or excise tax. Just in your personal view, how do you think what is more likely a decrease of mineral extraction tax or excise taxes?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Svetlana, this is not our decision to make so I mean it's very difficult for us to judge which one is more probable and which one is less probable even though from our calculations we do believe that &#x2013; and from the discussion with the working group with regard to taxes, obviously you do have more of headroom to cause export duty, but mineral extraction break is also nice to have. But as I said, this is a decision that has to be made by the government and by the industry regulator, so we will be sitting here and waiting for the right decision to be made.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello everyone. This is <mark type="ph" /> Yegar (31:00) from Goldman Sachs. I have two questions if I may. The first one is on the downstream side. Looking at your financial statements at MD&amp;A, we can see that the volume of gasoline that was exported pretty much tripled versus first quarter of 2010. Now the question is, is this increase related to the fact that net backs of the export sales were higher than domestic prices, hence you directed more gasoline on the export, or this is due to the fact that part of the gasoline that you produce didn't match the "requirements" from 1st January and hence you were not able to sell it domestically. And related to this, what's the percentage of the Euro 2 gasoline production from the total output of gasoline that you have now? That's the first question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat the last part of the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the portion of Euro 2 gasoline production in your total gasoline output?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will try to answer some of this. I think we're going to have to come back to you by e-mail. <mark type="ph" /> Sasha (32:55) will come back soon with some of the specific detail, but I think in terms of the broader question, decisions taken on a monthly basis as to where to realize different types of product, as I think you will appreciate very fully, are function of price, tax, transportation, demand, existing logistics capability to different regions of demand, et cetera, et cetera. It can be a multiple range of factors. In addition, I would say the point that you mentioned that some of the gasoline that you would have seen sold in the first quarter of last year would not have been compliant with the new requirements in Euro 3, and as a result would have been required, if you will, to be evacuated from Russia and exported, which frankly was more important. I suspect it's actually unfortunately the second one &#x2013; second factor. But <mark type="ph" /> Sasha (33:56) can check in to the details of that and come back to you.</p>
          <p>In terms of the last part of your question, percentage of Euro 2 -- Yeah okay. So over the course of the full year of 2011 based on the initial business plan which is obviously every month being updated, but would have been approximately 700,000 tons of Euro 2. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that total makes sense. Thank you. If I just may ask another follow-up question to this. Assuming what I believe this new degree on the export duty on gasoline raising to 90% of the crude oil export duty coming into force from May 1st. So what consequences would that have to you guys in terms of the &#x2013; your gasoline marketing? Does it mean that you will immediately start producing less gasoline or start selling more on the domestic market? Or basically there will be no impact at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as Pavel already answered, I mean I think some of these announcements came out last night. I think the Prime Minister has expanded on them further today in a meeting of the government. We are also understanding that the requirement to move from Euro 2 to Euro 3 has been postponed by a year. I think we need some time, whether it's a matter of days or a few weeks for 60/66 et cetera to come back to specifically with that. I think &#x2013; in Pavel's answer, it should be evident that in terms of material EBITDA impact, we don't see a real threat. Frankly it's probably a good thing that we are going to be able to sell what was Euro 2 again in the domestic market as opposed to having export some of it, or at least the base product, but we'll need some more time to digest yesterday's announcements.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for the presentation. Just wanted to verify on your CapEx plans, in particular $11 billion total CapEx figure that you project for this year. As far as I can see from your presentation, this number was budgeted based on 30.5 ruble versus dollar assumption. I wonder what is the risk that this number can be increased and by how much given the fact that we have much stronger ruble rate as of today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your assumptions are right. I mean we need to forecast number in rubles. In terms of rubles, there is a slight "FX" risk to this CapEx numbers. I think at the same time it should be discounted by the fact that a number of procurement programs, a number of things have largely fixed pricing in them, so we will see if the number actually creeps up. And I think per year we usually do manage to deliver a number that is lower in terms of actual CapEx for the year. So I think while there is some I think "formal risk" that number will be higher I think at the same time it will be very difficult to make sure that we deliver the best possible outcome in line with our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Can I just have a quick follow up on that. Given the fact that we have now much higher prices than we basically we had at the end of last year when presumably your budgeted this year. Do you actually anticipate that you may increase activities in particular upstream drilling at your fields in Western Siberia? Generally, by how much you would expect that your drilling volumes to go up this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vadim, thanks for that. I mean there is no intention now to go to the board with a request to increase the capital program for 2011, but as Pavel mentioned &#x2013; in past years we have managed to deliver a number better than plan. Even adding some volume of work during the year and having the total come in at an amount less than plan. I wouldn't exclude that &#x2013; as we do have some economies, if you will, found at different tenders or types of work, potentially Yugansk for example, that we might make a decision in the second half of the year to add some drilling volume if prices are where they are, and it is obvious that these incremental projects are going to be very profitable.</p>
          <p>But we don't have any plans to go the board with a request for an increase in light of the current price environment.</p>

          <p>Hello. Just a quick question to follow up on the excise taxes and the domestic prices. Could you please tell me if you expect some &#x2013; any immediate reaction from the government to compensate for that, or should we look more like mid-term for the tax changes to come? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Pavel already went to a fair amount of length in outlining different components of the whole tax regime that are clearly on the table, and even as recently as last night and this morning, again in Prime Minister Putin's comments this morning, he instructed the Ministry of Energy to develop proposal to compensate for some of the measures which have been taken with respect to downstream taxation. So, I think we just need to be patient and see how things develop over the next few weeks.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I'm sorry. Just a final quick one from me. You've extended the deadline for your share swap deal with BP till the 16th of May. I wonder what happens if you will not be able to finalize this deal by then. Will you then have another perhaps month extension or this share swap deal &#x2013; we should assume that the opportunity for that will completely lapse?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. In terms of <mark type="indiscernible" />(41:57) with BP, you referred to May 16th, you know what happens next, well I mean what happens next is I guess May 17th. And from our side, we've been very consistent and we've been very clear to the market that we do see BP as an important and strategic partner to Rosneft, right. And we do seem to understand jointly with them that this is a very reciprocal feeling, and they also see Russia as a key area of their growth strategy even though I wouldn't be able to represent their views on this goal, but this was the message that was received and was heard throughout. So, I mean we are, as I said, looking forward to investing in the Russian shelf and developing the Russian Arctic.</p>
          <p>I know this is obviously a very important project for the industry, for the Arctic region, and for both companies. So, I think we'll be looking at a number of ways to build those on our operation and ensuring that this is a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:09) for both BP and Rosneft. Depending on the effect of the outcome of our negotiations that do involve strategic, legal and structural alternatives to the solution of the current arbitration case that's being heard.</p>
