        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the BASF 2011 Annual Results Conference here in Ludwigshafen. At the same time, I would also like to welcome all of &#x2013; those of you who are watching the webcast or are listening by phone. BASF posted again excellent results in 2011 despite moderate global economic growth and higher market volatility.</p>
          <p>Following a soft fourth quarter 2011, latest macro indicators signal a moderate sequential improvement of global economic momentum during the first half of 2012. And we will show you, ladies and gentlemen, that BASF is in excellent shape and fit for 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>With me today are Kurt Bock, our Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors; and Hans-Ulrich Engel, our Chief Financial Officer. Kurt will highlight BASF's performance in 2011 and talk about the key strategic achievements of last year before he will conclude with the outlook for the year 2012. Hans will then review the fourth quarter 2011 segment results, explain some details with respect to the financial statements and finally provide you with some projections and good numbers for your 2012 spreadsheet. Afterwards, both gentlemen will be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Now, please let me remind you that we are webcasting this event. We already posted the charts, the speech as well as the press documents on our website at basf.com/share. Before we start, I also would like to ask you to please turn off your mobiles and BlackBerries because they could interfere with our microphone system.</p>
          <p>And furthermore, I would like you to take a look at the disclosure and forward-looking statements page here on the chart behind me. And actually, this brings me already to the end of my introductory statements and I would like to hand over to Kurt.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Maggie. And also, welcome from my side, ladies and gentlemen. We are glad to have you here in Ludwigshafen for our 2011 earnings call, so to say. Also, welcome to those of you who join us via webcast.</p>
          <p>BASF achieved again new record sales in 2011. In the last 12 months, we reached sales of &#x20AC;73.5 billion, up 15% compared with the full year of 2010. EBITDA at &#x20AC;12 billion and EBIT before special items at &#x20AC;8.4 billion also marked new record highs.</p>
          <p>We also delivered on our promise to significantly increase EBIT before special items adjusted for non-compensable oil taxes. We achieved &#x20AC;8 billion which represents an increase of 12%. EBIT came in slightly higher than EBIT before special items due to the disposal gain from the formation of the Styrolution joint venture, which we formed on October 1.</p>
          <p>Net income climbed to &#x20AC;6.2 billion euros, an increase of 36%. And adjusted EPS reached &#x20AC;6.26, up 9%. And finally, operating cash flow was &#x20AC;7.1 billion, up 10% and a new record as well.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we saw, as expected, a slowdown in business activities, but we continued to pursue our value-before-volume strategy. Moreover, customer orders were down due to slowing demand and tight inventory management. This resulted in lower volumes and margins across most of our chemical businesses.</p>
          <p>Sales in Q4 increased by 10% to &#x20AC;18.1 billion, primarily due to our successful price increases of 9%. BASF achieved again a record EBITDA in a fourth quarter of &#x20AC;2.9 billion, up 7%. EBITDA as well as EBIT of &#x20AC;1.9 billion were positively impacted by the disposal gain of Styrolution in the amount of &#x20AC;593 million.</p>
          <p>EBIT before special items declined by 14%, mainly due to lower volumes and margins in several of our upstream businesses. In addition, EBIT before special items was down as the Styrenics activities were moved out of BASF into the Styrolution joint venture.</p>
          <p>Net income was &#x20AC;1.1 billion, up 3% percent. And adjusted earnings per share were at &#x20AC;1.05 in Q4, which is a slight decline compared with 2010.</p>
          <p>What did we achieve in 2011? We are on track with our announced investments for future growth. Just to name a few, we successfully started up the plan of the second phase of investments at our Verbund site in Nanjing, and commissioned Nord Stream and the OPAL pipeline.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we have completed the integration of Cognis, and we are on track to realize synergies of &#x20AC;290 million. Our Styrolution joint venture with Ineos successfully commenced operations on October 1, as mentioned before. And in September, we signed a contract with EuroChem to sell our fertilizer activities in Antwerp.</p>
          <p>In January of this year, we announced that we signed also a contract to sell our 50% share in PEC-Rhin in Ottmarsheim in France to our joint venture partner GPN, a member of the French Total Group, thus completing our exit from the fertilizer business.</p>
          <p>We also delivered on operational excellence: We finalized our NEXT program, which will lead to more than &#x20AC;1 billion of annual earnings contribution.</p>
          <p>BASF already has leading positions in fast-growing businesses in the emerging markets, and we will continue to build on these. BASF's sales in the emerging markets increased to &#x20AC;21.2 billion in 2011. This represents 34% of BASF's total sales excluding Oil &amp; Gas. Since 2001, we have generated a compound annual growth rate of 13% with our activities in these emerging markets.</p>
          <p>We will further spur organic growth in these countries by increasing our sales force, strengthening our regional R&amp;D and investing in new production capacities. We expect that in 2020, emerging markets will contribute around 45% to BASF's sales again excluding Oil &amp; Gas.</p>
          <p>In 2003, we set ourself a goal of earning a premium on our cost of capital. Since then, we have earned a premium every year, with the exception of the crisis 2009, which also includes then the first-time inclusion of Ciba.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we again reached a significant premium of &#x20AC;2.6 billion on our cost of capital. We achieved this high premium despite a higher cost of capital rate. For 2011, the cost of capital rate increased from 9% to 11%, which explained the lower premium achieved. For 2012, we are also calculating with a cost of capital rate of 11%. In the coming years, we strive to earn average premium on our cost of capital of at least &#x20AC;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, share return is of utmost importance to us. We stand by our dividend policy to increase our dividend each year or at least maintain it at the previous year's level. We will propose, as you have seen this morning, to the Annual General Meeting to pay out a dividend of &#x20AC;2.50 per share, an increase of &#x20AC;0.30 or 14%. Over the past 10 years, the compound annual dividend growth rate was 15%. This reflects an attractive dividend yield of 4.6% based on the share price of &#x20AC;54 on December 30 of last year.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we continue to deliver long-term &#x2013; consistent long-term value for our shareholders. Over the past 10 years, the average annual return on BASF stock was 14%, clearly outperforming the German and European stock markets as well as the MSCI World Chemicals Index. In the last 5 years, which were impacted by the economic crisis, the outperformance was even better.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the outlook for 2012. Obviously, it's much more important to you. Obviously, today the uncertainty about the development of the next 12 to 24 months is much higher than expected a year ago. Our plan for 2012 is based on the following assumptions: first, in 2012, we expect GDP growth of 2.7%, the level achieved last year; second, we expect global chemical production without pharmaceuticals and industrial production to grow by 4.1% respectively which is below last year's number; and finally, we assume an average oil price of $110 per barrel as well as an average exchange rate of $1.30 per euro.</p>
          <p>In 2012, global chemical production, excluding pharmaceuticals again, will continue to grow in, from our point of view, in all regions. While the current uncertainties in financial markets will dampen growth perspectives, the chemical sector will benefit from positive impulses from emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we expect growth at a lower rate. However, please keep in mind that we saw a significant surge in demand in Europe in 2011. In Asia, excluding Japan, growth continues to be strong at approximately 8%. Despite an anticipated slowdown in growth due to lower export demand, China is expected to still grow strongly with nearly 9% this year.</p>
          <p>Based on these assumptions, the outlook for 2012 is as follows. We strive to increase volumes in 2012 excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures. We aim to exceed again the record levels of sales and EBIT before special items achieved by BASF Group in 2011.</p>
          <p>However, in the first half of 2012, we will most likely not achieve the exceptional high results of the comparable period of 2011. However, we expect to outperform during the second half, meaning higher results in the second half of 2012 than the first &#x2013; the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>More specifically, we plan to increase sales and earnings in all our business segments with the exception of the segment Chemicals, where we expect sales to be above last year's level but earnings to decline due to margin pressures in petrochemicals and intermediates. Sales and EBIT before special items in "Other" will be lower than last year simply due to the formation of Styrolution now accounted for at equity.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2012 and beyond, we announced at our Strategy Day last November that BASF wants to deliver an EBITDA of &#x20AC;15 billion by 2015, compared with the &#x20AC;12 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to hand over to Hans, who will fill you in on some other details and the financials. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Kurt, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, also from my side. I will focus in my presentation on the business development in the fourth quarter of 2011 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>We start with Chemicals. In Chemicals, successful price increases in all divisions led to higher sales. In addition, the startup of the Styrolution joint venture contributed positively to the top line because feedstock sales to the joint venture are now reported as third party sales. Due to the weakening demand and ongoing high raw material prices, EBIT before special items came in significantly lower.</p>
          <p>In Inorganics, sales grew by 9% mainly as a result of higher prices and slightly higher volumes. EBIT before special items was significantly up driven by higher margins.</p>
          <p>Following excellent results in the first 3 quarters of 2011, we saw a softening of demand in Petrochemicals. However, sales grew by 9%. We increased product prices due to higher feedstock cost. Volumes were considerably down since customers speculated on falling prices and consequently delayed their orders.</p>
          <p>EBIT before special items came in substantially lower, given reduced volumes in many product lines and lower margins particularly for cracker products in all regions.</p>
          <p>Sales in Intermediates decreased by 4% due to customers' destocking at year-end. Accordingly, we adjusted our global capacity utilization and reduced our inventories. EBIT before special items declined.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2011, sales in Chemicals rose by 14% and EBIT before special items reached a new high of &#x20AC;2.4 billion. Despite lower volumes in major product lines, sales in Plastics increased due to higher prices primarily in the Performance Polymers division. EBIT before special items declined considerably due to lower margins as a result of weak demand and increased raw material costs.</p>
          <p>In Performance Polymers, sales went up by 8%. Polyamide &amp; Intermediates sales rose driven by price increases. In Engineering Plastics, higher demand in North America compensated for lower volumes in Europe and Asia. EBIT before special items was, however, significantly lower due to receding margins, especially in intermediates.</p>
          <p>Sales in Polyurethanes rose by 2%. We realized higher prices in all businesses, with the exception of TDI. TDI prices and margins remained under pressure since sizable new capacities came on stream during the year and higher raw material costs could not be passed on to our customers. EBIT before special items was substantially down, mainly due to lower TDI margins.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2011, sales in Plastics rose by 12% and EBIT before special items came in below the high level of the previous year. The Performance Products segment posted a 19% rise in sales. The inclusion of the Cognis businesses as well as strong price increases across all divisions contributed to this growth. Volumes, however, declined by 6%, with a relatively strong volume decrease in Paper Chemicals and Performance Chemicals.</p>
          <p>EBIT before special items declined by 25% due to higher raw material costs, margin pressure and higher fixed costs partly related to the integration of Cognis. Special items amounted to &#x20AC;125 million mainly related to the restructuring charges in Paper Chemicals and the Cognis integration.</p>
          <p>In Dispersions &amp; Pigments, we posted higher sales in all regions and in all product lines except in pigments. The sales growth was driven by price increases and the inclusion of Cognis. Higher raw material costs could partially be passed on to the market. EBIT before special items declined substantially as a result of reduced pigment volumes and lower margins.</p>
          <p>Sales in Care Chemicals increased by more than 50%, thanks to the inclusion of Cognis business. Price competition as well as tight inventory management by our customers resulted in a slight volume decline. However, ongoing price increases, especially for detergents and formulators, compensated for the decline in volumes. Integration costs related to Cognis negatively impacted EBIT before special items.</p>
          <p>In Nutrition &amp; Health, the inclusion of the Cognis businesses and slightly higher prices contributed to good sales growth. Higher fixed and raw material costs, as well as product mix effects, outweighed price gains. Consequently, EBIT before special items declined substantially.</p>
          <p>In Paper Chemicals, demand was down because paper producers ordered less given the weaker economic environment. Volume losses could not be offset by higher selling prices. Despite these challenges, EBIT before special items improved, benefiting from ongoing restructuring measures and stringent fixed cost reduction.</p>
          <p>In Performance Chemicals, price increases and the inclusion of Cognis lifted sales. However, volumes declined significantly due to destocking activities at our customers. EBIT before special items was lower due to reduced volumes and higher fixed costs. For the full year 2011, sales of the Performance Products segment increased by 28% to &#x20AC;15.7 billion. EBIT before special items reached &#x20AC;1.7 billion, an increase of 11%.</p>
          <p>Volumes in the Functional Solutions segment were up 6%, driven by growing demand from the automotive industry for mobile emission catalysts and automotive coatings. Demand from the construction industry increased slightly, primarily owing to improved building activity in North America and Asia. EBIT before special items more than doubled.</p>
          <p>Catalyst sales increased by 17%, mainly due to higher sales volumes of mobile emissions catalysts, particularly in Asia and North America. With &#x20AC;676 million, the sales contribution from precious metal trading was up by 3.4%, driven by higher prices. EBIT before special items improved strongly.</p>
          <p>In Construction Chemicals, sales were up 4%. The business environment in southern Europe remained challenging. However, we experienced a positive development in demand in North America and Asia-Pacific. EBIT before special items declined mainly due to higher fixed costs. We implemented restructuring measures to streamline our structures in Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>Sales in Coatings increased by 8%, reflecting continued high worldwide demand for automotive OEM and refinish. EBIT before special items came in significantly above prior year. Coatings incurred high special items primarily in preparation of the planned divestment of Relius Decorative Paints.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2011, sales in Functional Solutions rose by 17% to &#x20AC;11.4 billion, and EBIT before special items was up 20% at &#x20AC;559 million.</p>
          <p>Now to Agricultural Solutions. While reaching new records in both sales and earnings for the full-year 2011, Agricultural Solutions saw a slight sales decline in Q4 due to pre-buying of our customers in Q3 in South America and portfolio optimization measures. In Q4, price increases of 2% were achieved, confirming guidance.</p>
          <p>Regionally, sales in Europe were driven by positive year-end business in France. In North America, sales were up due to higher fungicide sales. BASF's growing success in South America and other emerging markets has driven rapid growth of second half year Crop Protection sales over the past years, surging from &#x20AC;1.3 billion in 2009 to &#x20AC;1.7 billion in 2011. This corresponds to an increase of 31% in only 2 years.</p>
          <p>EBIT before special items in the fourth quarter almost matched the prior year's level despite an increase in R&amp;D spending and selling cost. The investments for our future growth are reflected in the significantly increased peak sales potential of our R&amp;D pipeline, which amounts to &#x20AC;2.8 billion.</p>
          <p>For the full-year 2011, sales in Agricultural Solutions rose by 3% to &#x20AC;4.2 billion, and EBIT before special items was up 8% at &#x20AC;810 million.</p>
          <p>In Oil &amp; Gas, sales increased by 33% driven by higher sales volumes and prices in Natural Gas Trading. In Libya, the onshore oil production restarted mid-October with 20,000 barrels per day, and reached 60,000 barrels per day at the end of December 2011 compared to a production capacity of 100,000 barrels per day. EBIT before special items for the entire Oil &amp; Gas segment declined by 4% in Q4 2011 due to lower production levels in Libya. Reported EBIT, however, came in 11% higher due to lower special items. Net income after minority interests went up by 20% to &#x20AC;276 million.</p>
          <p>Exploration &amp; Production volumes were below previous year's level as a result of the curtailed oil production in Libya. However, higher oil prices partly compensated for the lower production volumes. Consequently, sales declined by only 4%.</p>
          <p>Sales in Natural Gas Trading rose strongly thanks to higher gas prices and volumes. Margins, however, continued to be under pressure by the relatively low price level on the spot market. This effect was more than compensated by additional earnings from the startup of the OPAL pipeline.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2011, the Oil &amp; Gas segment reported sales of &#x20AC;12.1 billion, up 12%. EBIT before special items decreased by 13% to &#x20AC;2.1 billion. Adjusted for non-deductible oil taxes, EBIT before special items came in 16% higher at &#x20AC;1.7 billion. Net income rose by 15% to &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>In Other, sales decreased by 30% due to the deconsolidation of Styrenics following the formation of the Styrolution joint venture with Ineos on October 1, 2011.</p>
          <p>EBIT before special items increased by &#x20AC;128 million due to both lower hedging losses as well as lower provisions for the long-term incentive program. Positive special items of &#x20AC;623 million resulted primarily from the disposal gain of Styrolution. For further details, please refer to the Annual Report.</p>
          <p>We started the year 2011 with a cash position of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. With &#x20AC;7.1 billion, we again generated an excellent cash flow from operations in 2011 thereof &#x20AC;2.1 billion in Q4. Free cash flow reached &#x20AC;3.7 billion, thereof &#x20AC;768 million generated in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we stuck to our priorities with regard to the use of cash. We spent &#x20AC;3.4 billion for capital expenditures, which was significantly up from previous years' levels. Major projects which started operations in 2011 included the expansion of the Nanjing Verbund site in China and the new methylamine plant in Geismar, Louisiana. In addition, we completed the new oleum plant in Antwerp, Belgium, and extended our natural gas pipeline grid with the OPAL and NEL pipelines in Germany.</p>
          <p>Net cash-in mainly related to the formation of the Styrolution joint venture amounted to &#x20AC;500 million. We paid &#x20AC;2.5 billion in dividends to our shareholders and minority interest holders. And we used &#x20AC;2.4 billion for the repayment of debt. Other cash inflows include mainly the proceeds of the K+S disposal. At the end of 2011, we had a cash position of &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me turn our balance sheet. Compared with 2010, total assets rose by &#x20AC;1.8 billion to &#x20AC;61 billion. Long-term assets declined by &#x20AC;445 million. Due to the sale of K+S shares, financial assets declined by &#x20AC;1.1 billion. The Styrenics net assets in the amount of &#x20AC;734 million which were reported as assets of the disposal group were deconsolidated with the startup of the Styrolution joint venture on October 1 of the year 2011. BASF's 50% stake in the Styrolution joint venture will from now on be reported at equity.</p>
          <p>Our equity ratio improved from 38.1% to 41.5%. In 2011, we repaid 2 bonds in the amount of &#x20AC;1.2 billion. We reduced net debt by &#x20AC;2.6 billion to &#x20AC;11 billion, a reduction of &#x20AC;650 million in Q4 alone. With this, our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now below 1. With our A1/A+ rating and a well-balanced maturity profile of financial debt, BASF has an excellent financial position.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to give you some additional information and start by our operational excellence program, STEP. We are now taking the next step in operational excellence. Key focus areas of the recently announced STEP program are fixed cost reductions and margin improvements across the entire group. We expect the program to result in annual earnings contributions of about &#x20AC;1 billion by the end of 2015. Generating a strong cash flow will remain a key priority for 2012, and we will continue to keep tight control on our working capital.</p>
          <p>Our priorities for the use of cash remain clearly set. We continue to put great emphasis on organic growth through innovations. Therefore, we plan to increase our global R&amp;D expenditures from &#x20AC;1.6 billion to &#x20AC;1.7 billion in 2012. We project CapEx spending of about &#x20AC;3.5 billion. As demonstrated again this year, we remain committed to our dividend policy.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, BASF continues to be fit for 2012 and beyond. Thank you very much for your attention. And we are now happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Hans. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new system today with respect to questions and answers. So, give me a minute to inform you. Basically, behind your nametag, you will find a card which you have to please use and slide on the right hand of your microphone into a small slot. And then it is important that you firmly insert this card, so that then it gets basically the indication and it shows up on the screen here. Also, please automatically press off of the speak button, and this puts you in the queue. And then we take you one after another. We would also like to ask you to please limit your questions to about 2, if possible. And then if you have any further questions, you can requeue, and then we will start from the beginning again.</p>

          <p>So, with this, I would like to start with the first question from Norbert Barth, then comes Markus Mayer, and then Peter Spengle.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I start? Mr. Bock, you said the outlook statement is important for us. You are right. So, perhaps what I want to know a little bit of &#x2013; can you give us a little bit of flavor? What happened, especially at the beginning of the year 2012, so January, February are already closed. So, can you elaborate a little bit how the business goes by volume pricing by order intake? and also perhaps regarding to your guidance &#x2013; full year guidance 2012, you mentioned EBIT before special items, you know last year we have this special situation with this oil tax where you exclude that guidance. So, first question is it &#x2013; on what is it this time really and I believe it's now including the oil tax, would you give the same or are you the same confident if you exclude in the EBIT before special items, also the oil tax because this year we have to expect some bigger figures from the oil tax side?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Barth, for the question. How did we start into 2012, let me start by talking briefly about Q4, because in Q4 we saw volume decline as you noticed also in chemicals. And as this means that, essentially, during Q4, there was inventory de-stocking effect and customers became very, very cautious because they simply expected price declines. What we saw then in January and this now goes into February that they came back and they buy, so business is improving. However, volumes are still below the very, very high level we had achieved in the first quarter of 2011 and you remember that the first quarter of 2011 was the absolute best performing quarter we have ever had. And I &#x2013; today, I am not in a situation that I can tell you that we will have higher volumes in Q1 of 2012 than we had last year, that needs to be seen. But it's coming back and it's getting much better than what we had in Q4 over the course of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Pricing is okay. We are still in an uphill battle to increase prices. Just to give you one example is polyurethanes. MDI, we went out and put price increases forward, which highlights our strategy of value before volume. This is still our preferred strategy. I think this is the value creating strategy for the chemical industry, which could lead naturally sometimes also to volume losses because one or the other customer might say, okay, I don't accept that, but we are putting &#x2013; pushing very hard. Order intake is above last year's number, but that is certainly also affected by price effects because we have seen steady price increases over the course of 2011.</p>
          <p>Excluding oil and gas, that was the other part of your question. We give guidance now for full year saying we want to increase sales and earnings above the record levels of 2011, and we qualify this by saying most likely during the first half we will not achieve the numbers of last year, which in itself is not really an extremely optimistic start into the year. However, we think, based on our economic assumptions, GDP growth, chemical production growth, et cetera, that during the second half we should be able to outperform the numbers which we have achieved in the second half of 2011 and we stick to that guidance. It includes oil and gas and we will not go into segmental guidance. We certainly strive &#x2013; that's quite clear, we certainly strive to earn &#x2013; to improve our chemical earnings as well that to a certain degree will clearly depend on the upstream business and we made one caveat where we said in petrochemicals and intermediates and I said this in my earlier speech we do not &#x2013; we see higher sales, but most likely we will see some kind of margin squeeze because we are coming from extremely high, as you all know, from extremely high margins especially in petrochemicals in 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First on your named de-stockings, can you give us a flavor from which region and which end customers these de-stockings are coming from? And the second question on your STEP program, can you give us a split from which business unit &#x2013; business division this STEP program or the cost savings are coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I don't think that we have provided that detail of information about next and STEP which division &#x2013; which segment will provide what number. What we have done over the past couple of years is that we detailed quarter-by-quarter essentially how much have we already achieved and what is the run rate and actually we over-performed compared to our &#x20AC;1 billion goal for the next program. So, we are very confident that we will achieve the STEP &#x20AC;1 billion as well. De-stocking, that was a pretty big effect actually in Asia. Asia cooled down and saw that also when you look at our quarterly numbers for Asia cooled down quite a bit also some portfolio and mix effects. But I think Asia was in effect &#x2013; we saw a little bit of that in Europe as well and United States. Hans can probably better answer than I because that's your show.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Kurt. In the United States what we've seen or in North America what we've seen there is also in the fourth quarter tight inventory management. We've seen that in particular in going into the fourth quarter and I think as a result of the overall feeling about economic development in North America getting better, we actually saw that the situation improved in &#x2013; going into December and is looking pretty good for the months of January now and also going into the months of February and there in particular an industry that's growing strong is automotive.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. Two questions, if I may. First is on your sales projection, can we add something like 2% to the chemical production gross in 2012, like always? And the second question is on your business in the United States, there's quite a hype about shale gas and also oil production there. There's talks about new production facilities, so do you have plans to expand your business there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're absolutely right. We refer to our target to increase our business by about 2% of that chemical production that is what we always have said. Obviously, this is a medium term kind of average target. Can I promise you that we would achieve this number in every single particular year? No. Are we striving to achieve something like that this year? Quite clearly, yes, yeah. But again, too early to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, your question on shale gas, that is certainly providing a competitive advantage to the North American chemical industry. Just to give you an idea, the average spot prices in the month of January in the U.S. were right around $2.50 per million Btu, average spot price in Western Europe in excess of $8 per million Btu, gives you -gives you an idea on the environment there. What are we doing with respect to it? One, we've started up last year in 2011 a new methylamines plant, which is natural gas methanol-based. We're looking at the situation. We haven't announced any further major investments, but you see us taking advantage of that as an example now with the revamp of our cracker in Port Arthur where we will shift a little bit to lighter feed taking advantage of low natural gas prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're now moving to the next three questions. First is Lutz Gr&#xFC;ten, table 21; then Tony Jones, 25; and Martin R&#xF6;diger, table number 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. My first question is on TDI actually. I think this is the second consecutive quarter where you report lower margins and you're also saying that additional capacities are hitting the market and deteriorating the prices here. What makes you so confident that your own capacity is coming on stream, I think, at the end of 2014 along with your competitors then will be absorbed by the market and you will come back to more healthy margins in TDI? That will be my first question.</p>
          <p>The second one, more housekeeping question, you talked about feedstock sales in chemicals becoming third-party sales due to the Styrolution joint venture, could you quantify that affect for the final quarter please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to think about the second question for...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>I have an answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have an answer, okay, give the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That affect is &#x20AC;350 million in sales, and what that is the net effect of losing the Styrolution sales and then having sales coming out of the petrochemicals operating division. To TDI, yes, your observation is absolutely correct. Squeeze on TDI margins over the last couple of quarters, as expected we have to say we knew that, that was going to happen because, obviously, capacity which has been installed could be forecasted early couple of years ago. So, there is no big surprise on our point of view. Our investment for the TDI expansion here in Europe, in Germany is really based on mid-term forecast where we see a balancing out of supply and demand over time and we will contribute to that as well because I think you are aware that we will shut down ultimately then our relatively small 80,000 ton capacity, which we have in Eastern Germany in Schwarzheide. What is really important, the new TDI plant from our point of view as far as we observe the market will have very, very attractive cash cost, extremely attractive cost position and that makes us quite confident that we will be able to reap some benefits from that investment absolutely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So now, we are moving on with Tony Jones from Redburn, table number 25.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of us are trying to reconcile your new guidance in a period of fairly challenging visibility with that old market assumption that at least kind of times visibility for BASF is like a few months &#x2013; you like three months forward on the order book. So, does that imply that the mix of the business over time has allowed you to get better visibility in your order book is further forward than say just three months especially some of the downstream businesses, or you're just hoping that margins recover on restocking? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, last year, a few of the businesses had quite a big mismatch on input cost-to-selling prices especially downstream especially. Are you able to fix that? I mean are you looking at any measures to, say, shorten the price duration of certain contracts? Is there anything you can do to try and close that gap? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony, for that question. I think both questions are related with each other. It's an important point. Did our portfolio change over time? Has it changed and does it really kind of affect our ability to forecast the past forward? There are a couple of things where we see upside potential for 2012.</p>
          <p>First of all, we had some businesses which were not performing at the level of excellence that we want them. One is obviously paper chemicals and we have talked about this for quite some time because it's restructuring case coming from the combination of our business with Ciba's business. This is an ongoing process. We are making pretty good progress, I would say, and this will help us through 2012 as well.</p>
          <p>The other one where we are heavily affected by the business environment is construction chemicals apparently. We expect a little bit of bottoming out of the market. You see first indications in North America for that although at a very, very low level and we shouldn't really be overconfident here. But it means essentially that also in construction chemicals we see an opportunity to improve what we have achieved in 2011.</p>
          <p>Then we had the Cognis integration, the Cognis integration did not just bring as a special item it also had additional costs which are accounted for as normal ongoing cost, IT integration is just one example. Those costs will not re-happen again in 2012. This is all downstream activities as you noticed. Automotive, I think Hans already alluded to it. Automotive performed much better as an industry in 2010 &#x2013; 2011 than what we had expected and we are quite optimistic frankly for the industry and is particularly for our customer portfolio which we serve in Asia, in North America but also in Europe and that tells us that there might be some upside potential as well.</p>
          <p>The problem is still and you mentioned the level of visibility that the orders on hand tell us something for the next two to three to maximum four months and beyond that it's pretty cloudy and actually pretty dark out there. So, our full year guide is certainly based on the underlying assumptions. Again I repeat myself there is global economic growth and also chemical industry and industrial growth. So, I think these are a couple of explanations where we see, yes, the portfolio has shifted and yes, we have opportunities. What has happened in 2011 is also important to keep in mind when you talk about the downstream business. We had a huge surge in prices and margins, upstream activities, petrochemicals, intermediates. These guys sell at market price to our downstream businesses. So these &#x2013; our downstream people had to fight very, very hard to maintain their margins bring up prices. This simply takes time as we all know in some industries you have annual contracts. So now, we are working through this and you'll &#x2013; also will see some effect from that kind of adjustment through 2012. So, these are essentially underlying positive developments we have to realize and still we have to work very hard to make them happen, but we have an opportunity here.</p>

          <p>Now, we come to the next question from Martin R&#xF6;diger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, two questions from my side. First on Others &#x2013; segment Others. Taking out Styrenics business and soon also the fertilizers business, would it be fair to assume that this segment will generate a loss of &#x20AC;800 million on a normalized basis, ceteris paribus or should we keep in mind that you had some release of provisions for the BOP program or any windfall profits from the hedging results. And if so, can you give us an indication, what was the effect from both in 2011?</p>
          <p>And secondly on financial results, Q2 provide us with a pro forma profit contribution figure for Styrolutions in your financial results for 2012 or at least for a pro forma for 2011 and maybe an indication which or how much of restructuring costs we have to assume for Styrolutions in the next years to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Other, your question is, can you assume &#x20AC;800 million in cost on an ongoing basis, and I am just trying to think about that with now Styrolutions moving out, with fertilizers moving out, I'd say that figure is slightly too high. What we have in Other is one, the cost for our corporate R&amp;D programs, it is the cost of our central corporate organization. So, if I think about that, I'd say that figure of &#x20AC;800 million is too high overall.</p>
          <p>Financial results and Styrolution. Please keep in mind we will now account for Styrolution at equity, which means we do not control the restructuring cost of Styrolution directly. We are just one shareholder with 50% share and we are sitting on the Board of Styrolution, but the Styrolution management will essentially take those decisions and I cannot tell you today what kind of restructuring matters and what kind of costs they plan for 2012. We expect, obviously, based on the combination of both businesses INEOS and BASF that we will have a healthy financial income. That income is slightly effective when you look at our Annual Report that is a beauty of having now the Annual Report in front of you by a very shrewd and detailed accounting for the options we have in place for placing our share to INEOS or INEOS asking us to sell to them because under IFRS now we have to, on a quarterly basis, determine the fair value of those options and that will also impact the financial result. It's something which doesn't add any value. It keeps the accounts maybe happy. Take a look at the Annual Report it's amazing, what you have to do today. So...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Jeremy Redenius. Could you please give an indication of the production level you achieved in Libya for the full year 2011? On my math, you averaged about 35% of your potential volume there. I am wondering if you could confirm that and then also your expectation for 2012. And then second, could you talk a little about your waging &#x2013; your expectations for wage inflation in 2012 and also changes in head count, please? Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Could you give us an indication of the production volume you achieved in Libya in 2011 full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Asia, it's obviously much higher than in Europe. As you probably follow here in Germany, right now we have negotiations starting between the unions and the employers and they expect 6% and that is certainly higher than what we want. So, I don't want to speculate about this. But in the past, we always had, across the globe, something like 2% to 3% wage increases on average.</p>
          <p>Headcount increase, approximately 1,500 people globally, something like that. It's not &#x2013; it's something we control very, very closely on a local level or business level. But apparently, in some cases, it's directly linked to volume as well and business opportunities. So, it's always a little bit difficult to give you precise number for the entire year. This number will be adjusted according to business needs, obviously.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy, your question on Libya, I tried to do the math quickly. We ran in Libya till, let's say, roughly the end of February using the full capacity that we have there. Then, we had a ramp-up phase during November that got us to on average in the second half of December to 60,000 barrels per day. I'd say, if you take all of that together, we were probably somewhere in the range of 25% to 30% of the capacity that we have in Libya.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You mentioned about some restocking going on at the start of the year. I just wondered if you could give us a sense of your perception with regards to inventories in the chain. And then secondly, I remember previously whenever you completed the Ciba integration, you announced the Cognis acquisition fairly shortly afterwards. Given that you've now completed the Cognis integration, should we expect a significant acquisition in the coming months? And also with that, I mean are there any particular areas that you would say that are more likely than others? I mean would you potentially consider oil and gas assets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stocking, restocking and I'll start with the Ciba, Cognis. So, going by that pattern, Ciba, Cognis, obviously, we are working on the letter C right now. But seriously, it's too early to say. I mean, we are not really motivated by let's say our integration experts now being idle and let's do something about it but more by the strategic fit and by the financial attractiveness. And this is everything I can say right now. There's nothing really to add.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't expect a pattern that something has to happen almost automatically. I agree from now a couple of years we had &#x2013; every other year, we had mid-sized acquisition from our point of view. What you have seen obviously is that we are quite busy building up capabilities in some areas, particularly in batteries, where we have now done three smaller acquisitions, all capability driven, which is a different pattern apparently than acquiring a Ciba or a Cognis new businesses or complementary business in some cases. And this is also important for creating future growth and earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, if I get your question correctly, restocking, destocking where our customers that was the question. Where are we? As always not that easy to tell because our customers have a tendency not to tell us absolutely where they are with respect to their inventories. But what we've seen is that basically everyone has managed their inventories tightly during Q4.</p>
          <p>As a result of that, our assumption is that our customers are running their inventories at what's called safety levels, so not a lot of room to go below that, actually probably no room to go below that. And as a result of that the expectation is that we'll see some restocking activities, still very early to tell because there's a number of, let me say, unknowns out there in particular with respect to Asia that makes things a little bit difficult at this point in time to comment on. That simply has to do with the fact that this year we have Chinese New Year already in January while last year we had in February. So, comparing there, in particular, in Asia, you've got a distorted picture which makes it a little bit difficult to comment on that. But overall, as I said, based on what we see customers running on very, very low inventories.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a quick housekeeping question on Cognis. You mentioned a couple of times that there had been integration costs in Q4 again that were not shown as special items. Can you possibly quantify the impact on the Q4 results in Performance Products, please for us in Q4? And the second question relates to the pricing size. You posted a 9% price increase year-on-year across the whole group in Q4. When you look at this pricing number in comparison to Q3, where would we see the percentage price increase Q4 versus Q3?</p>
          <p>And then the third question relates to the &#x2013; a very, well, overall question on the raw-material cost increase that you have seen in Q4 compared to the prior year quarter, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Integration cost, Cognis not accounted for special items, about &#x20AC;40 billion in Q4 and it seems to be kind of running rate &#x2013; run rate as well. Price increase consecutively Q4 over Q3, I don't have it at the tip of my finger. I have to say we have to look it up, and I'll give you the number later on.</p>
          <p>Raw-material price increase was quite dramatic, actually, throughout 2011 going into the fourth quarter. And that, as I said earlier, is probably our biggest concern we have right now. If the oil price really continues to go up, then the world would look probably differently. If the higher oil price would just be an indication of a good, thriving global economy that would be nice but apparently, the oil price is not entirely driven by economic considerations.</p>
          <p>The raw-material effect, I don't think we ever quantify this, actually. We try to keep a little bit opaque here.</p>

          <p>So, Christian Faitz, table number 11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. Just quickly, two things. First of all, Agricultural Solutions, can you give us an update about current rating conditions? How has the year started? How has the crop season started for you on the volume side and pricing side? And then second maybe a more complex question. How do you deal at the moment or maybe for the business year with the spread between your oil-linked contracts for your gas trading activities and the spot market in gas because apparently there seems to be somewhat of a gap which could, at some point, lead to certain loss situation in natural gas trading simply because of the spread &#x2013; because my understanding is you are buying an oil-linked gas price from Gazprom. And so, you can only give obviously the spot market price into your customer base. Thanks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question about our Ag business. First of all, let me state that just looking at Q4, it's not really a good indication where we are in that particular business because Q4 is kind of &#x2013; just the final part of the year, cleaning up, so to say, housekeeping.</p>
          <p>The start into the first quarter was excellent. What we have seen so far, we are very confident for 2012 to see good volume growth often based on overall or underlying good conditions in the industry, for instance in the United States this year we expect record acreage to be grown, 95 million acres. We've never seen that before so, yeah, I think the pre-conditions for good growth are there. On top of that, we have an excellent portfolio; we had a press release, talk about that later &#x2013; last year about our pipeline. And you noticed that we increased the pipeline value of our products about &#x20AC;2.1 billion, if I remember correctly, to &#x20AC;2.8 billion based on very innovative <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:26) which we have and very good formulations. So, we are optimistic for our 2012; should be a good year. The big disclaimer is always the weather. But that's self-understood here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Therefore, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:37)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far, yes but &#x2013; still it's February. I mean, there are some early deliveries <mark type="indiscernible" /> (61:48) picking up, but let's see and wait. But what we have seen so far is good news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, with the situation that you are describing with respect to the Natural Gas Trading business, we are dealing since late 2008 to early 2009. So that was the point in time when we started to see the decoupling of the spot prices from the oil-linked contract prices. We've taken a number of measures over this period of time now to deal with that situation. We have to the extent possible used the flexibility that we have in our long-term contracts. We have renegotiated contracts, as everyone else in the industry has done. We are buying spot in the market, so we have a whole portfolio there. And you see how our Natural Gas Trading business has performed in the year 2011, which is at or slightly higher than the level that we performed that in 2010. If you look at Q4, the same is true there. Positive quarter with roughly, if I recall the figure correctly, &#x20AC;120 million in EBIT. So, you see us in a very difficult environment there. On one hand side, adjusting our purchase portfolio and then do in the market what we need to do to keep our profitability in that business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're coming to the next question is from Ronald K&#xF6;hler again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. I have one question <mark type="ph" /> relating to (63:41) Libya. Obviously, you said you have ramped up to 60,000 barrels per day. Full capacity would be 100,000 per day. What is your goal? When do you believe you might come back to full capacity? Then I have an accounting question, IAS 19 pension accounting, the change here which was just implemented and you should implement over the next years. What might that have an impact on your equity? And on the Others line, in Q4, obviously, it was quite low. Was there any reversal of option plan or what is, let's say &#x2013; yeah, what had driven the Others line to such a low level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll start with an answer to your Libya questions. It's pure speculation if I would give you an answer and say, here's the point in time when we think we'll be back at 100,000; completely depends on the infrastructure. We could ramp up the production quickly, basically immediately, but it all depends on what can actually go through the pipelines and the terminals and that's where the restriction is at this point in time. And I can tell you when that situation will move, so that we are able to produce the 100,000 and ship the 100,000 barrels again.</p>
          <p>On your Others question, please keep in mind that in Others, you have the profit from the sale of the &#x2013; to Styrolution. That's one thing. And you mentioned rightfully that there is, compared to prior years &#x2013; compared to prior year, there's a significant impact there that comes from the long-term incentive program as a result of a lower share price in the end of 2011 compared to the year 2010. On your IAS 19 question and the equity impact, I can't give you an answer at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the next question then, Fabian Smeets from ING, table number 41.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions from my side. In the review on nutrition and health, you indicate results in 2011 were hampered by higher fixed and raw material costs as well as product mix effects. But in your guidance, I think you're quite optimistic on the division, indicating you expect a significant improvement in earnings. What makes you so confident on passing on the raw material prices or maybe the mix effects in 2012?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I think you already highlighted a little bit, oil. It is reaching new highs in euros every day. And what is the response you're hearing from your clients to price hikes you're currently implementing or what is the response you expect maybe to see in the next months when oil prices move higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll try to take the question on Nutrition &amp; Health. Yeah, we're quite confident for 2012. We had to absorb higher feedstock cost last year that was quite a burden. We have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (67:19) price increases that should certainly help. It is a mixed bag of activities that you have to keep in mind. It's not just one, let's say, homogeneous business. We're talking here about vitamins, for instance, where we still see a more or less a good pricing. We talk about Aroma Chemicals which are doing well right now. We also see some restocking there. So, overall, the start into the year was good and so far there's nothing really we can add to that.</p>
          <p>With that the other part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the oil price, we've seen quite a development during the last three, four weeks, I'd say. But I think what you see in there reflected our, let me call them geopolitical issues, that are driving the oil price. In particular, the oil price in Brent up at this point in time, we were at &#x20AC;124 earlier in the day. You know what our forecast is with respect to oil. We say Brent on average, &#x20AC;110. In the course of the year 2012, obviously with the volatility that we got used to over the last four, five years when you look at oil price. Our expectation is that we see a certain, let me say, normalization of the oil price once the geopolitical issues cease to exist. Could that develop in a different direction? Could the oil price increase further? Absolutely, then the question will be where will that have a negative impact on the overall growth environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with this I break for a moment and I'm plugging in one question that came via email. And this question is from Andrew Benson [Citigroup] and he asked, will BASF buy back shares in 2012 post the AGM approval?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Andrew thanks for the question. As you rightfully noticed, we ask our shareholders meeting AGM now to approve again a stock buyback program which we had in place until 2008 where we &#x2013; for about 10 years, bought back about 20% of our outstanding stock. This is a precautionary measure, so to say, it needs to be seen then over the course of the year, what kind of ideas we have. So far we are cash flow positive, and we have reduced our net debt quite nicely and if this is a further opportunity to improve our capital structure, I think that Hans will come forward with a proposal, but simply too early to say. It depends really on investment needs. Maybe we have an idea with regard to M&amp;A. I think Hans can still add to the IAS 19 just to explain also how detailed our Annual Report is at that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The quick check with the experts allows me to say that we do not expect a significant impact, or we do not expect an impact there at all.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, we go on now with Jean de Watteville from Nomura International, table 45.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Jean de Watteville from Nomura. Just two questions, the first one, I think you mentioned on some of the areas where you would be interested by acquisition. You mention water chemicals. I'm just wondering whether you could elaborate a little bit on that subject. What are the technologies and assets that BASF currently have in water chemicals? And what would be a nice complement? Is that you're looking for technology, market access, more assets, higher market share? Just elaborate a little bit what you're looking for here.</p>
          <p>And the second subject is going back to the shale gases, obviously significant difference of competitiveness for the petrochemicals between North America and Europe. We know that there is some potential shale gas projects in Europe, it's very early days, we talked about Poland, maybe in France. I'm just interested, what's BASF position here? Obviously, you're major consumer of gas. You're also in gas trading. You're an E&amp;P company. Are you actively lobbying for the development of shale gas in Europe? Are you seeking technological partnership so that you can play a role in the development of shale gas in Europe, or you're just an observer what could happen here? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Jean, for the question about water chemicals. I think it's self understood that water itself is a big megatrend and a growing business opportunity. What we won't do &#x2013; let me start by what we won't do, we will not go into servicing water or sewage plants. Forget about that. That is not our business. What we will do is to develop &#x2013; we acquired actually a water chemicals business with Ciba, as you know, to develop additional chemicals to further improve the processing of water, waste water, et cetera. One core technology in that respect are membranes, and I don't know if you noticed that we made a pretty small acquisition of a German-based company called inge watertechnologies, a few dozen people actually, but they are very well-regarded specialist for membranes. And the big issue now is, for us, how can we combine their expertise and their market access with our knowledge, especially in certain specialty plastics to come up with better membrane technology. And that, for us, is a path forward to really offer better technological solutions to our customers just providing another chemical which is already in the market does make a lot of sense for us.</p>
          <p>It's really about innovation and new technology. It's a, let's say, emerging field of activity. We have this water chemical business, but now we are working on the membranes. And we might take a look at other opportunities as well, whether we can fasten up the development process, maybe we're making one or the other smaller acquisition, but it's simply too early to say. What we have done, we identified the area as a growth opportunity for BASF. We have expertise which we will now combine with something which we have acquired, and I think we can go from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shale gas in Europe, a lot of discussion, a lot of talk about shale gas in Europe. You already mentioned some of the hotspots. You mentioned Poland. In particular, Exxon is active there. And interestingly enough, Exxon is looking for <mark type="ph" /> farming (74:43) partners, which Exxon does not usually do when there are a lot of positive aspects with respect to their E&amp;P activities. You mentioned France. If I understand the situation correctly, France does not allow hydrofracing, which is essential to produce shale gas. So, I don't see a real potential there in France. You asked with respect to our activities in shale gas. Do we have any shale gas activities at this point in time? No, we don't. Do we have the technology in our portfolio, the hydrofracing technology? Yes, we have that. We have licenses in North Rhine-Westphalia where we're actually doing desktop studies but we haven't drilled any wells or anything like that.</p>
          <p>If you compare the situation in the U.S. to the situation that you find in Europe, I think there are a number of major differences. The first difference that you have is population density. And when you look at a shale gas field and you look at the number of wells and you look at how many wells need to be drilled, it's a lot more than in conventional gas drilling and gas production. As a result of that, I think we'll run into &#x2013; we would run into some environmental discussions and issues in particular in Western Europe when it comes to shale gas production. The regulatory environment is different in the U.S. compared to Western Europe in particular. I think that probably the highest prospects for shale gas being produced eventually, you'll have in Eastern Europe and there in Poland because Poland tries to become independent of natural gas import. There's also discussion about shale gas in Hung&#xE1;ria, Bulgaria and Romania. But I'd say very, very early stages. Our assumptions are that shale gas in the European market will not play a significant role in the next 10 years.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this brings us to the next question from James Knight, Exane BNP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I've got two questions. Firstly, in Chemicals, you indicated in intermediates some of the product lines that might see lower margins this year. Could you do the same in petrochemicals, either on product line or by region?</p>
          <p>Second question is referring to chart on page 104 which is the risks and opportunities section, I'm probably reading too much into this but you've added a line on acquisitions or cooperation which optically suggests it's not going to be particularly active year BASF in M&amp;A this year. Am I reading too much into that? I guess I got the answer on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You probably are reading too much into that. I mean, we have put something into our Annual Report. As I said before, we are not driven by the desire to keep our integration experts busy that cannot be the determining factor. It's really about, again, strategic fit. Do we find something which really makes sense both strategically and operationally and is it financially attractive...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is in the introduction to the general section of the risk management report. So, it's actually that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you have lots of reading stuff in front of you. You can go through all those pages and you can discuss it. Petrochemicals, we saw a slowdown in Q4, that's quite clear, especially in Asia, as we experienced it. The start into the new year was actually quite good. A little bit better than what we had expected coming out of the fourth quarter in terms of margins. I mean, you follow this also very, very closely for the major products. What I can say here is for us. We are a propylene net buyer. We are an ethylene small net seller, very small net seller. What is really important, the majority of what we produce here it goes downstream for captive demand. And I alluded to that earlier on when I talked about some of our downstream folks who had to cope with the high feedstock cost, raw material cost in 2012 and who might now see a little bit of room to maneuver, which still doesn't mean they should reduce prices but improve their margins, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the next question is from Thomas Gilbert, UBS, table 44.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you for taking my two questions there on the segmental guidance you've provide in the Annual Report. First, wearing the bullish glasses, it sounds like from listening to you and from reading that the Performance Products segment is really the big swing factor for the earnings this year. I mean, you're exiting 2011 with 14.7% EBITDA margin. I think the target under John Feldmann for 2012 was 20%. The difference is &#x20AC;800 million EBITDA. Could you &#x2013; will you make the 20% margin in 2012 or how close can you get? That is the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is now wearing the more bearing glasses, you're guiding in plastics. The EBIT in the nylon chain down, TDI is difficult and remains so. That means if I back &#x2013; the MDI, you must have a very bullish year on MDI or system houses. What is it &#x2013; what are you seeing in these product lines going into 2012? Is this really making up for the weaknesses elsewhere because you're guiding, I think, the segment up in earnings for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with plastics. We talked about TDI. That is a no-brainer, obviously. Polyamide, capro, we had a record, as you know, record pricing and margins in 2011. And we expect there will be a &#x2013; that is the guiding down, there will be a slight decline of pricing which we already have seen in Q4, and subsequently, also of margins. However, we are talking here about very high levels of prices and margins still reflecting &#x2013; obviously, reflecting supply and demand which overall is still quite healthy. So, we are not talking about going back to 2009, 2008 numbers. We are talking about very substantial profitability still in this entire value chain.</p>
          <p>MDI, we are in the midst of fighting from price increase because we think that the underlying supply/demand conditions justify with this. So, we try. We've seen how successful we will be. We are determined. This again reflects our strategy value before volume. And the system house, that is a growing business for us. It's a profitable business. It's a very important outlet for our precursors, MDI, TDI, polyols, obviously. So, that's highly, highly profitable.</p>
          <p>Performance Products, yes, there is room for improvement. We fully agree. And I already mentioned a couple of reasons why we should see some improvement there. You asked specifically can we guarantee the 20% EBITDA for 2012, I think that's a little bit too early to say. And as you have noticed probably we see exception of Ag which has a very specific business model which really relates itself to EBITDA as a specific target.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; when you look at the Annual Report, we also shied away from providing you with EBITDA guidance for our particular segments because there are couple of reasons which makes this really difficult. Oil &amp; Gas is self-understood, a case in itself. But even other cases, if you have price inflation which we have seen now for a couple of years, we have seen price inflation for three years of about 10% a year, obviously it's denominator of that equation EBITDA over sales increases quite a bit and brings down profitability.</p>
          <p>And for that reason we really prefer talking about absolute, absolute earnings and that is also guidance we provided to increase absolute earnings for BASF Group. So, the 20% might be a little bit of a stretch but there is room for improvement in absolute terms, I agree.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the next question is coming now from Harald Gruber, table number one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Thank you. Two questions, the first is related to the capital cost issue. Can you just briefly explain which assumptions are behind the lift from 9% to 11%? is this telling us that or saying that you might have reached an inflection point for value adding across the group level so to increase the hurdle rate because your content of specialties or higher value-added business has increased over time?</p>
          <p>Secondly working capital, can you explain the measures behind the &#x2013; well the aim to further trim working capital, is this like last year when you had noticeable downsizing of receivables or is this related to inventories, although oil prices might stay high, so this might be very challenging when it comes to inventory downsizing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question on your cost of capital, the increase from 9% to 11% that we've seen for the year 2011 and going into the year 2012, simply has to do with a cost of capital model. The fact &#x2013; the representation of our equity and the debt that we carry as a result of that, it increased from 9% to 11% in the year 2011 and we see that at the same level going into the year 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Harald, could you repeat your second question one more time, I didn't catch it quite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is dealing with the planned measures to further trim working capital requirements. So does this come from downsizing inventories or receivables or what is likely to happen, I mean this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an ongoing effort to reduce our working capital, obviously our measure is days outstanding both for inventories and for receivables. We have seen good progress with regards to receivables in 2011. With regard to inventories, there was a slight increase over the course of the fourth quarter because obviously demand came down a little bit, and we had to adjust capacities, which was &#x2013; there was a little bit of a time lag, so we are one or two days above of what we like to achieve. It's a biggest swing factor apparently for our cash flow development, also in 2012. I think, overall if you look at the entire year, 2011, we have managed our working capital quite nicely, the increase is really well below what you would expect if you look at volume growth and price developments and that is certainly also what we try to achieve in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>So then we have our next question from Derek Rosenthal from Och-Ziff Capital Management. Table number four.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for your time. Can you guys elaborate on your strategy a little bit on the newly formed Battery Materials division? And are some of the various upstream Battery Materials business is of interest to you, such as lithium chemicals or other products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We try to build a position in battery chemicals, correct. We gained a position in that particular business by acquiring Engelhard by the way in 2006. We had a foothold in that technology at that point in time, nobody spoke about automotive and batteries. We are in the midst of building a plant in Ohio in Elyria for cathode materials and that only tells you a story we are interested in battery chemicals. So we are talking cathode materials, electrolytes. We are not talking stacks, packages, building the battery itself.</p>
          <p>From our point of view, the sweet spot in that technology is really better innovative chemicals and we are closely cooperating with for instance car manufacturers, but also with battery producers to develop new chemical entities.</p>
          <p>What we have done now is we formed a business unit, Battery Materials, which is based in New Jersey. We have also made a couple of acquisitions, small ones by our standards but they are entirely what we call capability driven; three happened over the last couple of weeks which add new technology, some of the technology is 10 years out from now, lithium-sulfur technology for batteries is nothing which will materialize over the next 10 years. This is the fourth generation so to say of Battery Materials, which has much higher density, longevity et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, for us this is a long-term play, it's based on the assumption which I think is realistic that electrical mobility will grow significantly in developed countries and in developing countries and for making that happen batteries and Battery Materials are the core technology to make that happen at the end of the day. And we are quite confident we can build a position in that business.</p>
          <p>The plant which we are building in Ohio right now will come on stream third, fourth quarter of this year. This is a start if the business grows according to our expectations there will be additional investments needed, obviously, if you can come up with better materials and better technologies, but we are quite confident that bringing the entire expertise of BSF together with also some acquired expertise that we will be a frontrunner in that particular industry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So this brings us to the next question of Markus Mayer from Kepler. Table 12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Two questions from me. You said in this outlook you are quite optimistic on the automotive sector. And the question is as several, despite big OEMs, which has premium products all the others are quite negative for 2012. So what is your positive fume, is this just legislation change for example in catalysts here, which makes you positive or do you see several other trends which are of importance? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is &#x2013; we had already some questions on the margin target on your Functional Solutions business and you had gave out a target for 2012 of EBITDA margin of 18% for the group. Is this target still valid or is it also here far too away to say that it's still a valid target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You start with automotive and then I'll go...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you look at the development in automotive, what have we seen there. Let's go back to the year 2010, you saw 74 million units being sold in the year 2010, you go to the year 2011 there you're at roughly 79 million units. And you look into the forecast for the year 2012 and you're talking 84 million units. So, you'll see significant growth in that area. If you look here in Europe, I fully agree, different picture depending on where the producer sits and what brand and what spectrum of the portfolio the producer is in, but we hear from the producers in Germany, be it Daimler, BMW or VW actually quite positive.</p>
          <p>If you look into North America, the figures there last year we were at &#x20AC;12.8 million. The sales forecast for this year is roughly &#x20AC;1 million higher. The news that's coming out of Detroit, in general, very positive, so we see in transportation or automotive &#x2013; we see strong underlying growth, which in part has to do, in particular North America, with the average age of the fleet, which just requires you to replace your old car at a certain point in time and there is obviously significant further growth also coming from emerging markets and they are in particular out of Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>EBITDA, I think that's an important point to talk about for a minute. When we made that announcement of the guidance in 2008, we said we want to achieve 18% in 2012. Actually we had just finished the year 2007 when we had 17.6% EBITDA of our sales. So you might say, 'that wasn't really that much of a challenge, why did you come up with just 18%.'</p>
          <p>Now we are at about 16%. So, what has happened in between? First of all, we added about &#x20AC;2 billion absolute terms of EBITDA during both years. Secondly, we have an effect, because the denominator &#x2013; I said this before, the dominator just went up higher oil prices, higher pricing in general, which dilutes these kinds of profitability measures. And thirdly, there was a big change in our portfolio structure as well, including oil and gas and its size, or I'll give you another example, the precious metals business, which is a high-volume very low margin business.</p>
          <p>And for that reason and we discussed this in November when we met with some of you in London. For that reason, we really decided we want to set ourselves an absolute target and we came forward with this medium target, which is &#x20AC;15 billion in 2015, we are currently at &#x20AC;12 billion, so we might say it's just &#x20AC;3 billion, but nevertheless it's something like 20% increase and that needs to be materialized and we are fully determined to achieve that particular target. I think that provides you with at least equally good guidance with regard to the overall profitability targets we have as BASF.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow-up question on the Chemicals segment in Q4. The reclassification of the sales to the Styrolution joint venture or Styrolution sales to the joint venture now led to a significant sales impact, but did it also have an earnings impact in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because sales gets consolidated or deconsolidated, earnings just is earnings, doesn't change really whether it's intra-company or external, it's just earnings for the business because we sell at market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, the next one is Tony Jones from Redburn. Table 25.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just two last questions, the cost saving programs and then also your capital allocation or CapEx plan. Could you help us understand which benefit, which businesses will benefit most over the next years, two years and that will be helpful to sort of think about growth, especially. And then finally going back to Libya, I know you've had a lot of questions about this. But is there any option for you to renegotiate your tax regime there or is it in the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll start with the Libya tax question. If we go back roughly one year we had negotiated our EPSA-IV agreement, it sits there, it is ready to be signed. That would lead to a completely different tax situation than what we have currently. But you followed the events in Libya. So the agreement is sitting there. And I can tell you pretty much the same question as with respect to infrastructure and what's going to happen there. I can tell you at this point in time if and when we will get back to talking about moving from the current concession agreement environment to an EPSA agreement just don't know.</p>
          <p>The full focus of the National Oil Corporation at this point in time is at ramping up oil production, they came back much quicker than we would have actually expected. The oil production is much higher than where we thought it would be in the January and February timeframe. But, frankly, there is not a lot of focus at this point in time in the NOC on any type of contractual discussion. So, agreements are honored, as they are, but the point in time where we can talk again about moving from concession agreement to EPSA, I can tell you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, talking about CapEx, actually you'll find this also in our Annual Report in very detail on page 117, breakdown by segments and regions, but to give you an idea, 20% &#x2013; roughly 20% goes into Chemicals, 13% is Plastics, Performance Products 14%, Functional Solutions 6%, Ag is about 4% and oil and gas is pretty big chunk with 31%.</p>
          <p>Regionally, it still looks like it's tilted towards Europe, because Europe has 65%, but you have to keep in mind that essentially it includes 35% oil and gas piece, which we account for as Europe, even if it happens for instance in Northern Africa, you should take that piece out of the oil and gas piece, I think a pretty good chunk of our investments also goes to the, what we call, emerging markets. But, again, you'll find the detail here in the Annual Report.</p>
          <p>The cost savings program next, it goes across all staff, it goes across all businesses, frankly. There is no exception, everybody participates, everybody joins in. These are programs which cover productivity enhancements, cost reductions, margins improvements because you have better yields, better management of plants, et cetera. It's quite difficult for me to give you now a specific breakdown by segment. But, I think it would be fair &#x2013; take oil and gas out because they run a different scheme here, but it would be fair if you look at this from a, let's say, sales proportional point of view; that pretty much reflects also the relative contributions of the respective segments to that program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, now we're coming to Ronald K&#xF6;hler and then Christian Faitz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Another question on natural gas trading; it's one of the areas in the &#x2013; in your Annual Report where you actually say earnings might be lower in 2012 versus 2011. We have seen quite a volatile spike in spot market price and I know you have potentially for building gas reserves or you had potentially for building gas reserves if you perhaps sold in the spikes. Would that mean that an event like that might be &#x2013; so positively contribute that you potentially could do better than what you're guiding? And, one additional question on that; you said you renegotiated your contracts. Do you still have this lag effect by higher oil prices selling &#x2013; whether it's your selling prices or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (101:57) now out after these renegotiations? One question to your overall group targets, and yeah, you have obviously the 2015, 2020 targets and you spoke about you are committed to that. Did you have &#x2013; or do you have a special incentive &#x2013; management incentive program which is linked to these targets to increase the commitment of upper management, middle management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with your question on the time lag. For the oil price linked part in the contracts, the time lag still exists, still the same. You look at the average of your last nine months in your purchasing contracts and to the extent you sell based on the average of the first six of this nine-month period of time so no change there. Does the cold spell that we had here lead to &#x2013; lead us to changing our guidance for natural gas trading results? No, it does not. Let's first of all see how the month of February comes in and then we have a better picture and a better understanding on what that actually has done? Volume certainly went up as a result of the very cold weather.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about medium-term targets, let's explain this a little bit coming from our corporate governance structure which we have here at BASF. We have an Executive Board, have a target agreement with our Supervisory Board, and that target agreement certainly encompasses our budget for 2012; that is a no-brainer. But, it also has medium-term targets and longer-term targets. And, obviously, the implementation of this trade which we put forward in November, which we had chemistry, is a major part of our target agreement. And, we will report to our Supervisory Board as well how we are doing with regard to implementing those specific matters and achieving our targets. So, they are one year, more short-term targets but also medium and long-term targets. Apart from that, even if we did not have that target agreement, we stepped forward and said, okay, this is what we want to achieve, again based on certain assumptions about economic growth and production growth, et cetera, globally and I can assure you that this team works extremely hard to make this happen absolutely because we do not want to disappoint you. That's quite clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, now I'm inserting one question that came from <mark type="ph" /> Jeff (104:42) via e-mail. And, the question is, could you give us some guidance on the tax rate for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate for 2012, I'll give that a try. You've seen our tax rate come down significantly, by roughly 5 percentage points, from 31% to 26% in 2011. The big driver for that drop we've mentioned a number of times already; that's the oil production in Libya that comes with that extremely high tax. I would expect us to be in a more normal environment in the year 2012, which means a total tax rate in the low 30s and it means an underlying tax rate, excluding our Oil &amp; Gas business, in the mid-20s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, now we come to our last four questions. There is one from Christian Faitz and one from <mark type="ph" /> William Cross (105:52), from Jeremy Redenius and Richard Logan. I would like to start with <mark type="ph" /> William Cross (105:57), though, because he didn't have a question yet. So, please, William, go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Could you just amplify on your philosophy with respect to share repurchase because it did seem an important part of you presentation at the end of November? But, if I am reading correctly your comments about the change in the cost of capital, you don't expect to move sharply to a higher leverage. And, there are many companies that think of it as an accordion that to the extent that an acquisition doesn't appear and they are unpredictable, then you'll use the repurchase authorization. But, perhaps that's not the way you're thinking about it. It would be helpful just to hear your philosophy about it beyond the term precautionary measure which could be &#x2013; could mean many different things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have used it in the past very aggressively actually. As I said, we bought back about 20% of our outstanding stock and very consistently so. I think every single year, between 2000 &#x2013; 1999 and 2008, we bought back stock. And that was always a very pragmatic decision; when we had surplus capital or finance available, we bought back. And that meant that we increase our leverage quite dramatically. So, we had a much more efficient capital structure. We still have certain uncertainties today in our capital markets, financial markets. That is certainly something we have to keep in mind. But, all other things being equal, I would foresee, if we have to reduce our leverage or increase buybacks, we would go for the most cost-efficient solution and that could mean buybacks frankly. But, again, it is to be seen when this is going to happen. And, the other disclaimer as always, if you had a great idea how to spend the money operationally, strategically that then is still the first consideration. If we have surplus money available, then we buy back which also, as you said, reduces our cost of capital apparently. Does it answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You do think of this as what you will use in the event that larger acquisitions that consume the cash flow don't appear and so it's an accordion, yeah?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Then, I want to go back to Christina Faitz, still had a question. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just two quick questions; one is nutrition and health; you talked about adverse mix effects in Q4. Can you elucidate on those please? And, then second, I just want to pick your brains because I'm sure your brains are bigger than mine, at least combined. If I look at the general perception, it seems that the market seems to think Q3 and Q4 were the exception to the norm that they were lower and &#x2013; but if I look at a normal chemical business year, I would strictly also assume, because of the typical seasonality in Q3 and Q4 and maybe in addition in the future in Q1 because of the Chinese New Year, you would typically book 60% roughly of your profits on the chemical side in the first half and 40% in the second half. As such, would you actually believe that maybe the years 2010 and 2011 &#x2013; sorry, 2009 and 2010 were rather the exception to the rule that you had fairly strong and actually also sequentially growing earnings in the second half of these respective years? What is your view on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a tricky one, I have to say. You're right; essentially, we make more money in the first half than in the second half, reflecting essentially seasonality in Ag. However, over the last 10 years that kind of seasonality has come down or was reduced quite dramatically. For instance, now Q4 for Ag is also a positive quarter, which never had been the case in the past. I think it's hard to say from today's point of view whether there is, let's say, an underlying change or this is just, let's say, a reflection of industry or economic cycle. We saw, obviously, the uncertainty grew over the course of the second half of 2011. I'll come back to what I said earlier on. Our guidance for 2012 is based on the assumption that we have underlying economic growth. We see no reason why that should not be the case and that, over the course of the year, the situation will not deteriorate but might even become a little bit better. There are a couple of positive factors you can mention. Japan has a rebound, et cetera. The big, big question mark is always emerging markets in Asia, to what extent can they still continue to grow at that growth rate. That is probably the one big risk factor, apart from the oil price, which I see.</p>
          <p>The other question was about nutrition and health and how we are doing there. First of all, let me start. We had excellent performance in 2011. It was really, really good; incorporating, by the way, the Cognis business which is a major piece &#x2013; is the major piece of that particular business. Trading conditions so far are good. I wouldn't say they are benign. They are certainly challenging, but they are good. And, we aim to increase our earnings for the year. And, this reflects certainly further growth opportunities which materialize coming from the Cognis integration which is not just about cost but also about growth, growing with our customers. And, it also means that we have worked with them of the integration issues which we were facing last year.</p>

It has developed according to our expectations and integration has been a positive experience for us, and the experience also with our customers is very positive. They've reacted very, very positively to BASF acquiring the business. They see it as a solidification of the Cognis operation, extension of the product portfolio and the offerings and it has really opened up new avenues for BASF also entering certain industries and most importantly certain large customers where we had a certain share of business but now with Cognis, we are much bigger, much more important, and also more successful.</p>

Do you see this persisting for many years from here? And, do you see anything that will change that or is there anything that you can do to address that? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Apparently it affects especially North America due to the shift of feedstock from the crackers. Some people are talking about dedicated C3 plants now; for instance, we have one in Tarragona in Spain. That might happen. The price differences have grown quite attractive in some cases. So, there might be a rebalancing happening over time. For us, again, we are a small &#x2013; relatively small net buyer. It hasn't had really that much of an effect for us. Access to propylene is important. And, I'll give you one example. We announced last year that we will build an acrylics complex in Brazil and that was only possible because we were able to conclude a contract with Braskem to provide the propylene which we need for that particular investment which was a $0.5-billion investment, acrylics, dispersions, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (116:14) acrylates and SAP as well. So, so far, we have been able to secure advantaged raw materials for our growth.</p>

          <p>So Martin, you have the final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming back to acquisitions; you already talked about the smaller acquisitions like in batteries and also watertechnologies. When it comes to bigger-sized acquisitions <mark type="indiscernible" /> (116:43) Engelhard or whatsoever, those kinds of &#x2013; I know you have several acquisition criteria. Could you please prioritize these kinds of acquisition criteria? What is the first ranked criteria? Is it more the position, being close to end customers, helping BASF to reduce the cyclicality? Or, is it similar to the small acquisitions that you want to get technology, enabling you to generate innovations also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the first criteria is really how can we make money acquiring that company, how can it create actual value and that is all based on cash flow models which we have explained at other opportunity &#x2013; occasions already. It has to be financially attractive, genuinely attractive, to help us to grow the business. We are not that short-sighted that it has to be in all cases accretive in year one and especially when we talk about capability-related acquisitions, small ones, which are essentially below your radar screen, I would say. You cannot expect that they will have decent returns &#x2013; within the first couple of years. It's really about building long-term growth and profitability.</p>
          <p>With regard to strategic positioning, what we have said in the past still holds true. We are especially interested in acquisitions which are technology-driven, which have high barriers to entry, where innovation really makes a difference, where we can differentiate ourselves from our competition. And, if you look at the entire pattern of our portfolio changes over the last couple of years, moving out of, let's say, commodity-type products &#x2013; fertilizer, the last one; Styrolution &#x2013; and acquiring businesses which are more technology-driven. I think you can clearly understand this is also the path forward. And, we have done &#x2013; you saw that we have done very, very few acquisitions in chemicals &#x2013; in the segment Chemicals and in the segment Plastics, for instance; sometimes for lack of opportunity, sometimes because we already have a very strong &#x2013; inherently strong position based on our verbund philosophy. And, it doesn't make sense to just add something on which essentially dilutes your earnings and doesn't really create additional value.</p>

          <p>Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, this brings us to the end of our Analyst Conference. I would like to thank you for joining us here in Ludwigshafen. At the same time, I would also like to thank all of the guests who listened via the web or on the phone.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we hope that with our special gifts today, namely that we handed out our hot-off-the-print Annual Report to you, this will help you to do a good analysis on BASF, and we wish you happy reading and good analysis. And, should you have any further questions, please contact us in the IR team; we will be happy to help you.</p>
          <p>We will next report on our first quarter 2012 results on April 27, already at 8:30 in the morning because this is the day of our Annual General Meeting. With this, I would like to say goodbye to all of those who have joined us electronically. And, for those who are here, I would like to invite you now that we will have dinner together at the Casino. Thanks again.</p>
