          <p>Hello, this is the Chorus Call Conference operator.  Welcome to the Husky Energy First Quarter 2008 Conference Call and Webcast.  As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded.  After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Tanis Thacker, Manager of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brock.  Good morning everyone.  We are pleased that you could join us today to discuss our 2008 first quarter results we released yesterday.  With me in the room are Mr. John Lau, President and Chief Executive Officer, Rob Peabody, Chief Operating Officer, Don Ingram, Senior Vice President, Midstream Refined Products and Mike D'Aguiar, Vice President of Finance.  In today's call, John will discuss the financial results and give an overview of the operational highlights.  Don Ingram will give an update on the Midstream and Downstream divisions.  John will then conclude and we will open the call for questions, starting with analysts then followed by media.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information.  Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors.  These factors are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to John.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tanis, and good morning to everyone.  I'm very pleased to report that in the first quarter of 2008, Husky continued to achieve record results.  Sales and operating revenue was $5.1 billion in the first quarter of 2008, up 57% compared with $3.2 billion in the same quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations increased 16% to $1.5 billion or $1.82 per share.  Earnings were $887 million or $1.04 per share in the first quarter, up 36% from $650 million or $0.77 per share in the same quarter of 2007.  To allow shareholders to benefit from the high commodity prices environment and the strength in our financial performance and balance sheets, we have increased too a rise in our quarter dividends will be $0.44 per share increased 31% from $0.33 per share last, when you compare the last quarter.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, Husky's production averaged 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the 13-day turnaround at White Rose, the sale of certain non core properties and reduced natural gas drilling in 2007.  Crude oil production was 251.7 thousand barrels of oil per day in the quarter while natural gas production averaged 590 million cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, Husky progressed in a number of key areas.  On March 31, we complete all agreements required to form an integrater oil sands joint venture with BP. This transaction consists of a 50/50 partnership to develop the Sunrise oil sands project in Canada, which Husky will operate, and also a 50/50 limited liability company for the existing Toledo refinery in Ohio, USA, which BP will operate.</p>
          <p>The development of the Sunrise oil sands project is expected to proceed in three phases.  The first development phase will produce 60,000 barrels per day of bitumen starting in 2012, and the second and third phases are target to increase the production capacity to approximate 200,000 barrels per day of bitumen by 2005 to 2020.</p>
          <p>The Toledo refinery will be reconfigured to process approximately 120,000 barrels per day of bitumen feedstock by 2015, matching the two phases of the Sunrise oil sands development.</p>
          <p>All agreements with BP were completed on schedule with the effective date of the transaction of January 1, 2008.</p>
          <p>Offshore the East Coast of Canada, White Rose 13-day planned turnaround was carried out in January.  In early April, operations were temporary affected by the presence of significant ice pack and icebergs.  Preventive measurements were taken by our East Coast team to monitor conditions surrounding the field. Production has now resumed to full rates.</p>
          <p>Husky's celebrated a milestone in late March when the White Rose shuttle tankers completed their 100th safe offloading of crew from the field.  The White Rose oil field has now produced and transported approximately 84 million barrels of crude oil to markets in Canada and the United States since its initial production.</p>
          <p>The North Amethyst satellite tieback project advanced significantly in the first quarter.  Husky has secured the Global Grand Banks drilling unit drilling unit for a three-year term and is participating in the rig sharing contract for Henry Goodrich. In early April, we received approval from the regulatory board and the federal and provincial governments for the development.  Production from this field is expected in late 2009 or early 2010.</p>
          <p>Also in China, Husky completed the interpretation of the 3-D seismic data acquired over the Liwan natural gas discovery.  The West Hercules deep water drilling rig is expected to arrive at the field on schedule in mid-2008.  In preparation for deep water drilling, Husky has decided to drill one shallow water exploration well on Block 3905 before moving the rig to Block 2926 to commence delineation drilling of the Liwan discovery.</p>
          <p>In April 2008, the company completed an agreement with CNOOC to jointly develop the Madura BD field a natural gas liquids field located offshore Indonesia.  CNOOC brings extensive experience and strong technical skills in operating offshore Indonesia.  We are pleased to team up with a strong partner to ensure that the development of Madura BD field proceeds expeditiously and efficiently.  Husky will continue to focus on exploration and drilling activities offshore Indonesia.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Don Ingram to give an update on the Midstream and Downstream divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John.  Our midstream and downstream divisions again had a solid performance in the first quarter.  Upgrader earnings for the first quarter were $72 million, more than 40% higher than last year.  Infrastructure and marketing earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were 72 million, up 20% from last year.</p>
          <p>Our Canadian Refined Products division showed strong earnings in the quarter.  Net earnings were 30 million in the first quarter, 50% higher than the same period last year due primarily to strong asphalt product margins and the addition of our ethanol business at Minnedosa.</p>
          <p>At the Lima refinery, Husky has completed the acquisition transaction, assumed all the responsibilities for operations, administration and marketing.  In addition, a sales and marketing office has been established at Columbus to manage product sales and movement in the US operations.  An engineering evaluation is near completion to determine the optimal reconfiguration of the Lima refinery to increase its capacity to process heavier crude feedstocks.</p>
          <p>Given the seasonal nature of the refining margins, Husky expects crack spreads to continue to improve over those experienced in the first quarter of 2008.  We anticipate our refining operations will show stronger financial performance for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>The Minnedosa ethanol plant was commissioned in December and has now reached design capacity of 130 million liters per year during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call back to John for concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Don.  The first quarter of 2008 demonstrate Husky's financial and operating</p>
          <p>Successes in our Upstream, Midstream and Downstream divisions.  Receiving approval for the North Amethyst development allows Husky to move forward with the satellite development.  With the completion of the agreements on schedule with BP, we are now in a position to proceed with the Sunrise oil sands development on an integrated basis. The arrival of the West Hercules drilling rig offshore China will provide us a firm position for the development of the Liwan discovery and opportunity to evaluate the surrounding blocks.</p>
          <p>The joint venture with CNOOC will enable the Madura development to move forward in an expedient and cost effective manner.  We expect the year 2008 will be another record year for Husky in this high commodity prices environment.</p>
          <p>Back to you, Tanis.</p>

          <p>Thank you, John.  That concludes the formal part of the call.  We would be pleased to answer any questions you might have, starting with the analysts, then we will follow up with media.  I will now turn it back to the conference operator.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Our first question today comes from Harry Mitier of Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys.  I just wonder if you could address your financing plans if any for the rest of the year.  I know you still have some bridge debt outstanding and you said previously on conference calls that the capital market felt better, you might consider coming to market.  So, given that it feels like,at least the investor grade in that market is flying somewhat and you haven't paid down any of the bridge debt yet and it does come to you in a few months, should we expect to see a bond out of you guys over the next few months or what are your current thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.  I am John here.  For the Husky, we are in a very strong position.  We anticipate that debt-to-cash flow by the middle of this year or the end of the year will be 0.3 to 1.  Our mandate from the bond is about 2 to 1 cash flow and 40% debt to capital.  So we have a huge capacity appetite around the amount of 14 to $15 billion.  So far, we are taking advantage of the mixed market.  Our financial division is really looking at it.  We may have time to do a major acquisition and more important is the bond size and also further funding.  We don't, we are not in a hurry to utilize all the firm's debt at this point but we are definitely looking at the market in the second or third quarter of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Kate Lucas of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Kate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had a quick question on if you could share some thoughts on the outlook for Husky in the Canadian natural gas market, just in light of renewed strength in North American natural gas prices, what are you seeing in terms of trends in costs and then therefore maybe Husky's spending outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can give you a good update on that; we've got an expert in here. Don, will you cover the gas market for me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The gas market is getting stronger.  We are seeing much more stabilized pricing at the higher, at higher levels and we anticipate the gas prices to move to more Btu heat content, so much of that of oil over the next two years. And I know Rob and his group are spending more time identifying opportunities in Western Canada right now with some success. So we look at that as being a very positive market and we've got some focus on it right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Rob Peabody. I'll just add to Don's comment.  I mean with the rising gas prices, we are putting more focus on it again.  We drilled a number of very good wells in the first quarter and brought our current gas production up to the range of 630 million a day now from 590 in the last quarter.  So we are putting that focus on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great and then in terms of just any trends in terms of costs just industry-wide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you are talking operating costs, costs still are an issue.  They still are rising.  Costs in the first quarter were probably particularly heavy because we had very -extremely cold conditions for a period in the first quarter and that actually upped our cost for methanol injection to prevent freeze-ups and then a lot of extra servicing costs to get wells back on stream again.  So, I think the first quarter this year a bit of an anomaly but we continue to see heavy pressure across the board on pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Gordon Gee of RBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Gordon.  How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am good.  Thank you.  Good morning.  Could you give me an update on Tucker, what's happening there and also if you could give us an idea what kind of asset sales you had in Q1 in terms of how much you sold in terms of production, given your press release?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Tucker is a challenge, but as far as we can see it, the facilities are really first class.  We have finished the Tucker; the cost for production throughput is about 16,000 barrels per day throughput cost.  And then at the moment, because of the aqua flow underneath where we looked at adjacent position, the reservoir actually is very good.  We actually increased our reserve booking at the end of December 2007.  So, we are working with the government to see whether we can elevate that drilling about 5 to 10 meters above.  But it takes a bit of time to get approval.  We are really looking very closely at the government to review their PET-1/PET-2 and PET-3 are doing very well because PET is on the higher level.  So far, we expect because of regular process and our engineering, the shortage on labor, we expect that production according to our target would be delayed by about 12 to 18 months to arrive at that peak production.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, if you could just comment on how much asset sales occurred during the first quarter?</p>

          <p>Asset sales?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Rob Peabody again.  The asset sales 1Q to 1Q were about &#x2013; we had net sales of 5,500 barrels out.  Or not net sales &#x2013; we had 5,500 barrels of sales and subsequent to that through the year, we picked up about 2,000 of acquisitions.  So, we are net 2,500.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Our next question comes from Terry Peters of Canaccord Adams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.  I wonder if you would just clarify how the timing of the earnings from your joint venture with BP in their refinery are going to flow into Husky?  I didn't see it, so obviously it was accounted for may be differently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gee, Terry, that's a good question.  And for the BP transaction we signed all the contract 31st March 2008 and the transaction is effective 1 January, 2008.  So we had all the income accrued to us but under accounting rules, we are not supposed to put that into income.  We have to charge that as a credit to our asset.  So, you will see the turnaround or the booking of revenue and income after the completion of all documents and that would be effective 1st April.  You will see the huge benefit come through.  So, we are not forgetting about the income and earnings but theirs is credit too, the asset, as ruled out by the Chartered Accounting Institute.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you still comfortable with your previous comments with respect to the EBITDA of that refinery or is the environment a little tougher this year as opposed to last year?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Don.  The first quarter actually mirrors last year quite closely and we've seen major movements in crack spreads in March and early April and so it's coming right back in line with what we thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you be able to comment on what its contribution was in the first quarter had you booked it as earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first quarter the crack spread is quite narrow, but that is no major difference to us and the amount for that we put that in is about $7 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to ask you how the McMullen lease fits into the strategy going forward and you mentioned that it's 100% working interest.  So I presume then it's totally excluded from the joint venture with BP?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes it is, this is Rob Peabody.  But yes it is totally excluded from the BP joint venture and McMullen is very interesting because it has both coal production potential and then long-term thermal production potential and so we are actually putting together a plan right now on the coal production and on the thermal production going forward.  And, so it has a lot of potential.  We are putting together the plan.  You saw the contingent resources associated with the lease that we put out at the time of the deal.  So, we are working forward on it now &#x2013; very, very excited.</p>
