          <p>Welcome and I would like to thank you for holding for today's Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. Your lines are in a listen-only during today's conference until the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to Richard Kinder. Sir, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Ed, and welcome to the Kinder Morgan Third Quarter Analyst Call. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
          <p>Also, as usual, I'll give an overview of the quarter, and then turn it over to Park Shaper, our President, who will go through the financial results in detail. And then, we'll open the line for any and all questions that you might have.</p>
          <p>The third quarter 2009 was above last year in distributable cash flow per unit and we think that's the best metric to judge our performance on. We ended up at $1.12 per unit this quarter versus $1.09 a year ago. It was also above our plan for the third quarter by a substantial amount and we obviously have more than covered our distribution of $1.05, which we have declared for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, four out of our five business segments were above the third quarter of 2008. One exception being our CO2 business, which was barely lower largely as a result of the difference in crude oil pricing between the two quarters, down about $50 in terms of average WTI price when you compare the third quarter 2009 back to the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>We expect all the five of our business segments to exceed their 2008 results for full-year 2009. And we expect to distribute as we've said, $4.20 per unit for the full-year 2009 and we expect to fully cover or virtually fully cover that distribution out of 2009 distributable cash flow.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, as really we have all year, we've faced some negatives and we experienced some positives, which offset those negatives and I thought it would be interesting to just take you through both patches, the negatives and the positives and let me start with the negatives.</p>
          <p>We continue to experience lower products volumes on our Products Pipeline. For the quarter, total refined products were down 2.7% from a year ago. It's interesting that the gasoline for the second quarter in a row was positive on a year-to-year comparison. If you include ethanol shipments with it, it was positive, but barely by 0.2% for the quarter. So we have seen some pickup in gasoline volumes on our system. We have not seen meaningful pickups on the jet fuel or particularly on diesel. So that's the first negative we experienced.</p>
          <p>The second is in our Terminals group, and that's lower steel volumes. In fact, if you look at the Terminals group, the liquids terminals portions of that business segment is doing very well ahead of plan and well ahead of last year and the weakness is in the bulk side of the operation overwhelmingly on steel volumes. And let me give you some volumes to back that. There are some specific volume numbers to back that up.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of 2009, we handled 5 million tons of steel that compares to 9.4 million tons in the third quarter of 2008. Now, we'll say that we have seen some meaningful improvement as the year is going on. In the second quarter of 2009, we handled 3.1 million tons, again going back to 5 million tons for the third quarter. So we did experience a nice sequential improvement. May be that indicates that the bottom has been reached and we're starting to see an upturn, but still well below the third quarter of last year, which I might add, was our all-time record quarter for steel throughput.</p>
          <p>This is pretty consistent with the information we have with regard to overall utilization of capacity in the steel production business in United States. At the peak in 2007 and for part of 2008, capacity utilization was running in the 85 to 87% range. It dropped as low as 40% in May of this year and now has rebounded in October 2 around 60%. We'll see how it continues to go in the fourth quarter and beyond, but still a weak comparison to a year ago, but a better comparison on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>Now, the negative of course is in our CO2 segment, that's oil prices as you'll recall, we targeted our budget on average WTI price of $68 a barrel. Even with the up tick we've seen over the last few weeks, we're still going to fall somewhat shorter than probably if today's forward curve holds something in approximately $8 short of our original target.</p>
          <p>And then the final negative we've experienced is weaker margins in our Texas pipelines. This is a result of a number of factors, but a lot of it is -- we obviously are buying and selling our transporting. In some cases for a percentage of the natural gas price and as that percentage has gone down, on some of our contractual arrangements, we've experienced weaker margins.</p>
          <p>Now, those negatives, which we have confronted pretty much all year have been more than offset by number of positives and let me kind of take you through those.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter as we have all year, we continue to experience good performance in our Products Pipeline group. Specifically that we are up on the Pacific side and our Pacific operations and our West Coast Terminals, where we've been able to roll some contracts for tankage at higher numbers and also on our Transmix operations where we've had a good quarter and year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Second positive for us has been better volumes in our Canadian operations. For example, in the third quarter, the volumes on Trans Mountain, that's our big pipeline that comes across from Edmonton to the lower mainland in Vancouver and then drops on behind into Washington state. On that pipeline, our volumes in the third quarter were up 24% compared to the third quarter a year ago.</p>
          <p>We've also had a positive in terms of higher oil volumes and our SACROC unit. We're well above year-ago at SACROC. We are slightly below the second quarter of 2009, because in the third quarter, we have modestly slowed our CO2 injection rate as we've tried to operate our facilities as comfortably and as efficiently as we possibly can.</p>
          <p>We've had another positive across-the-board from cost savings. That's impacted in a positive way, both O&amp;M, which obviously stays within the various segments and G&amp;A, which is a separate line item. And finally, we've also had lower interest cost than we anticipated in our plan as our floating rate debt has experienced lower rates. And then we have brought REX and MEP online during 2008, which is added to the bottom line of our Natural Gas Pipeline operations.</p>
          <p>Let me bring you up-to-date on our major projects particularly those major Natural Gas Pipelines we've been working on for the last few years. We have now finished and put in service Kinder Morgan Louisiana and Midcontinent Express. The last segment of REX that's a segment that runs from Lebanon, Ohio to Clarington, Ohio is now completely finished except for one directional drill under one river in Ohio. We expect to complete that within the next few weeks and then REX will be fully in service all the way to Clarington.</p>
          <p>That leaves us within the Natural Gas segment on an ongoing basis. As you may recall, we've already received FERC permission to expand REX through compression and to actually have a two-phase expansion of MEP Midcontinent Express, again through a compression. Both of those projects are ahead of schedule and within budget in accordance with the original budget that we set.</p>
          <p>The final major project in the Natural Gas group of course is the Fayetteville Express project, which is a 50-50 joint venture with Energy Transfer, which is scheduled for construction in 2010. We have now received just last week our environmental assessment from the FERC. That looks fine. We're ready to proceed as soon as we get the certificate. We will start construction in the early spring and that construction will take place through the rest of 2010.</p>
          <p>We have also gone a long way on finalizing our contracts on the four spreads that comprise the S&amp;P construction and so far those contracts look to be within our budget numbers for the project.</p>
          <p>Finally, we've announced or made a few acquisitions since the last time we talked to you, the biggest of which was our acquisition of the natural gas treating facilities of Crosstex, was approximately a $270 million acquisition. It's fee-based natural gas treating primarily removing CO2 from the gas streams. It's accretive to the bottom line of MEP -- KMP from the start and we expect it to have some nice growth potential, both as a stand-alone business and also as a way of increasing our connectivity with producers in our Texas Intrastate Pipeline group.</p>
          <p>So that's an overview of the quarter, which we consider to have been a good quarter above our plan. And with that, I'll turn it over to Park for the financial details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Rich. Hopefully everybody have a copy of the press release and I will be going through the number of pages, which should be at the back of the press release.</p>
          <p>The first financial page is the GAAP income statement. Towards the bottom, right above the bottom section, you'll see the declared distribution per unit, $1.05 for the quarter, consistent with our expectations, consistent with our budget, up 3% from a $1.02 for the third quarter of 2008. For the nine months, we will have distributed $3.15, that's up 6% from that $2.97 that we distributed in the first three quarters of 2008.</p>
          <p>One thing to note here, our total distribution will be just a little bit north of $300 million for the third quarter 2009. We also -- through those three quarters, we will have distributed $875 million to our Limited Partners. We're on track to distribute about $1.2 billion to our Limited Partners for 2009, and it's actually brought to our attention earlier this morning by one of our board members that there are very few companies in the United States, who distribute north of $1 billion to their holders in a year. And again, this is just a distribution, so the Limited Partners will be around 1.02 billion in 2009 or for 2009.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll go to the second page, we talked about how we're covering that distribution. And so really, I'll start at the bottom of the second page. The second line from the bottom is the DCF per unit and as Rich mentioned and as laid out in the press release, for the quarter, we generated $1.12 in distributable cash flow per unit. So we're more than covering the $1.05 distribution, and if you recall back when we announced the second quarter results, we expected at that time that we may not cover the distribution in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We have more than covered it actually at $19 million of excess coverage, that puts us at a deficit of about $0.2 million for the year, because we didn't cover in the first quarter or the second quarter. But as we look forward for the full year, we're very close to fully covering the $4.20 distribution. We still have two-and-a-half months to go. We hope that that we get there to fully cover that distribution. If we don't fully cover, we're going to miss by a very small amount. Our total distributions will be about $2.1 billion. And if we don't fully cover that total distribution, it's going to be by a very, very small amount relative to the total amount that we distributed.</p>
          <p>Moving above that, we're actually looking at it for the full year, the nine months, you'll see $3.07 compared to $3.35 a year ago. You may recall that the first half to first three quarters of 2008 were stronger than kind of the second half of last quarter of 2008, largely driven by the economy. It started to really weaken in the second half of the year and crude prices, which came down significantly in the second half of the year. So again, we had a very strong first three months or first three quarters 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, when we look at that for the full year, we expect it will be at or above that number for 2008. Moving above, you'll see the net income numbers, really we think the DCF per units in much more relevant measure. The total distributable cash flow for the quarter, $320 million, up about $38 million from where we were last year, right about flat for the nine months, 854 million compared 856 million. Above that, sustaining capital expenditures, about $41 million for the quarter. We're about $43 million a year ago. For the first three quarters about $112 million, was about $120 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>We expect that for the full-year, our sustaining capital expenditures will be about $176 million that is down from our budget of about $202 million. And the reason that's down, there are some projects that we just didn't have to do. There are cost savings that we've realized on the capital expenditure side, and then there are some projects that have been deferred to later years. But our current estimate again is $176 million. Our total for 2008 was $180.6 million, so we're pretty close. We expect, we'll come in pretty close to where we were in 2008.</p>
          <p>Above that, again the line called Express contribution, really all that's doing is backing out the earnings and adding in the distributions from Express of putting Express on a true cash basis. Similarly right above that, you have the book cash tax difference. Here we're backing out book taxes and adding in cash taxes. Now, of course cash taxes are negative. But when you add back the book, if cash taxes are less than book and it shows up as a positive here, that's what's going on for the quarter, <mark type="indiscernible" /> $17 million. For the first nine months at the positive $31 million, that is above our budget, and so we think we'll get a little bit positive. And really what this means, it will pay a little bit less in cash taxes in 2009.</p>
          <p>Above that you have DD&amp;A is up $50 million over $50 million for the quarter. It's up almost $150 million year-to-date. That actually is expected and actually is a little bit below our budget. A lot of the increase comes from CO2 and you can see that up above. It also comes from the projects that we're bringing online at a little bit smaller amount.</p>
          <p>The reason that the DD&amp;A is less than our budget is because of the CO2 production and increased reserve that we're seeing at CO2 as a function of oil prices, those reduce the DD&amp;A rate. Now, again we'll think that's totally relevant, we think it's much more meaningful just to look at our cash numbers. And then above that, again we get back to our income numbers.</p>
          <p>With that, let me jump up to the top of this page and we can talk about the segments and Rich touched on a number of these things. Starting with the product segment, you'll see we're about $26 million above last year for the quarter, we're about $52 million above last year year-to-date. Our products will finish the year above 2008. It is a budget year-to-date, we actually expect it to end just slightly above its budget for the year. Pacific, which is the biggest component of the segment is above 2008 largely due to higher tariffs. It is a little bit below its budget and we probably end the year a little bit below its budget due to lower volumes, lower gasoline, diesel and jet fuel volumes from what we had in the budget.</p>
          <p>Transmix and West Coast Terminals are nicely above 2008 and nicely above their budget. We expect them to end that way as well for the full year. Cochin is below its budget and below 2000 -- or actually just below its budget. Now, that actually was most extreme in the first quarter and you'll recall that we talked about that at that time. It has come back in the second and third quarters, although we still think that it will end the year below its full-year budget.</p>
          <p>On the Natural Gas Pipeline side, up about $18 million for the quarter, up almost $14 million year-to-date, but below its budget and we expect will end the year below its budget. Now, it's being heard by the items that Rich mentioned, the Texas Intrastates are seeing lower margins. And then we are seeing a combination of lower margins on the new pipelines for capacity that was sold or hasn't been sold previously and the delay in bringing those projects online. And so this is primarily Rockies Express and Midcontinent Express, so as we compare that to our budget, those are coming on a little bit later and so the earnings that we're getting from them for 2009 a little bit lower than our budget.</p>
          <p>Now, in contrast to that on KMIGT and actually Louisiana Pipeline were nicely ahead of where we thought we'd be in 2009. And so we're getting a little bit of a pickup out there.</p>
          <p>On the CO2 segment, you will see slightly below year ago, about $5 million below year ago and that's been the phase of a decline in crude prices of about $50 a barrel. So actually that's pretty good performance for the third quarter. We're also below 2008 for the year-to-date. We actually believe that CO2 will end up slightly above 2008 for the full year. Now, we have an easier comparison when it comes to the fourth quarter, which is again crude prices had dropped by the time we got to the fourth quarter 2008. And of course they are up some right now relative to where they were in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>We do expect CO2 to fall slightly short of this budget. But really overcoming tremendous head winds in this segment, the impact of price has been significant, and again it's been significant not just compared to last year, but also compared to our budget. CO2 has almost completely overcome that relative to budget based upon the SACROC volumes and based upon that we realized in that segment.</p>
          <p>On the Terminals side, nicely above <mark type="indiscernible" /> about $12 million up for the quarter, that's $23 million for the year, but it is under its budget and all of the shortfall of the budget and actually even more than the shortfall is caused by the reduction in steel volumes that Rich just took you through some of the details on.</p>
          <p>Now, we do had a little bit of weakness in coal and a little bit of weakness in fertilizer relative to our budget. We had some strength on the liquid side as a function of projects coming on earlier than we expected and also the function of renewing some contracts at slightly better terms and so that's offsetting the impact of steel a little bit. But we do expect Terminals to end up short of their budget for the year.</p>
          <p>Kinder Morgan Canada, you'll see above last year by about $8 million for the quarter, about $22 million year-to-date. Again, there are a couple of items that we talked about all year that we feel really need to be adjusted for here foreign exchange and actually its now a positive. Earlier in the year it was a negative on the segment. It has now turned to a positive.</p>
          <p>And the other is book taxes that we talked about back in the first quarter due to an accounting change. We had reflective book taxes on a different basis, get in our Canadian assets. Then we had assumed in our budget and so that's been a negative to budgets all year, but if you back those impacts out, again a positive from foreign exchange and negative from book taxes.</p>
          <p>Now year-to-date, Canada is actually above its budget by about $3.6 million and we expect it to end up above its budget or right at its budget. It is seeing growth this year due to Express in there for the full year, we acquired that asset from KMI in the third quarter of 2008 and the completion of the Anchor Loop project, which happened in 2008.</p>
          <p>That takes you to total segment earnings before DD&amp;A about 752 million for the quarter, up from 693 million a year ago, almost 2.15 million for the nine months, up from a little less than $2.1 billion in 2008, the first three quarters. And we're on track to generate segment earnings before DD&amp;A in excess of $2.9 billion, now probably a little bit less than our budget, which was a little over $3 billion, but still a nice growth from 2008 in what's clearly a very difficult environment. So nice growth from 2008 and very close to our annual budget.</p>
          <p>With that, <mark type="indiscernible" /> probably down to G&amp;A below the segment earnings contributions. You'll see about 85 million for the quarter, an increased incremental expense of about $8 million for the quarter and up about $15 million year-to-date. But actually below our budget, both for the quarter and for the year and we expect the G&amp;A will be below our budget for the full year largely as a result of the cost savings actions that we took in the first quarter of this year. So we're seeing the results there. And as Rich mentioned and I touched on, we also see it in the segment.</p>
          <p>Interest expenses below that, you'll see it's about -- almost $8 million higher for the quarter, it's about $16 million higher year-to-date. Now that was expected as well and is coming in below our budget, but $14 million favorable to our budget for the quarter. And we expect it will be about $30 million favorable to our budget for the year and that's a function of lower floating rate. Now, the reason is about last year, because the balance outstanding is greater and we'll talk about that in more detail when we get to the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Below that is certain items. For the most part, we have touched on these, just looking at the items that show-up for the quarter, the allocated non-cash long-term compensation, this is the compensation that happens at KMI, that KMP will never pay for, doesn't have to pay any money for, doesn't have to pay any equity for, has no responsibility for, but for accounting purposes, it has to reflect an expense on its books and so we reflect it here.</p>
          <p>The mark-to-market at certain extreme hedges, again, that's future hedges that we're marking the market here. The true impact of those hedges show-up in the segment when the visible transaction occurs. That's actually analogous to a new line, which is right below that, which is called CO2 hedges. This is an ineffectiveness on our CO2 hedges that represent a difference between financial settlement and the actual physical sale of our crude oil, you can see it from negative $5.4 million. Again, the key point here is, the impact of this ineffectiveness always has shown up in our segment and will continue to show up in our segment. So the true economic impact historically has shown up in the CO2 segment and we'll will continue to show up in the CO2 segment going forward.</p>
          <p>For accounting purposes, what we have to do here is reflect an estimated future value of that impact and that's why it shows up here, so again this is a future value projected for future transactions. When those transactions actually occur, this difference between the physical sale and the financial transaction shows up in the segment just like it always had, so really no change, this is just an accounting item that we need to reflect down here.</p>
          <p>Right below that, you'll see actually a $15 million positive on the hurricanes and buyers item. This is consistent to what we've been saying all along. When we have these events that are ensure of both, we frequently have to write-off the book value of the assets that have been damaged. And then we go about repairing them and we collect from insurance. And for accounting purposes, when those insurance proceeds come in and they shop us again. Well, just when we show the write-off of the assets as the certain item down below when that occurred and you can see some of that in 2008. When the gain occurs, when we collect it from insurance, we will show the gain down here in certain items and that's what's going on at this quarter.</p>
          <p>So that really is a majority of the significant certain items and really less of the income statement. There is one other thing I'll point out back on the face of the income statement. We frequently say that revenues are not overly meaningful for us. I think this is a good quarter to look at that and help understand why they are not overly meaningful. So if you turn back to the first page, you look at our revenues, they were down 150% both for the quarter and for the year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Now you could look at operating income, but that has certain items and then I think a more relevant thing is to compare on the second page where we have total segment earnings before DD&amp;A, so our revenues cut in half. So you'd think what's the impact on margins, well, margin is up. Segment earnings before DD&amp;A $752 million for the quarter up almost $60 million for the quarter, about 2.15 billion year-to-date, up about $60 million year-to-date. So again all this is doing is representing the fact that revenues for the most part of pass through, the revenue line is driven a lot by the Texas Intrastate segment, where we do buy some gas, but we back-to-back it with sales transactions of that gas.</p>
          <p>And so while we were flat, the impact of the price of the gas in our revenue line, we are selling an essentially the same basis and so that flows through our cost as well. And so again, changes in revenue don't have a lot of significance and don't have much impact on our ultimate earnings. So again, I'm just pointing that up because this is a good quarter to look at that and understand why we don't think the changes in revenue are overly relevant to our overall performance.</p>
          <p>The third page is the volume page, I had touched on some of this and Rich had touched on some of it. I'll actually go past that and just take a look at the balance sheet. The cash and cash equivalents are up about $100 million, a part of this is cash that's working in Canada and part of this is the timing on our credit facility borrowing. But we'll net that against debt when we talk about our total debt.</p>
          <p>Other current assets, you will see is down almost $320 million from the beginning of the year, that's all accounts receivable. PP&amp;E is up about $630 million from the beginning of the year, that's our CapEx offset by depreciation. Investments is changed about $1.6 billion from the beginning of the year, that's our contributions to our joint venture pipelines, primarily Rockies Express and Midcontinent Express. And then deferred charges and other assets is down about $350 million, that is the mark-to-market of the hedges that take place on the balance sheet. Total assets is about 19.6 billion, up from a little less than $18 billion at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt, I'll talk about that when I talk about the total debt. Other current liabilities like the other current assets is down, it's down about $475 million. The biggest piece of that is accounts payable. There are also some other approvals that are moving in and out next to a little bit additional reduction.</p>
          <p>Long-term debt, I'll discuss that in just a minute. The value of the interest rate swaps, largely just moving with the forward curve, forward interest rate. Although there are some amounts in there that relate to swaps that we have unwound, we did that in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of this year. And those are fixed amounts that are amortized over the remaining life of that outstanding debt.</p>
          <p>Other is up almost $200 million, that's the mark-to-market of the hedges, similarly accumulated other comprehensive loss that changes the mark-to-market of the hedges. And then you see other partner's capital is up almost $500 million, that's a function of equity issuance offset by distributions and excessive earnings. And I'll talk to more about the equity issuance in just a minute.</p>
          <p>So that take us down to total debt about $10.2 billion, up from about $8.5 billion at the beginning of the year. That's an increase of about 1.7 billion, I'll talk more about that increase in just a minute. If you compare that to our EBITDA, you'll see EBITDA is up slightly for the nine months and this is really -- this is a rolling 12-month list, so it's up at the end of September relative to where it was at the end of 2008. But our ratio of debt-to-EBITDA has gone up. Its now at about 3.9 times compared to 3.4 times at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now that amount is overstated a little bit, primarily because as projects come online, the full amount of their debt is represented here, but we don't yet have a full 12 months of EBITDA. And so that amount will naturally come down as we get a full 12 months of these projects on stream. Additionally, it's impacted by lower oil prices started in the fourth quarter of 2008. And so that's impacted us and clearly prices, right now are higher than where they have been over that rolling in 12-month period. And then if you look out the forward curve, they appear like they will stay at that level although. And then of course, the reduction in steel volume has hurt that EBITDA number as well.</p>
          <p>With that, let's talk about the change in debt. I'll talk about the $1.7 billion for the year-to-date. The change in the quarter has been about $937 million, so increase in debt from the end of June to the end of September. In those periods, on expansion capital, we've spend about $225 million in the quarter, almost $850 million year-to-date. The contributions to joint ventures, again this is largely REX and MEP, over $800 million in the quarter and over $1.6 billion year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Acquisitions about $9 million in the quarter, about $28 million year-to-date, now, that represents the Portland Airport pipeline that we acquired in the third quarter and then the Megafleet acquisition earlier. What is not represented there is the treating acquisition, but that actually closed on October 1, so closed in the fourth quarter, not in the third quarter and also the GMX transaction, which is not yet closed.</p>
          <p>So those are the investments on the raising capital side other than debt. We've actually issued equity of almost $150 million in the quarter and over $815 million year-to-date. Now in truth, the total growth amount of equity that we've issued and this is in the press release, if $858 million, just to reconcile these two numbers for you. The number that I mentioned here is a cash number that is net of underwriters discounts and it only represents what we had already received by the end of September. There is a little bit of that $858 million that actually came in in cash in October and that doesn't show up my numbers here, as I'm talking as of the end of the September.</p>
          <p>The KMR distributions have been a source of cash of about $86 million for the quarter, over $250 million year-to-date. We did generate about $144 million from the swap unwind in the first quarter. We also generated over $100 million from a transaction with the customer in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We had CapEx accruals of unless $75 million in the first quarter, which is largely a cash related capital expenditures from 2008 that has not yet been paid out by the end of 2008. At then there is a large use of cash for working capital and other items, both for the quarter and year-to-date. And there are few additional items in here that I'll talk about.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, it's about $120 million use of cash and for year-to-date, it's north of $400 million use of cash. If you look at back AR and AP are a use of cash of about $15 million in the quarter and about $119 million year-to-date.</p>
          <p>And there are few things that work here. One and probably the largest, it's just an increase in margin. Really, the right way to think about it is the month of September. You could think of it for the third quarter versus the month of December for the fourth quarter of 2008. And what happens here is they brought margin increases meaning, you know, what we expect to make gross, but we have a lag in collecting like every body does, you have -- you know, generally collect in the month following when the business patterns and you pay your bills in the month following when the business happens and you pay your bills in the month following when the business happens.</p>
          <p>That difference between what you'd expect to collect and what you have to pay out grows, well, then you're going ahead and increase use of cash for working capital. And as far as what happened here additionally, there are few other items that are more timing-related. Now, number of these things will reverse themselves in 2009, but not all them will. So we're not expecting all of this to wind itself out in 2009. We are expecting substantial portion of that to wind itself out over time.</p>
          <p>Now, of course there are the other things that happen is a dynamic business that may or may not offset that or may assisted. In addition to that, we've an increase in inventory in gas and storage of over $60 million and that's really year-to-date and that's kind of a typical seasonality. Other current assets and current liabilities are use of cash of about $80 million in the quarter and a $140 million year-to-date. Again that's largely timing driven in large part by timing on our interest payment, but also some timing on some other accruals.</p>
          <p>And then, the final largest thing and there are sorted other smaller things. Final largest thing is just the coverage of the distribution and if you look -- you know, top of that fact that we have about $19 million of excess coverage for the third quarter while that distribution doesn't get paid until November 13. And if you look at the distribution that have been paid in the first nine months of this year, then actually we had some negative coverage over that time period. Until recent distributions for the fourth quarter of 2008, and first and second quarters of 2009 and that's resulted in a use of cash about $100 million year-to-date about $17 million for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So, enough with the major items that add up to that use of cash for working capital and other items again trying back to our total change in debt.</p>
          <p>I got to give you little bit more detail on the expansion capital projects. For products we've spent about $40 million in the quarter well over $100 million year-to-date. We're expanding our cost and tank facility, adding capacity to handle ethanol in our Southeast terminals. Expansion of our Trailblazer Pipeline to that air force base and few other smaller projects. On the natural gas side, it's been about $64 million in the quarter little under $300 million year-to-date little under $300 million year-to-date, by far the biggest piece of that is the Kinder Morgan Louisiana pipeline, which is now service. We also have a couple of smaller storage expansions going on.</p>
          <p>On the CO2 side, we've spent about $51 million for the quarter, $238 million year-to-date, most of that is going to SACROC as it's typical, a little bit of expansion CapEx at Yates. But this number is below our budget as a function of the cost savings that we've realized. We've seen those benefits not only in OpEx and G&amp;A, but also in expansion CapEx especially here on the CO2 side and truthfully, I mentioned that we've also seen it on the sustaining CapEx side those cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Terminals has been about $62 million for the quarter, little under $200 million year-to-date. Ongoing expansions of Vancouver Wharves, Pasadena and Galena Park, which is really where the tanks that have come on early has been expanded on capacity at our core terminal and our peer nine terminal and in a variety of other smaller expansions.</p>
          <p>And then I mentioned a large contribution to the joint ventures, north of $800 million for the quarter, north of $1.6 billion year-to-date. The Rockies Express contribution was over $640 million in the quarter, but little under $1.1 billion year-to-date. And then the MEP contribution was about $132 million for the quarter, over $460 million year-to-date. So again, those are the biggest items, we've also made a little bit smaller contributions to pay the spreads in the quarter and year-to-date. And that is it for the KMP financials. I'll hand it back to Rich.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Stephen Maresca from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, Sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks. Just had three quick topics, I wanted to ask a quick question on. First, Rich, you talked about the Texas Intrastates and certainly difficult market conditions in terms of lower margins. I guess two things on that. One, can you just talk about again, how much you exposed in that area in terms of sensitivity fee base whereas exposure to buy and sell prices? And then two, as we have seen natural gas prices come up, are you seeing an improvement in that business since the third quarter ended?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve? Steve Kean will handle that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think unlike some of the -- unlike our Intrastate assets, there is a little bit more exposure from the Intrastate, but we kind of think of it as being 70 to 75% or so that's about locked in under some kind of term contractual arrangement. So that's pretty much secured in terms of the cash flow as we commence through the year and it's that last 25 or 30% that ends up being subject to be variables. And so as we look out over the course of the year, I mean we are not certainly getting back anywhere near all of that, but that's the place where there is <mark type="indiscernible" />. Now as the prices have come back up, yeah the part -- which as a part that Rich was referring to where we have some of our purchases that are a combination of a basis such as well as a percentage of the Houston Ship Channel, which kind of covers our fuel, that actually be sort of over cover our fuel, as prices come back, part of our business comes back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. To the second part, just in terms of your oil hedging, is there any update to 2010 for your oil hedging? And I guess, as earnings start to again as commodity prices arising, hedging a little bit more in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Park?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we did add a little bit to our 2010 hedges. During the quarter, it was an significant amount. Again, we're recently comparable with where we are right now and 2010, we are approaching -- we're more than 70% hedged in 2010. I think we will continue to evaluate prices have clearly improved and will probably layer some more on as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And last question, Rich, maybe this is for you. In terms of as you see a lot of these projects come on line and cash flow have been increasing where are you comfortable now in terms of distribution coverage when you start to think about raising the dividend again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean on an ongoing basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on ongoing run rate for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, it's been our tendency. We have very predictable long-term assets and so we don't think that we need to have tremendous amount of coverage in excess of our distribution. That's said, we'd like to have a little bit of coverage and I expect that's where we will continue to be. We haven't even started, we're just starting our budget process now, but we will lay that out when we release our estimate for 2010, that we would expect to fully cover 2010. Obviously, whatever that is, plus a little bit and in 2009 as Park and I both said, we're very close to fully covering right now and very optimistic we will fully cover. We might miss by a little bit, but I think we will fully cover and maybe have a little bit to spare on top of that. We just have you to see how these last two-and-a-half months turnout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks a lot for the time.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Ross Bayen <mark type="ph" /> from Wells Fargo. Your line is open, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ross. How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you doing, guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is related to rigs and Midcontinent Express. You mentioned that there were some additional capacity there that was probably done at Spartan <mark type="ph" /> and it didn't achieve the profitability you might have been looking for. How much capacity is available on those two systems and also, where are they running just generally speaking from a capacity utilization standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me kind of give an overview, Steve can jump in here. And you may have kind of misconstrued what said on that. What we have is, virtually all one quinery <mark type="ph" /> 13 cubic feet today on rigs is fully subscribed. There is just a small sliver that's not, that will be available on an ongoing basis. We have found as rigs has come online that we have a little bit of additional capacity on top of the 1.8 that vary seasonably and it varies with exactly where volumes are going. But we do have that available to sell, that's an upside and as basis differentials have gone down what we expected to get or that excess is not as great as we thought it would be and. And there also as you ramp up the line, there are also some other arguments, where we have the ability to sell for a few months some excess capacity and the basis differences simply wasn't what we expected. Therefore the spread wasn't.</p>
          <p>MEP is fully subscribed on our long-term basis, but again as we were starting up the second phase, we have the ability to sell some of the capacity before our customers were obligated to fully take that. Again, we expected to sell that where the margins where, the spread was. When we were building the things, the spreads across the country of course have gone down and so, we won't able to realize as much as we expected. So these are more or less with exception of this a bit of the additional capacity on rigs and it's very small. And so apart of the 1.8 Bcf per day everything else is really arguments around the store at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just on the other question on utilization on rigs. We have been in very sound or we have been <mark type="indiscernible" /> 1.7 and 1.8 Bcf on throughput levels and MEP has been like a little over Bcf with the Bcf to Zone <mark type="indiscernible" />. I guess, just to reiterate what Chris was saying, a lot of what we were talking about is, have to beat the sale this year that has -- that was subject to those business impacts that firms up and terms up when the projects go into that effect. So it goes in under the long-term contracts that we signed up originally, which is a good thing, of course in terms of getting the contract value as suppose to our current base with that path.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And that's very helpful. Thank you. Also obviously REX and Midcontinent are going to be included in your Natural Gas segment. Are those generally speaking -- performing as you expected, absent the sort of some of the delays, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. They are, fairly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my final question is, I guess the EBITDA at the end of your financial statement is inclusive of your program of share of the JVs. If you can give us kind of the current debt numbers at that quarter end at MEP and Rockies Express?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know. David, do you have that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, at a debt average, we've got 1.3 billion of permanent debt authority on REX, and then we had 1.9 billion roughly outstanding under the revolver at REX. At MEP, we have $800 million of permanent debt that's on that long term. And then we had roughly about 400 million outstanding under the revolver on MEP that basically will -- that revolver balance will go down to basically zero within the next few weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I mean, the right way to think about it is, it's a long-term debt, I have -- REX is going to be $3 billion in the long-term debt and MEP is going to be $800 million. And we're still in construction at Rockies Express. But once we complete that we expect we'll term out that debt and again it will $3 billion. And in MEP, the final equity contribution happens this month and once that does then it will be at the $800 million. So I don't think that interim levels really have that what you mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's very helpful. It just kind of helps us figure where it is at the end there. And a one final question, it looks like plantation performed better than the rest of the system. Is there anything intrinsic going on there that we are to be thinking about? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a volume standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a lot of moving parts and again, that's why we kind of cautioned not to pay too much attention to plantation compared to some of the others at pipelines because it is in the comparative situation and sometimes lines are full. This quarter, we experienced some additional jet fuel movement over to the Dulles Airport in Washington, DC which kind of made the jet fuel numbers look better than they probably are for -- on a long-term basis. And as I said, that's one reason why I was careful to say that we really haven't seen any meaningful up tick in jet across the whole system. So, I guess, that was more a one-time event. So I would read a lot into that, plantation continues to chug along and move the share of the volumes, but again, it is sub use to more outside events than the other systems are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's 2008 results probably effected by the hurricane --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's another good point. Yeah, it's -- we had -- plantation was the one system that was affected by the hurricanes in the third quarter of 2008. Good point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great point. And one final question. Any update on the final switch on date for Rockies Express. That's it from me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Steve, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have public posting out there, as Rich mentioned and as the posting explains we've got the one directional drill to compete and we have, post of that were above of notice during the month of November, and when that notice, given that will be in the direction of drill is complete, that will be another five and six days, about seven days following that actually tie in for rich packet and activate the line. And so when we, you know, communicating to the market through our hosting process on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> going forward as we get closer to the uncertain day.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, where we are on that is that, again this is a project about 185 to $190 million total cost that involves building or extending our CO2 pipeline in the Permian basin further East and North to serve among other potential users of CO2 there. Our own Katz project where we would again do a SACROC or Yates type of flood and we are so far on target to do that, cost seemed to be very preliminary at this point. Cost seemed to be along the lines of what we expected in that number I was sharing with you. We've ordered some of the pipe. We've bought a good bit of the right away. We've already contracted for some of the rig work to be done on the injection wells at the Katz unit, everything seems to be going alone and again as we sell alone, we will not have a production out of cads until 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's see. Yeah, actually for on a <mark type="indiscernible" /> basis its down a little bit from the prior year -- and I'm sorry, the question on but on year-to-date. Sequentially --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we have that I mean, as Steve mentioned, compare to -- third quarter compared to last year down slightly and that's true both for the quarter and year-to-date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought that you have the information quarter-over-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally, can you just talk a little bit more about trading facilities that you acquired from Crosstex, a little bit more about, what sort of opportunities you see connecting it to your Texas intrastate group and what the facilities running out right now and how are you plan to increase volumes on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we bought was approximately 290 trading units primarily in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. And what these trading units do the most part is, drip Co2 out of the line. So that how the natural gas streams. So that the natural gas will need pipelines expect where it can go into the long line pipelines like we and others operate. Obviously that has to be done, the produces have a choice, they could order and build these things and sell. But what we try to do any way that we both tries to do, is to provide one stop shopping. So if we have a producer who says, I got a Haynesville well coming on, its still kicking on 6% I need to get it down to 3% and as opposed to going out and worrying about building this myself.</p>
          <p>I'm not exactly sure how long the stream and my production will go on at what volumes and I can now call Kinder Morgan in the past cross checks and just order up a facility, which they will get out to meet generally within a couple of weeks just strip that out because we have inventory of two big yards one in Odessa, one in Victoria, Texas where we store inventory that we can move out to these sites on demand. So that's the service we provide, we get paid a fee for doing that and we think that there is good opportunity to grow that business in a couple of respects. First of all, we think there is a need for service. We think that, the fact that we have thousands of miles of Natural Gas pipeline in these various areas will allow us to have more contact with producers.</p>
          <p>That should benefit both the business we bought, it should allow us to put in there a more of these triggers, number one. But it should also and kind of a cross privilization way, help our intrastate pipeline in Texas connect that more reserves, because as people say, I need a trigger here, where was that gas going once it's treated. GE, if we can work with you to move it into one of our systems, we'd be happy to do that. So in a sense, it's kind of an up stream expansion. So we looked at it and we didn't factor in any kind of value to the Texas intrastate, we think we will get that. But just on a stand alone basis, we think it's a nice accretive acquisition premise. And then we think again that we will have dreaded more <mark type="ph" /> synergies with our Texas intrastate operations that will be a positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And for competitive purposes, I don't know if you can disclose but at the fees, market-based or they're set up just in price and what are the fees relative to I guess what Crosstex is charging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Yeah, I'm not going to comment on individual fees. Obviously there are other -- they're not regulated fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They maybe market based and lots of them are contract that we've abandoned, so they haven't necessarily changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Emily, let me add one other thing to your prior question about the quarter-over-quarter change. Because of the seasonality, that impact most of our assets. We tend not to look at changes sequential quarter to sequential quarter, but this is not overly meaningful. But that's actually why we don't have the information in front of us, because we just don't analyze at that way.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Fine.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, Park, <mark type="indiscernible" /> -- I missed the numbers on the G&amp;A expense, I think you indicated that you're -- we're so much below budget this quarter and year-to-date. Could you repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's right around $10 million, actually a little lower $10 million that we are below year-to-date and that's about where we expect to end the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then where are you on your in terms of project backlog at this point? And then how much is left to spend on REX, I guess, MEP is or I guess you got the expansion -- compression expansion next year. But could you just give an update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me talk about the project backlog, then I'll let the Steve or Park talk -- sorry David talk specifically on expenditures. But on the project, what we have still going forward is we have those two expansions already permitted and already fully subscribed on MEP and REX. And again those will come online during 2010 and they are under our budget that we originally had for and on time for delivery. They are compression projects, we're not really dealing with directional drills here, we're dealing with compression. Then we have the Fayetteville Express that I talked about, again which will be built during 2010, come online late 2010, early 2011. And then we have a number of other projects, of course, as to Emily's question, of course, I mentioned the rather major expansion of our CO2 network is $187 million Katz project including the pipeline.</p>
          <p>We have a number of products pipeline project still going including some fairly good size tank expansions in our Carson California facility, a good size project for the military in Northern California, one of their air bases. And then we have a number of terminals projects that are coming online that are presently underway including a pretty good-sized expansion of our <mark type="indiscernible" /> facility for a specific customer. We'd mentioned that actually I think in the previous call. So we have a lot of backlog, we'll be able to kind of quantify all that, when we release our 2010 budget, we'll be able to tell you exactly what we expect to be spent on capital expenditures in 2010.</p>
          <p>Then in addition, not only have we made these acquisitions that we referred to, but we expect to have a couple of more medium-sized acquisitions that we will make in the next few months that will also if you want to look that as project backlog, that's also upside for potential growth. So I have referred to before as far as major and natural gas projects, the pigs going through the boa constrictor to a certain extent that's true and a lot of the pigs are now going through, but we do have some sizeable projects that's build to build. That said, the demand on capital next year is going to be very small, relatively small compared to the amount of funds that we've expanded on, particularly on these joint venture pipelines during 2009. Steve or Park <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just -- I mean, in round numbers. I mean, I know you're going to give the full detail of the budget layout in the -- at the Analyst Meeting. But just a round numbers about how much --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really I guess due to the budget, we haven't finalized all the Terminals projects. So you can see that -- the Fayetteville Express is $1.2 billion project, you know that Katz is a $200 million, little less $200 million, so and so forth. So we've got substantial <mark type="indiscernible" />. I'm sure there will be some that we're not even aware of today, opportunities you'll find. We think we're very opportunistic to make acquisitions or do construction projects that are accretive to the bottom line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Yves Siegel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Yves. How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm doing well. Thanks, good evening. Just a couple of quick ones. Rich, not surprising, I got confused when you were mentioning Kinder Morgan Louisiana being above budget. Can you just elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Park, do you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's actually above budget, mostly due to the recognition of AFDC <mark type="ph" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so that's what taken it above budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then sort of a last question, do you see any signs of the economy improving in terms of what you may be saw during the quarter of September over August or what you're seeing in October, especially as you were talking about the both Terminals and jet fuels and diesel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good question, Yves. We judge it on kinds of things I talked about in my remarks. We have seen a nice quarter-to-quarter improvement in steel volumes. Right now, we're looking at the fourth quarter. Our forecast is that those volumes will be relatively flat with the third quarter. So we will maintain the pickup that we had in the second quarter, but we're not expecting to see a lot of growth of that 5 million ton number that we had in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, it is instructive on the steel volumes that the 9.4 million turns in the third quarter a year ago was the peak. By the fourth quarter, I mean, firmly, but I think in the fourth quarter, it was six and change, 6 million and change. So if we are right and we're relatively flat this quarter at five or maybe a little better than five, we certainly won't have the percentage deterioration year-to-year that we had in the third quarter, but nevertheless we would expect to be below the fourth quarter of 2008. So we're seeing some pickup, I think steel volumes at least that we handle probably will hit the low mark some time in the May, June timeframe and we have seen some come back.</p>
          <p>But I would caution you that our customers on the steel side are saying, we are not -- we can only give you projections for six to eight weeks out, because we are simply filling orders as they come in. So that's kind of cautionary. Again, as we talked about, Yves, on the product side, you know, we're seeing continued weakness in jet fuel and diesel. We've got to assume and there is a lot of moving parts that we have to assume that the diesel is largely a function of lower construction activity, particularly in places like Las Vegas, Phoenix and Southern California.</p>
          <p>And jet, it is largely a function of simply fewer planes flying to these various destinations. So we have not seen an upturn there. We have seen gasoline volumes come back at least on a year-to-year comparison, they're modestly above where they were a year ago. And that trend seems to be about where we are heading into the fourth quarter. So those are probably the best indications that we have of a real viewpoint into that what I would call the Mainstreet economy. I don't know if that should help it all, but that's what we see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's great. Thanks. And just finally, any sense of the potential for moving <mark type="indiscernible" /> further east from Clarington at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's certainly -- what I could call actively in the works right now. You know, I think a lot of producers pick up a lot of capacity here and kind of adjusting it and watching and seeing how price would shape out and how Marcellus shape out. There is just I think a lot of factors that are in play for people right now. And so I would say again nothing actively in the works and nothing by any spreads imminent there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could the very last one, I apologize, but conceptually, could you guys just give a sense of all those type has been built and so we've seen basis flatten out across the country? What's your viewpoint if you have one on -- what we may or not see as it relate to basis, may be showing up again at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly you heard us say before that we do not subscribe to the bottom line of the movie build it may will come few other dreams. Because when you build a pipeline, the basis differential will generally collapse and if you haven't signed up throughput in advance, you're in a lot of trouble. And so that's why we didn't start in this projects until we had them all virtually fully subscribed.</p>
          <p>That said, I think you're going to see a lot of bottlenecks still out there, so you're going to see -- {***Part 25***}</p>
          <p>{***part 26***}  -- differential in my view move around based on where those bottlenecks are at a given time. So for example, as the bottlenecks move further east, the spread between Rockies and Midcontinent collapsed. When REX and others got further east and that basis collapsed, so basis differential collapsed. So I think that's what you're going to see, but I think it's going to take some time for all of this to sort of shakeout. As Steve said, people taking on additional capacity, they're going to put that to use. Economic animals, you have marketers, you have LDCs in the mix. And I think you are just going to -- we're going to have to wait and see what it shakes out and what the supply really is coming out of some of these new shale plays, certainly the Marcellus and how that develops is key to the whole thing. So that's kind of already answered, but I think that it's just too early to tell. I think you will see basis differentials because you will have bottlenecks, you will have oversupply in one region and under supply from another region. Steve, anything left?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a follow-up. Just earlier in the year, you talked about concessions from oil service suppliers at industrial divisions and have you seen any clawback there or have those concessions been pretty that you have been able to get them to <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've not seen any retreat yet with respect to costs increasing as a result of the recent up tick in oil prices. Year-over-year, if you look at our operating costs, they are down about 35% through the first half of 37% through the third quarter. The concessions we're getting from our vendors to produce their cost have kind of slowed down. We're getting more of our work and we are continuing to see cost reductions arising out of that activity. Now, our hungry vendors out there that are very competitive and we're still capitalizing on that, but we've not yet seen cost start to pick up. We wouldn't be surprised to see that if the oil continues to remain 70, $80 a barrel, we will not see some upward pressure revolving during the fourth quarter. But at this point in time, we have not seeing that.</p>
