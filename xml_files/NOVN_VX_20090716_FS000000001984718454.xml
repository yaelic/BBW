          <p>Thank you very much, John. Together with me this afternoon we have Raymund Breu, our CFO. And we have the CEOs of our businesses, Joe Jimenez for Pharma; Andrin Oswald for Vaccines and Diagnostics; Jeff George for Sandoz; George Gunn for Consumer Health; and David Epstein, for Novartis Oncology. And as well, we have here Trevor Mundel, the Head of Global Development.</p>
          <p>So let me start with the presentation. I'm on Page Number Four, which is essentially summarizing the key messages for the first half of this year. Novartis showed a strong operational performance with net sales of $20.3 billion, which is plus 8% in local currencies. However, we did still see a strong currency effect, so in dollars this corresponds to minus 2%. Operating income is 4.7 billion, which is 11% up in constant currencies and excluding exceptional items, and minus 5% in dollars.  Also, very strong free cash flow before dividends, 33% as compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceuticals showed an outstanding performance with net sales growth of 12% in local currencies, mainly driven by recently launched products. We also showed a substantial progress in our R&amp;D business with approvals of Afinitor, Ilaris, Ixiaro and also Prevacid 24 Hours, among others. Novartis reaffirms, based on these good results, the expectations for a strong operational performance in 2009 and also for record earnings in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>On Page Five, you can see that we had a very solid performance in the second quarter, which contributed to the good results in the first half. Second quarter, we had net sales of 10.5 billion, also up plus 8% in local currencies, and an operating income of 2.4 billion, which is up 8% in constant currencies and even 13% in constant currencies and excluding exceptional items. Also very strong in the second quarter, the cash flow before dividends, up by 57%.</p>
          <p>When we look at the divisional performance on Slide Six, we see that Pharma had an outstanding performance, growing by 12% in sales and local currencies and 11% in Op Inc, mainly driven by good performance of launch products and also the good performance in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Vaccines and Diagnostics had a difficult quarter, mainly driven by significant one-time effects with regard to sales. So for example, we did not have any pandemic influenza sales in this quarter, which we did have last year. And also in terms of Op Inc, where we saw a depression of Op Inc by an exceptional charge for a legal issue.</p>
          <p>Sandoz showed dynamic growth in emerging markets, leading to a 4% increase in local currencies and also continuing focus towards U.S. turnaround.</p>
          <p>In Consumer Health, we saw good growth in CIBA Vision. We also saw overall good performance resulting in a 1% growth in local currencies and actually a 7% growth in constant currencies in Op Inc.</p>
          <p>On Page Eight, when we look at it from a geographical perspective, we see strong growth in all regions of the world with strongest growth in the top six emerging markets, with 20% growth for the company. But also we see good growth in the U.S. and in Europe with 7% each.</p>
          <p>On Page Nine, very significant contributions to this sustained growth momentum are coming from the more than 10 new product introductions in Pharma in the last two years. Now these new products contribute now more than three times as much as new product contributions in -- on average for our competitors. We believe that this is a very strong proof of our innovation power in the Pharma business and this makes us very confident also for the future.</p>
          <p>On Page 10, also in the future, we will continue to build on our innovative innovation capabilities, which we have been demonstrating with a number of important approvals that you can see on this chart in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>On Page 11, now looking forward, we believe that the strong growth prospects that we have through our rejuvenated portfolio will mitigate the so-called 2012 patent cliff. We show great growth with our recently launched products. We have a strong pipeline in all divisions, which is expected to continue to drive growth through the 2012 period based on assets like Afinitor, FTY, and QAB, our meningitis vaccines, also the field of biosimilars.</p>
          <p>Our productivity efforts deliver above target, enabling us to invest even more and even quicker and earlier in R&amp;D and also our high growth markets. We do expand our strong position in the high growth emerging markets. And last but not least, we do expect a limited impact and we do have a limited exposure to the U.S. healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to hand over to my colleague, Raymund Breu.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joerg. I'm now on Slide 13, and I concentrate my comments just on the Q2 numbers for ease of understanding. The second quarter was really impacted significantly by the currencies and then is characterized by a very strong growth in free cash flow before dividends of 57%. And I will explain later on, the factors that have contributed to it.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, the current impact on sales was 10% on operating income, 12% negative, excluding these, there was a strong underlying growth of 8% operationally, both in sales and in operating income.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see that our operating income margin as reported dropped 0.5 percentage point, but if you adjust for the exceptional items and for the amortization of goodwill and intangibles, then the margin was up 0.6 percentage points. The driving factors were really broad activity improvements in cost of goods sold, in marketing and selling, and in general and administrative. And these productivity improvements allowed us to invest more in research and development, and allowed us to invest in launches in particular in pharmaceuticals and in expanding aggressively in emerging growth markets.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you can see that if we correct for the major exceptional items and look at operating income, then you can see that the underlying growth in adjusted operating income in constant currencies was 13%. And this compares very well with the constant currency sales growth of 8%.</p>
          <p>The exceptional items are two in this quarter. One is less divestment gains, in particular in Pharmaceuticals. And the other one is that in the comparative quarter in 2008, we had a 104 million release of provisions in Pharmaceuticals. In Vaccines and Diagnostics, in this quarter, we had 45 million for a legal charge that has impacted the result in this division.</p>
          <p>On Slide 17, we show you the non-operating items. And it's visible that net income from continuing operations was down 10% in U.S. dollars compared to operating income being down only 4%. Net income was impacted by financing costs; financing the Alcon 25% stake. And then additional financial expense related to the bond issues that we have done in last year and in the first half of this year, which now amount to $8.5 billion. And obviously, the expense there will now show up in the financial result.</p>
          <p>The other item, which contributed to the net income development, was an increase in the tax charge. We have re-estimated our tax rate for the full year this year, and our estimate currently is that it will be 15.2%. As a result, we then have in the second quarter booked a catch up for the first quarter as well, from 14 to this 15.2%. And then the tax rate for the second quarter amounted to 16.3% compared to a 13% in the comparable quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Finally on Slide 18, I mentioned that the free cash flow before dividends from continuing operations went up 57%. This is mostly driven by the cash flow from operating activities, which is up 41%. And there are two explanations for this very good development. One is improved working capital management. And the other one is that we had lower tax payments and financial payments in this quarter compared to the quarter two in 2008.</p>
          <p>With this, I hand over to Joe Jimenez, the CEO of Pharmaceuticals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Raymund. Okay, I'm on Slide 20. Pharma performance continues to be strong. I think we're executing well against the new product launches, but our established products are also performing well. Our focus on cost reduction has ensured that we're delivering solid operating income performance, and our pipeline continues to deliver. I'll talk more about that in a minute.</p>
          <p>On Slide 21, you can see that net sales continued to grow at double-digit rates. So in the second quarter, we were up 11%. I'm also pleased with the operating income performance reported, 2%.  So that's more than offsetting the currency hit. And on an organic basis, that operating income growth is around 17%. So we're pleased with the organic operating performance.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 shows that we're outperforming our key competitors as shown by IMS. And this is the combination of the new launches, but also the fact that you've got established products like Glivec growing at 15% and Diovan growing at 6%. So a good base, a good solid base, and then the new products come on top.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 shows that, you know, this is broad-based. I think the most encouraging thing that we've seen in Pharma is that the strength is across all therapeutic areas. So in the second quarter, we grew all therapeutic areas at double-digit rates in local currency.</p>
          <p>Slide 24, we had good pipeline progress in the quarter. In June, the FDA approved Ilaris, which is our IL-1 antibody. It approved for a rare set of autoimmune diseases known as CAPS. This really is though just the beginning for Ilaris, which is proving to be a phenomenal IL-1 blocker. So we've seen positive Phase II data in systemic juvenile arthritis, and we're testing the compound in gout and type 2 diabetes. But I think it's a great example of Novartis' pathways approach to R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>On 25, you can see that Afinitor is off to a very strong start in the U.S. So in renal cell cancer, we've already delivered 1,500 prescriptions, and that's in less than three months. In Europe, we had a positive CHMP opinion in May and we expect a positive EMEA decision this summer. So as we've said before, we're very bullish on Afinitor and we've got a very large parallel development program that's listed here on the slide across a broad range of indications. So up to, if you add up the patient population, up to 500,000 patients could eventually benefit from Afinitor.</p>
          <p>I'm also becoming more encouraged with the data on Tekturna. So on Slide 26, if you step back, there's still a tremendous unmet medical need in hypertension. So even though the ACEI and ARB treatment is widespread, there's still high levels of negative cardiovascular events. We know that Plasma Renin Activity, PRA, as a biomarker, is highly correlated with negative outcomes. And we've conducted some retrospective analyses on some large outcome's trials, which confirm this. And we think it's a real point of difference for Tekturna, because Tekturna is the only mass agent that reduces PRA, in fact, ACEIs and ARBs increase it. So it gives us confidence that when we get to ASPIRE HIGHER outcomes data, that we will have positive results, and that could be an inflection point for Tekturna.</p>
          <p>On 27, you see that Galvus continues to grow nicely. So it generated about $40 million in the quarter. I think we've demonstrated our ability to compete against Januvia. I've listed a couple of markets here, fast uptake markets like Brazil and Greece. We're increasing our investment in some large markets in Europe. And we've also got some big key launches coming up with Galvus in Asia, China, Japan, Korea. So we expect Galvus to be over 500 million by 2012, and that's all outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Our cost savings are shown on 28. They're paying off. So we reduced costs over $250 million in the second quarter, coming primarily from procurement and from marketing and sales.</p>
          <p>On 29, you can see the buildup of our cost reduction. It's important not only because it improves margin, but also because it ensures that we can continue to invest in R&amp;D and emerging growth markets while showing good operating income progression.</p>
          <p>On Slide 30, we do expect U.S. healthcare reform to impact us beginning in 2010. We've said that we support the industry's position on helping fill the Medicare doughnut hole, and we strongly support the effort to increase coverage in the U.S. And we're going to have to pay for this through increased productivity, not only in the U.S., but also coming from other markets.</p>
          <p>Now on Slide 31, I think it's important that we restart the discussion of how we're going to offset lost sales due to the Diovan patent expiration. And I think our first half results are a strong indication of our strong foundation as we approach that time period. There's basically three primary growth drivers. The first is our current launches, okay. We've talked about that. They're 16% of our sales today, $2 billion year-to-date. So this year, they're going to be over 4 billion, and they're going to continue to ramp through that period.</p>
          <p>The second growth driver is the late-stage pipeline with QAB and FTY coming. And then the third is the acceleration of growth in our six key emerging markets. So I think the fundamentals are very strong, but the point here is that there's not one silver bullet. This is a complex issue, and we're approaching it in a multi-faceted way.</p>
          <p>But the second part of the story is shown on Slide 32, and that's really the shape of the Diovan patent's expiration. There's two things to note here. First, this is a three-year event. So this is not a cliff. It begins in late '11 and goes through '12, '13. But the second thing to note is that even when it's over, Diovan still will be over $2 billion in sales. Today, we have a substantial business in Latin America and in Asia, and we're already facing generic competition and we're continuing to grow Diovan. So we've proven that this is going to still exist as a product for Novartis.</p>
          <p>Slide 33, the most immediate impact that we're going to see is the Losartan generic event, but you have to really sit down and look at Diovan. Diovan has some clear advantages. Superior blood pressure reduction. So this is a superior anti-hypertensive. Secondly, we've got additional indications of heart failure and post-MI. But I think most importantly, we're managing our hypertension portfolio as that, a portfolio. This is not just about Novartis. We have multiple single pill combinations, which gives us some kind of defense against this event. So I'm not saying there won't be an impact. There will, but it's not going to be as severe as some may think.</p>
          <p>So based on our 2009 performance to-date, we are raising out guidance for the full year to at least high single-digit sales growth. And I think we're executing well and we're going to continue to execute well through the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe. So I'm on Page 36. So overall, we continue to deliver on our priorities for 2009 with dynamic expansion of the new Pharma products, that's for new launches, return of Sandoz and Consumer Health to growth in the U.S. with Sandoz return to growth in the second quarter. Consumer Health had a 3% growth in the first half in the U.S. We continue to expand strongly in the emerging markets and to improve our operational performance. Forward is a good example for that where we did exceed our cumulative savings target of 1.6 billion now, one and a half year ahead of schedule. And we continue to drive our additional projects in that area like COMPETE and Customers First.</p>
          <p>On Page 37, you see that Sandoz is showing a dynamic growth in most emerging markets in the first half with 14% growth in the top six emerging markets, and still a good performance also in Europe with 3% growth in a difficult environment.</p>
          <p>Overall on Page 38, Sandoz is on the right track with global sales now in the first quarter and in the second quarter of this year growing 4% in local currencies after a difficult 2008. And you also see in with regard to the U.S. sales on the bottom of that chart, that again, 2008 was a very difficult year.  But you see also here improvement in the first and second quarter. And we hope that, that trend will continue for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>On Page 39, you also see that Sandoz is doing a great job in Germany with significant market share gains over the last years actually. Sandoz Germany now achieved a market share of 29.1% in May, with Hexal clearly being the number one generic company in Germany. 1A Pharma is growing very, very nicely. And in the month of June, 1A did actually achieve the number three position among the generic companies in Germany, which again is a great achievement. This is almost -- this is all based on successful new product introductions, including Clopidogrel, Filgrastim and Pantoprazol.</p>
          <p>On Page 40, Sandoz is also continuing to build its biosimilar franchise with the approval or the first approval of a biosimilar in Japan with Omnitrope. And overall, the biosimilar sales are up 62% in the first half of 2009 in local currencies. Still, Novartis is the only company or Sandoz is the only company with biosimilars on the market in all three important regions: the U.S., Europe, and now Japan.</p>
          <p>On Page 41, Sandoz did also expand its technology capabilities with the acquisition of EBEWE Pharma, which is a specialty generic injectable business focused on anti-cancer medicines. Now, EBEWE, as part of Sandoz now, will be able to expand its global reach significantly, which will then also help to launch the strong portfolio that EBEWE has been building over the last few years in the coming years.</p>
          <p>On Page 42, of course, last but not at least, also the Wilson plant remediation is on track. Quite significant changes have happened at Wilson. So for example, there is a new site management team appointed with replacements of more than 20 senior managers at the site. We'll also refocus Wilson on the manufacturing core competence at that site, and we will shift the R&amp;D focus from Wilson to the Novartis campus in New Jersey.</p>
          <p>There is the FDA inspection anticipated now for this quarter. The remediation activities are all proceeding according to plan. And I believe it's important to remember that the Wilson facility continues to operate during all of this remediation work, with now more than 30 products being actively shipped from that site.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health on Page 43, solid growth in emerging markets with the U.S. showing improved performance. You see in the top six emerging markets, 4% growth in the first half. In the U.S., 3% growth in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>On Page 44, this growth is mainly driven by these 15 major brands that are listed on this page. All of them selling more than $100 million at least. And most of them gaining market share, which then leads to a market share situation of 3.5% in OTC, 21.6% in CIBA Vision, and 7.4% in Animal Health.</p>
          <p>In the attractive OTC market on Page 45, Prevacid 24 Hours will be an important new player. It is our aim to make Prevacid 24 Hour a top five OTC brand in the U.S. based on the strong label that the team has achieved for Prevacid 24 Hours, which is very similar to Prevacid Rx. Also, in addition, there is a three-year marketing exclusivity period that will last till May of 2012.</p>
          <p>Coming to V&amp;D on Page 46, V&amp;D is continuing to make progress with its R&amp;D pipeline. As you know, we got a complete response letter from Menveo, and we believe that we can answer all the questions before the end of the year. In Europe, the CHMP opinion from Menveo is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. Men B has completed their recruitment for the pivotal Phase III trial in Europe; its results are expected as planned next year. IXARO was approved in Europe and in the U.S., and the launch is going well. OPTAFLU got a license in Switzerland, and we do intend to submit a BLA before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Just as a reminder on Page 47, the Menveo situation, as you know, it has been filed in the 11 to 55 year old category in the U.S. and in Europe. The filing is planned in next year for the category between two and 10 years, and then next year also for the category between two months and two years in Europe and in 2011 in the U.S.</p>
          <p>On Page 48, obviously there is another investigational vaccine that is generating huge attention and interest at the moment, and that's the H1N1 vaccine. This chart actually summarizes the status as of today. In terms of demand, we do now have two contracts with HHS, both covering the antigen, the H1N1 antigen, but also our proprietary MF59 adjuvant. In addition to that, there are a number of agreements formed with other countries and there are ongoing discussions with quite a large range of governments.</p>
          <p>Now from a manufacturing and supply perspective, we can say that the production has started at all manufacturing sites in Europe with the cell culture based manufacturing being first in Germany. We do expect deliveries in 2009, but they will depend on the yields. And as you might have also heard from WHO, these yields are currently low. There is work ongoing to improve them, but it's very difficult to predict what it will be at the end. Also, regulatory timelines and timelines for clinical studies, et cetera will have an impact on deliveries and on doses actually. Nevertheless, we do expect to have first deliveries in late of 2009. Clinical trials are planned to start in July of 2009 and we hope for the earliest licensures potentially later this year somewhere in late autumn.</p>
          <p>This gets me to Page 49, Novartis Group outlook. Barring any unforeseen events, the Group net sales are still expected to grow at mid-single-digit rate in local currencies. We're of course very pleased with the Pharmaceuticals performance where we see net sales growing at a minimum at high single digit rates in local currencies and we stick to our projection of record operating and net income in constant currencies.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much, and with this, we open the Q&amp;A, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, if I could. Firstly, I think some surprise on your comments on the potential of Galvus, given the regulatory history there. So, for me, I think I would be very interested in just a little bit more detail as to why you think you can hit the $500 million. And whether that really is going to be focused on some of the less mainstream markets, or whether or not you're confident that you can take on Januvia in Europe?</p>
          <p>Also, a short update on generic Lovenox from the Sandoz perspective. I realize that's been a feature in the past. I wonder if you could give us an update of expected timelines there?</p>
          <p>And then, Joerg, you've made a number of comments about the lack of erosion of Diovan, the potential of the pipeline, and smaller products such as Galvus. I wonder if we can push you for a longer-term growth outlook for the Pharma division, or Joe, of course. And whether or not you think that Novartis can continue to grow through it's patent expiries. Or whether or not the message is, yes, there will clearly be some revenue and earnings loss, but that it will mitigated by some of these other products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthew, thank you very much for these questions. So I think we should start with Galvus, Joe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Matt, the six &#x2013; sorry, the $500 million forecast or at least 500 by 2012 is an ex-U.S. number. So if you look at where we currently have Galvus already approved, and you take out and you look at the ramp that we've currently seen in those markets, and you treat it as you would any analog. We feel very comfortable that we will be able to generate that level if the product continues to progress, and the reaction that we've seen by physicians continues. So we've been able to go head-to-head against Januvia, and in many markets, outsell Januvia. I think we probably under resourced it in Europe because we were not -- we were a little bit surprised by the reaction that we got by physicians and the uptake that we saw. So we are at this time really adding resources to the European markets where it already is being sold, and expect to see a nice trajectory. Again, that's 2012, so that's still a ways away.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I think it was important to start talking about the growth drivers.  The one thing about Diovan, and the reason why I wanted to show the fact that this is a three-year event, is that because we've got three pretty significant growth drivers to replace that lost revenue. The fact that it's a three-year event gives us more time for the growth drivers to kick in and to create a trajectory for total Pharma that may be better than what people are expecting. Now I don't want to forecast what our growth rates will be, but I'll tell you that we're spending a lot of time internally, a lot of time and attention thinking about '12, '13 and '14. And putting things in place right now to be able to replace that lost revenue.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on Enoxaparin, a couple updates. The most recent one is that the FDA inspected our Kundl, Austria site July 6 to 9 as part of their ongoing heparin supply quality control actions. And happy to report, we received no 483 and no significant issues identified to us. And that's coming on the back now of all four of our Chinese heparin suppliers, which have been inspected, again, with no significant issues identified to us.</p>
          <p>On the patent front, you'll recall probably, Matthew, back in April, late April, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case brought by Sanofi-Aventis. So that effectively ended the patent litigation. But the final decision pending from the FDF on our ENOX application is still outstanding. And that's against the backdrop of about 1,600, 1,700 ANDOs that are in backlog. So it's hard for me to speculate on timing, and there do remain two outstanding citizen's petitions. So we'll see how things evolve, but of course, we aspire to launch as soon as possible.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Amit Roy from Nomura, just a couple of simple questions.  You've upgraded the Pharmaceutical sales guidance to mid-to-high single digits, to high single-digit, pardon me, but the Group sales guidance remains unchanged. Can you give some indications of what your kind of fearing in the second half there?</p>
          <p>And secondly, for just Forward, you've now delivered 1.7 billion in 18 -- 18 months ahead of schedule. Any sort of, is that all we're going to see or any indication of how much more we may get on that?</p>
          <p>And lastly, the fixed-dose combination of Diovan and Tekturna, I believe, was filed in December 2008. Any update as to where that's now progressing? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question regarding the Group guidance for the second half, I can maybe add the following. This Group guidance does not include any contributions from pandemic sales in V&amp;D. Currently, the timing and the amount of these sales is still highly uncertain. So we don't know how much we can sell in the second half of this year and when exactly it would happen, that's why in the guidance, we have excluded these.</p>
          <p>Second element you have to take into account that for the Vaccines and Diagnostics and for the Sandoz division, we still feel that there are some uncertainties in the second half. In Sandoz, obviously, we have to see what will happen to our pending approvals for Lovenox and other products in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have to see when the remediation of Wilson will be accepted by the FDA, that is uncertain. In V&amp;D, the outlook for the non-pandemic product at the moment is a bit clouded for the second half of the year. And finally, I could add that the impact of the global recession on Consumer Health still has to be seen how that will develop in the second half.</p>
          <p>And given these elements in the non-Pharma divisions, we feel that it is at the moment the right guidance that we say that the Group will increase or is expected to increase sales in constant currencies at the mid single-digit rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Forward, I mean, we have always been saying that these principles that we apply in the Forward project in terms of how we deal with purchasing et cetera, that they will continue to exist at Novartis. So we will certainly, we do certainly expect to continue to see savings from the principles of the program. However, certainly for 2010, we see this to be basic business and we will obviously strive for finding even more money here. And I'm sure we will, but we may not continue to report this as Forward savings. So you will probably see the project Forward disappear from the radar screen at one point in time, but it doesn't mean that the savings will disappear.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Tim Anderson of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple of questions, first one is about your levels of investment needed in emerging markets. You and other companies have talked about how resources are essentially being transferred from slow growing established markets to the faster growing emerging markets, such that the overall cost savings for the organization may not be that great. My question is, at what point in the future will you have sufficiently built up your infrastructure in emerging markets to the point where the ramp up in spending begins to lessen or becomes at a steady state?</p>
          <p>Second question is on your meningitis B vaccine, hoping you can go into more detail on when Phase III might begin in the U.S. and what exactly the FDA wants to see before you move into Phase III?  And I'd also like your understanding of where the competition is in this area. I think Wyeth is supposed to make a Phase III go/no go decision for their own vaccine by the end of this year. And I'm trying to figure out if they might leapfrog ahead of you in the U.S.? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, on emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tim, regarding the investment in emerging markets, you know, it's a good question. As you look at our marketing and sales spending in the first half of this year, in the press release in the back, you can see that it was, a year ago, 30.4% of sales, and this year it's 29.6% of sales. So it's about an 80 basis point improvement in total spend, sorry, in total efficiency of the marketing spend. Now that includes a significant investment in emerging markets, the six that we talk about, the six key emerging markets. So my expectation is, your question about at what point will the ramp up be complete. We're going to continue to invest in those key emerging markets, but we're going to do it in a way that continues to improve the overall efficiency of the marketing spending. So we will improve in the developed markets, such as the U.S. and Europe, in a way that more than compensates for the emerging market buildup. I have to also say that we did this in the face of all of the new product launches. So we're still able to show marketing spend efficiency and EGM buildup. And as long as I can continue to drop my M&amp;S as a percent of sales, then I think that's a long-term play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can add for the other divisions: Sandoz, Consumer Health, and V&amp;D. Obviously, there is also a significant growth and we showed it already in the emerging markets. And we will continue to build infrastructure as well, but the same principles apply then for Pharma. We will certainly invest in sustainable, but also profitable infrastructure. But we see this to continue for quite a number of years because we see also the potential on those markets to be very, very significant. Okay, on Men B, Andrin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Men B, with regards to what the FDA had requested, there were two things. One was some more clinical data with regards to safety in infants, not because something unexpected was seen in the trials, but simply because they increased their standards of what they would want us to have before one would start the large scale Phase III study. This data is almost completed and will be submitted in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Second was on some pre-clinical data, they wanted to better showcase the broad coverage that the vaccine would have if it were to be in a Phase III. There are about 2,000 relevant Men B strains circulating in the U.S., and this is one of the reasons why it is so difficult to develop a Men B vaccine, and there is currently none available. You cannot in a clinical trial test the efficacy of a new vaccine in all those 2,000 strains. This is, of course, impossible. So we had to develop a model based on which we could better predict, based on the vaccine's efficacy in a few strains, how it would also perform in all the other 2,000 strains. And that data is currently completed. And based on an agreement with the FDA on how we would do that and we will also submit that data in the second half of the year. And based on those submissions then we will have a next end of Phase II meeting in a few months, and we'll then with the FDA discuss how we would go into a Phase III.</p>
          <p>With regards to Wyeth and competition, I cannot comment on Wyeth. Our vaccine and the composition of it is somewhat different to the one from Wyeth, I mean, that we can say. And our composition is based on experience we had with a large scale outbreak in response campaigning in New Zealand where we have gained a lot of experience on what could work and what not. And based on that, we feel confident that we have a good solution that could really make a difference here in developing the first Men B vaccine, which is still one of the, I would say, outstanding killers in infants even in advanced industrialized nations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Phase III, is it safe to assume you might be able to go into Phase III by the end of the year or early 2010? Is that the timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, I mean if the data that we submit here and -- is satisfying to the FDA and we find an agreement on how to move forward, then we would start Phase III in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on a good result. I have two elements. Number one, if you could go through how you see the Diovan franchise beyond 2014 remaining at two billion. How -- I've still got a bit of difficulties in understanding how that franchise can be so high if the prices across most of the markets are going to be plummeting.</p>
          <p>And number two, the Wilson plant issues, there seem to be a lot of things happening there for that, that at the beginning where you suggested that it was actually a minor issue that was happening there. I just wanted to understand, is all of it necessary, or is just some of it coming as part of the Forward program being implemented also in the Sandoz division. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Joe, Diovan beyond 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andrew, starting with the question. In 2014, why we think it will be at least 2 billion. If you, right now, look at the franchise in Latin America and in Asia, parts of Asia, where we're already facing generic competition, where there was never patent protection, we are right now, it's a substantial business there and it is continuing to grow. So it's in a number of countries where, for example in Venezuela, there are multiple Valsartans on, generic Valsartans, on the market. In China, there's more than 10 generic versions of Diovan. So we've been able to prove. So, this was -- that will be unaffected by the event of the genericizations in the west. And what's -- what we're finding is that we're able to operate in those markets in ways that we build the brand. Some of them are self-pay markets. So we've got very aggressive point-of-sale programs at the pharmacies that are really proving that this is a sustainable business, not everywhere, so not where the price collapse in Western Europe or in the U.S. I think you're going to see it become 100% generic in the U.S, but in some of those other markets, it should be a sustainable business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us an indication of the 878 million of Diovan revenues that are ex-U.S. How much of that is in those type of markets where you think that you got a branded competitive advantage that will be retained?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I wouldn't want to get into the specifics of the country-by-country.  But I think you can, if you look at....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you suggest like one-third of that business is probably associated with that type of brand capture?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't want to speculate on what percent, but I think if you went and you looked at what markets are primarily self pay, that don't have right now protection on Diovan, you could figure it out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so as Joerg had said earlier, we continue to work closely with the FDA on a remediation plan. And Andrew, we anticipate a Q3 re-inspection from the Atlanta district of the FDA, which has the power to list a warning letter. The leadership changes with respect to your specific question around Project Forward, they're not actually related to our operational excellence initiative, which is Project COMPETE at Sandoz. But rather really to the need to upgrade and strengthen site leadership to really refocus the site on higher quality standards around documentation and validation where we had the issues.</p>
          <p>We did earlier this week take a decision to close the R&amp;D function, as Joerg had mentioned. And to refocus our R&amp;D efforts at our East Hanover Novartis site so that we're closer to our sister division Pharma, and really can access the deep pools of talent in generics in the New Jersey area around formulation and analytical developments in other areas.</p>
          <p>But things continue to move on track at the Wilson site. And I think what's also important to keep in mind is that Wilson is one of over 40 global manufacturing sites that we have. And as Joerg mentioned, we continue to ship over 30 products from the Wilson site to the U.S. market.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Florent Cespedes speaking from Exane BNP Paribas. A few quick questions, first on products, on Lucentis, could you give us some idea of why the performance was so strong in Q2 and was it sustainable going forward? Secondly, on Tekturna, what could be the next short-term communication that could accelerate the ramp up of the product? And a question now on Wilson, on the Wilson plant. How fast the production could start after the inspection in Q3? Is it a matter of months or a matter of weeks? And maybe to come back on Diovan in 2014, is it a fair assumption to say that, among the $2 billion, there is a significant portion that is coming from a good resilience of the Japanese market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with Lucentis, we were very pleased with the performance in the second quarter in Lucentis. And what's happening is, the business model that we're using to sell Lucentis is starting to get some traction, and this is really where we're focusing more, more than just on the transaction to create some value around the pills, or around the specific medicine.  We use that kind of as a metaphor here, value behind the pill. But for -- in Lucentis' case, it's helping physicians understand how to improve their patient flow through their offices so that they can maximize or minimize the number of times spent with each patient around Lucentis and ensure that the patient flow is positive. It's around creating disease awareness campaigns so that we continue to drive great patient populations to increase awareness of wet AMD. So I think it is sustainable as long as we continue to execute against that new commercial approach where we are moving beyond the transaction.</p>
          <p>Regarding Tekturna, we do have a set of data coming from Stage 2 hypertension patients where we hope that we'll be able to show very significant blood pressure drops for Tekturna. And that will be coming out later in the summer. So later this summer. I do think that will help Tekturna perform. You know, if you look at Tekturna's performance to date, 120, almost $130 million sold this year. Tekturna could approach 300 million this fiscal year, and that's without much data. So it's &#x2013; I'm starting to become more and more positive on it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, your question about Diovan and also Japan, I probably should have mentioned Japan in the previous answer because as you look at generic penetration in Japan it's very low. And in fact, even though the government is trying to increase generic penetration more quickly, there's a natural cultural resistance to it. So the fact that we've got a significant proportion of Diovan in Japan, I think, provides a -- will provide a significant business for us in that country post 2014.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, just on the swine flu contracts from the HHS, I was wondering at the sort of current yields you're getting, how many doses those two contracts would equate to? And given the low yields, does it actually take up the majority of your capacity, i.e., you wouldn't have any scope to fill orders from other countries? Is the product also going to be on a fairly standard marginal, would low yields mean this is going to be a much lower margin product than your seasonal vaccine? I was wondering if you could help with timing, the realization of orders? Do you just think really a handful of orders or deliveries at the end of this year? Most of this is really going to come through in 2010?</p>
          <p>And than on project Forward, you're exceeding your goals, but you're still not really beating numbers or raising your Group guidance. So I was just wondering what's happening to the savings, what proportion is being reinvested versus what proportion is maintaining margins.</p>
          <p>And then just a quick question on healthcare reform, you referred to the impact as being moderate and manageable. I was just wondering if you could help us by defining what moderate is? Is that a five to 10% profitability impact or a 2% profitability impact? And on the manageable part of that statement, I was wondering what steps you think you'll have to take to actually make that manageable? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Graham. So let's start with H1N1. Andrin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think with regards to contracts like the ones with HHS, I think the first important thing to emphasis is that those contracts and the values that are given in the press are of course theoretical values. I mean, all these contracts are set up with assumptions. And clarity is discussed with the partners about uncertainties in terms of what is going to happen in the months to come.</p>
          <p>With regards to the impact of the yields, I mean, all contracts clearly specify that delivery of any vaccine will depend, and amongst others, on the yield. So also a U.S. contract in terms of phased execution, there would be more or less doses delivered at a certain point in time depending on how the yields will look like. The same is true for our other contracts as well. But of course, the yield is not the only uncertainty with regards to when potential sales could kick in, clinical trials are the -- on the second one, we will see first results at the end of September. And for the large scale more few other studies, probably will take even a bit longer. So it is simply too early right now to say how much we can really deliver at what point in time. We said in the past that we would have capacity for about 150 million doses to be produced this year. If everything goes well, this was under the assumption of a normal yield. As in the seasonal flu right now, the yield is significantly long -- lower, and WHO is commenting on that, probably between 30 to 50% of what was a normal seasonal yield. And of course then potential deliveries would have to be adjusted for that.</p>
          <p>Given the uncertainties, it is too early to speculate on profit. It is clear that the more we can deliver, the higher our profit would be, given that most of the production costs are fixed. So the yield will make a big difference there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrin. On healthcare reform, Joe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's based on what's happening in Washington, things are changing pretty rapidly. So, obviously, we don't know what the full impact is going to be. But if you just look at where we think it's going to come out, I used the words moderate, but manageable. And rather than put 2%, 5% on it, what I mean by that is that we're not going to use this is an excuse for poor performance. So what it means is, look, we're going to have to get the specific actions that we're going to have to take once we determine what the total cost will be from a Novartis Pharma standpoint. We're going to have to take more aggressive action on the procurement side and the sourcing side.</p>
          <p>I think I've said before that when I first came to Pharma, only 3% of our indirect spend, which is a multibillion dollar spend, had been pushed through an e-sourcing event. Now, we're now up to 13% of that indirect spend pushed through e-sourcing. But that number has to be up 20, 30, 40% quickly. So we're going to have to get much more aggressive on the sourcing side, particularly in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The second key area that will help us offset is that, if you remember back a year ago, we moved to a geographic structure from a sales force standpoint. Not just because we wanted regionalization, but because it was going to force better resource allocation decisions down to the brick level in the U.S.  And I'll tell you that I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making already. And once we put those general managers in place in the regions in the U.S., we're really seeing a new approach to more appropriate and better resource allocation on the field force. So I think those are two big areas, you know, that will help us to manage through healthcare reform.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you didn't mention R&amp;D in there Joe. I mean, is that still a sacred cow? Or do you think that the performance might change your thinking on the return of invested capital of investing in R&amp;D in anyway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, at this point, we're still saying that we want to keep that number at 20% of sales or better right now. But I'll tell you, we are very aggressively going in to the development side of it. And we are looking at process improvement and leaning certain operations in a way that can help us reduce total cost of development. But at this stage, because we have so many good projects to fund, we're saying that what we save in R&amp;D is going to be reinvested so that we can maintain that strong pipeline because it's so critical through 2012, '13, and '14.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Graham, you asked about the Forward savings and how much is falling to the bottom line or how much is reinvested. You understand that this is almost impossible to say because obviously the savings into money that is saved is fungible in a sense. That it's in the end very difficult to say that where the increase in operating income or the improvement in the operating margin is coming from, whether it's growth or savings and so on. But what we know, for example, there are Forward savings in marketing and selling. We're reinvesting significantly in these emerging growth markets and in the launches. And despite this, our marketing and selling as a percent of sales is down. So that's clearly a portion of these savings are dropping to the bottom line. Similarly, in our investments in R&amp;D, we couldn't do without the savings there, but again all these things are fungible and we don't -- we are not in a position to say to you so much is dropping to the bottom line and so much is reinvested.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Maybe a couple of the pipe -- questions on the pipeline for Trevor. On FTY720, any update in terms of infection rates or malignancies that you could give? I know that the data is coming Q4, but you have previously press released any serious adverse events. And then maybe just given that you're close to the QAB149 approval in October, any visibility on where the FDA is thinking about the COPD indication? And then last question on Lovenox generics, what is the difference between the Sandoz and the EBEWE Lovenox generic given that one has got tentative approval and one hasn't? And is there a chance for Sandoz to rather use the EBEWE generic once the deal closes there? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Brett, thank you for directing a question to me. On the FTY front, really no change in the safety profile from my Q1 update. In the infection area, we've seen no unusual infections or any deaths from systemic infections, no PML. On the QAB front, the submission progresses well, particularly on the technical side, which is always an issue. We do have this action date in the second half of the year. As you know though, it has been the case with the FDA that the average time to approval for these in held products has been 18 months, which would push us into 2010. So although we might be hopeful, we're still looking at that average as probably applying to us. So we would look at approval and launch in 2010 for QAB.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Brett, I think your question was on Eloxatin or Oxaliplatin, not on Enoxaparin, which is the generic for Lovenox.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right, sorry about that there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's okay. So Sandoz was granted a summary judgment of non-infringement in mid June by the New Jersey District Court regarding the Orange Book patent. That was the case that was brought by Sanofi-Aventis following our Paragraph IV filing. But really for competitive reasons, I can't comment further at this stage, we're also pre-closed with EBEWE. But there is certain elements of the legal proceedings that have not yet worked out because you probably know the patent doesn't expire till 2013, but the automatic 30 month stay winds up in -- on August 9. So we would have to wait for a final judgment on all the patents.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, I just wanted to follow up on the hypertension franchise. And could you just talk us through the outcome studies on Tekturna in terms of AVANT-GARDE and ACCELERATE and the timing of when we might get the data on those studies.</p>
          <p>And just to come back on the Diovan franchise. Joe, you mentioned that LatAm and Asia were a large portion of Diovan. Can you actually put some numbers to that? What proportion of Diovan comes from LatAm and Asia today, and what kind of growth rate you've seen historically from that franchise?</p>
          <p>And then I wanted to just ask Raymund just with regards to the tax rate outlook for the full year.  Should we expect around the 15% level, but going forward, should we expect any sort of change in that sort of underlying assumption based on sort of a profitability mix? And lastly related to working capital, can you just talk us through where you're seeing significant improvements in the working capital development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. So Trevor, outcome studies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in the ASPIRE HIGHER program, the first real outcome study that I would focus on would be the study time failure, which would come out towards the end of 2010, that's the Astronaut study. The big study coming out in 2012, ALTITUDE, is looking at diabetics and looking there at progression of diabetic nephropathy and other cardiovascular events, that's an important study for us. And then finally, the Chronic Heart Failure study would come out in 2013, 2014. These are both event driven studies. So it will depend on the number of events. But those are the three critical studies that we'll be looking at over the next three to four years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding Diovan, in these markets where we are seeing generics already in the market and where we're primarily, these are primarily self-pay markets, we're seeing the franchise grow, the Diovan franchise grow, in the high single-digits. So about consistent with where it's been on a total global basis. And part of it is because we've had a number of years to get the -- to get to get the model right and what kind of relationship marketing we need to do. It's almost a branded generic strategy a little bit, but still able to command a significant premium over the generics in those markets.</p>
          <p>I'd hesitate to try to breakout what percent of Diovan is in those markets. I think it's fair to say that, if you look at our forecasts, and you look at the fact that in Japan in 2014, you'll still have a significant business in some Latin American markets and some other Asian markets like China and others. That's how we got to our something more than $2 billion forecast.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally with regard to the tax rate outlook, two elements there. Going forward, we feel comfortable that the tax rate should be in this range of 15 to 17% from all the information that we have and from our business plans, that seems a very feasible range for the foreseeable future. There is one proviso to it, I should mention that the pandemic size in vaccines, if we had sales there, those sales will be taxed at the higher rate even the production size the mix of countries. So those sales you probably would have to tax at the rate in the 30 to 40% range. But for the ongoing other business, the range that we expect is 15 to 17%. The working capital improvement, the biggest improvement we expect in inventory reduction, and in particular in pharmaceuticals.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Two questions upon emerging markets and one on biosimilars. On emerging markets, your aspirational target of doubling Pharma in emerging markets as a percent of the portfolio, does that -- is that an aspirational target based simply on the organic growth of the business existing and new product launches? Or do you think you'll need to make some acquisitions in order to achieve that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, what guidance would you give us on the impact that that growth will have on margins? And in particular, I'm thinking about how far out do we have to go before emerging markets have to bear some R&amp;D costs, which I guess may not be the case at the moment?</p>
          <p>And the question on biosimilars is simply can you give us some sense of what you're actually selling, is it -- either as a percent of Sandoz or even indeed the aggregate sales in the quarter of the biosimilars, if that were up 62% underlying? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding the first question on the target for EGM, doubling the size or the percentage contribution to that business, that is purely organic. When we picked the six markets that we said we're going to invest heavily in, they had to be markets where we had good infrastructure, a good capability to really grow organically, and they also had to have some level of critical mass from a sales standpoint today. So this is pure organic growth, and it's based on plans that we obviously have in place. So specific plans, specific forecasts, but I'll say a lot can happen because it's a very volatile region.</p>
          <p>Regarding the impact on margins, the way to think about our emerging growth market strategy is, while we are investing heavily in emerging markets right now to build up the capability in that market. If you look at the -- they are right now only, I wouldn't say slightly, but they're somewhat below the Pharma global average margin, we've said that before. And what that means is that we must improve margins disproportionately in Western Europe and in other parts of the world where we can. So that in total, we can meet the total Pharma global operating income objectives and operating income margin objectives without using the EGM buildup as a reason for dilution. So, as long as -- it's an algorithm that all has to fit together. So the buildup has to come at a point where we're not destroying margins. And then also to fund that buildup, we have to disproportionately grow margins in some of the other more mature markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to biosimilars, I think in the past, we've reported on our Biopharma division, which Kevin, includes our third-party biotech collaborations business. We don't breakout our biosimilars sales, the 62% growth that you referenced, for competitive reasons.</p>
          <p>As to what we're marketing today, as you're probably aware, for example in Europe, no other company in generics has more than one approved marketed biosimilar, we have three in Germany alone for example. EPO as well as our filgrastim, which is the reference product for Amgen's Neupogen. As well as our third product human growth hormone, which is Omnitrope, we also sell in the US. And that's what Joerg mentioned that we received approval in Japan, and also the first ever biosimilars approval in Canada earlier this year. But as for breaking out the specific number, we don't do that. Biopharma as a division represents a little under 3% of our sales globally.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. First question on restructuring please, just in terms of Sandoz, the specific measures there. Can you give us any feel at all for timelines and cumulative savings potential and how much in savings has already been realized? Because my sense at the beginning of the year was that you were really making a very serious effort to get the Sandoz margins up through restructuring?</p>
          <p>My second question, still relating to the swine flu contract. I'm still trying to get a feel for how much risk there still might be that a part of this contract in the U.S. doesn't actually rematerialize. So I'm actually wondering, is there a timeline where you need to have deliver to the U.S. governments or else they can go to your competitors? Or is this basically, are you definitely going to get that one billion whenever you can deliver? And you're saying you are still in talks with about 35 other governments, but realistically, how much incremental capacity would you actually have at the moment to offer to these governments?  And I still, I'm not quite sure, is there actually any competition right now or going into 2010 between the seasonal and the pandemic flu vaccine production?</p>
          <p>And then I just had a very quick question on Galvus. Can you just update us on your U.S. plans because you were saying a few years ago that maybe towards the end of the decade you might try to re-file with the FDA after being able to show some proposed marketing surveillance data in Europe? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Right, that's simple. We haven't changed our plans in the U.S. At this point, we don't have a plan to re-file. But we are certainly watching the situation very closely with the other, with the other BPP 4 inhibitors.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marietta, we continue to really focus on project COMPETE, which is across functional efforts to really drive costs savings in tech ops and marketing and sales and G&amp;A and in development, and we have made significant progress. We're well ahead of internal objectives, but a lot of that is baked into our targets for the year. If you look at, for example, in Italy, and Spain and Portugal, the restructuring has progressed, and those markets are showing significant improvements in profitability.</p>
          <p>With respect to our margins, you saw that in Q2 our margin was 13.9%, that's versus 12.6 last year.  Q2 is always a bit lower than Q1, which is seasonality influenced and significantly higher because of anti-infective sales, which are higher margin. But we continue to make good progress against our restructuring plans internally.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so I want to explain again that the contracts we have signed also with HHS are yield dependent. So if the yield reduces, I mean, then any country will get a less supply at the certain point in time. This will ensure that we can actually deliver to many governments and would not suddenly have to deliver only to one if the yield gets lower, because I don't think that would be in the best public health interest. The contracts are, in generally, binding. So if yields would be lower, or for let's say regulatory reasons, the timelines would be delayed, then the shipment would happen at the later stage. It's not that the governments who could then simply change their mind or go for example to a competitor. Not that I would be worried about the competitors, because I think there is more demand than what the industry can supply, and it will be impossible, especially if the yield is lower, to get supply somewhere else. And of course, if the timelines eventually are such that a certain amount of the delivery could only happen at a moment when vaccination would not make sense anymore, I think then of course, one would not force that into the market, but we are far away from that.</p>
          <p>With regards to seasonal versus pandemic vaccine, for this year we said that we have produced and expect to sell the same amount of seasonal vaccine as last year. And I think that makes a lot of sense because seasonal vaccines are still needed, especially for the elderly. For 2010, it is too early to tell how that tradeoff would be made. It is fair to expect significant demand for pandemic vaccine also in 2010, especially from Southern Hemisphere countries that will go into the next flu season then. And I think to what extent there, we would have to make a tradeoff between producing more H1N1 versus starting the next seasonal campaign is not decided yet. We will of course, to a large extent, wait on the guidance on WHO. That normally gives us direction in terms of what is needed to make the right tradeoffs.</p>
