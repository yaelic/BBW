    <section name="MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We can start this review of our First Half Results. I am here with Carina Ho, our Investor Relationship; and Emmanuel Babeau, our CFO. Today we are going to review the strategy and business update, and we are going to review in detail the finance presentation regarding the first half. We are going to finish by giving you an outlook.</p>
          <p>But I would like to start this presentation by quickly reminding you the main characteristics of Schneider Electric, well &#x2013; and I am in slide five, five to eight. Just to remind you that we are a company which is totally specialized on energy management. We help our customers to make their energy safe, variable, efficient, positive and green. And if you want to remember a few characteristics about Schneider Electric, the first characteristic is that we have a diversified exposure to end markets, an exposure &#x2013; a diversification of exposure that we benefited completely from in this first half, and we are going to come back on this aspect. A few other characteristics that I would like you to remember about Schneider. We are a global company and we do more &#x2013; we do 35% of our turnover in new economies. We are also a company which is committed to innovation. We spend 5% of our sales in R&amp;D. We have 8,000 engineers scattered around the world to develop innovation close to the most advanced customers, and we are a company committed to sustainable development. We consider it pretty sustainable development as we keep up our strategy.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to tell you that when you speak about Schneider Electric you should associate it to two key elements, two key words, two key growth engines. First, the new business linked to Smart Grid, renewable energy efficiency, intelligence in every application where there is energy, building, homes, data centers, industry infrastructure, electric vehicle, new application on the intelligent grid, flexible grid which sticks in the middle. On the other powerful engine of growth and development for Schneider Electric, is it's very capita, very deep rooted presence in new economies. That's a reminder concerning Schneider Electric. Most of you know us very well, so I am moving straight to the core of this presentation which is the highlights or the main titles of this first half. And I am moving for those on the phone to slide 10.</p>
          <p>So if I look at the main characteristics of this first half, it's really characterized by a strong rebound in growth, especially in the second quarter, we strike a quarter with an organic growth of more than 10%, which makes first half compounded at 6.4%. And we are going to come back on that just later, but once again &#x2013; or once more, sorry, the new economies have delivered a growth of 12% above the mature countries. So, new economies have another time as a powerful engine of our growth.</p>
          <p>Second point, we have kept going deeper in One Schneider. And One Schneider is not only about efficiency, and I will come back to that in a minute, but a large part of it is linked to efficiency. We deliver cumulative, you know that we have a plan of cost reduction of 1.6 billion of those three year from 2009 to 2011, and at the end &#x2013; at mid of the project we deliver two-third of the savings, which is to say &#x20AC;1 billion of savings. In the first half itself, we've delivered &#x20AC;350 million on the back of 2009 at &#x20AC;650 million of cost reduction. So, continuation of our research of cost efficiency, of our cost cutting, on a pretty strong performance in the first half.</p>
          <p>Third element, our operating margin, our EBITA, is going up 3.6 points and is going other 15% &#x2013; at 15.2%. And what is noticeable also is that our net profit doubles and reaches &#x20AC;735 million. And finally, I wouldn't be complete if I wouldn't mention one key element, one key event, of our company's life during the first half which is integration of Areva Distribution which is well on track and taking place since the 7th of July, date of closing of the operation. So, pretty dense first half characterized by a strong rebound in organic growth, very strong rebound in profit improvement and on the adjunction step change in our distribution activity and our medium voltage activity through the integration of Areva distribution.</p>
          <p>So going through the main elements on I mean slide 11 for those on the phone, so main elements of our strategy, you remember that One Schneider is three major transformations. One, one solution provider for key end market segments; we use 2009 to reorganize the company and dedicate ourselves by customers and market segments. The second one is one leader in new economies, and I am going to come back to that. It's again another engine of growth. And finally, it's One Company, which has been a major catalyzer of efficiency and of cost reduction.</p>
          <p>So first, let's look at our end markets, places where we deliver solutions. Well, what you see here is that we have benefited on the first half of two early cycles in our portfolio of activities, and the first one is certainly industry. We've told you that we are keeping on investing our industry activity. We are speaking about process and machine automation, which we've done. And the growth that we see today is really carried by certainly new economies, but it's &#x2013; overall everywhere in the world, it's based a lot on machine manufacturers, OEMs which are selling on the back of the rebound many new economies, but I would say a bit everywhere in the world. What we see also is that end users are starting to reinvest because they have stopped investing for so long now that they have to reinvest in their plants.</p>
          <p>So new economies, machine manufacturers, we did two acquisitions to reinforce our presence in this sector during the first half; Cimac on SCADA group, Cimac &#x2013; both of them are pretty strong in the new economies, especially Cimac, which is based in the Gulf. Second, very strong rebound, it's our IT industry. You know that we are in a very strong position, we are leader in the world in this sector. And what we saw first were the products rebounding and now what we see clearly are the projects or data centers rebounding. Probably only Europe is lagging, but to be totally fair to Europe, Europe was the latest to go down during the crisis with a delay of six to nine months, and our things today are pretty positive on the possibilities of rebound of Europe, which has not happened yet. And it is an important part of our activity.</p>
          <p>And finally, our activity in sensors and actuators for repetitive machines, namely planes, namely automotive and industrial machine, has known a very strong rebound, buzz in growth and buzz in profit. This had been impacted last year very badly by the automotive industry in North America. And what I want to mention here is that we are refocusing this activity very largely on the industry segment. What we've done during the crisis is make sure that we would be moving this activity closer to our more traditional markets of industry and this shift has been positive, very positive in terms of profitability.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 12, and this are more later-cycle part of the portfolio, and I would say those activities have now bottomed and they're shown in Q2, all of them, rebound &#x2013; signs of rebound, not only signs but figures of rebound. So building is negative on the full first half, but better and positive in the second quarter. What is carrying the development of building here is energy efficiency in the buildings and especially we have a strong activity of Performance Contracting and energy efficiency in the U.S., which has been very positive the things that we are deploying everywhere else. The growth here has been a bit weaker than the rest of the group, because this is a division which is far less exposed to the new economies.</p>
          <p>So one part of the investment we are putting today &#x2013; we are realizing today is to make sure that we deploy commercially this activity into the new economies, benefiting from the platform of the rest of the activities and especially the power platform. Then in power, we've been the medium voltage, the distribution part has been affected by the construction market and some weakness in the market of the utilities, but new economies were very resilient. And we see this market starting to rebound and the same things applies somewhere in the low voltage.</p>
          <p>In the solutions &#x2013; in power, we've benefited from the solutions, we deliver in renewables, and our dynamics in renewables all over the world have been extremely strong. So part of portfolio which is later in the rebound but clearly in a positive dynamics, and Emmanuel will detail that a bit later. So I don't want to be overlapping with his part in Q2, and therefore gaining some very positive dynamics for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide 13, we speak about solutions, a few elements of things that we are delivering, renewable energies, start-up firms, we are doing a lot them at the moment and gaining experience, on gaining efficiency and designing them. We have full turnkey capability all over the world. OEM solutions coming out with full architecture, which is called Machine Structure, which is very, very &#x2013; with a software called SoMachine machine, which is very innovative and very much in rapture with the usual architectures. That is working very well. The growth is over 50% in H1 and we are clearly taking market share there. It's the definition of eco-structure in the field of the machine.</p>
          <p>Performance Contracting, I was speaking about that, I won't come back on that, and complete data centers. Again, in the data center we are a company able deliver everything and probably the unique company able to deliver everything on the market which is booming and this is place where we push the advantage. It's not only electrical distribution or energy control, it's about process control, it's about security control, it's about environment control. We have full repository in all aspects of the solution.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 14 and the second part of the strategy, one leader in new economies, what we see here is that during the whole cycle, new economies have been better than mature countries and you know that they have been a big advocate of the investment in new economies. We have the &#x2013; some of you had heated discussions at the beginning of the crisis on the behavior of new economies. And so far, I've not been disappointed and this first half new economies deliver growth of 14%, actually on the second quarter it's plus 17%. So the dynamics is an acceleration of the momentum.</p>
          <p>The most striking fact of the first half is anyway in favor of the matured countries that go from Q1 from negative to 7%, almost 7% positive in Q2. So what we see is that benefiting also from lower comps, but the matured are reentering with pretty good dynamics into the positive. An year what is in the new economies we have no working on the basics of our business, but clearly is a development that we have in the mature countries is coming from our diversification of end market. And from the new activities, we are working on energy efficiency, renewables, all the aspects of intelligence that we are putting in buildings and homes, these are the activities which are carrying the growth on the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Okay, what we see here is that &#x2013; what we see in sales is also accompanied by a shift of the back-office on 50% of the cost of sales, I remind you, are &#x2013; will come from new economies in 2011. This is a plan that we are delivering to be leader in a new economy. New economies represent 35% of our turnover in H1. Most of the acquisition we've done in the past have net out. Actually there were more in the west and we deploy those technologies in the new economies, but the crisis has certainly accelerated and capitalized the shift of activity to new economies. To give you a bit more precise flavor about what we are doing to develop our presence in new economies, so it's slide 15, I would say we are benefiting, and this is at the bottom of the slide, of major trends that we see in those new economies. Urbanization is huge, while &#x2013; take the simple China, we are speaking about two populations of France moving from rural to urban in the next five years. We're not speaking about the next 20 years, we're speaking about the next five years. With that comes a lot of need for energy. You can triple that figure if you take full spectrum of &#x2013; or the full range, I would say, of new economies. Increasing need of resources will &#x2013; we work a lot in mining, in oil and gas, and this is redeveloping very fast. And one trend that we didn't put here but which is also very strong, it's all the economy of knowledge and especially the activity of datacenters which is booming in many of those new economies.</p>
          <p>Now when you look at what we do by business, in power it's mostly offer adaptation, we adapt offers, we benefit from our R&amp;D in those countries. We've got 1,000 people in R&amp;D in China. We've got several hundreds of people in India. It's really close to 800. We have people in Latin America also developing specific cultures for those markets. We are leveraging &#x2013; we shall leverage from now on the average &#x2013; the Areva distribution market position on industrial capacity. Areva brought a very good position in new economies, more than 45% of the sales in new economies. So, that will reinforce our exposure to new economies. In industry, again the OEM, a lot of solutions for the resource &#x2013; for the basic and fundamental needs of those markets, mining, water, oil and gas, electrification, therefore utilities.</p>
          <p>So we have the full solution for that. Id IT, I spoke about it, complete data centers here. This IT division is still smaller in proportion than the average of the group in its exposure in emerging countries. So we are investing commercially to be able to reach all the cities and all the places that we should reach in the new economies. And building is a startup in new economies, so really we are investing to &#x2013; beyond those markets. And remember &#x2013; I will remind you, sorry, that we do a lot on buildings through our power activities. So we have the commercial access, we don't always have the specialists technically to follow yet those buildings, but we see something on the reparation and that we are taking today. Plus we do exceptionally external growth in the new economies. Our preferred model of development in new economies is organic because when the market is growing you displace market shares potentially very fast. But we happen sometimes to make some external growth operation, which we did for instance with Zicom or with Cimac during the first half.</p>
          <p>Last part of our strategy is One Company coming from the past of lot of acquisitions, the culture of extreme decentralization and extreme differences. Our customers ask for one solution and we can't deliver one solution if we are not one company, so we've decided in 2009 to go in the direction of One Company. You've heard about the conversions of our brands, the conversions of our sites, this building is one example, by the way, seven sites in one. Well, conversions of our processes, of what we're doing, a lot of sharing on globalizations and cost reduction. On the results in the figures of this movement, is seeing that you probably don't see but is the impact on the customers, we come as one in front of the customer, but it's also our efficiency. And at the end of June, we have reduced our cost by 1 billion. Remind you, the plan is 1.6 billion in three years, half of the plan, two-third of the savings and the target is by the end of year to have delivered more than 70% of the plan, okay, at &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>My review wouldn't be complete without welcoming onboard of Schneider people from Areva D. By the way we are conducting this welcome on this integration, so Areva D represents on a full-year basis and these are the 2009, roughly &#x20AC;1.8 billion of turnover. The market needs, these are not the same, 45% to the utilities and 55% to the building and industry, and there clearly Areva D didn't have to reach on that later part of the market. But Schneider is bringing that marginal cost at no cost with its low voltage sales, an exceptional sales network to carry the technologies of Areva D. This also reinforces our footprint in new economies. 45% of the sales of Areva D are in new economies, so more and better than the average of the group. And finally something that doesn't appear here, an exceptional capability in the field of power automation, distribution automation on Smart Grid, which relays on software which are combining with ours to make one of the leaders if not the leaders in the distribution automation.</p>
          <p>Review a bit some global figures and I am in slide 18. The financial impact of the consolidation of Areva D are in line with expectations. We are going to consolidate from the 7th of June, none of the figures of Areva D appear in our accounts of the first half, but it's going to be at the end of the year in terms of consolidation roughly 1.1 billion of turnover. So it's roughly one half of the year. We expect the profitability to be around 5%, which is line with our expectations, probably a bit better, which is below the average of the group and this is something we are going to certainly be addressing with the teams. The operation would be EPS equity from the first year obviously. And the integration charges should be roughly &#x20AC;50 million, with 15 being &#x2013; happening on the first half and the rest happening on the second half. I remind you that we are targeting a level of synergies of &#x20AC;120 million, which is very significant. I am very optimistic &#x2013; for me with perspective of this integration. We had the first meetings of the people of Schneider and Areva D together. And there was a lot of enthusiasm in building this world leadership, the second largest activity business of Schneider, world leader, into our group.</p>
          <p>So this being said, this was again a very busy H1 and that was a lot of talking. Now, the sales figures with Emmanuel.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Pascal, and then good morning to all of you. I would like lead you through the key numbers for our first half 2010 now. And I suggest that we start immediately with our topline. And clearly, making a few comments on the dynamic that we've seen playing between the Q1 and Q2; as we can see, there have been strong acceleration between the growth that we experienced during Q1, which was a moderate growth, plus 2%, and the strong growth that we have seen for our Q2 at plus 10%. The reasons for this acceleration are various. So first one of course is that indeed we were probably facing the trough of many businesses last year during this Q2 2009. Therefore, we were enjoying some easy comps for the second quarter 2010. But nevertheless, we have seen some renewed dynamism across our businesses and across our region. They have all posted some growth and sometimes some very impressive growth. So, we are back to growth in all our geographies and in all our businesses.</p>
          <p>Just a few words on the evolution of dynamism by geographies; Western Europe was globally at minus 4 in Q1, plus 5 in Q2, so an acceleration of 8, 9 points. If you look at North America, we were at minus in Q1, plus 6 in Q2, same kind of acceleration in terms of absolute number of extra growth if you want. Rest of the world, which was around breakeven in terms of growth in Q1, was plus 8% in Q2. And APAC which was really very impressive in Q1 with plus 23%, was at the same kind of level, plus 24%, in the Q2. So overall, acceleration improvement in all region and growth across our businesses.</p>
          <p>If we go now into some more deeper analysis between the new economies and the mature country, you see that we start to have some interesting answers about debate on coupling or decoupling between this new economy and the mature country. If we start focusing on new economies, they are already delivering a strong Q1 at plus 12% and they further accelerated in Q2 with plus 17%. Of course, Asia has been leading the charge here and when we speak about Asia, we have to start with China which is still in Q2 staying significantly above 20% organic growth, so very strong growth. But Asia is not only about China, India is also performing very well posting as well growth which is superior to a 20% threshold. And we've also to mention when we speak about Asia not only China and India, but it's also about Vietnam, it's about Indonesia, these new countries which are growing fast, let's say, as fast or close to as fast as the China and India, represent a huge population, we're talking about almost 400 million people for the two country I have mentioned, strong prospect for growth for us in these two countries.</p>
          <p>Let's take Asia for a second, Latin America posted double-digit growth, Middle East, double-digit growth as well, Russia which is rebounding stronger than what we said initially, strong double-digit growth as well. Central Europe had been negative during Q1 and stabilized during Q2 with double H1 around stability. And Africa was in fact the only negative area, but some of you may remember that this was only &#x2013; the only growing country in our H1 of 2009. So for Africa, we are also enjoying some higher comps and different I would say trend in term of dynamism.</p>
          <p>Moving now to mature economies, they were negative in the first quarter at minus 2%. They are positive at plus 7%, clearly benefiting from dynamism on the industry investment in IT, low voltage also back to growth, all that creating a better environment for mature country which indeed where, as I said, enjoying some easy comps on this Q2.</p>
          <p>Entering into some details for Europe and North America, Europe first, some countries have been performing well. If you look at Germany, Italy, they did post a nice growth for the two country by the industry. They are big OEM countries and that clearly has been helping the performance. If you look at Italy only, the renewable dimension has been important and clearly helping the growth as well. France has posted nice Q2 with nice growth, so it's a market which is back to growth. Two black spots for us in Western Europe during this H1, Spain which is still double-digit negative growth and the Nordic county, which have been negative overall during this first half. Moving to North America, also positive, helped by industry and IT, and some beginning of positive signal in the residential in the U.S. Very early stage, difficult to see that it's a strong firm long-term trend, but we start to see some positive signal here. Japan was very strong, but on easy comps and Australia is very much behaving like a new economy country or an Asian country and posted strong growth.</p>
          <p>If we look at the evolution of our sales between &#x2013; the dynamism between Q2 and globally H1, you see that all businesses have been accelerating. If you look at power, plus 6% in the second quarter, when it reached minus 3% in the first quarter. Here this is clearly low voltage and renewable globally improving when medium voltage is still down. Industry was very strong already in Q1 at plus 19%. It posted plus 27% in Q2, further accelerating, again that was the most depressed part of the result last year for industry in the second quarter. IT, still improving, plus 6% to plus 10%. We said that every region were growing but actually Europe was lagging in term of magnitude of the rebound. And building which was the most declining country in Q1 at minus 4, has been rebounding in plus 2. They are not in this business benefiting from the strength of the new economy as much as the other business are benefiting. But clearly, they are benefiting from positive trend in term of energy efficiency, building automation which is supporting the business. Overall, we reach this &#x20AC;8,571 million of sales for the first half and this is a growth of 10.5% globally for the group.</p>
          <p>And now in page 23, and I keep going down the main line of our P&amp;L, gross profit reached &#x20AC;3.5 billion in our H1. It's plus 18% compared to last year. And this represent a margin rate of 44.08%. This is took 2.5% above our first half last year. We have clearly been generated significant gain in term of productivity, but I will come back on that in a minute.</p>
          <p>Out EBITA before restructuring and one-off cost for Areva D integration which &#x20AC;1.3 billion, this is 44% above the H1 2009 and that mean margin of 15.2% that is plus 3.6% compared to last year, very significant improvement in profitability for the group in our H1.</p>
          <p>Keep going down, 50 million of one-off integration cost for Areva Distribution, we said that we are expecting around 50 million for the full year and for the integration of Areva D restructuring cost &#x20AC;61 million, we are below the 112 million of last year. Many costs are now behind us in term of generating synergies, but we still have of course some cost to generate the extra 350 million cost reduction that we've achieved during this H1, but clearly we are now with a lower level of restructuring cost and globally, we expect restructuring cost to be in the bracket between 100 and &#x20AC;150 million for the full-year 2010. That lead us to an EBITA of 1.25 billion, plus 55%. Amortization and impairment of intangible, 90 million. This is below last year because last year we had some special impairment due to the economic situation. This year we are back to normal trend, which was previously around 100 million a year, plus the fact a few brands which are going to disappear due to our One Program where we focusing on more limited number of brands, are going to unauthorized over a five-year period and this will generate a 60 million extra charge over the next five-year period. That means an EBIT of &#x20AC;1,135 million, plus 66%, compared to last year. Net financial expense reached &#x20AC;132 million, significantly better than the &#x20AC;198 million that we had last year. This is due to largely a ForEx gain of &#x20AC;37 million. The ForEx has been turning positive for us during this first half. You may have noticed that this has been positive at the level of the topline, around &#x20AC;250 million of extra sales due to ForEx in H1 globally. This is positive at the level of the EBIT line, around &#x20AC;60 million positive on this first half, and it is positive on our net financial expense. We will see that this is negative at the level of debt number of course.</p>
          <p>Income tax, we have 24% rate for the first half of 2010 which we estimate to be probably close to what should be our final number for the full-year 2010, and minority interest we have 29 million of profit, which corresponds to minority shareholding. All that means a net income group share of &#x20AC;735 million. This is more than doubling our net profit last year. And if I look at our earning per shares, we reached 2 <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Let's move to some analysis of change to understand which kind of drivers have been playing during our first half. First of all, of course volume drive, we have been generating a significant growth in volume and that has been generating an extra profit of &#x20AC;192 million. Now moving to the mix, we are close to stability on the mix, a significant improvement compared to last year where we had a very negative number for the full year. A lot of things playing here, but we have within product and within solution some negative mix which have been playing and that is bringing us to this stability on mix. Price, absolutely in line with what we said. We said that we are globally expecting something around neutrality for the full year. This has been the case for the first half and this is our expectation for the full-year 2010.</p>
          <p>Now moving to productivity, which has been really the big achievement of the group during this first half in terms of efficiency, we have almost generated 300 million of extra operating profit, thanks to gain in productivity. And I will detail that in a minute. We have seen some cost of good inflation, &#x20AC;53 million, but that only integrates a limited number for raw materials, &#x20AC;35 million, when we expect something close to &#x20AC;150 million of negative raw material impact for the full year. So that means that we have something around 115 million euro of negative raw material impact as the headwind for the second part of the year, so something that will be clearly playing negatively against us during the second half.</p>
          <p>Moving to the support function costs savings, we kept delivering on that. Remember that last year we achieved globally &#x20AC;550 million. For the first half, we have been generating &#x20AC;15 million of extra savings, but let's be clear, this is hiding a very diverse reality between mature country where we have been generating in excess of that and new economies where, given the strength of the growth, we have to reinvest in order to support this growth today and of course to prepare the growth tomorrow. So we keep delivering savings, but of course with a very different picture between new economies and mature countries. We have some inflation and IT costs linked to the bridge program. We have some one-off elements in order, we have some marginally positive impact on scope, and we have this currency effect of plus &#x20AC;61 million, which shows that currency have been playing positively for us. Euro has been depreciating versus most of the currency during this first half, but what is interesting to note is that this positive impact on the first half is only linked to the dollar in a limited portion. That means that this positive impact on the currency is largely due to other currencies, the Australian dollar, the Russian ruble, the Indian rupees and all the big currency in which we are working, and that means that we do expect some positive impact probably to develop around the dollar, of course depending on what the dollar will be in H2, which has been only playing moderately during the first half.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to try to give some explanation and to give you some light on the reason behind this very strong performance that we have achieved on manufacturing productivity. &#x20AC;529 million of fixed manufacturing cost during the first half, and this is taking some negative ForEx element into account, when last year for the first half we had &#x20AC;559 million of fixed manufacturing cost. So with much volume, we have been able to significantly decrease the manufacturing cost. I think it illustrates pretty well the strong effort and the strong realization that the teams have been generating during this first half in term of productivity.</p>
          <p>Moving to the explanation of the &#x20AC;300 million, you see that roughly one-third, &#x20AC;98 million, is the positive manufacturing productivity coming from new extra volume &#x2013; growth in volumes. The rest is about purchasing, &#x20AC;124 million, so we've been purchasing raw material components in better condition. This is about lean manufacturing, the way we organize production, the engineering of our product and this is about rebalancing 42 <mark type="inaudible" /> for topline margin, but of course negatively at the level of our SFC. Salary inflation and other was negative for 72 million, and we generated 50 million of extra savings on our global program of efficiency on SFC, and our global 1 billion objective again with the strong discrepancy that I described previously. Now, with 600 million or close to it, that means that we have generated a 13% decrease of our SFC base, which is a significant achievement.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the profitability by business and what we have seen during this first half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2009, you see that apart from buildings, we have improved our profitability in all businesses, sometime in a moderate way, significant but moderate, power where we are close to 20% EBITA margin of plus 2%; IT where we are close to 15% EBITA margin, plus 1.6%; and sometime in a very spectacular way almost doubling our profitability on industry getting close to 20% and plus 11 points and the customized sensors, we were close to stability last year and we have generated plus 12 points this year, now getting to significant profitability on this business.</p>
          <p>Debt and free cash flow, the debt amounted to 4 billion &#x2013; roughly &#x20AC;4 billion at the end of June 2010. That is of course taking into account the integration of Areva Distribution and more than &#x20AC;200 million of negative impact because of the currency. The free cash flow was above &#x20AC;450 million. This is down the &#x20AC;726 million last year, but there is only reason for that and this is the evolution of the working capital. Last year, we were of course in a totally different dynamic with the working capital going down by almost &#x20AC;250 million. When this year, on the contrary, we have to cope with a significant increase in our business, in our volumes and this is consumption of working capital of close to 500 million. Apart from this, working capital we wanted then to bring analyze in a second, this is actually regarding CapEx. We have been extremely disciplined and even significantly better than last year.</p>
          <p>So a few words maybe to explain what has been acting on the working capital, to understand that it is largely about normal evolution that we are talking here. At the end of December, we had a &#x20AC;3 billion amount for working capital globally. Just the scope and mainly the ForEx, the fact that the part of our working capital is in dollar, is in ruble, is in rupees, in Australian dollar, in Chinese yuan and so on. That has been generating an extra &#x20AC;400 million mechanically. Then we have the fact that the working capital is progressing largely in line with our sales. And that has been adding another &#x20AC;200 million and then you have an additional &#x20AC;300 million, which is due to the fact that we have increased the level of inventories between end of December and end of June. I remind you that at the end of December, we were above 80 days only, when we are 91 days of inventory at the end of June. But that &#x2013; we mentioned at that time that we were significantly putting pressure on the supply chain and on the team to get to this number.</p>
          <p>Facing this true growth that we have experienced in H1, of course we have had to alleviate this pressure that we have put on the supply chain. We took the decision because of pressure on supply to create some inventory in order to cope with our customer expectation in term of delivery and to avoid any kind of significant shortage. And we also took the decision to increase the level of our inventory for some raw material and some components precisely because we are ourselves seeing some pressure in the supply for this raw material and supply chain. So this is explaining the situation that will be certainly largely improved at the end of December 2010. Apart from that, as you can see and compared to what we have achieved at the end of June 2009 last year, we are improving on the level of receivable and we are improving on the payables. And we keep a very disciplined overall level of working capital.</p>
          <p>We finished this first half with a very strong balance sheet. You see that the net-debt-to-EBITA level after the Areva D integration is in line, roughly speaking, with we had at the end of 2009 and what had at the end of 2008, which means that we keep I think a very strong balance sheet, which is giving us a lot comfort and a lot of flexibility.</p>
          <p>Jean-Pascal, I leave you the floor for the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving on to the outlook very briefly, because most of the topics have been already covered, what we see as major factors for the second half of the year, there are four defining the outlook. Recovery of Industry and IT are confirmed. They are going to continue, but we are going to be comparing to a more demanding basis of comparison. The later cycle bidding on medium voltage I would say power overall will continue showing sequential recovery on their side. We'll benefit also from a lower basis of comparison. The momentum of two economies to our opinion on what we can observe very clearly on the market are going to remain strong. In the nutshell, we confirm their rebound, their recovery. On the profitability, we are going to be facing some headwinds, which we didn't face in the first half in the field of raw material on inflation for around &#x20AC;150 million. And at the same time, we're going to keep on developing our effort for industrial productivity on support function cost savings in mature countries where the level <mark type="inaudible" /> cost savings by the end of the year. So therefore, to deliver more than 70% the total plan of 1.6 billion at the end of the second year of the plan, which all compounded gives the following outlook. We see dynamics of growth, growth percentage similar in H2, broadly to what we saw in H1, so same kind of growth in H2 in respect what we saw on H1. And the second thing is profitability improvement that would put our EBITA margin at around 15 &#x2013; 0.5%, this is before restructuring and this is more important before the consolidation of Areva Distribution.</p>
          <p>This being said, this concludes our &#x2013; I should say, well, our presentation, but we are pretty happy to go into the detail of this first half with you and we are now ready for questions. Thank you for your attention.</p>

          <p>Okay. So, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to stare the Q&amp;A section. So we'll first pick the questions from the floor here in this room and then we will take questions from people who join this conference by phone. So, first question?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning; Ga&#xEB;l de Bray from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I am still a little bit concerned about the cash flow development in the first half of this year. How much of the working <mark type="inaudible" /> do you expect to be able to recoup by the end of the year? And what kind of free cash flow to sales ratio do you anticipate for this year? And maybe also, what would be a kind of a normalized level for you going forward? Also still kind of a medium terms question on that related to the working cap, I don't think that Schneider has ever been best-in-class player in terms of working capital management, at least compared to some of your peers in this sector.</p>
          <p>So, do you have any plan internally to further improve the level and catch-up maybe with some of your peers, just maybe like Legrand, for example, in this sector, which is doing very well in that metric? And still also related to what happened in H1 in terms of working capital development, how much of the margin improvement as seen in H1 is actually coming from &#x2013; you've been through a buildup and higher production levels, it seems to be close to 110 bps roughly on the H1 margins. I don't know if I am totally wrong on that, and can you confirm that it won't be repeated in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's one question, right? Just on the free cash flow, the impact in H1 is inventory on the &#x2013; it's on inventory and its real contrary decision when we saw the uptake of the orders that we are focusing and we saw some shortages on the side of the suppliers. I &#x2013; we decided with the team to give total priority to our customers, and especially in the fast rebounding geographies, because in the figures you see there are some geographies which are rebounding really &#x2013; it's really a rapture of demand. On use intentions, so we've really decided to adjust our inventory up and to cover us &#x2013; ourselves on that side. I expect the level of inventory, which is the only abnormality in the first half to be back to a normal level of working capital, I would say, by the end of the year, okay, but in an year of growth and in the dynamics and in the momentum of growth, but it was a real conscious decision and more obsessed by the customer satisfaction in this period and being able to take the wins of growth than by this specific aspect at the middle of the year. So, I have no worry that we're going to correct that during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>I will let Emmanuel complement, but on working capital, you say we're not best-in-class, we just have already one to compare apple-to-apple because the figures we are talking about are not the same in most of the cases. And second thing, we have to &#x2013; you have to integrate the global footprint and the global characteristics of the business to be able to compare. And working capital is one part of the equation, but there is another part which is in the P&amp;L, in the balance sheet with it's &#x2013; you have to put it in the complete equation. I would argue that first we have improved since the deployment of our business and especially the deployment in new economies and very vast territories that we've improved quite significantly our performance in working capital and it's a good news that there is a lot to do still.</p>
          <p>So you're right in saying that we can do better. On this assumption we are working, we are keeping on working on closing, on consolidating some of our manufacturing plants, some of our distribution centers, reducing the number of references, those are left in front of us, the convergence of brands is helping on that aspect. So we are going to keep improving, but I think when it comes to working capital you have to look at the full parameter of the geographies where you're exposed, some geographies pay faster, some not as fast. Some people call it vast territories, some are more concentrated on the &#x2013; I think today we've improved quite significantly. I will say normal level of working capital at the end of the year will be in percentage of sales close to what we're delivering, probably a bit better, in the years of I would say normal volatility on our markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I've captured well your question on inventory level and the impact on the margin you're saying, is the fact that you've been building inventory as benefiting the productivity, is this the sense of your question? Well, the answer is of course, yes. I would certainly just limit the impact of that because in the extra inventory, as I said, there is a significant part of raw materials and dieing components and no impact on production.</p>
          <p>Second, as you said, I mean at the end of the day, the extra inventory compared to a normal level are limited in fact when you exclude the ForEx impact and therefore it remains limited. So I am not able to give you what is the impact, it's certainly a few millions. I don't think that if we were able to calculate the right number this would change the view on the fact that we have generated very strong productivity. So this has been marginally helping, but certainly has not been building the picture or changing the picture, if you want, on productivity.</p>

          <p>We don't give a lot of expectation and guidance, but &#x2013; we don't give guidance on cash flow. What I can tell you is that on the long-term, our clearly &#x2013; our clear objective is to have a cash flow generation which is in line with our net profit. Last year, we were at 180% of net profit generated in cash flow and of course it was a very specific here. Our trend on the long-term is to be at around 100% number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think we have a question from Ludovic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Ludovic Debailleux, Natixis. I have three questions, please. First of all, could you share with us your view on our &#x2013; the bid that Emerson is doing on Chloride could change the competitive landscape of the UPS market, especially in Europe? Second question is related to China. Do you really believe that the demand from the secondary markets &#x2013; secondary towns, sorry, will be enough to offset potential growth in large towns such as Shanghai or Beijing? And lastly, coming back to Areva Distribution, the margin stands at 5%. Can you share with us the potential of improvement in the medium term or at least tell us what is the current level of profitability within Schneider medium voltage? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, the bid of Emerson and Chloride, I don't want to comment on competitor's moves. I think it's a logical move of consolidation. In a sector which is asking a lot of concentration of R&amp;D, you need to be big to succeed. What I would say is that it consolidates, also it confirms the value of our investment in the sector for the world leader, APC, on &#x2013; that's it. Just I think it's a natural movement of consolidation. I saw also that it generated interest among the industry and I believe that Schneider has very good position in the field of central power. At the core of many applications in our sectors is the data center. We speak a lot about data centers. They speak about semiconductor factories, flat panel factories; everything which is stabilizing the power in new economies where you have grids very often fading and all the supply of central power, so the process and industrial applications.</p>
          <p>So we are in the an exceptional position to put the UPS on the central power with medium voltage, with low voltage and within the full system of electrical distribution, and this remains a strong advantage of Emerson, who is focused only on the secure power part. So we are &#x2013; in the field of IT or in the field of those hi-tech we keep an exceptional or unique position in terms of portfolio. China now, China has been very, very buoyant on the first half on &#x2013; I think we've captured the large part of the opportunity. We expect some cooling in the second half, but more by basis of comparison than anything else. Without entering into detail, we see a lot of dynamism in many of the segments. We are touching China and clearly we are already present in the secondary cities where the demand is taking place. But I would say it's not now. It has already started, I would say, in the past quarters.</p>
          <p>The Chinese government has stimulated the economy and pushed a lot of the development inside the country, inside the west or inside <mark type="inaudible" /> and we see the elements of that. And it's not only stimulus, it's natural propelling of ship, it's a natural wave of development which is clearly taking place. And there I would say our business model, which is very much in partnership with Chinese players, very scattered, very adapted to that environment, it's certainly helping us to capture those capabilities. We benefit from the network of distribution, network of integrators.</p>
          <p>Areva D, there is a potential for improvement. When we did the acquisition, we explained that in 2008 the profitability of medium voltage was around 14%, 2008. Certainly, it was a good point but yes, it shows that Schneider in the same activities having better profitability, benefiting completely from the synergies with low voltage. I mean we told you that 55% of this market is the die shoes market. And the die shoes market is very costly to reach if you don't have a larger basket of products to offer. We have that basket for low voltage where we are world leader by far. And this enables us to cover at marginal cost this part of the market. On the entry of new technologies in &#x2013; from Areva into sales network are already I would say and it's been short time producing some visible affects. So that will give us some volume that will enable us to redistribute our sales on specialist forces. I am very optimistic that we shall gradually improve the things, but stay in line with what we have said of 120 million of synergies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean one good news is clearly the fact that, as we said, we believe that the medium voltage has probably troughed in Q2 and that means that this business is joining us at a time where it should see some improving dynamism certainly starting next year and therefore there is a good time for the business to join Schneider and that will help us in our ambition to grow readily the profitability.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Alfred Glaser from Cheuvreux. On just rebounding on medium voltage, could you give us a bit more color on the outlook right now, is it the business was stabilizing? What do you expect more precisely in terms of potential demand growth in the next few months or in the next few quarters? And what you expect about the pricing in medium voltage?</p>
          <p>And second question on the &#x2013; your margin targets and the Areva Distribution integration, is it correct that in the 15.5% you include the margin and the consolidation of Areva Distribution this year? And does the integration change anything to your mid-term target of 13 to 16% operating margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To start by this question, I'd say explicitly it doesn't include, so it is at constant parameter, so 15.5. Does it change our mid-term objective of 13 to 16, no. I mean we are in a business that we know. It reinforces, but it doesn't change the profile of the company, so we'll stay with the same ambition over the cycle to deliver margin 13 and 16%. What is the outlook? We stay cautious, okay. But today what we've seen is a trough on the start of the rebound. But it's a bit too early to say &#x2013; what is clear is that we are able to carry the medium voltage not only in the utilities, which was a traditional positioning of Areva, but clearly strongly in the industry which was not obvious positioning for Areva D in the building, which is the segment which starts to rebound in any way in new economies, which is rebounding quite strongly. In infrastructure and in many other behind data centers or in many applications, so you could &#x2013; we can say that the outlook for medium voltage readily, it's a later cycle in what we do, especially due to the implementation of projects, small project on new deals, will be &#x2013; the rebound will be later than the other activities, but we think it's going to have a dynamic which will be close to the one of the group.</p>
          <p>Pricing depends of the part of medium voltage we are talking about, but globally we've had where the transformers have been more indexed on the raw materials, our position in this is quite selective on resisting pretty well to the pressures. But we have adapted our prices to the conditions of the market. And for the rest, it's pretty much in line with what you see in low voltage, I mean we can position ourselves with a neutral price on the year.</p>

          <p>The next question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Olivier Esnou with Exane BNP Paribas. Two questions, please. I wanted first to come back on the bridge and the mix component of the bridge. I didn't fully get why it's a low number in this half and so if you could bring some details. And maybe explain to what extent it could be link to the fact that your solution business margin now has a sort of, is sort of much close to the group? And aside to that, the second question would be, what has been the growth of that solution in service path in the first half, I mean last year &#x2013; the product part of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with the mix, I mean it's always a combination of a lot of elements and a number of element have been playing positively during this first half and notably the fact that this is the answer to your second question. Solution has been growing, but not at the average pace of the group, so between product and solution there has been something which has been slightly in favor of product, but within product and within solution we have seen some negative impact. In product, power has been growing at a lesser pace than other activity with a lower profitability, and within solution we have been developing solution notably on renewable, which are enjoying a lower margin. So, this is really a combination of elements which is driving because it's close the neutrality element.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On solution, it's really a time of cycle because solutions took more time to decrease during the crisis, time of execution of the projects and distributions and which is then later than the on the cycle for the same reason, but the pipe is good, I mean on worry on the orders.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Alex Barnett from Jefferies. Can you just try to put some numbers around restocking and destocking, just talk about sort of the rate last year that we did see destocking in and the impact in Q2 this year of restocking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's difficult to put a figure. I would &#x2013; probably, we see a &#x2013; one thing we've all learnt into the crisis is to be more cautious with &#x2013; I spoke about our conscious decision to build some raw material structure especially, but this was linked to this specific uptake on the demand. We don't see now our key distributors, we don't see much restocking. What we are benefiting nevertheless is the fact there was destocking last year, so we decreased the basis of comparison. That's what you would probably say.</p>
          <p>Now putting a figure, it's &#x2013; the situations are very diverse and it is difficult to characterize totally &#x2013; the fact that they were in some parts of the business some real appeals or request of deliveries means that some of the stocks are low actually. So, we are phasing all sorts of situation, I would say. Probably, the biggest impact is more the basis of comparison of last year, due to destocking they were in the decrease ultimately, but we don't see an excessive stock at our distributors at all. Well, there was still a bit of destocking issue, but it's going to be a bit less, is in H2 anyway. Most of the destocking took place in H1 though even last year it was quite difficult to characterize, but it was...</p>

          <p>Good morning. Two questions, please. The first one is on energy efficiency in the U.S. We have seen a number of your competitors with their Q2 results updating about orders received that's now stimulus related. I don't quite know how they calculate it, but maybe you could give us an update how that business is going and what the outlook is there, whether that's government &#x2013; support will decline from here or not? And also maybe in terms of clarification on the financials, if you could give us maybe some breakdown, how &#x2013; the assets you are currently holding on the balance sheet for Areva, how they will breakdown maybe on the asset side into goodwill and normal asset and maybe on the liability side what we should add may be to pensions for the full year coming from Areva? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, I won't &#x2013; I don't see your question was for me to comment on a competitor's declaration, which in my vision is that today when I look at the global figures, we do in advanced services for energy efficiency in the U.S., they are good, it's good growth double-digit and it's very dynamic. Now, split what is coming from stimulus from the rest for me is a bit complicated. On globally, what we've seen around the world is sometime for the stimulus to come to reality. There has been a lot of talks, but not always. We see some of it, some that we can identify but not always easy to split it.</p>
          <p>So I will probably disappoint you by my lack of knowledge of the market, but I prefer &#x2013; I am not to &#x2013; try to characterize it because I would risk to be inducing some wrong interpretation. What we see is that there is an energy efficiency movement in the U.S. A part of it is federal or state driven, but the large part also is privately driven. I have difficulties personally to sort out which is stimulated on that. The financials...</p>

          <p>On the Areva, we for the time being, have a number which is only provisional, but slightly north of 1 billion &#x2013; &#x20AC;1.24 billion, there is a cash impact at the end of June, but it is a cash impact which is base on numbers which will have to be finally determined together with our partner at term. So, this number could go slightly up or down but at least it will you a good idea of the impact. On top of that, we could have a pension impact which I estimate to be probably in the range of, let's say, 60, &#x20AC;70 million, which could be whether an extra pension deficit or some cash payment results, and which means that this would be immediately some extra debt and of course that does not take into account anything on India, which is a situation that is only for conclusion later on this year. So, this is pre the Areva D in India.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Matt Williams from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. It's Matt Williams at HSBC. A quick question, if I may, on the Performance Contracting business that you mentioned on slide 13, I think it was. You didn't mention private sector customers with regard to that. And I was wondering if you could comment on private sector activity within Performance Contracting, how you think this business could grow overall in terms of size and through cycle profitability, whether it would be below or above group average? And obviously, linked to the previous question about public sector customers and potential austerity measures, how you feel about the client mix and customer mix there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Performance Contracting is something which makes a lot of sense. I mean people are looking for cost and they are looking in more and more geographies to reducing their carbon emissions and their energy impact. So making savings, thanks to technology, it makes a lot of sense. I mean, when you are in a cost reduction mind, I mean everybody is still in the mindset of the crisis on gaining more efficiency. Energy is costing a lot in many countries, more and more in many countries. In other countries, it's a question of scarcity. So finding the smart way to reduce your bill on &#x2013; that the savings will pay at the end of the day. This is one of the investment where who pays, the savings pay for the investment. The payback is relatively short, three to five years, and very visible and can be monitored, can be proven. Goes into your carbon summary, on your carbon performance, shows that you are investing in the right directions.</p>
          <p>So we see that happening in the public sphere, but we see that happening a lot also in the private sphere. Where does it happen, a bit everywhere. I mean I can't be too specific, where we saw performance contracting probably taking off the most has been the U.S. because it's a model which is an OpEx model and it is an OpEx &#x2013; it is a model that really is that you can financially justify on &#x2013; I would say which is not pragmatic probably culture of cost reduction in the U.S. and in other geographies. So, this is something we are developing.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; in terms of profitability, it's a service unlike any service and solution in Schneider, it's around I would say &#x2013; slightly below the average of the group, but with no CapEx or no capital engagements. So, this is what I can say. And as I was saying before, that kind of business is developing more &#x2013; is developing at double digit in an environment like in the U.S. which is depressed. But now we are developing those kinds of services all over the world, but very selectively because it's asks for very specific competency for highly trained people and we don't want to run into any risk, so we go selectively into the deployment of those solutions. On the austerity, while we are not the most &#x2013; the company that must engage with governments as you would know and certainly we would expect potentially some impact, now when you look at the reality of those cost cutting measures by the government, especially in Europe, I am not yet sure that it is too visible. So we expect the top of that market probably to be not as strong as one could expect, but we are not the most exposed company to that kind of &#x2013; part of the economy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Martin Wilkie from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. It's Martin Wilkie of Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions; firstly, on pricing, you said there is no real change to the pricing, but you are seeing more raw material inflation. I was wondering if you could just give us some sense if the price increases you might expect in a higher raw material environment are just essentially fair than if that's the first half of 2011 story, or are you seeing pushback from customers, and I am guessing there is probably more of evidence in utility markets, for example, but if you could just give us some sense of the outlook on pricing there? And then secondly, I appreciate you don't disclosed orders, but if you could just give us some sense of the trajectory of what you saw in Q2, did you see some of the strength that was very evident in the quarter continuing through to the end and therefore you are still very comfortable with the trajectory as we head into Q3? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Martin. On pricing, and we said very clearly that we were of course monitoring the situation regarding raw material price. After a surge &#x2013; a significant surge in raw material pricing in the beginning of 2010, we have seen pricing coming down a little bit and of course we are not back to the peak that we have experienced some time in 2008. Having said that, we are today of course on a market-by-market basis and depending on the situation trying to access the opportunity that we could have to increase prices. I will expect that some price increase will happen in H2, but I will expect impact of this price increase to be limited or to remain limited for the second half of 2010. But I would not say that we are facing pushback from the customers. I think that we have been clearly today focusing on recovering dynamism in our topline. We have achieved that. We, as we said expect, dynamism for the full-year 2010, now we start working on price and see on selective and case-by-case basis what we could do, taking into account this raw material impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. On your second question, the answer is that I confirm that we do not disclose orders. So &#x2013; but what I can say to you as a trend is that the orders are pretty much confirming the dynamics that you see on sales.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very clear. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll have time for one last question, and then we'll close today's section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got the last question from Mr. James Moore from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone; I have three. I wondered if you could help us on what you think the FX impact would be at current rates? Is it going to be more than the 61 in the first half, given dollar/euro and if so, how much? Secondly, the mix development, is it going to keep improving to a positive in the second half given the OE recovery or do you see that heading backwards? And then finally a more conceptual question just on the Smart Grid, I am just trying to be clear, is it that you're seeing more demand for the same products or are you selling incremental new products in technology? And could you quantify what Smart Grid is in revenue terms for you now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the ForEx, always it's very difficult to exercise because as you've probably noticed, the currency tend to vary quite a bit from one day to the other day. So always difficult to say what it could be for the full 2010. What I can tell you is that trying to assess what could be the global impact for our topline based on the current euro dollar parity or it's around 1.30 we get to a number which could be between 700 to &#x20AC;800 million positive impact for the full year. So we've already 250 in the first half but for the full year that could be anywhere between 700 and &#x20AC;800 million positive impact on the topline.</p>
          <p>Again, I am not saying that this will be the case, it's not a guidance. This can &#x2013; in two months from now the situation can be different, just to give you an idea of impact on topline based on the current rate that we are experiencing. On the EBIT, I am absolutely not in a position to give any guidance because the transactional consequences are just unforeseeable and therefore I won't try this exercise. You have seen that this has been positive in the first half and I am not able to confirm the importance of the positive impact on the bottom line of what I've described on the topline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the mix, always a complicated question. What we are going to see probably in H2 is more solutions. So we generate profitability which is slightly below, but at the same time we are going to see more rebound of power which is a good margin. So all of these components make the answer pretty complicated. I would say, probably in line with what we've seen but we are going to be far more intelligent at the end of the second half and be very clever in explaining what happens, okay.</p>
          <p>Anyway I don't see major disruption in the balance of the group, okay. On the Smart Grid, this is very interesting question. On the &#x2013; well, we see &#x2013; on the one side it creates new activities for us. Take two simple examples. Connecting the renewable is something totally new for the group. We were not there two years ago, it started with the acquisition of Xantrex and today it's already a significant activity in our business. We are working on the electric vehicle. It appears in our accounts. It's only cost, we don't see it, it's investment but the first revenues will happen from next year and we are in partnership with a certain number of partners, automotives, utilities. We have already our first pilots installed. That's not generating revenue, but it's going to be a new activity.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the Smart Grid will be a development of existing activities. There is no Smart Grid if you don't have smart buildings, smart homes, smart data centers, smart plants, things that we are doing today for our living and things that will be necessary, today they're kind of optional but tomorrow they would be necessary. If you want to benefit from the tariffs of utilities, you are going to have to make your building connected on Smart Grid ready. The building where I'm speaking from today is Smart Grid ready, is a grid suddenly, now the electricity is carbon intensive or carbon intense or it's expensive, I can shut off because it's automatic, automated, I can adapt this building to the grid. I can conclude new contracts with the utilities. I can discuss my contract with the utility because I know what I'm doing.</p>
          <p>So no Smart Grid without smart buildings, without smart homes, smart plans, smart data centers, and these are things that we are totally equipped to do. We do home automation, we do building automation, data center automation, construction automation and industry automation. And no Smart Grid without a flexible grid and it's going to be very difficult to operate. This is &#x2013; there is no compatibility between the two sides and we are one of the very companies in the world that can ensure this compatibility.</p>
          <p>So yes, it will catalyze, it will foster more sales of what we are doing. It will enrich also in the sense of putting more functionalities on what we are doing and we are largely working into it, into the cost structure architecture, we make sure that everything can be controlled, terminated and connected. Now you're asking me, what is the turnover that you do in the Smart Grid, I would say that everything we do in Schneider is participating to the Smart Grid. Look at the development of our solutions, look at the development of what we do in automation, in renewables tomorrow in the electrical vehicle. We are going to try to isolate that, but it's going to be always difficult. I mean take a building lightings, yes, it's automated.</p>
          <p>What is the part which is rated to the automation, everything is integrated. I mean we can't do an intelligent building if the breakers are not intelligent, and for us the breaker which is intelligent is not at all just an animal as a breaker of yesterday. So, it's a factor of a new functionalities responding to new needs of our customers. And we are at the forefront of those technologies and it's &#x2013; tell you, for somebody who has worked for almost 25 years in the industry I have never seen so much potential of changes, but positive changes in what we are doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To follow-up on that, what proportion of your products that you sell today are old-style analogue and what are new style intelligent digital Smart Grid-esque and how is that mixing, because that seems to be where the importance is for your future revenue and margin potential?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I recognize your &#x2013; I recognize you. Well I, it's &#x2013; now most of the breakers I would say are before you go to the absolutely terminal level are all electronics. If you need our electronics below &#x2013; you have to come below 100 amps, not to have electronics in what we sell. So it's &#x2013; the old thing has become very electronic, I mean the drives are electronic, the UPS are electronics, can be connected to breakers.</p>
          <p>While I don't want to bore you with technical things are electronic, on our connectible, now are they connected, in many cases, no, but they are able to be connected or they can be connected. And I can't answer properly to your question. But in what we sell, I would say most of what we sell today is electronic. Just refer to our R&amp;D, R&amp;D today is 60%, more than 60% is electronics and software, which is a big change from where we were 10 years ago.</p>
