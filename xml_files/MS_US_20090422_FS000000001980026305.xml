      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we will review our quarterly results and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. We've been firm in our view that 2009 would be a year of transition and the first quarter reflects that cautious view. For the calendar quarter-ended March 31, we reported a net loss of 57 cents per share. Excluding the impact of Morgan Stanley's debt-related credit spreads, earnings per share would have been positive $0.37. While the rebound in our bond prices drove the loss this quarter, this movement demonstrate the market's confidence in Morgan Stanley's financial strength is an important validation of our franchise.</p>
          <p>As you know, the first quarter was punctuated by ongoing government policy to promote market stability. While these efforts have had some positive impact, economic conditions are still uncertain. Our economists forecast a base case contraction in world GDP of roughly 2% for 2009, the first decline in more than 60 years. Market conditions continued to be erratic in the quarter, and real estate markets deteriorated significantly around the world.</p>
          <p>Morgan Stanley is a strong beneficiary of the changing competitive landscape as a dominant industry participant with robust capital levels. We are well positioned for a recovery in the global capital markets and are not limited by a large loan portfolio or direct consumer exposure. Already we are experiencing better pricing and market share gains across our principal businesses, resulting in good operating earnings this quarter.</p>
          <p>As we navigate these markets, we are executing on a number of strategic initiatives to position us for outperformance. Within Institutional Securities, we continue to target our capital on a risk-adjusted basis while we remain focused on reducing legacy positions.</p>
          <p>In March, we signed a memorandum of understanding with MUFG to combine our Japanese securities businesses creating the third largest brokerage franchise in Japan with dominant market presence and global reach. The MUFG joint venture will form a preeminent leader in both M&amp;A and debt financing with full year pro forma 2008 operating revenues of $2.5 billion. This partnership underscores our strong global commitment on our goal of continuing to realize attractive growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>In January, as you're well aware, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Smith Barney, creating the largest wealth management firm. The integration is on schedule and we expect the deal to close in the third quarter '09 if not sooner.</p>
          <p>Asset Management continues to be constrained by poor performance and the downturn in real estate. Turning around this business remains a top priority. We are upgrading investment talent, and have implemented a number of cost initiatives.</p>
          <p>In November, we committed to $2 billion in firm-wide cost savings for 2009. In the first quarter we made significant progress towards achieving this goal. Compensation expense excluding severance was down 47% from a year ago as we managed compensation to reflect the lower revenue environment as well as significant head count reductions. We reduced non compensation expenses by 9% from a year ago driven by lower brokerage and clearing expenses from lower activity and tighter expense controls around professional services and business development globally.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our consolidated results, we continued to demonstrate strength in our industry leading businesses, including commodities, foreign exchange, interest rates, equity derivatives, investment banking and Global Wealth Management. In accordance with SEC guidelines we re-casted 2008 to a calendar year. This enhanced disclosure facilitates comparisons across quarters and amongst our bank holding company peers. This quarter we are providing even greater transparency in our financial supplement by, including firm-wide real estate investment exposures and their corresponding P&amp;L impact, tangible common equity, a currently popular measure, and tangible book value per share.</p>
          <p>Turning to page two in our financial supplement, firm-wide revenues are $3 billion, including the negative impact of $1.5 billion from the tightening of Morgan Stanley's credit spreads on certain long-term debt carried at fair value. Net losses on firm-wide real estate investments aggregated a billion dollars, which had a sizeable impact on our results.</p>
          <p>Whilst results from the quarter reflect mark-to-market volatility, Morgan Stanley operates and will continue to operate under fair-value accounting rules using conservative assumptions. We believe fair-value accounting provides the best assessment of our business, both in terms of our results and balance sheet. And whilst we did not early adopt the provisions of FASB Staff Position 157-4, we do not expect any impact on our application of mark-to-market accounting upon adoption in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to page three in the financial supplement, you will see that after significantly reducing our balance sheet in 2008, total assets declined to $626 billion at March 31, of which $152 billion is our liquidity pool. Nearly one quarter of our balance sheet was in cash and cash equivalents this quarter, and although this creates a noticeable drag to our earnings, we believe that maintaining a strong liquidity position is currently the most prudent approach. Our capital ratios demonstrate the exceptional strength of our balance sheet. This quarter we moved to Basel I under Fed guidelines. While we are still finalizing our calculations, we believe our tier one ratio under Basel I will be 16.4%. Excluding TARP capital, our ratio would be 12.9%. The risk weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $287 billion at March 31.</p>
          <p>The tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 4.3% in the first quarter. As you can see in our supplement on page three, this ratio has continually improved over the last five consecutive quarters. Additionally, our tangible common equity to risk weighted asset ratio was 9.3%.</p>
          <p>The absolute level of our Level 3 assets was down at March 31, and represents approximately 11% of total assets, but clearly that is on a much smaller balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Our funding strategy remains to increase the stable share of funding to roughly 50% of total assets, as we further diversify both our sources of funding and our business mix. This quarter, we continued to make significant progress towards achieving this goal. At the end of the first quarter, we were at 44%, up from 36% at November month-end. The increase was primarily driven by firm-wide deposits, which was $60 billion at quarter-end, up from 43 billion at November month-end.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the businesses. Starting with Institutional Securities, detailed on page five of the supplement, revenues of 1.7 billion include the negative impact of credit spreads discussed earlier. In additional, principal investment revenues were negative $791 million, the majority of which relates to writedowns in real estate limited partnership interests. Non-interest expenses were $2.1 billion in the first quarter '09, 34% below the average quarter in 2008. Inclusive of the impact of Morgan Stanley's debt-related credit spreads, the business reported a pre-tax loss of $434 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to investment banking on page six. Notwithstanding the challenging market conditions, our franchise remained active and delivered a strong performance. We experienced a strong improvement in market share resulting in top rankings of the league tables across a number of categories. We were number one in announced global M&amp;A, our consistent measurement, and advised the largest M&amp;A transactions to the industry, including Pfizer's acquisition of Wyeth, Merck's acquisition of Schering-Plough, and Rio Tinto's strategic relationship with Chinalco. We led the reopening of the IPO market with Mead Johnson, the first since November and largest since April 2008. Significant underwriting transactions included concurrent covenant and convertible debt offerings for Alcoa and Auto Lift and GE's Capital's unsecured debt offering.</p>
          <p>The capital markets have remained active in April, and we continue to lead significant deals. For instance, we led the IPO for Rosetta Stone, which is the first to price above its filing range in a year. Convertible issuance has had a strong start, and we are currently number one in the global convertible league tables. In the debt markets, Morgan Stanley led offerings, including CrownCastle, the largest sole-managed high yield bond since November '07, and a bond offering for Rio Tinto, which is one of the largest investment grade transactions in the second quarter thus, far.</p>
          <p>First quarter investment banking revenues of $812 million were up 33% from the fourth quarter of last year both driven by increases in all products and regions. Advisory revenues increased 12% sequentially on strength in the US and Asia, even though overall market M&amp;A volumes remain subdued.</p>
          <p>Equity underwriting revenues were up 14% from the fourth quarter, driven by rights issue activity in Europe. Fixed income underwriting revenues more than doubled on increased investment grade bond issuance and loan fees. Equity sales and trading revenue of 877 million were negatively impacted by $555 million from the narrowing of debt related credit spreads on firm issued structured notes.</p>
          <p>Prime brokerage core revenues and period end client balances were relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter, reflecting a stabilization of this business. Revenues were flat, driven by a shift in balance mix despite a decline in average client balances. This decrease was in line with the overall contraction of the hedge fund industry. However, client balances of our top 50 accounts increased 10% in the first quarter of '09, and have continued to grow in April. Our industry-leading prime brokerage platform continues to provide innovative client solutions, such as our Tripod eTrust structures.</p>
          <p>Cash equity revenues were down 10% from last quarter driven by lower market volumes and notionals in Europe. Derivatives reported a solid quarter on continued volatility although client activity remained lower than 2008 levels and quantitative strategies were a positive contributor in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Fixed income sales and trading revenues of 1.3 billion were reduced by 980 million dollars from the narrowing of credit spreads on firm-issued structured notes. Excluding this. Fixed income demonstrated strength across all businesses relative to 2008.</p>
          <p>Commodities reported one of its best quarters on wider margins and healthy customer activity driving broad-based strength across all segments and regions. Trading revenues were strong across all desks.</p>
          <p>Interest rate credit and currency trading revenues combined were up substantially from the last quarter on strong volumes. Interest rate products reported an exceptional quarter on higher volumes and wider spreads; revenues were up over 150% for the quarterly average of last year.</p>
          <p>Currencies had a strong quarter benefiting from market volatility and strong customer activity.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets recorded losses on the continued deterioration of the Eastern European credit market. Credit trading reported very strong positive results, compared to a loss in the fourth quarter reflecting higher customer activity levels and favorable positioning on credit spreads.</p>
          <p>Detailed on pages 14, 15, and 16 of the financial supplement are our mortgage related gross and net exposures. On page 14 you'll see that we have streamlined our presentation given the remaining magnitude of our US subprime exposures. Simply put, all information previously contained on this analysis have been aggregated into one schedule. We have combined our ABS CDO subprime positions with the investment grade rated subprime exposures in our subsidiary banks. Our super senior mezzanine net exposure remains zero. The 300 million loss was driven entirely by the investment portfolio in our large subsidiary banks included within other sales and trading. On page 15, within non- subprime residential mortgage, we reduced our gross exposure by 8% and our net exposure by 18% from December. These exposures include Alt-A, which declined further to $1.2 billion. Overall net writedowns on losses were 200 million.</p>
          <p>On page 16 within CMBS commercial home loans, our gross exposure remained relatively unchanged. Whilst we reduced aggregate commercial loans, CMBS bonds and warehouse lines on a gross basis by 15%, our total net exposure increased as we continued to take CMBS directional positioning as we have informed you in the previous two quarters. Overall, we recorded a net gain of $600 million.</p>
          <p>Other sales and trading revenues of negative 808 million were primarily driven by our lending businesses which includes leverage acquisition finance and relationship lending. Net losses here were $437 million. We continue to reduce our non investment grade leverage acquisition portfolio, which is now 4.2 billion, as you can see in the footnote on page seven of the financial supplement. Also included in other sales and trading are losses of approximately $200 million from the investment portfolio in our subsidiary banks. This includes losses of 300 million related to subprime securities that I mentioned earlier, partly offset by gains of $100 million in non subprime securities.</p>
          <p>Total average trading and non-trading value at risk (VaR) increased to $142 million from $129 million in the fourth quarter. Trading VaR increased to 115 from 105 primarily driven by higher levels of market volatility. Non-trading VaR increased to 83 million from 66 million driven by widening credit spreads on higher spread volatility.</p>
          <p>Turning to the page eight of the supplement and our Global Wealth Management business, revenues were stable despite the slowdown in the retail market. Those revenues of 1.3 billion increased 2% from the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting an increase in principal trading revenues partly offset by lower commissions and fees. Principal trading revenues were higher primarily due to strong fixed income trading activity. Non-interest expenses were relatively flat sequentially, excluding $177 million of expenses related to auction rate securities in the fourth quarter of last year. Progress from our cost reduction initiatives was offset by higher compensation expenses.</p>
          <p>Profit before tax was $119 million and the PBT margin was 9% for the quarter, but excluding approximately 39 million of our JV related integration costs, PBT margin was actually 12%.</p>
          <p>On page 9 you can see the productivity metrics. Total client assets decreased five percent market levels continued to decline during the quarter. Net new assets were $3 billion, while bank deposits grew substantially over last quarter to 47 billion as clients moved more of their assets to cash. The number of FAs was down slightly for the quarter as we hired fewer trainees in anticipation of the joint venture with Smith Barney.</p>
          <p>Turning to Asset Management on page 10 of the supplement, Asset Management had a pre-tax loss of $559 million driven by investment losses within Merchant Banking and a $310 million pre-tax loss on credit. Core Asset Management revenues returned to profitability in the first quarter. Revenues increased substantially from last quarter, due to lower investment losses and gains from sales. Management and administration fees declined resulting from lower average assets under management.</p>
          <p>Merchant Banking revenues were negative by $319 million. They included principal investment losses of $374 million in real estate, including $99 million on Crescent financial assets and $56 million from private equity investments. Non-interest expenses for Asset Management decreased 24% from the fourth quarter of last year and included a $131 million dollar impairment charge related to Crescent. Excluding Crescent impairment charges in both quarters, non compensation expenses declined 38%, sequentially driven by our cost reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Turning to pages 11 and 12 of the supplement, you can see the assets under management and asset flow data. Total assets under management decreased 12% to $356 billion during the quarter on a continued decline in global financial markets and net asset outflows. Virtually all of the quarterly outflows were in our core business, primarily from fixed income funds which include our money market funds. Equity performance has had a significant rebound for US and global growth strategies year-to-date and we continue to see good long-term performance in small cap, large cap value and international equities.</p>
          <p>We have also seen significant improvements year-to-date in the global fixed income performance against our peer group. This improvement is largely due to restructuring the portfolios, and some key staffing changes.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we are providing additional disclosure on our firm-wide real estate exposures on page 17 of the supplement. Our total real estate gross exposure as reflected on our statement of financial condition, which includes Crescent and other consolidated interests, directs investments in real estate &#x2013; direct investments in real estate and infrastructure funds and bridge financing was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter, including $1.9 billion of contractual commitments, our total exposure would be $6.8 billion. This exposure excludes assets and investments for the benefit of certain deferred employee compensation or co-investment plans.</p>
          <p>On page 19 of the financial supplement we have reported the results for the month of December. We reported a net loss from continuing operations of $1.62 per share. As you know, December was particularly difficult for the industry, as the extreme market conditions experienced in November extended into December. The loss was principally due to fixed income sales and trading losses specifically in credit products and leverage lending. Along with extreme movements in our debt related credit spreads, trading losses in November and December drove the dramatic swing in our recast results which you will see in the supplement between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>Q1 '09 results include a $331 million income tax benefit resulting from the repatriation of non-US earnings at tax rates lower than those previously estimated. Excluding this, the effective tax rate was 41%.</p>
          <p>Preferred dividends and other related charges of $401 million reduced earnings by approximately $0.40 in the first quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>The Board of Directors approved the reduction of our quarterly dividend to 5 cents from 27 cents, enhancing our already strong capital position.</p>
          <p>Now just a few words on the outlook. Global financial markets are in the midst of a profound cyclical and structural change which will likely continue through 2009. While banks have made significant progress in deleveraging, the process of consumer deleveraging will take time. In order to move towards a constructive environment, we must see a deceleration in credit related losses and a significant reduction in funding costs. Government coordination globally is critical in accomplishing this.</p>
          <p>We are uniquely positioned to benefit from the changes transforming our industry. Despite near term headwinds, we are gaining market share and executing on our strategy. Institutional Securities remains core to the franchise, with a range of industry leading benefits &#x2013; businesses benefiting from market share gains and improved pricing power. The Morgan Stanley/Smith Barney joint venture is a game changer. It contributes the quality and diversification of our earnings and is a significant differentiator of our distribution network and we are confident we can fix Asset Management. While we remain cautious, we are capitalizing on our dominant position for long-term outperformance. We are one of the only financial intermediaries with the scale, global footprint and range of capital markets expertise sought by institutional and retail clients worldwide. And with that, I would now take your questions. Thank you for listening.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question will come from the line of Mike Mayo [Calyon Securities]. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you comment on your appetite on returning TARP capital, if you're able to do it, are you ready to do it and do you think you'll be able to do it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First let me say that our Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel I is 16.4%. Excluding TARP capital it's 12.9%. Our tangible common equity to risk-weighted asset ratio is 9.3%. We are more than comfortable with all these numbers. Having said that, we await the results of a stress test and guidance from our regulators as to what they will permit us to do. This is a topic of great debate at this point by many parties and much comment has been made. All that we will say is that at the completion of the stress assessment, if permitted and supported by our supervisors, we would like to consider the repayment of TARP capital. We would like to repay TARP capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, a separate question on potential structural changes that you have. You ramped up deposits you said from 43 to 60 billion. What's your appetite in buying say a regional bank? And then, separately, your joint venture with Smith Barney, it looks like Smith Barney had 40 billion of client outflows in the first quarter. How do you think about that, if your partner might not be as strong as you thought before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are two very different questions there Mike, so let me deal with them. Our retail banking strategy is very much a function of being supplementary and complementary to what we're doing in Global Wealth Management. It needs to feed into a high net worth strategy which we've been consistent on. So of course, we will look at things that fit into that strategy, right? So I think that answers question one and we've been quite clear on it. On the Smith Barney, they clearly are having some attrition, but if I look at the Barron's survey of the top hundred FAs, we have, you know, of the top hundred FAs, we have a huge amount of those or 33 of those are actually Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney. I think at the top ten, eight are Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney. So there will be some attrition at the lower levels. We look at the top quintiles, and so on. What we're absolutely confident about is that when you merge these institutions together you will get the synergies and economies that we spoke about and you will get incremental profit margin because it is a scale business. So you would expect some attrition in the merger, but the attrition we are seeing is not of concern to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Kion Aubuchon from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. The first question is regarding your number of shares. Can you just explain the increase quarter on quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's significant at all. There will be some employee &#x2013; let me just have a look at that. Period end shares, there's a little bit from EICP programs that were coming through, but I have &#x2013; it's 107.4 was December '08 and we're 108.1 now. So it's all EICP-related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the mark-to-market of your real estate writedowns, can you discuss how we should look at that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well mark-to-market as you know, Kion is mark-to-market. I can't give predictive valuations. The only way I would discuss it is that there are a few issues. First of all, Crescent is a fully consolidated subsidiary. Our results include all of the revenues and expenses there. That includes impairment, sales of certain assets, and so on. Remember that I previously told that you approximately 90 cent plus of Crescent, which is in the schedule, their assets are held at cost, which is subject to depreciation unless we have impairments on the sales, and so on. On the rest of it, which is fair value, we do that on the test disposals, and so on. So, we've given you a schedule that gives you all of those real estate exposures. In terms of &#x2013; all I can say about &#x2013; I'm confident that the valuations as of March 31 are in line with what we've given you, the exposure we're giving you, and you then make your own assessments going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the movement of revenues, can you talk a little bit about months on months in fixed income and equities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. You mean the trend of revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, January was the strong month, February was less strong but pretty fine and we were not comfortable predicting the quarter at that point because we'd seen volatility in the past and March was a weak month. And as you know, you tend to get path of things being set at the end of certain months, in this case, at the end of March. We had some recovery on the back of the big TARP announcements, but up to that point it was very thin volume.</p>
          <p>What I do &#x2013; can say is that our customer volumes were robust across most asset classes and showed signs of increasing market share through the period.</p>

          <p>And can you give us an idea of how much of the first quarter revenues in fixed income equities was related to hedging or prop gains, and some of it I assume coming back from the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing came back from the fourth quarter. As far as I'm concerned our core operating revenues are very much a function of flow. And I didn't get anything specific from hedging gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. You talked a little bit about the CMBS revenues, but I just wanted to drill in on that a bit more. You generated about $1.5 billion in net revenues from your hedges in the quarter if I interpret the table correctly after making about 2.5 billion on that last year, clearly good risk management results which made the CRE P&amp;L positive in both periods. But I also noticed that you reduced your overall hedging in the quarter by about 2 billion, and as a result, as I think you alluded to, your net CRE position did bump up at the end of the period. Maybe you can talk a little bit about in particular, the reduction in the hedges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's interpretive. As I said, to you in previous quarters, while we were actually managing down our gross exposure in CMBS, the bombs loads and the warehouse line's line down 15% at March 31. With the widening spread to the volatility we saw in the marketplace, we've actually acted upon opportunities within these asset classes to take directional positions from which we benefited, and I think I alerted you last year to the fact that that schedule would show trading activity, and you would have to look at it on a line-by-line item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, fair enough. I just wanted to follow up on that and make sure that I understood that correctly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is trading at fair value, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I also noticed that real estate equity exposure on the P&amp;L &#x2013; sorry, I noticed that your real estate equity exposure only fell by about 200 million even though the P&amp;L was a negative 1 billion. Are you actively adding to your exposure in funds in Crescent, or is there something else that would explain that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the combination of losses recognized, partly offset by additional investments, and we disclose our commitments during the quarter &#x2013; principally those committed capital calls by the funds has kept that balance relatively consistent between December 31 and March 31. So we actually do show you the disclosure and the commitments, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That makes sense. On fixed income and maybe I'm not really looking at this the right way, but if I do a quick adjustment of your fixed income revenues by aggregating the other, which as I think you pointed out, is largely credit portfolio, and then, adding back the related fair value of the debt mark and all the other identified marks that you gave us in the quarter, and if I compare it to similarly adjusted figures for your main competitors, it still seems like you're running significantly lower than Goldman, Citi, or JPMorgan. And I'm wondering, despite the fact that you say you're seeing improvement in market share, whether there's something in terms of risk appetite or something else which might be driving that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely. It is about risk appetite. Look at our VaR numbers, which are significantly lower. Look at our balance sheet. I mean, we did not see on a risk-adjusted return basis this quarter, the sort of opportunities that others may or may not have seen. We have been clear that we will take risk when we think the risk adjusted return appetite warrants that, and that is reflected in VaR numbers, balance sheet, and positions. What I can tell you is we know what our market shares are, and we feel comfortable in making the statements we've made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair. And just finally, one update. Do you have an update on the pro forma impact of the Smith Barney joint venture on book value and tangible book value per share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, we are currently at the end of the quarter, tangible book value per share, 24.65. We think that tangible book pro forma would be 22.20. But our book value per share would go from 27.35 to 28.99.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. First, could you provide us with where your marks stand for commercial real estate, residential real estate, and levered loans at the end of the March quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, CMBS bonds are trade &#x2013; are marked in the mid-40s. Mezzanine commercial loans are marked in the low 50s. Alt-As are marked in the mid-20s. Subprime, ABS, CDO, mezzanines in the low teens and legacy, last &#x2013; leveraged finance, acquisition finance portfolio loans are valued in the low 60s. Have I missed anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that covers it all from my end. Thanks, and then, Colm, could you provide us with respect to the December sub some more detail on the magnitude of the debt spread gains and potential writedowns that you may have taken in that month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Basically it's a billion dollars of writedowns between leverage lending writedowns and mezzanine commercial mortgage writedowns, and then, we had the best part of 300 million dollars in DVA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, finally, from my end, how should we think about compensation accrual going forward? I know there was a bunch of moving parts to the P&amp;L this quarter. And just wanted to get your sense of how that maybe smoothes out or changes over the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, I mean, in compensation we look at a predictive basis on how we're going to pay people during the year, right? So consistent with our policy, our compensation accrual is a result of our best estimate of compensation at year-end considering our results, market environment and accrued based upon quarterly revenue. Now, so this quarter we're expecting the trajectory of our revenues to improve during the year. We are comfortable that we will pay competitively based on the market; obviously, estimating compensation has been difficult. So away from that, is there anything else you want to know?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Is that a condition of repaying TARP?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No? Okay. And secondly, why would you issue the non-guaranteed debt presumably if that's at the higher cost of funding? Are you running out of capacity there or is it just -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not actually. If anything, I have excess liquidity, Steve. The issue is really a signaling thing. We need to get the unsecured markets reopened. There have only been two deals done by two competitors. And people are obviously paying, as you're intimating, relatively high spreads for that. But I think it's important to show that the unsecured markets will reopen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, and then, in your prepared remarks just lastly, you mentioned the deleveraging of the consumer, and presumably that's baked into your expectations for the joint venture. How should we think about that impact on the retail brokerage unit? Is it just a matter of the mix of assets, what investors will choose to invest in, or is it lower assets under management, how should we think about that phenomena?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is baked. I mean, it's certainly baked into the consideration we paid as a price. But actually, the attraction of the Global Wealth Management business is that it's an economy of scale. The more scale you have, the more you can reduce your cost basis and you can actually get attractive PBT margins on that base. So we have forecasted reduction in revenues, but it's more than offset by the economies of scale itself.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple of little questions. First, as I noticed, there's sort of a shift out of net interest income into trading income it looks like, and I was wondering especially with the extra free funds, as it were, from the preferred going up, I would have thought net interest income all things being equal should have been higher, and I was wondering, is there something to that, is there a fundamental reason for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's really &#x2013; the problem is that we're a strange animal. We're not a bank. And you know, as we're moving towards being a bank &#x2013; I mean, we are a bank, don't get me wrong, we're a bank holding company, but the core of our business is institutional securities, so you would not see similar trends from a commercial bank. And I think that's something we just have to try and explain a bit more, but nothing untoward in that at all, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then also, you talked before about interest in acquiring a branch system. Can you talk about your appetite for assuming credit risk and a big loan portfolio in any kind of acquisition like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We haven't spoken about an interest in acquisition of a branch system. We actually have a branch system of a thousand branches on a pro forma basis with Smith Barney. What we've spoken about is that we will acquire things, insofar as they add to our high net worth strategy within Global Wealth Management. But we're really not in the business of adding to loan exposures, except for what will support our existing business and clearly defined strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good, and then, finally, the tax rate of 41%, is that something we should be using going forward, or was that abnormally high, and why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is our best guess of where we are at the moment, based upon our regional spread of revenues, and you know, other tax planning strategies we've been doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of Roger Freeman from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Colm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Roger, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks. Just wanted to come back to elaborate on a few other questions that have been asked. So I guess first, within fixed income trading, how do you think about sort of your risk taking appetite going forward? It sounds like you may move to a more, you know, more risk loving position, shall we say, in subsequent quarters if markets improve. But actually the gist of the question here is, how much risk actually had to be taken this quarter to make money because a lot of what we hear is that you know, which is why bid/ask spreads and decent client flow generated pretty healthy profits, and it really wasn't about taking a lot of risks. Any thoughts around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I would just repeat what I've said earlier, Roger, and I don't want to call anybody else, it's a question of interpretation. If I look at our market share, which we can measure on various markets, we've gained market share in fixed income markets broadly. I mean, we see that in investment grade credits, we see that in interest rate flow, we see that in commodities, and so on, right? So we certainly are getting our share and an increasing share in the flow businesses. We are prepared to take more risk to support our client businesses, but it has not impacted our share of the flow in our opinion. So moving forward, when we feel on a risk adjusted basis, it warrants taking more risk we will do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, and then, I guess in the equities business, can you comment on some of the things that contributed to some weaker spots there? You know, you mention equities volumes being down, I mean, actually equities volumes were up 4% sequentially from the fourth quarter. I guess, is that a comment about the flow you saw across your desk? I know more flow -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's more about the flow across our desk; it's also really a comment on the absence of hedge funds in the market to a large extent and the prime brokerage revenues. Prime brokerage revenues have traditionally been a reasonable chunk of our business. As you know, we're resizing that business. Our market share has slipped; we said at the end of the third quarter earnings call, we were moving away from a market share strategy to a much more contiguous strategy and that's what we're doing. And as I've said, we've seen evidence that our balance is from our strategic or contiguous clients are coming back up. So I expect that that will improve over time within a resized prime brokerage business, given the constraints of our balance sheet, which we've also been clear about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you say the balances there earlier were actually flat sequentially in prime brokerage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, pretty much flat sequentially. But what's interesting is, in the end of March and beginning of April, we started seeing increases in those balances from our major accounts. Now, our balances were flat, but you've got to see that in the context of a market where in the first quarter there were significant redemptions from hedge funds. That would seem to imply that relative to the market, we were increasing share from our low point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, given the net &#x2013; the marks that you just disclosed in I think Howard's question, what are your thoughts about selling into the PPIP securities program, if that gets off the ground? Looks to me like you could make some money off that. Most people seem to be saying they're not going to sell into this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't know at the moment what to do because we're unclear with the circumstances and the conditions surrounding those programs. And we actually applaud the initiatives of the regulators and the Treasury to get these programs up and running but there's been a certain degree of confusion coming into the market about what are the implications of using these programs either as a buyer or a seller. So frankly, we have to wait and see what those implications are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, just lastly, to come back to commercial real estate. I'm a little confused, I guess Crescent is where most of your actual equity in real estate investments is like office, multifamily, et cetera is, and the marks there are very light it sounds like because you carry investments at cost. I guess my question there is, tell me if I'm wrong about that, but I guess my question is, what do you think the difference in the value on a fair market basis is from where you're carrying at, and are there refinancings coming up inside those portfolios on those properties this year that would force to you take impairments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't foresee those. Possibly. Number one, Crescent remember has, we've shown you the gross. There's a non-recourse financing against that, so our net exposure where I allow to speak in those terms is significantly smaller. We have taken impairments and writedowns where we can. In our LP commitments, they are what they are, the 1.9 billion we referred to, and everything else we've disclosed you, the gross and as always with real estate you have got to be aware or one has to be aware that there's always refinancing risk. So we're dealing with those accordingly and we're disclosing as much as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thanks.</p>

          <p>I'm very good, thank you. Roger asked a lot of my questions, but I wanted to take then an opportunity to ask you about the Wealth Management division. So you have an option to buy original bank or are you fully at maximum capacity with respect to your Wealth Management business because there are going to be obviously assets for sale. That's another way of generating deposits, and then, the follow on to that is are you gaining share there? Does anything have to do with the Switzerland, US tax issues and can you elaborate on the competitive market specifically to attracting brokers?</p>

          <p>I think, look, yes, I think first of all, let's begin, we're going to be the largest wealth manager by certain measures anyway and we think that that will give us significant profitability. So if you remember in the fourth quarter we lost some FAs. It's clear now that we've got net new money coming in, $3 billion. It's clear that we are attracting high quality people, and you see that from the Barron's survey of quality of people that we have. So we actually think that we are very well positioned. As I said, in my comments it's a game changer and we are now getting a lot of interesting people coming to us. You're absolutely right, there was a period where one of the firms was attracting head count on various deals. I think that that has stopped or slowed. And I think the market is in flux. But we're pretty comfortable with our dominant position where we are and what we now need to do is to optimize it. In terms of deposits, as you know, in a pro forma basis slewing off a signature amount of deposits, and we've given the liability strategy about how much deposits feed into our network. But I want to repeat something on deposits again. Deposits are only useful insofar as you can use them, right? So what we have to do is continue to convert, you know, you know, grow our bank, move eligible activities into our bank and that will dictate the pace to which we can grow further deposits.</p>

          <p>Okay. I guess I'm just going to re-ask my question, which it seems like the economics of a wealth management model.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, good morning. I just have a question on the structured credit notes which are getting marked. Can you give us the size of the portfolio that is getting marked and how that's changed since the start of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The portfolio's continuing to run off. In our Level 3 disclosure at the end of November I think we showed you a gross size from memory of about 28 billion. Not all of those are fair valued but the great majority of them are. The average duration is about 3.5 years and I think you can probably work it from it that if that's okay Richard.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's very helpful. And is there a specific hedging policy as well in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've looked at hedging DVA. As you know, it's GAAP earnings. I don't think there's any real correlation for that. The problem is that our spread has been very volatile and that's why we don't hedge it, which is why we've always disclosed it.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Okay. That's great. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered but maybe just follow up on the DVA. Is there any ability to buy back debt at discounts to kind of lock in the gains that we saw in the fourth quarter? Obviously they've recovered in value a decent amount but I still think they're trading below par or are you constrained by TARP and other things from doing buy backs like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a very good question. You are constrained under the terms of TLGP from buying back debt other than from normal debt defense, and so on. But also you've got to look at these structured notes. You know, you have to make a market in terms of debt defense. The nature of these structured notes are primarily small investors who buy them with embedded options, and so on. So it's not like doing a tender for a public bond issue.</p>
