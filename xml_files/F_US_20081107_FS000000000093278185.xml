          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford Motor Co. third quarter earnings conference call. My name is Katina , and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this presentation. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to our host for today's call, Ms. Lillian Etzkorn, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katina , and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning. With me this morning are Alan Mulally, President and CEO, and Lewis Booth, chief financial officer. Also in the room are Peter Daniel, Senior Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Treasurer; Mark Kosman, Director of Accounting; and K.R. Kent, Ford Credit CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to review a couple of quick items. Copies of this morning's earnings release and the slides that we will be using today have been posted on Ford's Investor and Media websites for your reference. The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our form 10-Q for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call are reconciled to their GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. Additional information about the factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors are also detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the presentation over to Alan Mulally, Ford's President and CEO.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lillian, and good morning. As you all know, the global auto industry is facing unprecedented challenges. The turbulence in the worldwide economy continues to undermine consumer confidence and impact our business, as do the tight credit markets. In the U.S., October marked the lowest industry sales rate in 25 years. Vehicle demand is down substantially in Europe and in Asia as well.</p>
          <p>While Ford has been dramatically affected by the difficult business environment, we remain absolutely convinced that we have the right plan and are taking the right actions to weather this difficult period and emerge as a leading globally integrated company, poised for long-term profitable growth. In these challenging times, our plan is more important than ever: aggressively restructure the business, accelerate the development of vehicles people want and need, finance our plan and improve our balance sheet and work together as one team leveraging our global assets. While the third quarter was extremely difficult, we continue to show progress against our plan. Among the highlights for Ford in the third quarter was the launch of the new Ford F-150 in North America and the Ford Fiesta in Europe, which will be the first of Ford's new global small cars.</p>
          <p>I will start off today by providing you with an overview of last quarter's results and our recent accomplishments. Lewis Booth, our new Chief Financial Officer, will take us through the details and provide an outlook for the rest of 2008. I will then detail the significant actions we are announcing today to reduce our cost structure, reserve cash and manage our business with absolute discipline. While these actions are difficult, they are absolutely necessary to ensure we have the liquidity necessary to execute our plan to transform Ford into a profitably growing enterprise for all of our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide three, I'll review the key financial results for the third quarter. As shown at the top of the slide, vehicle wholesales last quarter were about 1.2 million units, down 313,000 from the same period in 2007. Ford's third quarter revenue was 32.1 billion down nine billion from a year ago. The decline reflects lower volume, the sale of Jaguar Land Rover, unfavorable product mix and lower net pricing, partly offset by favorable exchanges &#x2013; changes in the currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Ford's third quarter pre-tax operating loss from continuing operations, excluding special items was 2.7 billion, over 2.9 billion worse than a year ago. This reduction included 2.5 billion in automotive and about 400 million at financial services. Our third quarter net loss was 129 million, including over 2.2 billion of favorable pre-tax special items, more than explained by the retiree health care curtailment gain related to the VEBA agreement with the UAW. This will be discussed in more detail by Lewis. We ended the quarter with 18.9 billion of cash, and we will discuss this further in detail.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide four, North America incurred an operating loss of 2.6 billion during the third quarter. This loss was about 1.6 billion worse than 2007, more than explained by lower volume and unfavorable production mix. We saw continued strong performance from Ford South America with an operating profit of 480 million up from 386 million a year ago. Ford Europe profitability is down versus a year ago reflecting declined economic conditions. Global incurred a 458 million operating loss compared with a loss of 167 million a year ago. This decline was more than explained by unfavorable volume and mix and exchange. Ford Asia Pacific, Africa and Mazda were each about even. Financial Services had a 159 million operating profit.</p>
          <p>Overall we reduced our costs by 300 million despite commodity cost increases of more than one billion. North America remains on track to achieve or exceed our $5 billion cost reduction goal by the end of 2008 compared with 2005.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide five, we launched two new vehicles during the last quarter. The new 2009 Ford F-150 full-size pickup was launched in North America, the number one selling truck in America for 31 years running with best in class capability and unsurpassed fuel economy. In Europe we launched a new Ford Fiesta, the first of Ford's new global small cars. Production began in Cologne, Germany, and the car is now going on sale in Europe. Fiesta also is beginning to now go on sale in Asia and will be introduced in North America in early 2010.</p>
          <p>We debuted at the Paris Air Show the all new Ford Ka, a stylish subcompact car that goes on sale in Europe late this year and is featured in the new James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace; launched the Ford Focus in China and Ford Escape in key Asia Pacific and Africa markets.</p>
          <p>Slide six details some of our key business accomplishments this quarter. We improved the vehicle quality again, marked four consecutive years of progress. Ford Lincoln Mercury vehicles collectively reduced things gone wrong by 7.7% compared to last year, pulling into a statistical tie with Honda and Toyota, atop the list of seven major automakers in the U.S. Global Quality Research System study.</p>
          <p>We achieved a leading number of Top Safety Picks from the U.S. Insurance Institute of Highway Safety with the 2009 Ford Flex and the Lincoln MKS earning top honors. This builds on Ford's achievement of the most U.S. government five-star safety ratings in the automobile industry.</p>
          <p>We reduced North America's salary personnel cost by about 15% and reduced hourly personnel by about 3,000 since the end of the second quarter. On October 8, Volvo announced restructuring plans to review salary personnel by an additional 3,300 and agency personnel by an additional 700, bringing the total planned Volvo personnel actions to about 6,000 worldwide since June, equal to about 25% reduction.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit continues to execute its funding plan and increased its liquidity available for use to about 25 billion despite a very challenging credit market. Ford Credit continues to support Ford's core business.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Lewis to go through the third quarter results in even more detail. Lewis?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alan. Let's move on to slide eight, which provides more information on our third quarter results. Starting in the lower left, our net loss for the third quarter was $129 million. Our net loss included minority interests in profitable affiliates. This net loss also included 462 million of tax benefits, more than explained by an adjustment for accounting standard FAS 109 related to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which may at least partly reverse in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for these items leaves a third quarter pre-tax loss of $540 million. These results include favorable pre-tax special items of over $2.2 billion,  and we'll cover these on the next two slides. Excluding these special items, we recorded a third quarter pre-tax operating loss of over $2.7 billion. Most of the following slides will focus on these pre-tax operating results.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide nine, which covers special items in the third quarter. We recorded a charge of $197 million, largely related to hourly and salary personnel reduction programs in the U.S. Largely offsetting these changes was a $320 million gain due to a reduction in the number of personnel in our Job Security Benefits reserve, primarily due to changes in the ACH plan. We also incurred $94 million of charges primarily related to personnel reduction programs in Europe, Australia and Volvo. Finally the $2.3 billion improvement near the bottom of the slide primarily represents the curtailment gain related to the VEBA agreement with the UAW. We will provide more information on the VEBA agreement on the next slide.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, during the third quarter related to our UAW retiree health care settlement agreement, we received court approval and successfully completed our pre-clearance review of the accounting treatment with the SEC. As a result, we recognized a curtailment gain in excess of $2 billion. This was included as a special item on the prior slide. This and other efficiencies result in ongoing health care cost savings of about $2 billion, about the same as our earlier estimate. About half of these savings will be recognized this year with all of the savings being recognized in 2009. The annual ongoing net cash flow benefit is about $1 billion, unchanged from our earlier estimate. The net cash savings include health care savings of 1.6 billion offset by interest on the debt that will be used to settle the health care obligation.</p>
          <p>Between the third quarter effective date and year end 2009 implementation date, all increment expense related to UAW retiree health care will be defined as a special item. This reflects that Ford's obligations to pay into the new VEBA are capped as provided in the settlement agreement and that all related amounts will be eliminated on an ongoing basis after 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 11. I'd like to talk about the status of our ACH divestiture actions. ACH was formed in October 2005 with 17 plants, two of which were subsequently transferred to Ford. It had two missions: to ensure continuity of supply and the support of new product programs while improving quality and cost, and to sell or close its facilities by year end 2008.</p>
          <p>The status of divestitures at the end of this year will include five plants sold, two plants closed and two additional plants to close by year end. Looking forward, a fifth plant is scheduled to close in 2009, and a sixth scheduled in 2010. While we remain engaged in discussions with prospective buyers for three of the four remaining plants, we currently expect that we will continue to operate at least a portion of these plants. We've made good progress to date while limiting the need to invest substantial incremental resources in these businesses. We are intent on transitioning these businesses to the supply base as soon as practical in an orderly and economical manner.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 12, which shows our pre-tax operating results by sector. The third quarter pre-tax operating results were a loss of over $2.7 billion. These results included a loss of $2.9 billion  for the automotive sector and a profit of 159 million for Financial Services.</p>
          <p>Let's move to slide 13, which shows pre-tax operating results for each of our automotive operating segments and Other Automotive. We'll focus here on Other Automotive and then cover the operations in detail on the next slides.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, Other Automotive was a loss of $411 million. The net interest expense was higher than our previous expectation primarily due to lower returns on our cash portfolio. Given the continuing turbulence in the financial markets and the impact that this has had on our portfolio returns, we are not going to provide guidance on net interest expense at this time.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows the change in third quarter results compared with a year ago, a deterioration of $2.5 billion. Compared with 2007, volume and mix was $2.1 billion  unfavorable, primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable mix in North America and Volvo, partly offset by improvements in Europe and South America. Net pricing was $200 million unfavorable, more than explained by declines in North America, partly offset by improvements in South America and Europe. Costs were $300 million favorable, and we'll cover this on the next slide. And exchange was about flat.</p>
          <p>Net interest in related fair market value adjustments were $400 million unfavorable primarily due to lower cash balances, lower interest income rates and portfolio losses. And finally, the non-recurrence of Jaguar Land Rover profits in 2007 also adversely affected the year-over-year comparison by about $100 million.</p>
          <p>Now to slide 15, which explains our year-over-year cost reductions, which were about three billion in the first nine months, including $300 million in the third quarter. Net product costs were $300 million higher for the first nine months, more than explained by commodity cost increases and higher product content, partly offset by material cost reductions. In the third quarter, net product costs were up $900 million, more than explained by higher commodity costs and unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges, which reversed gains reported earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>Warranty expense was about $200 million lower, mainly due to favorable first quarter adjustments to Ford of Europe warranty results, reflecting improved quality. Manufacturing and engineering costs were about $700 million lower, more than explained by the continued benefit of our restructuring actions in North America. Spending related costs improved by $900 million, primarily reflecting the non-recurrence of accelerated depreciation and amortization for facilities that we recently closed, and lower depreciation expense related to the North American asset impairment for the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Pension and retiree health care expenses were $700 million lower, primarily reflecting health care efficiencies. And overhead costs were about $600 million lower than a year ago, primarily due to our restructuring actions. And advertising and sales promotions were about $200 million lower than a year ago.</p>
          <p>For the next section of slides, we'll cover each of the automotive operations, starting with North America on slide 16. Third quarter wholesales were 462,000 units, down 187,000 units compared to the same period in 2007, primarily reflecting the decline in the U.S. industry SAAR from16.2 million units in third quarter 2007 to 13.1 million units, and a decline in U.S. market share from 13.4% to 12.4%.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the last quarter, we reduced U.S. dealer stocks by over 80,000 units compared with a reduction of less than 20,000 units during the same period a year ago. Third quarter revenue was $10.8 billion, down $5.9 billion from a year ago, consistent with lower volumes, unfavorable model mix and lower net pricing. For the third quarter, Ford North America reported a pre-tax loss of about $2.6 billion, down about $1.6 billion from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 provides an explanation of the change in North American results compared with a year ago. Volume and mix was about $1.9 billion unfavorable, primarily reflecting the decline in U.S. industry volumes, unfavorable product mix, lower dealer stocks and lower market share. Net pricing was unfavorable by $400 million, more than explained by higher retail incentives in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
          <p>Volume and mix and net pricing both were adversely affected by very low production of full-size pickup trucks during the third quarter of 2008 as we sold down dealer stocks of the 2008 models prior to the launch of the new 2009 model. Cost changes were over $500 million favorable primarily reflecting 1.2 billion of lower structural costs, including lower pension and OPEB and spending-related manufacturing and engineering and overhead costs.</p>
          <p>The structural cost reductions were partly offset by higher commodity costs, including unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges because of the recent declines in commodity prices, which reversed gains recorded earlier in the year. And exchange was about $200 million favorable.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 provides an explanation of the deterioration in North America for the third quarter results compared with the second quarter. Volume and mix was $1.3 billion unfavorable primarily reflecting declines in dealer stocks, the U.S. industry SAAR reduction from 14.6 million units to 13.1 million units and U.S. market share from 14.4% to 12.4%. Net pricing was $100 million unfavorable, more than explained by higher retail incentives.</p>
          <p>Cost changes were $100 million favorable, primarily reflecting $600 million of lower structural costs due to lower manufacturing and engineering, spending related and pension and OPEB costs. The structural cost improvements were probably offset by unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges and higher commodity costs. Exchange was $100 million favorable, and other was $100 million  unfavorable.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows U.S. market share for Ford and Lincoln Mercury. For the third quarter our market share was 12.4%, including 9.3% for retail and 3.1% for fleet. Retail market share declined by over one point from last year, primarily explained by segmentation shifts away from full-size pickups and traditional SUVs. Fleet share increased by 0.2 from last year primarily reflecting a slower decline in fleet sales relative to the overall decline in the total industry.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 provides a summary of actual and protected cost reductions in North America. In the third quarter operating-related cost reductions totaled $500 million compared with a year ago. Net product costs were about $700 million unfavorable with material cost reductions more than offset by high commodity costs and added product features. Structural costs reductions totaled $1.2 billion in the third quarter compared with a year ago. The favorable change includes about $250 million for reduced depreciation from the fixed asset impairment in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Hourly and salaried personnel in North America totaled 80,000 at the end of the third quarter, down 5,000 people from the end of the second quarter. And we remain on track to achieve or exceed our $5 billion cost reduction target.</p>
          <p>Now on to South America on slide 21. Third quarter wholesales were 125,000 units, up 9,000 units from a year ago. Third quarter revenue was $2.7 billion, up 600 million from a year ago, primarily reflecting a stronger Brazilian currency, higher volumes and favorable net pricing. For the third quarter, Ford South America reports a pre-tax profit of $480 million, up 94 million from a year ago. This increase reflected &#x2013; primarily reflected higher net pricing, favorable volume and mix and favorable changes in currency exchange rates, slightly offset by higher net product costs.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 covers Ford of Europe. In the third quarter, wholesales were 410,000 units, 12,000 units lower than 2007. Third quarter market share was 8.6% in the 19 markets that we tracked, equal to the prior year. And third quarter revenue was $9.7 billion, up $1.4 billion from a year ago primarily due to favorable currency translation, mix and net pricing, partly offset by lower volumes. For the third quarter, Ford Europe reports a pre-tax profit of $69 million, down $224 million from a year ago. And we'll cover this change on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 provides an explanation of the change in results compared to a year ago. Volume and mix was about flat compared with the same period in 2007, with favorable product mix offset by lower volume. Net pricing was $100 million favorable compared to a year ago and in total cost increased by $100 million. This increase was more than explained by unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments for commodity hedges. Exchange was $100 million unfavorable mainly due to the weakening of the British pound compared to the euro. Historically third quarter results are generally weaker than the average quarter due to the scheduled plant shutdowns, but industry weakness is a concern going forward.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 covers Volvo. Third quarter wholesales were 66,000 units, down 36,000 from a year ago. This reduction is explained by lower industry volumes and market share, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and lower dealer stocks. Market share in the U.S. is 0.4% down 0.2 from last year, and this decrease reflects in part a decision to decrease emphasis on small vehicles that have become less profitable with changes in currency exchange rates and the market segmentation shift away from SUVs.</p>
          <p>Market share in Europe was 1.2%, down 0.1 from a year ago. Third quarter revenue was $2.9 billion, down $900 million from a year ago primarily reflecting lower volumes partly offset by favorable currency translation. For the third quarter Volvo reports a pre-tax loss of $458 million, down $291 million  from a year ago. This result was worse than our expectations three months ago. We'll cover this decline on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 provides an explanation of the change in results compared with a year ago. Volume and mix was $300 million unfavorable, primarily explained by lower industry volume, market share and unfavorable product mix in the U.S. and Europe. These declines were worse than we had expected. Net pricing was about flat from a year ago, and in total, costs were reduced by about $100 million, with higher commodity costs more than offset by reductions in a number of areas. Exchange was about $100 million unfavorable.</p>
          <p>On October 8, Volvo announced restructuring plans to reduce salaried personnel by an additional 3,300 employees and agency personnel by an additional 700 employees. Including the restructurings announced on June 25, the total personnel actions now planned to be initiated account for about 6,000 people worldwide of which 1,200 are agency employees. This will be a total reduction of around 25%.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide 26, which covers Asia Pacific, Africa and Mazda. Overall third quarter profits were $3 million, and we'll discuss Asia Pacific and Africa more on the next slide. Ford lost $1 million from its investment in Mazda and associated operations in the third quarter, down $50 million from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Slide 27 covers Asia Pacific and Africa. In the third quarter wholesales were 111,000 units, a decrease of 18,000 units compared with 2007, primarily reflecting stronger competitive activity in China and India and continued industry weakness in key markets. Third quarter revenues were $1.7 billion, down $100 million  from a year ago, reflecting lower volumes partially offset by favorable currency translation.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter Asia Pacific and Africa reported a pre-tax profit of $4 million, down $26 million from a year ago. The decline in results is primarily explained by unfavorable volume and mix partly offset by favorable net pricing.</p>
          <p>Slide 28 shows automotive cash and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $18.9 billion in gross cash. Our operating related cash flow was $7.7 billion negative in the third quarter, reflecting an automotive pre-tax loss of $2.9 billion, capital spending during the quarter about $500 million  higher than depreciation and amortization, changes in working capital and other timing differences of $3.6 billion negative, and this is primarily explained by lower trade payables as a result of lower production.</p>
          <p>Payments of $700 million to Ford Credit reflects our change to up-front payment of subvention. Excluding the up-front subvention payments, our operating cash flow was $7 billion negative. I would like to note, however, this outflow was significantly impacted by a number of unique factors during the quarter, including the decision to reduce truck production to allow for an orderly sell down of dealer inventories to make way for new models.</p>
          <p>Overall, Ford's global third quarter production levels were about 100,000 units below retail sales and nearly 500,000 units below the second quarter results. This had a substantial effect on profit and the decline in production results in about a $3 billion reduction in payables during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Separation programs resulted in an outflow of $200 million for the quarter, and we contributed $100 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Ford Credit did not pay Ford a dividend during the third quarter. Including all of these impacts, the total decline in gross cash during the third quarter was $7.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 29 summarizes our net liquidity. Total liquidity including available credit lines was $29.6 billion, and automotive debt was 26.1 billion. Upon implementation of the independent VEBA, we will contribute debt securities with a face value of 6.3 billion to the trust. We have less than $3 billion of debt maturities in the next three years.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide 30 and Financial Services. For the third quarter, the Financial Services sector reports a pre-tax profit of $159 million, down $397 million  from a year ago. Other Financial Services reports a loss of $2 million in the third quarter, down $12 million from a year ago. We will cover Ford Credit in more detail on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 31 explains a change in Ford Credit's pre-tax profits for the third quarter, compared with a year ago. For the third quarter, pre-tax profits were $161 million, down $400 million from a year ago. The decrease in earnings primarily reflected the non-recurrence of net gains related to market valuation adjustments and derivatives, a higher provision for credit losses and lower volumes. These factors were partly offset by higher financing margins. The increase in credit losses primarily reflected higher severities and higher repossessions in the U.S. retail and lease portfolio.</p>
          <p>Residual losses were about the same in the third quarter 2008 compared with last year. While auction values have declined significantly from last year, the profit implications in the third quarter were mitigated by the $2.1 billion lease impairment charge in the second quarter. We expect auction values to continue to be volatile. We expect Ford Credit to incur a pre-tax loss in the second half of 2008 which is expected to be smaller than its first half pre-tax loss of 262 million, excluding the impairment charge.</p>
          <p>As shown in the memo on the lower left of the slide, Ford Credit's September 30, 2008 managed assets were $130 billion, about $18 billion  lower than a year ago. This decline is more than explained by lower North American receivables, impact of divestitures and alternative business arrangements, changes in currency exchange rates and the second quarter 2008 impairment charge for North American operating lease.</p>
          <p>Slide 32 covers the liquidity and funding outlook for Ford Credit. The left box shows Ford Credit's committed liquidity programs and cash and the utilization of its liquidity sources at the end of the third quarter. Ford Credit's liquidity exceeded utilization by about $25 billion. Ford Credit's funding strategy includes maintaining liquidity to meet short-term funding by having a substantial cash balance and committed funding capacity.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit plans to diversify its global asset-backed funding capabilities and renew global asset-backed funding capacity. This includes maintaining a diversity of liquidity providers. As it has done in the past, Ford Credit will continue to explore and execute alternative business and funding arrangements in those locations where we lack diverse funding capability, while also ensuring that Ford has continued support in these markets if needed.</p>
          <p>The most recent example of such an arrangement is the financial support for America will come from a third party. Global government-sponsored programs have been announced to help mitigate the present credit crisis. Ford Credit expressed a benefit from these programs both directly and indirectly in the U.S. and in Europe. By the end of the third quarter, Ford Credit's managed leverage was 9.6 to one and Ford Credit's equity was $11.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide 33, which shows where we are in our planning assumptions and operational metrics for 2008. Total industry during the first nine months was equal to a SAAR of 14.4 million units in the U.S. and 17.2 million units in Europe. Based on the continued deterioration in economic conditions in the U.S. market, we expect that the industry will be lower than the outlook that we communicated previously. We are now projecting total industry, including medium and heavy trucks to be about 13.7 million units for the full year. We're also seeing increasing weakness across Europe, and as a result we are now projecting that European full year industry volumes will be about 16.7 million units.</p>
          <p>On the operational metrics, the quality of our vehicles has risen consistently for four straight years. Ford's Lincoln and Mercury vehicles collectively reduced things gone wrong by 7.7% compared to last year, and as noted earlier, our quality has received important third-party endorsements. Automotive costs have improved by $3 billion through the first nine months, and we now expect full year cost reduction to be about $4 billion globally, including the impact of last quarter's impairment.</p>
          <p>The U.S. market share for the first nine months was 14%, down 0.7 for the same period a year ago, and absolute operating cash flow during the first nine months was 12.3 negative. This was higher than planned, and we continue to expect the full year net outflow to be worse than originally projected. Capital expenditures during the first nine months was $4.7 billion, and we expect full year expenditures to be on track with our full year plan. Overall as communicated previously, 2008 operating and overall results will be lower than 2007 levels &#x2013; will be worse than 2007 levels.</p>
          <p>Slide 34 covers our production plans for the fourth quarter. In North America, the fourth quarter production schedule is 430,000 units, down 211,000 units from 2007 and 40,000 units lower than our prior guidance. Most of this decline is in SUVs and vans. For Ford Europe, we expect fourth quarter production of 400,000 units down about 90,000 units from a year ago and our prior guidance.</p>
          <p>In Volvo, we expect fourth quarter production of 77,000 units, down 40,000 units from a year ago and down 33,000 units from our prior guidance. As you can see from the above chart, overall compared with last year our production reductions in the fourth quarter will be greater than those of the third quarter as we respond to the rapid deterioration in the external environment. As a result, our year-over-year profit decline this quarter exceed that of the fourth quarter with the results of impacts on our cash flows.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn it back over to Alan to summarize our plan going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lewis. Going forward, let's turn to slide 36. We believe the downturn in industry volume will be now broader, deeper and longer than previously expected. Industry volumes next year are expected to decline compared with 2008 levels. Some recovery is expected in 2010. Ford's overall market share should be about the same as 2008 with our new products. We expect the U.S. market to continue to trend towards smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles going forward.</p>
          <p>Our suppliers and dealers are under increasing pleasure, the financial markets remain volatile but are projected to stabilize and gradually improve over the next year. Commodity prices are expected to remain below recent peaks but likely also will continue to remain volatile. The U.S. dollar has strengthened against most currencies, and given the overall uncertainty in the economic environment we do not plan to provide additional guidance at this time.</p>
          <p>Slide 37 summarizes the key aspects of our plan. These have not changed. We are more focused than ever on implementing our transformation plan to respond to the significant challenges presented by the continuing global economic downturn. We are pleased that we went to the capital markets at the right time to obtain liquidity to finance our plan and that we sold non-core brands to raise further capital and allow further focus of our resources. And I'm especially pleased with how the team is working together to create One Ford and leverage our global resources.</p>
          <p>Despite the present turbulence in the worldwide economy, I continue to believe that Ford is well positioned to take advantage of our scale and global product strengths with a balanced portfolio of small, medium and large cars, utilities and trucks, and a sharp focus on the Ford blue oval brand across the globe, we can effectively operate through the current downturn. Going forward this balanced portfolio will allow the flexibility to adapt more easily the changes in our environment and begin to grow profitability as a global economy rebounds.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 38, despite the recent changes in the global marketplace, our plan to invest in new smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles and a more balanced global profit portfolio remains in place. In combination with the business improvements achieved recently, we expect the One Ford product development vision and process to enable us to deliver a range of highly acclaimed smaller vehicles in what we call the global segments, that is B, C, C/D, and Commercial Van segments beginning in the middle of next year.</p>
          <p>By 2010, about 40% of our entries in North America in these segments will be shared with Ford of Europe. Platforms and top hats with 100% of the lineup in these segments shared with Ford of Europe by 2013. This compares with nothing in common today. In every new product we introduce not only those in the global segments but also those that will be regionally offers only will provide fuel economy that will be best or among the best against facing competition. Our new products will be assembled in plants featuring Lean manufacturing techniques and in nearly all facilities flexible body shops will make them competitive with the best in the business.</p>
          <p>And many of our power trains will be built in plants that can flex among the I 4, V-6, V-8 or diesel engines. Importantly we expect to have our vehicle assembly capacity matched to demand. As we make these changes, we intend to continue fixing the fundamentals of the business, including the significant reduction in structural costs next year. We also will continue ongoing consolidation of our dealer network.</p>
          <p>As shown here on slide 39, to support new product investments and offset continued industry weakness, Ford is implementing a series of actions that are expected to improve automotive cash by a total of 14 billion to 17 billion through 2010. The actions include: reducing annual capital spending to between five and 5.5 billion, enabled in a large part by the efficiency in Ford's global product development system. Nearly all planned product programs remain on track and on time, aside from a few select vehicles that will be deferred until industry volumes recover. In addition, we are reducing spending for large vehicles in declining segments.</p>
          <p>Reducing North America's salaries personnel related costs by an additional 10% by the end of January 2009, primarily through personnel reductions and attrition. Additional actions impacting compensation are also being implemented. The reductions are in addition to personnel related cost actions already taken in Ford North America and underway in Ford Europe, Ford Asia Pacific and Africa and Volvo. Further reduction of U.S. hourly employees by approximately 2,600 as a result of the most recent round of targeted buyouts, bringing Ford's total to U.S. hourly reductions through buyouts in 2008 to approximately 7,000.</p>
          <p>Eliminating performance bonuses for global salaried employees for the 2008 performance year, eliminating merit pay increases for North America salary employees in 2009, suspending matching funds for salaried employees in Ford's savings and stock investment plan, reducing engineering manufacturing, information technology and marketing costs through greater global efficiencies and alignment with reduced volume assumptions.</p>
          <p>Reducing inventories globally and achieving other working capital improvements. While Ford Credit remains an important strategic asset, integral to Ford, we are releasing some of Ford Credit's capital to Ford Motor Company, consistent with Ford Credit's smaller balance sheet and a focus on core Ford brands, continuing to develop incremental sources of automotive funding, including divesting non-core operations and assets and implementing equity for debt swaps.</p>
          <p>At this point I would like to add that we are working with a number of governments around the world to maximize the availability of funding to provide further protection against the uncertain economic environment that the entire automotive industry is facing. Incremental funding also would allow us to potentially accelerate selected actions in our plan.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide 40. While business conditions continue to change quickly, our One Ford plan is more right now than ever. As we've explained we are more focused than ever on delivering our transformation plan and taking the swift and often difficult actions needed to respond to challenging and historic times for the global automotive industry. Businesses around the world are facing enormous challenges, and Ford is no exception. However, Ford is focused on things we can control.</p>
          <p>The cash improvement actions we detailed earlier will maintain the strength of our balance sheet as we continue our product led transformation. We have innovative new products that entered the market in the third quarter, including the Ford Fiesta and the Ford F-150, the new Ford Kuga is off to a great start in Europe and the new Ford Ka and Fiesta will enhance our lineups in Europe and in China. And importantly we are launching our new vehicles with world class quality.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit remains an important strategic asset and is open for business as it funds dealers and offers loans to new car buyers. In spite of declining economic condition, Ford Europe remained profitable in the third quarter. South America turned in another strong quarter. And North America is on course to hit its cost reduction target as it focuses on transforming itself with more fuel-efficient, smaller cars, crossover and utilities.</p>
          <p>In the next year our product offensive continues with the new Ford Mustang, the Lincoln MKZ, fresh and gas and new hybrid versions of both the Ford Fusion and the Mercury Milan, new Ford Focus with fuel efficient EcoBoost engines as well as Lincoln MKS and Ford Flex with EcoBoost engines.</p>
          <p>In summary, these are challenging days indeed for the auto industry, yet I am more convinced than ever that Ford has the right plan. I continue to believe that Ford will be well positioned to take advantage of our scale and our product strengths worldwide. Now we'd be pleased to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Alan. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to start the Q&amp;A session now. We have about 40 minutes, 45 minutes for the Q&amp;A. We will begin with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media who are also on the call. In order to allow as many questions as possible within our timeframe, I ask that you keep your questions brief so that we don't have to move callers along after a couple of minutes.

          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just first wanted to ask about working capital. And I think, there's a lot of questions around this, but specifically on the three billion or the $3.6 billion use in the quarter, that was much higher than we were expecting. Sounds like it was because of a payables issue. Wouldn't that have been offset by receivables being reduced so that there would be sort of a net impact that would have been smaller? And is this sort of an ongoing issue or is this really just a step function down, and we're not going to see a big burn again from working capital in the fourth quarter which is traditionally a little bit stronger? Just really would try to understand what's going on there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just answer &#x2013; John, this is Lewis Booth. Let me just answer the payables piece of the question. They did come down significantly because of lower production. We do expect some further reductions in the fourth quarter because of the lower production reported in the fourth quarter around the world. We expect to see that begin to flatten out as we look forward to the 2009 as production begins to settle and perhaps grow it towards the back end of the year as we begin to see a very modest recovery. In terms of receivables, I'm going to ask K.R. Kent just to discuss that with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John, on the receivables, this is K.R. Kent from the Credit company. Generally the receivables are paid off by the credit company really short term. I mean it's like two and a half days or so that we put it on to our books and then would be wholsaled out to the dealers, obviously, and payables are much longer term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we should assume that there would be another hit, potentially another hit in the fourth quarter and then we're flat, that step function is changed, going into -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well there's some hit in the fourth quarter, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. Then second, one thing that we struggle with in looking at the company is trying to understand man capacity, install capacity and capacity utilization, and you guys didn't touch on that in this quarter, and it's clearly &#x2013; it's a big issue for the company going forward as far as right sizing. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on where you stand on capacity actions and really just sort of highlight a little bit the delta between sort of your structural capacity and your man capacity and how cost savings might develop as you cut capacity going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. John, we're not going to give you specific numbers today. We're in the very, very near term, we're obviously going to have some down production weeks, particularly in the U.S. in the fourth quarter as we continue to lower production to make sure we don't build stocks. We did that in the third quarter because what we're really try to do is make sure we keep production in balance with demand because we don't want to build dealer stocks in this period. Longer term, it's very much going to depend on what happens to the economic outlook in 2009 around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, I might just add that we are continuing with our plan to make the best economic decisions in the near term because clearly some of the plans we're not using a full utilization, but we have great contribution from the products that are there. And we're absolutely going to tie the change that we make to increase the utilization and the efficiency to when it makes sense economically, with our products cycle plan, with the product strategy going forward, and we feel we really have improved that over the long term and so as we go forward we'll share more of that with you with the cycle plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as of now, no new capacity actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, with the buyouts we achieved in the third quarter we've got minimal servicepeople in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then lastly, Alan, yesterday was the first day you guys were down in D.C. with sort of your cross town rivals talking about the current situation and the need potentially for some government support for the industry. I was just wondering what you think Ford might need in general in this potential help from the government, or is there the potential for Ford, given all the liquidity that you pulled in at the end of 2006, to get through this without any government support, contrary to maybe some other players in the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep, you bet. Will be glad to give you my perspective, and you're always welcome to join us. I'm very encouraged with the dialogue, with not only the U.S. government but the governments around the world, as everybody is dealing clearly with this economic slowdown and what it means to the economies worldwide.</p>
          <p>And with respect to the U.S. government, I think I'd like to maybe focus on three key things, John, that we're working with. The first one is that, as you well know, that during the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, that legislation last year, I was really proud of Ford for &#x2013; we stepped up to be part of that solution. And in addition to the conversation on fuel mileage and the commitments we made on that, we also had a very good conversation about the investment it takes to bring those fuel-efficient technologies to market. And then we also &#x2013; they also included in the legislation government loans to help us support the implementation of that fuel-efficient technology. And so that piece of it now has gone to the Department of Energy, and yesterday they released the draft of their criteria for applying for those loans. And so we spent time talking about that and understanding that, and then of course we will bounce our product development and our enabling technology plan up against that, and get our request in sooner rather than later. So I'm very pleased with the development in that area.</p>
          <p>On another piece associated with the government's work to free up the credit, on Ford Credit's side, we have registered to sell up to 16 billion of asset-backed commercial paper through the U.S. government's commercial paper facility. And through October 31, we have utilized about 25% of that. So that's a key part of freeing up liquidity for everybody, but specifically for Ford Motor Credit to be able to make the loans that the customers really do need.</p>
          <p>And then maybe the last piece, John, I would highlight that we spent time on yesterday was additional funding under the guise of more of a bridge loan &#x2013; that clearly none of us know what the future really is going &#x2013; how it's going to turn out, but clearly it could &#x2013; the economy could degrade much faster and put the industry at risk. And so one of the things we talked about was having a bridge loan capability that we could access that if it deteriorated substantially.</p>
          <p>Now having said all that, as we pointed out in the call, our basic plan is to enhance our cash position, continue to invest in the new products that people do really want and continue our restructuring. And we are not assuming that kind of help from the U.S. government at this time, because clearly we don't know what that might be. But we are absolutely going to continue the dialogue with the U.S. government and others, that if things deteriorated substantially, that we could do what it takes to keep this very important industry going for the United States, and be part of the solution to turn the economy around.</p>

          <p>What we talked about yesterday is that we are open to &#x2013; we didn't want to specify the specific funding mechanism, but we were certainly open to talk about the different possibilities. But we're not much further than that right now, but we'll absolutely update you as we go forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Similar question, you did outline in the deck here today that equity for debt swaps would be part of your cash improvement plan. How much of that six to eight billion do you think would come from that mechanism?  Would it be two or three billion? Can you frame that for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Chris, it's about $1 billion within the six to eight, of which we've executed roughly half, and the cash starts coming back to us in 2009 and 2010 as the Ford Credit debt pays off.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're calling out as a special item because there's a large one-time curtailment gain that is not reflected in the ongoing performance. So that's the reason we're calling it out as a special.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it the gain that you're going to call out or maybe I misinterpreted. It sounded like on an ongoing basis you were going to call out the cost savings associated with this plan as a special item?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going forward until we fully implement it at the end of '09, we're going to call all changes as special because effectively we've wiped out the obligation. So there will be ups and downs, and we're going to call them all special because we don't have any ongoing obligation.</p>

          <p>Hi. Could you comment on the earnings outlook for Latin America going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're going through a very strong period at the moment. We do expect that to come off. We're seeing some industry beginning to downturn. Also seeing currency moving against the dollar reported earnings in Latin America, so we're expecting to see them come off what has been an extraordinarily strong performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on that same line of thinking on Europe, the profits are down this quarter but it didn't look like your volumes came off that much in Q3. Fourth quarter obviously looks like industry volumes are slowing significantly. I mean, is it reasonable to assume Ford Europe would still remain profitable next year given the level of registration declines we're seeing in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on our present assumptions for next year, it's reasonable to assume that Ford Europe will remain profitable next year. We're seeing actually the Western Europe volumes come off a little. The biggest deterioration has been in some of the developing and Eastern Europe markets, particularly Russia and Turkey, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Lewis, can you talk about in Europe what is the financing situation for consumers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it's tight. I don't think we've got a specific issue in Europe compared to here. I mean it's very tight worldwide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean has there been any marked deterioration there in the last couple of months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Himanshu, are you talking specifically like on consumer financing vehicles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Ford Credit obviously is still open for business, so we've been doing our piece. We have seen some banks pull back a bit, but it hasn't been like it's been in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly on Volvo, I just noticed in the appendix on slide, I forgot which slide it was, where you had the head count, but it looked like Volvo's head count sequentially was flat between June and September, and I think you're talking about taking 6,000 heads out. What is the cadence of that head count reduction at Volvo going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly -- within Sweden there's a very organized approach where you agree the reductions you're going to take and then you discuss specifically how you're going to achieve them, and that happens over a six month period, consultation between the company and the authorities, and then the company and the unions. So about 2,000 of those people will be out by end of the year, and the remaining 4,000 will be out in the first quarter. But on the agency people, it will probably be a little bit faster.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The 8 to 9 billion of operating cash improvement you've got on slide 39, it looks like that's cumulative. And it looks like you're taking your CapEx down by one to two billion versus where it had been running. I just want to make sure we understand that properly. Is the prospective cost reduction, the structural cost reduction that you're targeting something like six to eight billion cumulatively, like three to four billion a year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, also included in that 8 to 9 is some improvements in working capital. So the actual structural is a little bit lower than you're implying. Specific to CapEx, it will be about $2 billion in the period, about $1 billion in each year. We've done that without significantly affecting the product program. That's one of the reasons we do work so hard on the structural costs is to make sure that we continue to invest heavily in our new product program, so that as things begin to improve, we've got a fully competitive lineup around the world of both new product and fuel-efficient product within it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if it's below the three to four billion, how does that break down between U.S. and -- it sounds like some of the actions you're taking are international. Can you tell us what your North American structural costs are at this point, and whether you're managing your structural costs to a specific U.S. SAAR breakeven point?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>And Rod, just a little bit more color. Clearly, while we have there on chart 33 or slide 33 is the 13.7 for the year end as a SAAR, and our guidance is that we believe that 2009 is clearly going to not be better, which means probably a little bit lower, so, and we're not recovering until 2010, so you can see we're trying to be conservative here going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple questions on the VEBA. Are you pursuing and have you got an SEC agreement around the question settlement accounting FAS 106, paragraph 90, or negative plan amendment accounting, 106 paragraph 55?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We got an agreement from the SEC to do settlement accounting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So why wasn't the one-time gain larger, then, reflecting the full mark down of the OPEB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's several elements to it. The first one is a curtailment gain, then you have an actuarial gain, which goes through OIC, and that gets offset by any accumulated losses that you may have, so it's quite complicated accounting. So there are various elements to it, but the one time you see now is essentially the curtailment gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll follow up offline on some of the FAS 106 details. Second question, on the cash saves, is that cumulative? That is this cash will be saved by the end of 2010?  Or is this a run rate that you should be in -- excuse me, 2009 -- a run rate you should be in by 4Q '09?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that's the best way to handle it because it is complex. The cash saves we're showing is cumulative through 2009 and through 2010.</p>

          <p>Okay. And on Ford Credit, what is the ROA or net income level they need to achieve to be comfortable with resuming the dividend flow up? I know it's not based on profits, it's based on shrinkage, but how are you thinking about managing their liquidity versus the needs of Ford Auto?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's a couple pieces to go with this. And that's we're going to make the cash payments to do the reduction in the receivable portfolio as it declines. And the other couple pieces that are driving the decline, including Jag Land Rover moving away, Mazda moving away, and then the industry decline as well. And that we'll have this -- we're going to balance the return of capital with our successful execution of the funding plan as well, to make sure that we continue to support Ford in the financing of the products.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think from the perspective of the revolver and the term loan, which did pledge most of the assets, and I think as far as we know at this point we haven't had discussions specifically on what the government would want as support, or as Alan said earlier, what tails come with it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>I had a question regarding Ford Credit. GMAC announced intentions to try to gain bank holding status, which I think surprised a lot of people. I know the ownership structure is very different at Ford Motor Credit. But do you see any strategic advantages for such actions at Ford Credit? Is that something that you could potentially even consider? Because it would help the cost of capital a lot. Clearly there's advantages to winning such status.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the strategic advantage we see is having Ford Credit as an owned, captive financing company. That's the strategic asset. Given that's our view, we couldn't apply for a bank holding company, because of that ownership structure. So our strategy is unchanged. We see Ford Credit as a key part of the way we do business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. I guess a secondary question, and it could relate to Ford Credit. With availability for credit down across the market and volumes falling, a lot of dealers I spoke to are challenged to get financing, not just at Ford but across the industry. Do you envision any specific help for those dealers? And how does it feel out there when you're talking to your dealers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, as far as wholesale financing goes, right now in the U.S. we are doing about 77% of our dealers, and the other 23 obviously have been done through other banks and other finance companies. And in Europe right now, we're financing 98% of the dealers. So, so far, as we've been able to continue to fund ourselves, we've been very supportive of our dealers from the funding aspects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Doug, just if I can just close out the bank holding company question, I think you know we do have an application pending for an industrial loan bank, and obviously we'd welcome that, because that would put us on parity with some of our competitors who already have ILCs approved.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>I wanted to follow up on the DOE loan program issue. I guess yesterday there was a summary sheet that came out, and I mean one of the things that was kind of new in there was they provided a base year for fuel economy improvements, right? It was previously unspecified, and they said 2005. And I guess the reaction that people seem to have to that was just, would this really kind of constrain the number of programs that might qualify for this? Because I guess most of us thought they would make it as broad as possible just to help maximize the impact from a liquidity perspective. And I just wanted to get your thoughts, because that seems like kind of a high hurdle for 25% improvement?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll let you know sooner rather than later, because another neat thing about the plan is that they &#x2013; from our understanding, they want to move decisively, and we think there's a chance of even being able to come to some conclusions as early as the fourth quarter, so we're going to move very aggressively to comply.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You bet. I think what they're going to do from the conversations we've had is maybe do it by quarter, and they're shooting to have it done as early as the fourth quarter, which is terrific.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, and welcome, Lewis. A couple of questions. I want to just start with this. Alan and Lewis, you talked about being on track or even a little bit ahead of track on the $5 billion in cost reductions. <mark type="inaudible" /> Yeah, but the question is is $5 billion still enough? I mean that was based on a whole differently set of assumptions, wasn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Absolutely is the answer because when we set that objective, the world has really changed since then, especially the U.S. economy deterioration, and the North American team have done a fabulous job, Bryce, at working their fundamental structural cost and exceeding their original target during the toughest of times.</p>
          <p>Now, clearly the big message today is that we with the economy further degrading that we are going to get ahead of it again and take additional action to match the production to the real demand and continue to improve our productivity. And so it's never over and these are tough actions but this is the appropriate thing to do and we're going to do it decisively, so we're going to keep improving.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Good morning. Just a quick question, Alan, on non-core assets that you're looking to continue to look to sell those. What would you now classify as a non-core asset and also could you also explain your stance regarding Volvo now just based on the deterioration that continues to affect them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet. Our focus on Volvo is clearly to improve their current business performance, and we are really working on the new vehicles, especially on the premium side. And we're also, as you can see today, we continue to move decisively on the cost structure and the productivity, but that's our main focus with Volvo and with all of our assets. We're continuing to focus on the blue oval and around the world, and we're always looking at all our assets to make sure that we're divesting the ones that are not key to our long term growth.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Just wanted to clarify a couple numbers that got or a couple things -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; headset on, okay. Just wanted to clarify two numbers that were mentioned. Lewis talked about something in connection with worldwide job cuts and 25% was mentioned. I was actually having to file at that particular moment, so I didn't &#x2013; what was that 25% and how many jobs are we talking about, and the timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To ensure there's no confusion, the 25% was explicitly the cuts we've announced in Volvo since the end of June, 2,000 in June and another 4,000 in October. So that's the 25%. We are implementing reductions around the world and the announcement we made today was a further 10% cut in personnel related costs in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then also you mentioned that there would be a few select models that might be affected by delays in product development. It didn't sound like you want to specify models, but in terms of like say a proportion of the product portfolio, I mean roughly how many models are we talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it in context. We're talking the second quarter that by 2010 would be just slightly better than 40% of our products common in the segments we talked about in North America, and it's just slightly under 40% now so it's very few and it's very select.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">

          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to be very clear and sorry about repeating something, with Volvo and Mazda as you know, since you get so many clips, there's been a lot of coverage and a lot of speculation about those. While you're cautious about the issue of declaring them core assets, and by the way, this is the first part of the question, I just want to make sure that at this point we have no reason to believe that there are any intentions of either selling off your stake in Mazda or selling Volvo? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Let me get the other in case we accidentally get cut off. The second part is as you look at the deteriorating economy, realistically do you see it necessary for Ford to receive significant loans or at least some loans from the government to maintain a healthy and viable position? Could you proceed as you are going now, or would you need the loans that are already as you've suggested beginning to get loosened up and possibly a portion of the 25 billion additional money that Pelosi and others are now talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Maybe I'll address your latter question first. With respect to our fundamental plan going forward, the way I would think about it is that the way we see the world over the next couple of years is that we anticipate that 2009 will be no better than 2008, with recovery happening in 2010. And based on that, with some robustness in our plan, some conservativism, that we are going to improve our cash position by that 14 to $17 billion to add to the position we have so that we can continue to invest in the new products and continue our restructuring, and we're not assuming the government loans in that plan.</p>
          <p>Now, the reason we're talking to the government, it's not just the U.S. but around the world, is that clearly the world could deteriorate. The economies could deteriorate further and it could put the automobile industry at risk. And so the most important thing we want to do is make sure we have this dialogue, and we have mechanism in place so if it deteriorated substantially we'd be able to access a bridge loan and pay it back and get through the downturn and keep this very important industry alive because it's so important to the economy and the recovery. So that's the good conversation we're having with the government.</p>
          <p>On the Mazda and the Volvo, our relationship with Mazda has not changed. And if we have &#x2013; whenever we have anything to announce we will announce it. On Volvo, I'd just like to go back to the most important thing we're doing on Volvo is focusing on improving their business performance. It's a great brand. We're really focusing on the product line, the premiumness of it and also on the productivity and the cost. And we're making great progress. You saw the announcements we were making today.</p>
          <p>And the reason I'm not avoiding, or avoiding the non-core asset is that clearly we're focusing most of our attention on the blue oval around the world, but Volvo is a great brand and we're improving its performance also. So that's what we mean by that.</p>

          <p>Hi, I just had a couple of quick questions here. In terms of the blue collar buyouts, obviously you had 2,600 as you reported here, do you plan to have any further buyouts on the hourly workers in North America at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, understand the key to that question will be the market and the economy and the industry levels and then our production rates going forward. And we'll continue implementing our plan of matching the production, our production, to the real demand and then sizing ourselves accordingly. Because the most important thing we do is support the customer with the demand that they really want, not overproduce so we don't have to discount vehicles and ruin the residual values. And that plan has worked very well for us and the customers going forward, so then we'll size our production capability to the production. So that will go with the production changes we make in the future.</p>

          <p>Well, that's a perfect lead in then for my final question, then, is really obviously the government doesn't want to just throw good money after bad here, they have been critical of some of the decisions that the auto industry has made in the past, and I think it seems like they are looking for some strings attached. My question is then what strings do you think are reasonable here, but more importantly how will those strings change the way the auto industry looks five to ten years from now?</p>

          <p>Sure. I think it's premature to speculate on what will be in agreements that we reach, but I would offer that the tone of the conversations is very positive because of the &#x2013; of the actions that have been taken over the last few years by the automobile industry in support of energy security, energy independence and sustainability. And as you well know, we stepped up first when we went through that legislative process over the last few years to be part of the answer to those very important issues.</p>
          <p>And so the response that we're getting is this is an important industry, we're moving in the right direction. In Ford's case, we're improving the efficiency on every vehicle size, we're complementing our larger vehicles with a full complement of small and medium-sized fuel-efficient vehicles, so we're getting a very positive response. And the real conversation about additional financing is really around the fact of how important the industry is and if the economy really degraded substantially, it's just a very important aspect that we have the automobile industry stay in business to be part of the answer of the economic recovery. So that's really the tone of the conversations. And I think it's just too early right now to speculate on what the agreements will entail.</p>

          <p>Could I just say one last thing? My team has surrounded me with notes saying that I misspoke earlier, and that I said Ford instead of the Taurus which will be delivered next year with the EcoBoost engine, so it's the Taurus and not the Focus that I said. Okay, for clarification. And everything else is right? Team? Okay, thank you, Lillian.</p>
