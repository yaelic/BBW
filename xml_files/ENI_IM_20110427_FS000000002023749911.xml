        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our first quarter results conference call. Before I take you through the financial results, let me give you an update on the status of our operations in Libya. As you all know, the situation in the country remains uncertain. So far, the conflict has forced a shutdown of several of our producing sites, as well as the closure of the Greenstream pipeline.</p>
          <p>These shutdowns reduced production by 129,000 boe per day, compared to the first quarter of last year, an impact which was partially offset by improved performance year-on-year. Wafa is currently the only field in operation with an output that, as of April 1st, has been of about 55,000 boe per day, entirely destined to local power generation. This is down from a production of around 90,000 boe per day in early March, each day in which production remains at current use levels will cause a 600 boe per day decrease in full year average daily production. We are constantly monitoring the progress of this highly volatile situation. Our assets have suffered no damage and we are technically able to resume production quickly once the situation stabilizes.</p>
          <p>And now on to our results. In the first quarter of 2011, the market environment was positive compared to the same period of last year. The Brent price averaged $105 a barrel, up 38% compared to the first quarter of '010. The average European refining margin Brent/Ural was $3.30 per barrel, while it remained depressed compared to historical trends, it was higher than in the corresponding period of last year. Finally, the euro depreciate is likely versus the U.S. dollar compared to the corresponding period last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to our results, adjusted operating profit in the first quarter amounted to &#x20AC;5.1 billion, up 18% year-on-year. This result is mainly due to the strong contribution of the exploration and production which was partially offset by lower results in gas and power and refining and marketing. Adjusted net profit for the first quarter was &#x20AC;2.2 billion, up 22% year-on-year. This result also reflects lower adjusted tax rate, down 2.5 percentage point to 50.5%.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of '011, Eni's hydrocarbon production amounted to $1.684 million boe per day, a decrease of 8.6% compared to the first quarter '010. This negative operating result was principally due to the ongoing instability in Libya, which reduced the production by 129,000 boe per day compared to the first quarter of '010.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, PSA entitlements were negatively affected by the sharp increase in the oil price, with an estimated impact of 32,000 boe per day. The increase in the oil price, however, boosted the division's adjusted operating profit, which amounted to over &#x20AC;4.1 billion, up 32% compared to the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, overall, gas volumes sold including consolidated and associated companies totaled 31.6 bcm, up around 9% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>However, adjusted operating profit decreased by 24% compared to the same period of '010, due to the sharply low results delivered by the marketing business.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the first quarter of '011 was just over &#x20AC;1 billion, compared to &#x20AC;1.4 billion in the first quarter of '010. International transportation results showed a 4% increase. The regulated businesses generated &#x20AC;393 million, up 4% versus the corresponding period of last year. The increase is mainly due higher returns of new capital expenditures and efficiency actions.</p>
          <p>Adjusted pro forma EBITDA in the Marketing and Power business was negatively impacted by increasing competitive pressure in Italy and Europe, as well as unfavorable climate and the scenario effects.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the ongoing situation in Libya reduced the volumes to shippers and affected margins owing to the substitution of recently renegotiated Libyan gas with that from Russia and Algeria. It's worth reminding you that first quarter results do not include any benefits from renegotiations although these will be retroactive once agreements are finalized.</p>
          <p>Turning now to R&amp;M, in the first quarter of '011, the division reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;148 million versus a loss of &#x20AC;94 million in the same period of last year. The poor performance reflected an unfavorable scenario due to high cost for oil feedstock. The result was partially offset by the improved profitability of Eni's complex refineries helped by widening price differentials between sweet and sour crudes, higher pricing premiums for gasoline and gas oil compared to fuel oil.</p>
          <p>Utilization rates were up 9 percentage points year-on-year and refining also benefited from improved efficiency, the synergic integration of refineries and optimization of supply.</p>
          <p>Marketing was affected by a rapid rise in the cost of distillates that could not be immediately transferred to final prices, and by lower retail sales in Italy. These negatives were partially offset by higher sales on European networks.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of '11, the Petrochemical business reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;12 million, compared to a loss of &#x20AC;59 million in the first quarter of '10. This improvement was driven by higher selling prices, mainly for ethylene and propylene only partially offset by higher feedstock costs.</p>
          <p>Saipem delivered adjusted operating profits of &#x20AC;342 million, up 18% versus first quarter '10.</p>
          <p>Other Activities and Corporate showed an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;129 million in line with the results reported in the first quarter of '10.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of '11 operating activities generated cash flows of &#x20AC;4.2 billion. The cash flow generated financed out flows of &#x20AC;3.1 billion, predominately CapEx for &#x20AC;2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Net financial debt, as at the end of March, amounted to &#x20AC;25 billion, a reduction of &#x20AC;1.2 billion versus December '10. The debt to equity ratio decreased to 0.44, when compared to 0.47 at the year-end, despite a negative translation difference.</p>
          <p>Charges to equity of approximately &#x20AC;1.9 billion closed by the euro-dollar exchange rate, registered at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and now together with Claudio Descalzi and Domenico Dispenza, I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. First question comes from Mr. Barry MacCarthy from Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr. MacCarthy, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions please. Thank you for your comments on Libya at the beginning of the presentation. I wanted to ask if you were aware of the condition of the more downstream equipment, if you like, from your fields for example the export terminals and so on, which you may not own, but rely upon in order to get your oil to a purchaser, if those are in usable condition.</p>
          <p>And the second question was on Venezuela, on the impact of the windfall tax; firstly, is it right to think that Perla and gas generally is excluded, and how it might have an effect on your <mark type="ph" /> journing (11:02) prospect there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Export terminal in Libya, at the moment to what we have been reported, there is no damages and there is no problem. All the installation on hot standby, that are running and at the moment there is no problem.</p>
          <p>For Venezuela, the new bill agreement should be this morning, so we read this morning the new bill and the new clauses and the new project and then Orinoco Belt project and not subject until the recovery of the available investment to these taxes. So at the moment there is no impact on our assets both gas and oil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is gas specifically excluded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is no mention together, they're just mentioned to new project, new fresh investment. So for &#x2013; the gas is something that we have to go deeper and we got the tax bill and the statement this morning, but what we are sure about that there is no impact for our project because also gas, also Perla is a new project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Mr. Demichelis, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. Two questions. One coming back to Venezuela, if the gas price situation with Perla concluded or should we expect some more negotiations from that side? The second question is on Angola and Block 15/06, we've seen you signing an MoU for the FPSO, maybe you can give us some kind of indication in terms of when you are expecting that project to be up and running and what's the cost for that project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Venezuela again, the gas price has been <mark type="ph" /> ID'd already (13:13) so what we are working on these on the term sheet. And the expectation is to sign the final document in September-October. And after that we are ready to sanction the project. But we don't focus any problem and any additional renegotiation on the gas.</p>
          <p>For Angola, the west has been sanctioned and restarted and we are awarding the contracts. I think that for the &#x2013; because the overall cost, normally we don't disclose all the cost &#x2013; we can say that the internal rate of the project is above the other rate.</p>
          <p>Now that we have &#x2013; we have most of the contracts awarded in terms of cost, we are matching the expectations, so it's not absolutely far from what we expected. And as we said, the breakeven price is below the $50 per barrel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And for start-ups, are you changing that at all, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the startup is always scheduled in the full-year plan, so by 2014 &#x2013; 2013, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Jon Rigby from UBS. Mr. Rigby, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Two questions, just on the Gas and Power business and the marketing business, I know the strategy events in March, you said that sort of 2014 for a normalization of earnings. But flag that actually the conditions had already begun to look like that could be earlier. And then clearly we've had a subsequent tightening of the markets.</p>
          <p>So would you be able to characterize how you'd expect those changes in the market to start to impact your earnings across the balance of 2011, where I know that you sort of renegotiate a lot of your marketing contracts in the summer and early autumn.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the recent Skrugard discovery in the Barents. I noted that there was a licensing round awarded just after that discovery and I wondered if I could ask Mr. Descalzi whether he was happy with what he got and whether the applications for those licenses were done with the knowledge of, or with the expectation of what you would find on that discovery? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for Gas and Power, you could say that the situation is not yet completely clear. Of course, we expect some consequence from the events in Japan, from the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:16) Germany. But really it is too early to understand how difficult  it is with the market equation. So what we can say at this stage is that we reconfirm our guidance to be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:26) last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Norway, I think that, yeah, absolutely happy about what we have, absolutely we're happy about the result of Skrugard. That can be considered one of the best discoveries in the last 20 years in Norway. And that came after Goliat and other discovery that we made. That is not new because we started our exploration in Norway in the Barents Sea in the '91, '92.</p>
          <p>So we had the rate of success of 70%, and the two recent licensing that has been issued by the government is really to recognize <mark type="ph" /> the half working (17:22) term of the investment and good result we got in the last two years. So I think that we're absolutely happy and we think that Barents Sea will be a very, very important hub in the Norge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Alastair Syme from Citi. Mr. Syme, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a very quick question on E&amp;P gas prices, the realization dropped versus fourth quarter, and I might have missed it in the prepared comments, is that a mix effect or is it something else going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's &#x2013; in the first quarter we have got an increase of 5% and is less of the expectation due to the effect of the Libyan gas. So that is the only reason, otherwise there is a good increase with respect to 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but my comment was, there was quite a drop versus fourth quarter pricing, I agree year-on-year there was an increase but the &#x2013; the quarter-on-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first quarter is due to Libya, the drop &#x2013; the drop that we have in the gas realization, nothing has changed, we can talk about our equity production line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. So it's exclusively all of Europe then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing has changed, because &#x2013; you know, it's like in Egypt, Nigeria and also in the rest of our gas production in Norway, everything is absolutely in line with the previous month and the only really drastic change has been in Libya, that's all. And that's closed off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Ms. Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital. Ms. Haskins, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions please. The first is, if we assume Libyan exports are kept off the market for the remainder of this year, what would the tax guidance, the tax rate be for the year? And the second question is, obviously, you're trying to put some self-help programs in place in your downstream business, but I just wondered if there is anything super-remedial, effectually you can do to stem the losses that we saw this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the tax rate is, in this situation, there is a reduction &#x2013; a reduction on the tax debt, the tax rate for the E&amp;P because of the high tax rate in Libya, that is 65%, so we're going to add &#x2013; it will be reduced a few points for the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, a reduction of two points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a few points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is as far as the E&amp;P business is concerned. Then on a global basis, on a consolidated basis, for the Group taken as a whole, we do not expect any major changes compared to '010, because the reduction of the tax burden in the E&amp;P business is compensated by the major incidents of the E&amp;P results on the global results of the Group.</p>
          <p>So you know that the E&amp;P earnings are normally affected by an higher tax charge and since the E&amp;P business will represent the most important part of the earnings in '011, this will result, the combination of lower tax rate for E&amp;P and higher incidents of the E&amp;P business, as a result of this effect, there will be no major changes compared to '010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then the issue on sort of the downstream again in this year, the higher price environment that you're now envisaging, sort of what do you need to do in order to try and correct the losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, we do not expect any major changes also in the downstream business, in particular, in the refining business for the rest of the year. What we have experienced in the first quarter in terms of oil prices, will remain more or less the same for the rest of the year, apart from a limited effect generated by the seasonality of our business. But however the difference all over the year is negligible. So we do not expect any major changes also for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you don't expect any improvement in your downstream profitability in the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the refining &#x2013; the pure refining, no, we do not expect any major changes. Since we report with the marketing business, we expect that the commercial, the marketing segment will be capable to recover in the remaining part of the year. So all in all, putting everything together, we expect a slight improvement, but in particular in the refining &#x2013; I repeat, the pure industrial refining business we do not expect any major changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next questions come from Mr. Theepan Jothilingam from Morgan Stanley, London. Mr. Jothilingam, please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a quick question on Greenstream. Could you just confirm or give us a order of magnitude on what the impact of the shutdown at Greenstream would be for Q2 and the rest of the year? And then secondly just on CapEx and investment in Libya, I was just wondering if you can give us again sort of just guidance on what type of investment it was you expected in Libya pre the disruption. And then thirdly, how many exploration wells did you have planned in your program for Libya? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of Greenstream, you know that we don't want to disclose any major information relating to the effect caused by the shutdown of the Greenstream pipeline. Of course, in order to give detail or information to be necessary to disclose sensible, commercial information and we don't want to release such sensible information. As far as CapEx for Libya...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we didn't forecast any big CapEx for Libya in <mark type="ph" /> three-year (24:44) plan, just in 2011. For 2011, we had just $200 million, $250 million for more investment, we can say and we shifted this investment for production optimization in other countries to compensate for what we are losing in Libya. And exploration &#x2013; exploration in Libya, we are now &#x2013; we're under force majeure for all the Libyan contracts. We don't have lots of big efforts &#x2013; exploration effort in Libya. We drilled &#x2013; we drilled the exploration wells in the offshore in the last two-year, a couple of years. So we &#x2013; just &#x2013; few months in the desert, one or two months of &#x2013; and we are &#x2013; force majeure, but we don't have any big exploration campaign in Libya for the future.</p>

          <p>If I can go back for a moment to the first question, we offered all the clients taking Libyan gas, other gas from other sources. Most of the customers accepted this offer, which means we are taking more of Russian and more Algerian gas to supply them, so the effect is there, but we are trying to compensate a little bit <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:04).</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Could you provide the breakdown in R&amp;M between marketing and refining contribution also to better understand the evolution based on your guidance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of results achieved by the end of March, you can consider that predominantly the loss has been generated almost entirely by the refining business, while the marketing activity has delivered more or less a breakeven situation and I believe that is enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the improvement is starting from a breakeven point and while are you expecting refining still --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For sure &#x2013; well, I repeat the marketing in particular segment is affected predominantly by seasonality is quite normal to have a low level of activity volumes and earnings generated the first quarter of the year and we expect a recovery in the incoming months.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. You know that we are disposing three pipelines: TAG, TENP and Transitgas. TAG, as far as TAG is concerned we are discussing with the customer the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:12) and we are confident that we'll be able to close everything in over the next few weeks. And as far as TENP and Transitgas, their situation is a little bit more complicated due to the process that we have selected for the disposal. Now we have opened data room, we have given access to the data room to few selected bidders then we expect to receive their binding offer within the end of next week after that we will select those bidders those entities with whom we will start the negotiation exclusivity basis and we are confident also for them to be able to close the deal. This will require some more time, so we are targeting the second half of '011 for the closing of the two transactions.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon to everyone. Could you please give us some details on that &#x2013; the possible disposal of your stake? There are rumors that Angolan investor could take 25% direct stake on the company?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you are referring to some press speculation and we do not comment these type of speculation. What we can say is exactly the same situation that we have already to communicate to the market over the last few weeks, meaning that we have received some unsolicited offer; now we are examining those proposal. Of course this activity is done in coordination with the other partners in particular with the Portuguese government. But, as you know today due to the crisis of the Portuguese government, we have to stop &#x2013; to interrupt this process. So we are estimating that it will be necessary some more time, but we are confident that in the next few weeks to be able to resume this activity and being capable to identify the final solution within the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. I just had a couple of quick questions; both on Gas and Power actually. Firstly, you said you are offsetting the lower availability of Libyan gas through other supply sources, and I think you mentioned Russia and Algeria. I'm just wondering if you're able to quantify the contribution of these supply sources not just between Russia and Algeria but also possibly any gas you're taking from the North Sea, LNG and also your own storage.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'm just wondering how the current Libyan situation change your negotiating position vis-&#xE0;-vis your major gas suppliers such as Gazprom and Sonatrach. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for the first question I would refer that normally we offer to our customers capital amount portfolio <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:14) Algeria and from Russia. But in fact the gas from our other portfolio that you know is the one the most diversified portfolio any other company in Europe.</p>
          <p>The second question is if the we made some consequence from the effect of Libyan oil negotiations. Up to now this has not been a question, a problem, of course <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:44) Libyan gas market would have some impact on the overall market situation, but this I expect has not been <mark type="ph" /> according to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:57) negotiation <mark type="indiscernible" /> Algeria (32:59) and Gazprom in Russia.</p>
