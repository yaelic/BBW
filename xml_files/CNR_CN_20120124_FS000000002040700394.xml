          <p>Hi, thank you for joining us for CN's Fourth Quarter Call. I'd like to remind you about the comments that have already been made regarding forward-looking statements. With us today is Claude Mongeau, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Luc Jobin, Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Keith Creel, Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer; and J.J. Ruest, Executive Vice-President and Chief Marketing Officer.</p>
          <p>As many of you already know, CN's board of directors yesterday decided to suspend certain payments and benefit compensation to Mr. Harrison and we have filed proceedings to affirm CN's rights in the U.S. Federal Court in Illinois. We do not have any further comments on this matter and we would ask that you would please focus on CN's outstanding fourth quarter financial results in your questions. In order to be fair to all the participants, please limit your questions to one each.</p>
          <p>And with that, it's now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Claude Mongeau, CN's President and Chief Executive Officer.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob, and thank you for all of you to join us on this fourth quarter call. I'm very pleased with our performance in that last quarter of the year. I think we were helped with weather but we finished with record revenue performance. We have the outstanding carloading volume and revenue performance all the way to the end of the year on December 31. So J.J. will take you through that, but it's, overall, if I adjust for currency, our revenues are up 12%. Clearly, if you look at it for the quarter but also for the full year, we were successful in outpacing the economy but also in outpacing our peers. I think our carloadings for the full year were 4% versus an average for the industry that was up around 3.2%.</p>
          <p>So our game plan is working from a revenue standpoint and we are bringing it to the bottom line, solid financial results, our operating ratio at the 64.7% reflects stellar productivity throughout the quarter, but we also have to face issues and headwind and Luc will give you some details whether it's stock-based compensation or fuel lag which we have to contend with.</p>
          <p>EPS for the quarter on a reported basis was C$1.32, adjusted was C$1.30. Either way, the EPS is up 20% which is a strong performance on a year-over-year basis and free cash flow the same. We've finished the year with effectively just under C$1.2 billion of a free cash flow and that's included the benefit from a number of well-timed and very smart monetization which helped us deliver on that performance.</p>
          <p>If I look at the full year, that theme of strong revenue performance was not just a fourth quarter phenomenon, it was really throughout the full year. We've had our record carloading performance as a range of commodities where we are back at peak level, and we brought that also to the revenue line with solid pricing and a very responsive fuel surcharge. It helped us cover for increases in the price of diesel.</p>
          <p>Strong financial performance backed up by very solid operational services, and as Keith will show you in a minute, our operational performance and our service performance, we are clearly trying to balance operational and service excellence and it's helping us to deliver those strong results. We are doing the trade-offs in the right manner, and it's helping us bringing additional income and additional business in support of our customer. It's really consistent with our strategy to be a true supply chain enabler, to encourage collaboration and to find ways with our customers and transportation partners to go after efficiency but also to help them win in the marketplace and help them grow their own business.</p>
          <p>I was also very pleased that just before Christmas actually, we had two collective agreements that have been agreements in principle that have been struck with the Teamsters, our Locomotive Engineers and with our Maintenance of Way employees, the field workers. And those two agreements are out for ratification. We should get the results pretty soon. But it was particularly pleasing to see that we were able to reach those collective agreements actually before the term of the agreement. So we did not need any conciliation, any mediation. We struck a fair deal and we plan to build on those agreements to continue our push with our colleagues and railroaders on a go forward basis.</p>
          <p>So overall, I think 2011 was a solid year. We are delivering on our agenda, and I will let the team give you some of the color and detail on that strong performance starting with Keith on the operation results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Claude. Your comments are certainly appreciating, as you've stated, and certainly with a clear understanding of our financial results demonstrates. Our railroad ran extremely well during the fourth quarter of 2011. I'm very proud of the men on this operating team leveraged our precision railroading model with our ongoing innovation, supply chain collaboration efforts with our customers and our supply chain partners. And these fourth quarter result established a very solid prove point that, in fact, we can produce operational and service excellence in concert with each other. There's no doubt in the minds of my operating team that service and productivity gains are complimentary when we jointly pursue them with our supply chain partners in the spirit of innovation and teamwork. So the formula's working.</p>
          <p>Let's take a few minutes to review how this rolled out during the fourth quarter. First, let's look at our operational excellence type of business approach. These are the same metrics we report on quarterly to provide a useful summary of our performance in the areas of the highest impact on our cost and service. Starting at the top left corner is our GTMs per train mile or our trainload metric. The trainload continues to increase as we successfully absorb much of our revenue growth in our existing trains.</p>
          <p>With that said, we still have more opportunity in this area, not by making our biggest trains longer but rather by increasing the size of the average train. We're leveraging our investments in distributed power alongside and convert this opportunity as our traffic level climbs. Volumes were up 7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we move this traffic through our terminals faster. We produce reduced terminal dwell and increased car velocity. So the operating metrics and performance are proving solid in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Both train speed and locomotive productivity were essentially flat with our performance last year. I'll say this does not indicate a performance lift, it's just more of a reflection of our conscious decision that we took take a small tradeoff from productivity for the flexibility to pre-position our assets specifically as we ramped up for the grain peak in the fall, which we've seen in the revenue side as a benefit, and also on the coal portfolio by pushing coal to the export terminals to make sure that we constantly had inventory on hand for export loading. Of course, this required a few extra locomotives to make this happen.</p>
          <p>So overall, things on the operating side went very well in the fourth quarter under this increased volume that we've noted. And as a result, the stable operation that we have at CN with our precision model as well gave myself and my senior team ample time to work with J.J. and his team and directly with our customers and partners as we've raised the bar on service excellence. So let's take a look at some of those results.</p>
          <p>Although this chart represents just two of the many customer service touch points we've converted and improved at CN, the results you see on order fulfillment and grain spotting reliability are two solid improvement examples our customers have experienced in 2011. First, on the merchandise business side, car and fulfillment of our CN supplied fleet improved 4 percentage points versus the same period last year. This was particularly positive as demand against these fleets increased 3% over the same period. A major contributor here is our car management excellence initiative in which we've turned our cash distributors into supply chain managers, greatly increased our communications with our customers which has proven powerful, combined with their ongoing fleet size and the renewal processes, which our operating team, of course, delivers with solid field execution.</p>
          <p>On the bulk side, a key measure of our service success is a 7-point improvement in grain spot and the reliability we've produced year-over-year. In the past, we measured our spotting performance to the week. We now measure spotting performance to the day. Our customers and our partners in the grain supply chain value this reliability and they are rewarding us with higher demand. This approach allowed CN to supply 12% more cars year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In fact, the fourth quarter of 2011 was the best we've experienced in the past 10 years.</p>
          <p>On the asset side of the equation, we also saw improvement. Car cycle time in the fourth quarter was reduced by 11% which, of course, we supplied against demand for that additional business. An additional meaningful prove point, we're happy to acknowledge several of the West Coast grain terminals feed on those records as well in the fourth quarter of 2011, which we feel strongly we helped enable through our scheduled grain plan and focus on demand supply chain efficiency.</p>
          <p>So I'll wrap my comments up by saying our strategy to balance operational and service excellence is delivering the high quality product while at the same time, maintaining our industry-leading operation efficiency. I'm a firm believer that success breeds success. So no doubt in 2012, we will continue this approach, both service and operational efficiency, pursuing that with tenacity as we continue weaving the CN way of doing business into our operating and corporate DNA.</p>
          <p>Now, over to J.J. to speak to growth that these efforts have supported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Keith and good afternoon to everybody who's joining us on the call today. As Claude already said in his opening comment, the fourth quarter was always an all-time revenue record for CN, and we will keep that momentum going in 2012.</p>
          <p>So let's review our result for the fourth quarter. We have increased revenue in 12% versus last year. This is on a currency-adjusted basis. The 12% breakdown is as follow: 4% came from volume; same-store price increased by 4.0% in line with the prior three quarter of 2011; and the fuel surcharge brought in 3.9% from fuel surcharge revenue. We had a C$16 million lag in our fuel surcharge in the fourth quarter. The mix was positive, an impact of about 1%. And for the first time in a long time, the impact of exchange was almost flat.</p>
          <p>So if we look at the result in more detail by business unit &#x2013; I'm on page 10 and all of my comment again will be on FX adjusted basis. Starting with petroleum and chemical revenue which was up 13% and it was on very strong petroleum product growth. Crude oil business more than doubled from the third quarter, and the gains were enabled by our facilities in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Diesel, jet fuel and heavy oil also posted very strong gains in the quarter, and the chemical shipment were basically on par versus last year, they were flat.</p>
          <p>Metals and minerals grew by an impressive 29%, and shale gas drilling activities had a very strong impact into that. Frac sand carloads were up 43%; height carloads were up 50%. And we have new production facilities located on CN, namely pipe plant in Ontario for drilling, drilling pipe as well as frac sand mines in Wisconsin and Michigan. Metal shipment increased for steel, raw material and iron ore, and we also had some further market share gain in copper and nickel concentrate.</p>
          <p>Forest product revenue rose 12% in the fourth quarter. Lumber and panel shipment to U.S. continue to trend upward. Overseas lumber, we're up 25% in carload in the quarter. Bulk shipment was somewhat weaker due to the softer wood market condition in the fourth quarter and busy export of wood pellet were up 34% in carloads. Automotive was up 12%. The West Coast import were up with Japanese production returning to normal, and the domestic producers on CN had a good market share quarter as well as strong truck sales.</p>
          <p>Bucking our positive trend, coal revenue at CN were down 1%. The Ridley Terminal in Prince Rupert had a prolonged shutdown, which was there for capacity expansion program that resulted in a temporary cutback of export coal as well as some of what Keith was mentioning about staging some train. The U.S. Gulf thermal coal export increased by 3,000 carloads in the quarter. However, our U.S. domestic coal was really affected negatively and that declined 6,800 carloads.</p>
          <p>The story on grain. Grain was up 5% in revenue. In the U.S., the export soybean and corn were down <mark type="ph" /> 18% (14:45) in carload while our domestic business was fairly good. And in Canada, we had a record quarter in term of grain. In the fourth quarter, CN market share stood at 51%. The fertilizer revenue was down 5%. The demand for potash was slow in last quarter and buyers are waiting for lower potash price.</p>
          <p>The overseas intermodal market was up15% in revenue. The Trans-Pacific volume is doing very well for CN. Prince Rupert and Vancouver combined, the volume increased 20%, outpacing our Canadian competition but also more relevant outpacing the West Coast industry average.</p>
          <p>On the domestic side of intermodal, the revenue was up 17%. We made some gains across all segment in domestic intermodal. We are capitalizing on U.S. trucking condition in U.S. We grew our domestic U.S. business by 22% in volume. The cross border business grew 29% in volume and the Canadian cities domestic volume grew by 7% in volume.</p>
          <p>And finally, to close the review of revenue, our non-rail revenue was up 10%. The growth in non-rail revenue was driven by our R&amp;R terminal and vessel and by our CNPL local trucking services. These gains were more than enough to offset the lost revenue on the terminal. And as you would recall, CN sold the CN coal terminal in Convent, Louisiana, and that took place in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at the outlook &#x2013; I'm now looking at page 11 and we will start with intermodal. Intermodal is &#x2013; has been an engine of growth for us the last two years and that definitely is going to be the case for 2012 as well. We definitely we believe, at least that's what our customers tell us, we have the strongest supply chain service package out there to help our customers grow their own business in their own market.</p>
          <p>We are opening some new train service from Prince Rupert to Calgary and Edmonton this year in support of our new log park in Calgary which will open in 2013. We also just opened a new terminal services to serve some of the market in Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p>
          <p>Our wholesale and retail volume will be strong. We are getting more market traction with our different initiative to grow our business in both Canada and United States. The U.S. consumer confidence index improved. It was currently at 64.5, which is up from a 55.2 November, and up for the 49.0 of October.</p>
          <p>If we look at the bulk outlook &#x2013; I'm on page 12 &#x2013; coal and pet coke by the West Coast starting with the West Coast business of CN importing coal and pet coke. We are poised for a year of record on the West Coast. The capacity expansion of the Ridley terminal is very well in place. They had a good production around here since mid-December, and this year we are targeting an increase probably in the range of 30% increase in revenue for the West Coast of business.</p>
          <p>Natural gas price, though, are cheap and will remain cheap this year and that will negatively affect our carload of U.S. thermal coal, however, our export of U.S. thermal coal via the Gulf will grow over since 2011.</p>
          <p>In fertilizer, Q1 will be soft and that's because of the slow demand on the potash right now, but the long-term prospect is bright. We are pleased to confirm that Canpotex starting this 1st of July.</p>
          <p>On Canadian grain, the outlook for Q1 is also very positive. We have a very good order book for wheat and canola, and <mark type="ph" /> key (18:08) service offering is the best in term of service offering in the industry. U.S. volume will be down. It's because of the weak U.S. export of corn and soybean. The U.S. farmer is waiting for better selling price at this point and that may be a story more for Q2 as opposed to Q1.</p>
          <p>If we look at our manufacturing sector on page 13, global oil price remain high. Shale drilling activity is also very strong, and we think that for most of market that we serve, they will stay about the breakeven point for the shale play. This will produce significant revenue growth in our crude business, our metal business and as well as our frac sand business.</p>
          <p>We are expecting steel operating rate to do better than last year and to be in the range of 75% to 78% operating rates for United States. This will be driven by local steel consumption in automotive sector, the energy sector and the heavy equipment sector. We anticipate a moderate improvement in U.S. housing starts; and, therefore, in our construction-related volume, we have in our forecast 700,000 units. We also expect moderate growth in automotive production and U.S. sales of domestic sales at 13.5 million units.</p>
          <p>The ISM purchasing manager index increased to 53.9% in December, which is up from the average of 51.0% than it was in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In closing, so far this year, we have a good start of January. Our service is solid and our revenue is up in excess of 10% so far. It's very early in the year. We have produced two very strong year back-to-back and we're positive about the outlook for this year and we will tell you more of our many commercial initiatives in the upcoming February 8 and 9 New Orleans investor deal that Bob has put together.

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, J.J. Now turning to page 15 of the presentation, let me walk you through the key financial highlights for the fourth quarter of the year. Revenues were up 12% to just under C$2.4 billion. Practically all sectors progressed in several categories, as J.J. described, once again, registered a performance that outpaced base market conditions. Operating income was C$839 million, up 8% versus last year, driven by strong revenue growth but partly offset by higher fuel and stock-based compensation costs. Other income was up slightly on account of a couple of small parcel sales. Our net income for the fourth quarter was C$592 million, up 18%. And the reported diluted EPS was C$1.32, up 22%.</p>
          <p>Now, excluding an income tax recovery of C$0.02 per share relating to prior years, the adjusted diluted EPS stood at C$1.30, up 20% versus 2010. On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate was 25% in the quarter resulting from a number of small adjustments to the year's estimated tax expense. Our operating ratio was 64.7% in the quarter versus 63.4% last year, an increase of 1.3 points.</p>
          <p>Allow me to turn to the operating expenses on the next page to provide some color on this unusual increase in our operating ratio in the quarter. First, it's important to know that we came through with another solid quarter in terms of operational productivity, in terms of our metrics, in terms of our customer service and our overall expense management.</p>
          <p>Keith and his team continued to make progress in improving trainload, terminal dwell, yard productivity and fuel efficiency. Our operating expenses were C$1.538 billion, up 15% versus last year, and the key drivers were fuel prices and stock-based compensation.</p>
          <p>Let me start by labor and fringe benefit costs. These were up 20% versus last year at C$511 million. Now, close to half of the variance, or C$40 million, was the result of an increase of about C$10 in our stock price in the quarter, from C$70 to C$80. Now, you'll recall that we had anticipated this reversal in our stock-based compensation expense in the third quarter's report earlier this year. So in the fourth quarter, this impact amounts to a headwind of C$0.07 of EPS.</p>
          <p>Now, wages were up 6%, or C$27 million. This was the result of wage cost inflation of approximately 3% and higher head count for 3%. Meanwhile, benefit costs, including pension, post-employment benefits, health and welfare were up 4%. Our head count just over &#x2013; stood at just over 23,000 employees, and we were essentially flat versus the third quarter and up 5% versus last year, roughly in line with our GTM growth of 5%. The head count increase was driven by a 3% higher base workforce and a 2% increase related to advanced hiring ahead of attrition to allow for training.</p>
          <p>Looking to 2012, we do expect head count to stabilize and be closer to replacing for attrition. But we continue to monitor our business levels and economic indicators to adapt as the need be. On our fuel expense, it increased by C$87 million to C$382 million.</p>
          <p>On account of prices being up some 25% in the quarter, while the balance of the change was attributable to the volume increase partly offset by efficiency gains of 1.5%. So the negative impact of increased fuel prices, i.e. the fuel lag, was C$16 million, or 3%, C$0.03 of EPS in the quarter. On the casualty and other cost category, we came in with C$56 million, C$9 million better than last year, as we continue to incur lower G&amp;A expenses and experience lower claims. This follows the trend that we've seen all year, but the benefit of such improved experience is clearly slowing down, and we'll be looking at more difficult comps in 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to our full-year results: We wrapped up 2011 with over C$9 billion in revenues, a 9% increase, or 11% on a constant currency basis. This was achieved with 4% increase in volume, a combined 4% increase in pricing and mix, 3% for fuel surcharge, offset by 2% of FX. Our operating earnings grew at the same rate as revenues to reach C$3.3 billion. Our operating ratio stood at 63.5%, 10 basis points better than last year. Net income stood at C$2.457 billion, up 17%. And this translated into a 21% increase in reported diluted EPS at C$5.41.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of our major asset sales and some of the income tax adjustments, the adjusted diluted EPS stood at C$4.84, a 15% increase over 2010, or 17% on a constant currency basis. In terms of free cash flow, we had a record year and generated C$1.175 billion. This was the product of better operating results, higher proceeds from major asset sales and after taking into account a C$350 million special pension contribution which was made in the fourth quarter of the year. These free cash flow improvements were partly offset by higher cash taxes, higher capital expenditures and higher dividends. Including capital leases, we finished the year with a C$1.712 billion in capital investments, which translates into a 19% of our revenues. Our debt-to-total-capital stood at 40% and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA was 1.7 times.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me turn to our 2012 guidance. While it's obvious that we have an uncertain global economic environment, we continue to see a gradual, although modest, improvement in the North American economy. We assume North American industrial production will be lower than in 2011 but nevertheless in the 3% range. Furthermore, we expect the U.S. housing starts to reach 700,000 units and U.S. motor vehicle sales to attain 13.5 million units. These and other key assumptions underpinning out outlook should translate into mid-single digit carload growth in 2012. And on the pricing front, we will continue with our inflation plus policy.</p>
          <p>One element that is emerging in 2012 as a significant headwind is an increase of approximately C$120 million in our pension expense. Our plan has historically enjoyed a very solid financial position on account of a conservative funding policy as we have not taken contribution holidays and we've also made special contributions to the tune of C$650 million in the last two years. In addition, we've enjoyed a strong investment performance over the years.</p>
          <p>Our plan is a sound design that calls for risk and cost sharing measures between the company and its members. However, the weak economic environment has led to a continued decline in interest rates over the last several years and also lower investment returns more recently. This has resulted in a significant increase in pension obligation and the accumulation of actuarial losses. In 2012, we will be amortizing a portion of these accumulated actuarial losses and this is the major source of the increased expense. This will mean an impact of over one point, actually close to 1.5 of operating ratio and a headwind of 4% on our EPS growth.</p>
          <p>So with this in context, our annual guidance for 2012, as it's aiming to achieve up to 10% of EPS growth over 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of C$4.84. We're also calling for free cash flow in the order of C$875 million. This assumes a capital investment program of approximately C$1.750 billion and a 15% increase in our dividends. It also takes into account total pension contribution of approximately C$275 million in 2012, as we adapt our funding to address a natural solvency deficit which we estimate at this point to be approximately C $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>So the CN team remains, as always, committed to delivering superior results and creating value for our shareholders, and we continue to leverage a solid pipeline of productivity and growth initiatives in 2012.</p>
          <p>On this note, Claude, back over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, thank you, Keith, J.J. and Luc. I think a good rundown on the results. Clearly, the fourth quarter finished the year strong but the overall year was also to me a good indication that our strategy and our game plan is unfolding very well. To be able to grow faster in the economy, grow faster than our peers in the industry, to contain expense and actually come up as a leader once again in expense management during 2011, to deliver 15% EPS growth in what was good but sluggish economic growth is testament to the strength of our franchise, the focus of our workforce and our game plan overall.</p>
          <p>So we're very pleased with those results. We're looking forward to 2012. If the economy stays with us, we should be delivering another year of very, very solid performance. And as Luc indicated, other than the pension headwind, all of our key other drivers are pointing in the right direction for another solid year of financial performance.</p>
          <p>J.J. said it earlier, as I told it on my comments, we are looking forward to see as many of you as possible in sunny New Orleans in early February on the 8th and the 9th. We will have an Investor Day there where we intend to, obviously, give you some color on our guidance for 2012 but even more importantly, to allow you get a good sense of our key initiatives, what we're doing to expand our agenda, supply chain collaboration and the focus that we have on balancing operational and service excellence. We have the entire management team ready and it should be a great meeting, and we look forward to see you there to talk about the long-term future for CN.</p>
          <p>And with that, Patrick, we will take questions from those on the call.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wonder if you could just give us your perspective on the outcome of the recent Canpotex negotiations and update us on some of the issues that would need to be resolved before we could see an export terminal up in Prince Rupert?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The current agreement that was announced earlier this week is something that we were &#x2013; we got &#x2013; we were hoping to get in the Vancouver, and the work is ongoing. In the case of Rupert, there's a commercial agreement in place, but a commercial agreement to be executed need to have to a terminal. So sometime this year, Canpotex, which is basically most of the capital money will continue their studies.</p>
          <p>On the CN side, we do have a quarter capacity to go to Rupert with, whether it's potash, coal or intermodal. And we've announced earlier this year, the rail corridor which is on the Ridley Island. So we are well equipped on our side to do more bulk business or intermodal business in Rupert. The question is really for the shareholders of Canpotex to decide when and if they want to move forward with the terminal in Rupert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I might ask one second question, your CapEx guidance for this year implies soft of a high single-digit increase over 2011. I wonder if you could just elaborate on some of your major growth CapEx initiatives for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, the CapEx guidance is a C$1.750 billion which is very close to last year. Last year, we ended up the year at C$1.712 billion. So we're approximately in the same range. We'll be providing more detail and color at the analyst conference in terms of where we're focusing some of the spending. But clearly, we are enhancing our capacity and our velocity on some of the key segments and some of the key lines such as the BC North area where we have a lot of business coming on to both Vancouver and as well up in Ridley, and that's really where we're focusing some of the CapEx.</p>
          <p>PTC continues to be an increasing category for some of our spending, and we've also got some equipment that we would anticipate to be adding to the fleet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of growth, there is another couple of projects in our capital expenditure for the Calgary terminal. It's going to be in full force during 2012. We've talked about the track spend for instance earlier which is a growth area where we are supporting our customers and upgrading some of the segments that need to be upgraded to allow for their siting expansion and trans-loading facilities. So we'll give you a better sense of all of that at our New Orleans meeting. But it's lined up to support both the growth and productivity that we are targeting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask you about the volume view. You had very good volume performance in 2011, and I think you're saying kind of mid-single digits of similar volume growth you're expecting this year. What do you think are the greatest risks to that view? Is there a significant risk from how your competitor, CP, runs? Is it a risk to lower natural gas prices, maybe drilling activity or just kind of broader economy risk? Or how should we think about risk that those volumes might be a bit lower than mid-single digits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, as you know, there's always a risk with the economy. We're calling for what I would call a continued modest economic recovery. But if there were issues in Europe or if there were issues with the global emerging markets slowing down, obviously, the impact in terms of North American economic growth could be real and that's obviously a risk. As for the rest, we are growing in pretty much every category. Our market share opportunities are broad-based, it's trucks, it's new markets altogether, it's gateway traffic coming through Canada, as opposed to coming through the U.S. It is in some instance against our principal competitor here in Canada but we are focusing and gardening in all direction if we need &#x2013; if we have to grow and outpace the economy overall. J.J., do you have any other comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's very, very broad based and very diverse so it's as much Canada and U.S., east and west, natural resource, manufacturing, global trade. I think the global trade overseas <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:12) will still be a very good start in 2012. The consumer confidence is maybe not the greatest but it's slightly getting better and the product that we offer to their shipping line is retroactive. The shipping industry is not making any money, but their volume is growing year-over-year. So I think &#x2013; I guess the short answer is we have a very diverse source of growth here. We don't depend on one thing or two things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you &#x2013; does your mid single-digits assume that you kind of keep constant share versus CP; and if you take some additional share, that'd maybe be upside, or what's your underlying kind of share assumption versus CP in the volume guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're assuming that the initiative we have last year will maintain traction. So our West Coast product has been growing because the market is growing and also because we've been able to gain market share versus what we call the Western railroad and the Western port. There's really four railroad and many ports in the west. We're competing with all of them.</p>
          <p>And then you're right, like, it's the same thing. It's not just CN/CP. It's much more diverse and broad-based than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I guess maybe I'll just ask one on pricing. There's certainly been a lot of press here on where your margins are versus competitors. Just wondering if you're getting any pushback at all from customers on pricing at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For pricing, nobody wants to pay any price increase if you're a consumer and then you buy, you always look for the best price, best value. So what we sell here based on the product that Keith gives me day-in day-out to sell, we sell on the value. So we present ourselves as the cheapest cost not the cheapest price. So, therefore, in general, we come in with a price which is slightly maybe higher than some other option, but all-in the cost of using that product because it's more reliable, it's steady, it's dependable, gives the customers a better cost. So from that point of view, there's always a desire from the buyer to get a better price, but our product's appealing. We've got a value proposition. We don't sell on cost. We sell on value, and we do have to compete so the next best option is always important to this final decision. The run rate we had in 2011, we're satisfied with and we think it's a good run rate for 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Hey, Keith, in the past, CN's done an awful lot of co-production with competitors, and I'm just curious if you think there's a lot more scope for doing that up in Canada given the relative overlap of the networks? Or have you pretty much maxed out on that opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I wouldn't say maxed out, but certainly, we've converted quite a bit of the opportunity that was on the ground. We've done some aggressive stuff in the east with our partners in the rail industry, and we've done some things in the west, even fine tuning what we had in the West Coast on the Vancouver area as recently as last quarter, which at the end of the day will help benefit both parties. So it's &#x2013; so far there's still some opportunities, nothing monumental, nothing that would equal what we've done in the past. But we're always looking for an opportunity. If one presents itself, it makes sense to co-produce then certainly we'll step up to the table and convert it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Keith, was there anything in the fourth quarter &#x2013; it seemed like an easier weather quarter. Is that something we need to keep in mind when we think about costs when we're modeling going forward?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Fadi Chamoun from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just to follow up on the potash, maybe J.J. you can help us understand a little bit the value proposition CN offers for a potential Prince Rupert terminal. I mean, if the choices are for expanding some of the other facilities on the West Coast, Vancouver and Portland, versus Prince Rupert, what does Prince Rupert bring to the table that would sway that volume growth in the medium term, I guess, to go to Prince Rupert? The other related question is also would CN be inclined to participate in building a terminal there and potentially getting a little bit more involved in the supply chain if that was something that would facilitate that decision for Canpotex to go to Prince Rupert?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So starting with the first question, Rupert is an attractive port because it is deep water. Not that Vancouver is not deep water but Rupert is even deeper water. But about for the product that goes to the northern part of Asia, it is a little closer. It shows some saving time in those cases. It's a greenfield site. That is, you start with a map where you can actually lay down your terminal the way it should be done if you want to &#x2013; you want to build a terminal that could go to Phase II and Phase III, you know, 5, 10, 15, 25 years from now. And Rupert can give you that because there's no neighbor. The footprint that Canpotex has under an option gives them &#x2013; it gives them a long, long time in term of access to market and future expansion.</p>
          <p>Then, you have the rail line. It is a different rail line than when you go to Vancouver, so it gives them redundancy. We have the North line at CN, currently this other contract they're using the <mark type="ph" /> salt line of OCN and CP (43:03). So it gives you a redundancy in case of disruption caused by whatever the reason that it might be &#x2013; derailment, weather, things that might happen on occasion over the years. And the CN service from the Saskatchewan we access all these lines. One of them actually we're going to physically connect here this year, the one that we don't physically connect today. And our service from the Prairies is, as experienced last winter, is pretty good &#x2013; pretty good, very dependable and whether it's grain or potash, I mean, Keith's guys do a great job of moving the train to the West Coast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I would say, Fadi, in two words it's a very compelling proposal if you're looking at diversity in your supply chain and you have an aggressive growth plan which is what the Canpotex is after. So we feel very good about our chances to convince them to stay in Canada and have a supply chain solution that meets their needs.</p>
          <p>As for your other question, we would certainly be happy to work with them and offer more seamless switching service in and out of the terminal and even help them if there's a need to in terms of operating that facility. We do that in other locations. But it would really be for Canpotex to decide if they want us to be involved in that activity or not, where our offer is based on the strength of our rail service and I think it stand on its own two feet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just quickly also on labor, just trying to understand the mechanics. Your head count grew at above rates than your volume in 2011, if I'm looking at this right, and you seem to be suggesting that 2012 will see much better productivity or underlying productivity in labor. And I'm just wondering what are the mechanics that have held you back last year from doing a lot of the, sort of, not growing the head count as much and why is this sort of reverting in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the biggest driver there, or trigger, was our decision, number one, to hire ahead to handle the business; and, number two, the challenge we have with training with our attrition. We've talked about our attrition labor that we have in the company. We're going to be experiencing turnover in the company through to 2015 that equates about 50% of our workforce. If you do that on the running trade side, you've got about a six-month lag time, so to speak, to go out and hire and train a qualified conductor and, of course, the conductors become engineers. So there is &#x2013; there was an investment, a conscious decision that made that I think you see now more steady state since we've absorbed that. And we'll grow the head count, so to speak, at least on the running trade side more similar to matching the growth in business with an expectation that we will get productivity as well.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Matt Troy from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A question on international imports, your volumes were quite strong. I think you referenced 20% growth through Vancouver and Rupert, certainly a standout versus what we're seeing from the other railroads and other ports. I'm wondering if you could just pick apart &#x2013; I'm trying to get a sense for market growth versus what is residual share gain from CP's service disruption last year. What's driving that growth and if you could just maybe put some primers as to why it so far exceeds what we're seeing elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't do that versus CP as such because I don't really have those numbers that &#x2013; we don't have that kind of level of detail. But definitely in the West Coast, we did add some destination in 2011 where we have destination that we served last year that we didn't serve as much in 2010. One of them is Detroit, for example. By the way, when we talk about Rupert and Vancouver, both these ports do a lot of Canadian business and U.S. business. Both of them do all the Canadian cities and the U.S. cities just as well. So Detroit last year, 2011, has been strong for us. We've also increased our presence in other area of the U.S., like Chicago, Memphis and Arcadia and Wisconsin &#x2013; Montreal, Toronto as well. So it's been very, very diverse.</p>
          <p>Western Canada is also an area of increased trade or consumer consumption or things that come from Asia, China which are used in the energy sector in Western Canada. We also have a very strong, extremely strong export program. You have heard a number of time about what we do on lumber, for example. A huge amount of lumber, B.C. lumber going to Asia. All of that find its way into a container. A lot of that now is actually done in Prince George on the new CN ramp. 2011 was already the real success here for Prince George as we did <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:46). It's a very wide range of things regarding import, export, source loading, new destination market. It's not about just the one event that took place, like an Asian competitor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's key for you to understand, Matt, that at the end of the day in intermodal, where the traffic goes is a decision that takes place one box at a time. So boxes can move on one shipping line that is served by CN or it can move on another shipping line that is served by <mark type="ph" /> Vienna (48:25) at a different port. And so really the better your service offering is, the better your transit time, the better you're capable of putting all the pieces together from a supply chain standpoint so that you have less dwell at the port, better transit time on rail, better connection all the way to the dockside out of your inland terminal, the more of those boxes will find their way on the shipping lines that we serve and that's what happening.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question, the last question, chemicals &#x2013; it's a more significant traffic relative to your commodity mix given its importance as a feedstock in the industrial economy. Certainly, your trends no different than what we've seen elsewhere in the class ones. You were up about 7% the first quarter, up 2% to 3% in the second and third, and then fourth you were actually off a little bit.</p>
          <p>Are you seeing anything either from a destocking perspective or restocking perspective that gives you concern that some of the slowing we saw on consumer and the lack of a peak season in the back half of 2011 might be creeping into the industrial landscape? Or are you comfortable based on your conversation with customers that we're just taking a slight pause here? What's behind that kind of moderation in chemical cargo growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For example, if we put fertilizer as a chemical, there's been some destocking because people are waiting for somewhat better price. So if you're a wholesaler or a buyer, you'd like &#x2013; you don't want to have too much product on hand. You just want to see if you're going to get a better price, which might be the case, might be not. The same thing in plastics. I think there was an effort by some of our major large chemical customers to finish the year with a good cash flow, meaning not having too much inventory in their hand as finished product because they may stop &#x2013; they may have to take a write down, meaning the value of the product may have been lower in the fourth quarter than it was earlier in year.</p>
          <p>That in itself though is good because if our customers enter 2012 with low inventory, when the demand starts to pick up or the signal that chemical price have to go up &#x2013; these are cyclical commodities they move fairly fast. As soon as the signal either plastics, potash or fertilizer price start to go up, people want to buy ahead of the next price increase, and these are not quality price increase. When they start to come in, you might have two or three price increase in a quarter. So we're happy to see our customers maybe at this point to have lower inventory, so it makes us less vulnerable to what's ahead of us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Just to come back on the volume growth assumptions for 2012 by commodity group, how would you rank the growth potential by commodity from the top to the bottom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the weak side, export grain in U.S. looks pretty weak. Paper is not a commodity that will have &#x2013; that will do wonders in 2012. On the highest side, we believe, intermodals in general will do well. That's where we the domestic. Canadian grain so far is doing very well, and then we'll see next summer what kind of crop we have in Canada. And then after that, in between, you've got everything in between. We talk about things related to the shale activity, shale drillings. So frac sand should do very well. Drilling pipes should be doing very well. Even though the Whirlpool market may not be as strong right now as it used, whether for terminal or steel, our customers are still at profitable and we think &#x2013; I think at least in the case of CN, export coal for both coasts will be a positive thing. Terminal coal in the U.S. may not be so strong, so I think we've covered some of that in the earlier hour of discussion.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Wanted to &#x2013; I know you don't want to address certain aspects of this, but just wondered if you could offer a little perspective. I mean, one way or another, there's a lot of effort being applied right now towards the idea that your Canadian competition can operate a lot better operationally and financially. Wondering if there's &#x2013; if you think in that event would change in any way some of the longer term strategic thoughts you have about what's appropriate for CN, some of the last-mile initiatives. Is there a potential that you would need to change course on some of the broader strategic initiatives if that were to develop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gary, that's a good question. Quite frankly, I think strong competition is a good thing. The best hockey or sports franchise really gets to their full potential when they meet a strong opponent. So we are all for a strong CP and we wish them well. I think what both railroads, CN and CP, need to do is to continue to focus on improving service, the price to market. Pricing discipline is a very important driver of solid financial performance and continued productivity. If we both do that, the railroad industry wins and CN and CP and other rail carriers win, and that's what we wish for the industry as a whole and for CN shareholders in particular.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So no real change to your longer-team thought process.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon.  I know Bob had mentioned at the beginning that you prefer not to talk about any of the movements or the things going on with Hunter Harrison &#x2013; and the only thing and help us here if this is a little bit too direct. But in some of the legal documents that I've read, you've indicated that there was a concern that there could be a very real threat to CN and so forth in the future if that role were be taken. And I think a lot of investor concern out there is around that position and without discussing the legal or the pension or any of that other effort, can you give us a little bit of comfort around that perspective that perhaps you are going to be negatively impacted should things develop the way that you're fairing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Walter, you heard Bob very well and I can give you all the comfort in the world. And all I would say is our lawyers that file the paper, this is in front of the court and we will not comment today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, I understand. If I may ask you a second one then, just on the Canpotex, just a follow up on this. I know this is an agreement or a business that you had historically sort of walked away from at this price, and I'm curious to see what's changed. Is it the volume now has risen to make it a much more effective and much more attractive business for you or has the pricing evolved that has made it more attractive? Can you give us a sense of what has change from the last go around that's made this a much more attractive business for you this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to say &#x2013; and J.J., you can add to this &#x2013; I don't think that saying that we walked away from this business is accurate. I mean, we were for the last 10 years, we did not have any of the business because CP won it at the time. And this is a business that is growing fast and will continue to grow fast and it's good business to have. And I believe it's in the interest of Canpotex to diversify its rail carrier the same way. Everybody wants reliability to their end market would do. So I think diversifying railroads, diversifying terminals, diversifying gateway is what they should do and they seem to be pleased with what we have to offer them and our intent on continuing down that path.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Ten years is a long time. I think everybody started with a basically a clean sheet, a white sheet as to what made sense for them, buyers or sellers. And we're happy with what Canpotex has trusted in CN. We were looking for a chunk; we have the chunk. And it is profitable business. So, I don't know what happened 10 years ago. That's almost, like, before most of us, but we started with a fresh look and I think it was the case for all the people who look at that transaction.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. When I think about the guidance you guys have given for 2012, it looks like there's not much margin opportunity kind of built in. When you think about the puts and takes to what could change relative to your expectations, are there more maybe opportunities on the cost side to potentially leverage up EPS above your guidance or maybe at the high end? Or is it more just a function of you get a little bit more revenue contribution from better volumes and a better economic outlook? I'm just kind of curious, kind of, how you think about the puts and takes of the guidance within what you'd given us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, at this stage, I mean, again, I mean, given the visibility we have on the economy and so on and so forth, I would say, I mean, we could &#x2013; it could go either way. I mean, we could see things falling down a little bit. Again, we're forecasting another recession, but it's been a pretty spotty rate of growth. So if we would be surprised on the upside then, of course, you would expect that to flow at the bottom line.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost, I mean, we continue to look for every opportunity we can find. In fact, our guidance has a certain amount of productivity improvement built in. It's really when you factor in the pension headwind that &#x2013; that that's a big offsetting force in 2012. But I mean, we're still looking for further opportunity for productivity improvement; and if there's anything out there, we'll be pushing more towards the high end of our guidance. That's where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the cost side from the pension is enough to &#x2013; is probably the big key gating factor from an expense perspective, right, as far as leveraging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; yeah, and when you add it all up C$120 million is a &#x2013; takes a lot of productivity to make up for and that's what's exactly what we're going to do next year. We're going to make up for it and show solid growth despite that headwind.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our last question will be from Jacob Bout from CIBC. Please go ahead.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; [05L6W2-E Jacob Bout]:&gt; Good afternoon. My question is about the Canadian Wheat Board and following with the dissolution, can we expect to see any changes to your network? First, how you're handling grain and what type of opportunities do you see here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's some question out there that we can't answer today that we'll be able to answer in a year from now as to how the grain will flow through to different ports, whether some of the ports will be enjoying the same business post-Wheat Board and before, and we'll see how that work. That will depend partly on what shape the Wheat Board exists post-August 1. I think the Wheat Board will exist. There'll be a market player for the market players in the different format and also the role of the major grain company who control and own these terminal long boats towed to different ports. So the volume will be the same. The flow might change and we're prepared to adapt to that in the coming months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say overall that you can make a case for efficiency gains. You can make a case for changes in terms of ruling as a result of the Canadian Wheat Board becoming what we all think will be a smaller player in the marketplace. But the good news is we have a great franchise, we have more diversity in the outlets we can serve that we feel we will be able to follow the market and do well as the new structure unfolds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more about the efficiencies of the supply chain than moving more grain. The grain will be the quantity that's grown under.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
