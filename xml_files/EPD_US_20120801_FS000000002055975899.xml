          <p>items G&amp;A cost decreased $8 million this quarter from the second quarter of 2011 primarily due to lower employee cost inflation and tax related expenses. Bottom of the note G&amp;A costs for the second quarter of 2011 included about $2.5 million worth of expenses with respect to the merger of with DEP and also <mark type="indiscernible" /> expenses associated with EPE.</p>
          <p>In terms of interest expense it decreased $2 million quarter-to-quarter primarily due to lower expenses related to interest rate hedging activity and higher capitalized interest. In terms of capitalized spending, we spent $927 million in CapEx this quarter, which includes about $837 million of growth capital of the joint deal which was for Eagle Ford related to our development project. We spent $1.8 billion in growth capital expenditures during the first six months of the year. We can expect to expand approximately $3.8 billion over the year. Decline in CapEx was $90 million in the second quarter of 2010, $180 million for the first half of the year, we still believe we will <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30, 2012, was $4.3 billion.

That's after adjusting debt for <mark type="indiscernible" /> for the hybrid debt securities.

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question will come from the line of Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Good morning. I don't know if you can hear me or not, but we'll go ahead and fire away. <mark type="ph" /> Jim, two quick questions, the first, referencing that recent rebound in NGL prices that you talked about, how do you think about hedging your equity NGL volumes out of Meeker and Pioneer into the back half of this year? And I guess it's really more of a question around how you think about balancing the ability to lock in those C2 prices to get that cash flow certainty versus trying to maximize your P&amp;L exposure by effectively being long Rockies ethane and selling Belvieu to lock in that attractive spread (25:40)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a clue what you're asking, Rob. Was that Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's Daren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daren, I don't have a clue what you're asking. I think what you're saying is what do we think about locking in for the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you've got. I mean, I think out of the Rockies, correct me if I'm wrong, out of Meeker and Pioneer, you're mostly hedged on C3+, but you've had a bounce back in C2 ethane pricing. So I guess it comes down to whether or not you think about locking in C2 prices at this stage of game for the next six months or if you just want to be as long as you can Conway or Rockies ethane and sell Belvieu?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are looking &#x2013; we're not locking-in at these prices the second half of the year on ethane. What we're looking at, frankly, is any time we &#x2013; I think we're 35% hedged on ethane in the third quarter. And we don't have any hedges on in the fourth quarter. But go back to the statement, if you could hear us &#x2013; hear me, it's the first earnings call I've had where Mike and I just talked to ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we enjoyed it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you all didn't hear us, it was was dynamite, let me tell you. If you look at, Daren, how we run our system, right now, we've been one of the guys that have rejected ethane in the Rockies primarily because, I got a strong look from the lawyer here, primarily because we could make more money buying ethane in Conway and move it to Mount Belvieu in that pipeline capacity that we control on Mid-America and Seminole being our allocated capacity. So if we can buy ethane or propane in Conway at $0.30 plus a gallon times off of Mount Belvieu, that's better than making $0.10 a gallon on our ethane out of the Rockies. Does that help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it does Jim, and I appreciate it. What's your thought process on how that spread plays out through the back half of this year, especially when you start looking at the propane inventory situation? And I think that you talked a little bit about that in your prepared commentary, even though it sounded like you were basically giving the call while scuba diving. But to the extent that propane inventories keep a lid on ethane prices, do you still think that that Conway to Belvieu spread remains about $0.25?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know what it remains. I think there's going to be a product in Conway that we're going to be able to move to Mount Belvieu and take advantage of a pretty wide spread, be it ethane, propane, or normal butane, frankly. Does that help, Daren?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it does. And then last question, Jim, from a longer-term perspective, when you think about the Mid-America Rockies NGL pipeline expansion, and on the back end of that, what Texas Express does for you, how much of a leg up do you think it gives you to allow Rockies and Mid-Con producers in order to get their EP down to Belvieu and get Belvieu pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think once we bring Texas Express out, and I think there's a &#x2013; there may be some other pipe coming in. We don't pay attention to the others. I think it will have a &#x2013; it will have the impact of relieving some of that downward pressure on Conway relative to Mont Belvieu. You've got to admit, you got to remember though, Oneok is building a pipe I think out of the Bakken down into Conway, tying it into Overland. So, you know, it depends on what new supplies hit Conway. Theoretically, it ought to relieve some of the pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I appreciate it, Jim. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brian Zarahn with Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure, Randy may have mentioned it, but the connection was a little choppy. On CapEx for 2012, did you say $3.8 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on 2013, is sort of a similar level a reasonable expectation at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Based on the projects that we have in hand now, I think Brian, probably the range is between $3.5 billion and call it $3.8 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the PDH unit, it won't be in service for a couple of years, you do have the majority of it subscribed, what &#x2013; around 75% I believe, what level do you expect to be contracted before it comes online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>100%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>90% to 100%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of the returns, because this is a little different type of asset for you, what type of expected returns would it be for this project for the PDH Unit, would it be in line with sort of other type of NGL-related projects or maybe a little higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to meet our expectations. I'm going to go back to Jerry's question, what Jerry told you &#x2013; we are not fully contracted, we are contracted to the point that we're happy with the return if we don't get anymore. But the reality is we got several companies wanting the rest of this capacity, we don't think we're going to have any trouble contracting it, and we think the returns are going to be very nice for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian, we typically don't give returns on our projects. But as Jim said, this is a good project in and of itself, and it fully integrates into a lot of our other assets and so it's a very attractive project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then last one from me. The onshore crude business was very strong this quarter, can you talk some of the drivers, was it more marketing oriented or was it a combination of factors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, this is Mark. It's a really a combination of factors, one is the increased production in the areas where we are, South Texas, West Texas in particular. And so we're getting more transportation revenue, fee based revenue. And then the marketing business was pretty strong in the second quarter. And that really is, our marketing business benefits from a very nice spread between LLS and WTI, and that spread was better in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Ross Payne with Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How you doing, guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ross.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is, can you talk about the changes in processing contracts migrating towards fee based, and what your current blend of fee based, POP and keep-whole might be as a percentage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, you know? We keep doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hey Ross, this is Randy. Currently we're about, with the second train of Yokum expected to come on this month, we are currently at about 30% keep-whole and expect that number to come down as the third train or last train of Yokum comes on next year. I'm looking at, actually it's lower than that, it's about 21%, 20%, 21% right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the percentage of fee and POP, if you have it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The combination would be -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what he's asking is to break them out separately, Randy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The percent of proceeds or percent of NGLs would be about 28% and then pure fee would be 32%. And that's today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And it was kind of breaking up on Mike and Jim earlier, but if you could talk about your hedges for the second half and what you might be looking at for 2013 for your equity NGLs and natural gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Ross, on C3+, I think we're 75%, 80% hedged through the balance of the year. On ethane, we're about 35% hedged in the third quarter. We don't have any hedges on in the fourth quarter, and we're not thinking about next year yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; we &#x2013; we, on C3+, I guess we are over-hedged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the final question is in the crude pipeline write up. I assume too that that profit increase was a result of the Seaway reversal as well, is that fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We started to get some Seaway revenue in June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Ross, that was only a part of a quarter, so it didn't have a full quarter impact.</p>

          <p>You can get your butt in there. We leave a spot a month open in the event we have some issues we don't want to domino and out. But then typically what we've been able to do is we get to that month, we're able to do a spot deal. Those deals are typically quite a lot higher in terms of fees than our contracts are. So we're fully contracted based on what we want to contract, and we have about a spot a month that is available for spot deals.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, I think you hit it. We try &#x2013; the hardest thing is to try to figure out what the decline rate is, but we're looking &#x2013; we have a pretty good reservoir group. We're looking at all the different basins, we try to understand what the richness is of the gas. We look at rig counts and come up with what we think the supply will be around those assumptions.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So propane export economics remain very favorable, and when you think about kind of the capacity that you have right now and some of the capacity coming online from third parties over the next year to 18 months, would you be interested in further expanding your capacity, given those favorable economics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can only expand the extent that you have export quality propane, and what drove the size of this expansion was the amount of export quality propane that we have. In other words, you can't have as much ethane in the propane, you've got to produce to 2% to 2.5% ethane. And that &#x2013; this expansion reflects our capability from our fractionators and our splitters to produce the volume of propane needed to support the expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for further expansion to export, we would have to expand our ability to produce low ethane propane for export.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the spread between global prices and U.S. prices right now, are the economics there to consider expanding your ability to fractionate that export quality propane?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I've never had a problem with a full <mark type="ph" /> S (42:40).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And certainly Bradley, the more capacity you build, the lower the fees get for that, so that there is a balance there some place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that balance is around your ability to &#x2013; it really goes back to what your supply capability of low ethane propane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That makes sense. We've seen some valuations &#x2013; I guess, valuations have maybe come off a little bit in the midstream market, especially among some of your smaller cap peers. In the past, you guys have talked about organic opportunities being more attractive than M&amp;A. Has &#x2013; have any of the valuations you've seen changed your opinion on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, given our CapEx for the balance of this year and for next year, and frankly for some projects that we're looking at, that may be out in 2014, 2015, we're very happy with the organic growth. We still think that even though some prices have come down, they've come down for a reason for those entities, and so they still look too attractive to us on a M&amp;A basis compared to what we can do internally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, that's helpful. And I guess this question comes back to some of your comments earlier on the PDH unit, specifically around the opinion you received from your lawyers. It seems like there's a little bit more willingness or a little bit more flexibility around petro chemical assets than I think maybe investors and folks in the market kind of considered non-MLP qualifying assets in the past. Now that it seems that there is kind of more of a door opening to ethane crackers and PDH units being put in, how does that change your kind of forward view about could this grow into either a substantial business where you're operating petrochemical assets for maybe a petrochemical customer who's taking the commodity risk, are their more opportunities similar to the PDH unit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we looked at PDH pretty hard, we think that that's a nice fit, we looked at butadiene. We did get a letter ruling that butadiene, <mark type="ph" /> I don't think that (44:52) butadiene was qualifying income. Ethylene, you start going out into the fringes, and frankly for us to get into that business, we'd be competing with our customers, which probably is not the best business model, and it's frankly just not something that we have an interest in.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Good morning. Just back to the onshore crude oil, I guess in the second half of last year, you really attributed the high margins to kind of two things, scarcity of trucks and then also the ability to buy on WTI and sell on LLS, now some of that went away in the first quarter, but bounced back this quarter. Just trying to gauge what you're seeing right now for the trucking and LLS opportunity as we move to the back half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, trucking is not nearly as much in short supply as it was a year ago. And so we don't see the logistics in the South Texas and West Texas being as constrained as they were. In terms of the LLS pricing and WTI pricing going forward, the market of course sees that spread declining, which makes a lot of sense, but it's still pretty healthy and looks to be healthy through the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Seaway, do you have the mix of heavy versus light on the pipeline right now, and then any update on the timing for the expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have the mix. It's very early on. So we don't really know where that's going to be longer term. We certainly think it will be heavy and light moving. As far as expanding, we &#x2013; I think we had mentioned in our write up, we will gradually expand over the next two years ultimately to a capacity of about 850.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we also said that we would have the pipeline fully reversed by the first quarter of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And T. J., that 850 is kind of the theoretical capacity of the pipe assuming that it's up 365 days a year and it's &#x2013; you're flowing in the right quality of crude to the extent that it's heavy or lighter as the volume change. So that's kind of a good ballpark number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess just, then tying into ECHO, just an update on timing there on completion and then your bigger picture thoughts now on the potential to build out the storage there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The project is moving along very well. We expect that to be complete in September. We are talking to shippers and various folks in the industry who do have a strong demand for storage in the Houston area, and we think ECHO is a real good fit, and so do they. So we're optimistic that we'll see some storage revenue there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think ECHO has the potential to be a real jewel, T. J. And we have the plan that we can build out, what, 6.5 million barrels of storage on acreage we currently own. We have connectivity to every &#x2013; we will have connectivity to every &#x2013; pipe to every refinery in the Beaumont, Port Arthur, Houston area. So we're pretty excited about its future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, T. J., we finished the quarter with $3.1 billion worth of liquidity. So from our standpoint right now we've got a lot of flexibility on how we fund our growth. We did say early on this year that we did not have the need to issue equity, and if you would, that was really based on what we were seeing in the business environment in the first quarter and where our CapEx budget was in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Since then, we've, if you would, committed to the looping of Seaway, we've committed to the PDH unit, and while we're not really looking for a lot of CapEx this year with respect to those projects, it'll be more next year. The CapEx spend for next year is <mark type="ph" /> still announced (49:18). I think we still got flexibility with how we come in and finance growth for the remainder of this year, and &#x2013; but we also don't want to get too far behind <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:28). As far as the ATM facility, again, that was a facility that, frankly, we've been looking forward to getting in place for a while.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I don't know if you spoke on this in your opening remarks, since we couldn't hear it either, but just any update on your thoughts on the distribution policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We've kind of been pretty consistent about that. And we talked about it in the last call. And what we said there was that we're going to reevaluate our distribution strategy towards the end of the year when more of our projects come online, so that's still our thought as we get into the fall, we'll take a look at it. And decide whether given our capital requirements, the financial market and our resources, whether it makes sense for us to perhaps be a little more aggressive on the distribution increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I'm just curious with, obviously we're seeing some increasing rejection of ethane, how that translates to the mix that gets fractionated on your system, if maybe you could talk a little bit about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rudy, you want Rudy to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the fractionators are certainly have a design capacity based on a component structure, if we lose too much ethane capacity, we could lose fractionation capacity correspondingly. Of course, that gives us an opportunity if there's a spread between ethane and EP, go ahead and split EP, but it's a fairly wide range on the ethane percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before you start losing capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Before you start losing capacity. That's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you're not really seeing a significant change in the purity product that's coming out at this point, and you're not likely to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. A couple percent is really irrelevant to what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, and then as far as the overall backlog of project opportunities, I guess Randy, you were saying you've got about $3.8 billion for the planned spend for 2013. What's the &#x2013; I know Mike, last time you just said there's billions and billions of &#x2013; where do you stand now on backlog of project opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think if you look at some of our more recent presentations, we've got charts in there that show about $7 billion of projects under construction. And those are just the ones that we've announced, kind of big items. There's a number of smaller projects that we have that are not included in that list. So as Randy said before, kind of $3.8 billion in total for this year, $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion next year, and we've got assets that we're working to construct that will come in service 2014 or 2015. So I think if you're asking what is it beyond 2013?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think $3 billion to $4 billion a year is a pretty safe bet.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I guess Randy, first question for you. You've got $500 million coming to you today, what are your plans for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to pay it off. We'll come in and refinance that near-term, utilizing the flexibility that we've got under the credit facility and cash on hand. So, yeah Harry, that payment probably already went out this morning. And &#x2013; but again, we've got a lot of flexibility as far as timing on when we come back in, and if you would refinance that in the term debt market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second question, just given the declines we've seen in ethane and propane and the effects of those on the overall NGL barrel, are you guys seeing any sign of producers cutting back on drilling in liquids locations and if so, where in particular is that apparent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think primarily we've seen them cut back in dry locations. We haven't yet seen any cutback on, and if you look at the C3+ is still not a bad deal if you look historically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So looking out to the balance of the year, you guys think that remains the same?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're going to &#x2013; it remains the same in terms of spread, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. Just one more question on the propane de-hydro project, just trying to understand the nature of the contracts. I understand you said it, you'll have no commodity risk, but will you be getting demand, like take or pay demand charges on that or will it be volume times a fee? I'm just trying to understand how that's going to work from your end?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a processing fee, energy adjusted processing fee, on top of our propane cost with a deficiency fee embedded in that. So, yes, it's take or pay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the customer is basically taking that spread risk?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let's &#x2013; I want to put it in a little bit more in context, think about it. These guys were buying their propylene from petrochemical companies that crack naphtha. Whenever &#x2013; this project is really a shale gas project, driven by the consumers of propylene coming to the realization that they were buying a byproduct. What they're after now is a more secure source of supply that's more &#x2013; that will be there every day, and they're willing to step up to that. And frankly, they believe in the future of the gas crude spread. They believe that ethane will be the base load and there'll be much less propylene coming out of the ethylene plants. Gerry?</p>

          <p>Randy, quick question on the NGL hedges and kind of what you've seen over the last quarter with your counterparties. Given the swift move down, have you seen the liquidity in the forward market get reduced or dry up a little bit? And then also if you could just describe, in general, your counterparties that you have today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> In a forward sense. (57:16)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, NGLs is an interesting product, you can do a lot of physical forward selling on NGLs. I would say Al, most of our forward party forward sales are physical, to physical companies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As far as the liquidity going forward, at these current spreads, we haven't been looking much going forward, but you can always go out about six months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, are you focused more on liquidity or the credit quality of the counterparties or both?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kind of both. I just didn't know what the forward market for being able to hedge in today's type of environment? I mean, it would appear that the counterparties in the last quarter probably got hit a little bit. And I just wanted to see what the current liquidity was for the forward market and who those counterparties were? But I mean, it sounds like most of your counterparties in this case are physical counterparties, not necessarily financial counterparties, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we're saying is they are both, what we're finding is there's fewer than there were before.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and John, I guess the one thing to add is probably the, if you've seen, I don't even want to say that you've seen a step change the first half of this year. But it's nothing compared to the step change that you saw coming out of 2008, 2009 with respect to liquidity and the number of parties that were there to come in and do forward sales of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:24)</p>
