          <p>Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Quarter Three Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would like to introduce our first speaker, Jeroen van der Veer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Jeroen Van der Veer here. I am sitting here with Peter Voser. Let me start to express my warm congratulations to Peter Voser because probably you have seen, we have announced yesterday that Peter, at the end of June next year, will succeed me as Chief Executive of Royal Dutch Shell.</p>
          <p>How are we going to do it? We start with the disclaimer and then I come back to you.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. So I have first a speech, takes about seven or eight minutes, then Peter Voser, after that Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Let me make -- let me start by making some comments on the investment landscape. We are seeing unprecedented volatility in world markets. At Shell, we are particularly careful to watch not just the credit markets but also things like oil prices and exchange rates. We have been running the company in a conservative way. We take a long-term view on oil prices and don't plan on anything like $150 oil prices that we were around earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet structure is conservative and I feel good about that. We are watching the world economic situation closely.  Shell can cope with a wide range of energy prices.  Our strategy remains to pay competitive and progressive dividends and to make significant investments in the company for future profitability. We are steering the Shell ship through rough waters, and so far, okay</p>
          <p>Now turning to the third quarter.  We delivered another set of competitive results in the third quarter. Earnings were impacted by things like hurricanes, but performances overall was satisfactory and underpinned by operating performance.</p>
          <p>Excluding identified items, CCS earnings were 8.8 billion and earnings per share increased from, increased by 47% from the third quarter '07.  Average oil and gas prices remained high during the quarter and supported upstream. Downstream earnings were resilient despite a more challenging demand environment than a year ago.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Duvernay in Canada and continue to strengthen our tight gas portfolio in North America with further acreage additions.</p>
          <p>At Shell, the strategy is all about good operating performance and competitive returns today and making some significant investment in the company for the future. Yes, we are generating large programs and yes, we have the largest investment program in Shell's history to create value for our shareholders and to play our part in providing safe, convenient and cost-competitive energy for customers.</p>
          <p>Cash flow was competitive and we are making significant returns to shareholders with payout to shareholders in the quarter at 3.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let me update you on the portfolio development in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We are making good progress with projects under construction. We are coming into a period where we have our new projects starting up. And I expect over a quarter of a million barrels per day of new upstream capacity on stream by the end of '09. In Nigeria, SPDC [Shell Petroleum Development Company] has started gas supplies to new Afam Power Plant and commissioning is under way.</p>
          <p>In Sakhalin, we expect winter oil production to come out soon and for the first time. The second LNG train will be ready shortly with gas sales starting early '09.</p>
          <p>In Australia, construction is complete at the North West Shelf LNG train number 5 and the new Angel gas platform came on stream in October.</p>
          <p>Turning to new portfolio. In Iraq, we signed handshake agreement to establish a joint venture with Iraqi partners to process and market gas in the southern part of the country, including some 700 million standard cubic feet per day of gas, which is currently being flared.  The joint venture will initially focus on domestic energy for Iraq with the potential for gas exports in the future.</p>
          <p>In Australia, we concluded agreements with Arrow Energy to purchase a 30% share in Arrow's Australia's coal bed methane assets and selected international positions.</p>
          <p>We made progress in our alternative energy and CO2 strategy with new biofuels reserves agreements, new funding from Alberta Government for the Quest CCS project at Scotford and Shell participation in the WESTCARB CCS project in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now let me update you on Canada.  In Canada, we completed the acquisition of Duvernay and took additional acreage positions in that area, which has created a leading position in the Montney tight gas fairway for Shell. We estimate that these Canadian tight gas positions have resources of some 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent for Shell; this at a total cost of $6.2 billion. This is an entry cost of about $1 per 1000 standard cubic feet of gas, and this excludes the further exploration potential. Integration of Duvernay goes well and we have about of 350 operated and 65 non-operated wells producing some 25,000 barrels oil equivalent per day and about 12 rigs drilling.</p>
          <p>Staying with Canada for a moment, let me update you on oil sands activities. We will continue to progress our Athabasca Oil Sands Project Expansion number 1 which is currently under construction. Clearly, there is significant industry inflation and a tight labor market in the Alberta area. We are not immune from that but the economics of the project remain satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we do see some evidence that Alberta market is going to cool down and several of our competitors have delayed new projects. So we have decided to delay the final investment decision on the second Athabasca Oil Sands Project Expansion number 2. This final investment decision, the FID, was originally planned for the second expansion for 2009. But we wait for costs to cool down in Alberta before any new investment decisions.</p>
          <p>This is another example where we put a priority on value creation, a lot of them on volumes. And we have not been shy to delay the projects where we don't like the cost outlook. Once Expansion number 1 is completed, we will look to continue to grow Oil Sands through debottlenecking opportunities at our Athabasca sites.</p>
          <p>Now let me hand you over to Peter Voser, and Peter will take you through the third quarter in detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon everybody. Let me make some comments on the macro environment in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas prices declined sharply in the quarter after a strong run-up in the second quarter. However, average oil prices in the third quarter were some $42 higher than the year ago levels. Refining margins were lower in all regions except Europe. Chemicals margins increased in the U.S. and Europe and declined in Asia.</p>
          <p>So far in fourth quarter, the oil and gas industry is starting to see the impact of the economic slowdown. Oil prices have started the fourth quarter at lower levels than Q3. Refining and chemicals margins have held relatively firmly, although we do expect pressure on margins from weaker demand and new industry refining and chemicals capacity. Price of margin volatility remains unusually high.</p>
          <p>So let me now turn to financial performance in more detail. Excluding identified items, CCS earnings per share increased by some 47% compared to the same quarter last year.  Excluding movements in working capital, cash flow per share increased by 7%. Dividend increased by 11% in dollar terms to $0.40 per share and share buyback for the quarter was some $800 million.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that in the second quarter of '08, we saw a negative impact of 750 million to earnings from mark-to-market accounting impacts, for example, on commodity derivatives. This was caused by a large increase in prices across the quarter. IFRS accounting treatment of these risk management instruments led to a positive impact as expected on earnings of around 800 million in the third quarter. These are non-cash impacts and we normally include these items in results since they are part of our normal activity in Shell. But as we have -- we did in the second quarter, I highlight the figures for you here because the impacts are large in the context of the overall results.</p>
          <p>Before I go into detail on the business results, let me update you on production capacity impact in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell's upstream and downstream production has been impacted by the shutdowns due to two hurricanes, Gustav and Ike. Shell's preparation for these hurricanes and the response in the aftermath went well. However, there were minor damages from high winds and from flooding at onshore facilities. In addition, we decided to use the hurricane downtime in the upstream to bring forward some planned maintenance from Q4.</p>
          <p>In the UK, the flat pipeline system and onshore facilities went into planned shutdown in the third quarter. This was the first shutdown of the system since 1990 and the work went well. However, production from several North Sea fields was shut-in during this process. So taken together, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico downtime reduced upstream production by some 120,000 boes per day versus the third quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>In the downstream, the hurricanes reduced refining throughput capacity by some 70,000 barrels per day for the third quarter and also impacted chemicals operations. North Sea operations returned to normal during the third quarter as did Gulf Coast refining. Shell's Gulf of Mexico capacity is some 350,000 boes a day. Production has been building up during fourth quarter and is currently standing at some 300,000 boes per day. A return to full production is expected in the first quarter'09.</p>
          <p>So let me now talk a little bit business by business. Upstream earnings increased by 69% to 6.7 billion. Realizations were competitive compared to industry market prices -- prices. However, there are continuing pressures industry-wide from operating costs and tax. Underlying volumes in the third quarter were essentially unchanged versus a year ago levels. Volumes were also supported by build up at Ormen Lange in Norway, Changbei in China, West Salym in Russia and a series of smaller ramp ups.</p>
          <p>LNG volumes decreased quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to higher year-on-year planned maintenance and cargo scheduling. Looking ahead, LNG volumes should begin to increase again as new capacity builds up at North West Shelf and Sakhalin over the next two quarters.</p>
          <p>In oil sands, bitumen production was down versus year ago levels as we continue to mine in lower grade bitumen ore. We expect Q4 oil sands production to be at marginally higher levels than Q3.</p>
          <p>We have made progress with alternative energy in the third quarter with completion of the Avancis thin-film solar plant in Germany with 20 megawatts per year production capacity and the start up of the 164 megawatt wind project, Mount Storm Phase I in the United States.</p>
          <p>Downstream earnings. They increased by 24% to 2.3 billion. Earnings were supported by improved marketing margins, partially offset by weaker chemicals earnings. We saw reduced operating rates in Gulf Coast refineries and chemical plants as a result of hurricanes. However, these impacts were to some extent offset by increased U.S. demand for imported downstream products from our European and Canadian refining system.</p>
          <p>At Shell, refining earnings were around $500 million in the third quarter of '08 compared to some 550 in Q3 '07. Excluding the Q3 '08 mark-to-market impact, earnings from marketing activities were up by 35% versus a year ago level to some $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Oil Products marketing sales volumes were essentially unchanged from a year ago levels. Excluding asset sales, weaker demand for retail fuels was partially offset by commercial fuels demand. Refining availability in Q4 '08 is expected to be around 90%, somewhat lower than the 93% of a year ago due to heavier scheduled maintenance.</p>
          <p>Chemicals earnings were impacted by lower margins and volumes, especially in the U.S. Availability in chemicals in Q3 '08 was 86% and we expect that availability in Q4 to be lower compared to last year, which was 93%.</p>
          <p>On the divestment side, we continue to make good progress with asset sales. First nine months of this year, we have received some 4.9 billion of disposal proceeds from both upstream and downstream and we are on track to deliver the $5 billion asset sales target for 2008.</p>
          <p>We have sold some 18,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day of upstream production capacity to end Q3. And I expect it to reach over 40,000 barrels of oil equivalents capacity per day by the end of the year as disposals continue. Total disposals proceeds since '04 have now reached some $31 billion, which is some 24% of average capital employed.</p>
          <p>We do expect Shell asset sales to continue and recycling inefficient capital into new projects is a key element of the financial strategy. However, there are clearly some pressures in the credit market today which might mean there are fewer buyers of assets than earlier in the year. We were successful in selling upstream and downstream assets at peak cycle in recent years, the macro trends are down for both segments at least for now. Now we are not in a rush to sell assets; it's not a fire sale. So the pace on asset sales might slow down here considerably.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash. The upstream and the downstream segments continued to generate cash flows above their capital requirements. Operating cash inflow plus asset sales over the last 12 months was around 56 billion including 7 billion from asset sales. Over the same period, we invested some $51 billion in CapEx acquisitions and returns to shareholders. So the cash position remains a healthy one. Balance sheet gearing including off balance sheet items was 15.4% at the end of Q3. Well we have got some flexibility here. Excluding off balance sheet items, the gearing ratio was at a very competitive 7.4%.</p>
          <p>Now with that, I pass back to Jeroen for a summary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. I recap. We are watching the world economic situation closely. Shell is robust across a wide range of energy prices. Our strategy remains to pay competitive and progressive dividends and to make significant investment in the company for the future profitability. We are steering the Shell ship through rough waters and so far okay. I think we have delivered another strong set of results in quarter three '08, helped by operating performance. We have made good progress with the portfolio and our strategy is on track: Operational excellence, competitive cash flow, capital discipline.</p>
          <p>With that, let me stop here, go for your questions. Over to you, operator.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes from Jon Rigby [UBS]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thanks for taking the question. A couple, in fact three. The first is it seems to me year-end oil price 2007 and quarter-end 3Q 2008 were about the same. Yet you seem to have had a draw in working capital over that of about $6.7 billion if I'm not mistaken. Can you just explain to me whether there are any sort of leads and lags in the way that working capital will evolve with for the major input price, which I guess is oil prices?</p>
          <p>The second question I just have is whether you could just discuss in a little bit more detail how you are approaching the process of FID projects when clearly a lot of the inputs -- and I'm not talking about your oil price assumption -- but particularly things like steel and also the contracted prices are probably moving around a lot right now.</p>
          <p>And third, just a follow up on the disposals comment. Do you ever consider extending some sort of loans to buyers, some sort of vendor credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I take the middle question myself about the FID, then the other two are for Peter Voser. He starts with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Jon. On the working capital, I think the way you need to look at it is in the following. With the sharp rise in the second quarter, obviously, the working capital went up considerably because of the oil price. In the third quarter, we actually performed well and those pieces which could come back did actually come back. But we are running roughly a 45 days kind of working capital in downstream. And that means that, at least in the second half of the quarter, that has not entirely come back yet into our cash flow. So you will actually see quite a bit of that coming in at least in October and partially even November. Both had gone up in the, let's say, second quarter and then started to build up in the third quarter. So there is an effect coming later in the year. And from that point of view, that's still to come.</p>
          <p>I would also say trading can be fluctuating quite a bit, depending on what storage deals you take in. And that is a more short-term kind of business. But it may take up to six months before that actually comes out. So taking year end and then third quarter is not always the right thing that you are stocking up for storage for winter say for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third quarter also has seen towards the end of the September with the falling price in absolute terms, money-wise, a sharp rise in the accounts receivables, because especially in Europe, you have seen a lot of winter stocking already of gas oil because quite a number of customers, actually many of them, were running at very slow stocks. And as the price came down, there was a real rush on to volumes. And that's one of the reasons why we haven't seen the volumes increase. We have actually seen a market share gain for us in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>I may take maybe the third one, the disposal on the loans. I think as a general policy, if we sell something, then we normally do not kind of subsidize or support the buyer too much. We may enter into long-term kind of takeoff agreements of products if that is for example linked to a refinery. There might obviously be some loans involved when we run businesses and then sell them. For example, in the BEB sale, we got the money from the government. But at the same time, loans from the company were paid back to us. But these loans you should more see as a normal capital, eyed to working capital, capital expenditure financing, which we do throughout the year to the company when it is owned by us. And when it's sold, that comes back to us and the buyer needs to finance that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, no long speech about the whole art of coming to FIDs. But on the day of the final investment decision, in general, what do you know on that day? The design is made. The architect has done his work, so to say. You have selected already the people who are going to build the project. You have probably locked in your major pieces of equipment, especially non-standard equipment. So you know when you can get that, and because you know that, you have a pretty good price idea. You have worked on a basis with your contractor. Is it that, is it a cost basis, is it turnkey, a whole kind of hybrid systems and an understanding.</p>
          <p>Well then, how do you come &#x2013; and then so basically and then you may have to arrange financing, understanding with the bankers and et cetera.</p>
          <p>Now back to your question is how do you work labor as fuel prices. And if we looked at Canada, the first global system of location factors, you know by experience that you -- in certain places it is more expensive to work at lower costs, that is called the location factor. And then you take tailor-made few where you are going to build the project as we do in Canada. These are not only our own estimates, but, for instance, CERA, that is the Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Cambridge, USA, gave a published data as well and more data is available for verticals overseas. And that leads you then to base your economics. The view in this case that the market will cool down in Canada is basically we &#x2013; I don't think it is -- that was so difficult to come to that idea, because at this moment, we are still in a very overheated situation in Canada. But it is quite clearly that our various cancellation of projects and that will have an impact on that overheated situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. What I mean is couldn't you extend the argument that you are specifically making about Canada generically across the industry, in that the way that a lot of the input costs that you obviously pay are moving that your waiting three or six months might actually pay on starting up new projects, starting on the construction phase of new projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point you made is good. If I go back to my old memory, and I'm pretty sure that analysis will show that you see a strong correlation, albeit with some time lags between the strong oil prices and costs from the service industry to contractors et cetera. And that is one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, usually when in the past a project was ready, then you like to go because the contractors have reserved the capacity of loans for equipment. And even if you have a bit of a swing, then the earlier cash flow was better than to delay it. Or to say it differently, to delay a project just the evening before FID is usually not that clever because then you start to miss the cash flow et cetera whilst you don't have not necessarily all the advantages.</p>
          <p>Having said that, what is happening now, the swings in the last, may I say, down cycle of the prices in the service industry, if I look at oil rigs, onshore, offshore steel prices, the volatility, the size of the swings was much bigger. So you come closer to your argument that timing &#x2013; and to timing them to take your FID is probably even more important even relatively compared to the past.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Lucas Herrmann [Deutsche Bank]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. And Peter, I've got to say congratulations and all the best with that. But three questions, if I might. Very simply, U.S. dollar moves phenomenally sharply against a multitude of currencies and I just wondered whether you could remind us of what the sensitivity or transactional sensitivity of the business is to the dollar given what we have seen.</p>
          <p>And secondly just to focus a little bit more on Canada. Can I just be clear whether or not you were paying full royalties on Canadian production of bitumen through this quarter? And Suncor made some comments I think a couple of days ago on the cash breakeven of their business, indicating it was around 40 U.S. &#x2013; or 40 Canadian dollars. I wonder whether you would care to give us any indication of whether that's the kind of number that seems sensible, 40 Canadian for your existing activities.</p>
          <p>And finally, just staying with the sands, Jeroen you said you're still going to make satisfactory returns from the Phase I project. Satisfactory on the basis of what, oil price or what kind of assumption around crude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I yield all four questions including the last one to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Lucas, also thanks for congratulations. On the U.S. dollar, if you take CapEx, the 10% swing of the dollar against the euro is roughly $0.5 billion, more or less depending on where it swings. On their income side, it is roughly 150 to $200 million, the same 10%. Q-on-Q, both quarters in oil sands at 25%. So we were going on the royalty side. We were going in and out and the last quarter it was different, but we then came back in in July. The fourth one, if you hear Jeroen saying satisfactory, that means actually he is normally very pleased about this. So that's what I learned with him after four years of working with him.</p>
          <p>So I think we have our price grid with the 3, the low, the medium, and the high. We take a very long-term view. As you know in '99, we took actually FID on the first project and there we were back at 14 to 16. And if I look back now, I mean this was a very, let's say, satisfactory project to use Jeroen's term as well. It is -- it was a very successful one. Then you had a question about the cash costs. I would say it's around $36 for us, of which, as you know, 30% of it is energy cost-driven. So you then actually move that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon gentlemen. First of all, Peter, congratulations on yesterday's announcement. Three questions actually. Just on marketing, very strong result there. I just wanted to sort of get a feel for how much you thought this was a transitory effect from oil prices falling and whether you could give a sense of indication of how things are moving into Q4.</p>
          <p>The second question just is on CapEx, potentially at lower prices. I was just wondering what sort of level of discretionary CapEx do you have in the portfolio. For example, give us the amount in 2008 that's reflected by higher activity levels.</p>
          <p>And lastly, just a follow up on the FIDs. Could you perhaps disclose what other FIDs you may be planning to take in 2009? I was sort of thinking perhaps about Bonga Southwest and if you could give some clarity around Gorgon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I start with marketing prices and then Peter will help you for the other two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, the market -- what is remarkable this year that if we correct for the hurricanes, our worldwide marketing volumes are about the same as last year, if I take &#x2013; this is the first nine months. Very hard to read how that is with scaling of market share and all those kinds of things. So that is remark one. Having said that, we could see, especially in the summer, you could see that there was an impact on the amount for gasoline, for instance, in the USA and Western Europe. What we could see as well is that if we think about certain Asian countries, if you take the subsidies on the gasoline, if you take that away that you get an initial demand reaction.</p>
          <p>What we don't know as yet is that if the prices, they have fallen now in all countries, yeah, that what is the demand coming back or have habits and behaviors of customers changed sort of more lasting way; too early to say. And that's why I abstain from giving precise marketing volumes guidance for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Peter, the question about CapEx and that he take to FIDs of what we did do with other projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Thanks for the question. On the discretionary CapEx, I think I'm not going to give you a number there. But let me explain a little bit how we look at this. Post-FID project, all that we are working on at the moment which will give us some 250,000 barrels per day in '08 and '09 of new production or a million if you take all the projects together in '08, 9, 10, 11 et cetera. And these are projects where we are committed, that's where we're going through with them. That's how we have built up the balance sheet, that's how the gearing actually has been planned et cetera.</p>
          <p>Then you get to the pre-FID ones, and that's where you take a very hard look at your costs, at your labor rate, at the EPC contract, at your production and your productivity of labor et cetera. And I think that's where you then take the hard decision if a project is not actually achieving the returns according to the three oil price scenarios you are managing. Then you either postpone or you cancel. And we have done this in the past and we will not be shy to do this going forward if we are not satisfied. But I have to be very clear that we take NPV and IRR outlooks for these kind of projects rather than being will we actually see it by short term kind of price spikes either upwards or downwards. I have given you in March a chart which shows you at 50 and $70 what IRRs we are achieving for all of these projects. So I would refer you back to those as well.</p>
          <p>Then on the FIDs, we have given you a slide which gives you kind of a large number of projects which we are working on. And we will take these FIDs when they come and we will not specify that period. What we have said is we are working at the moment at 800,000 barrels of production, so, of projects where we have not taken FID and that you would unlock some 6 billion additional barrels of resources. Remember, what we are bringing on stream at the moment has a 10 billion barrels of resources attached to it. So that's how we are looking at it.</p>
          <p>So I feel good about how we are managing CapEx and our program and I think there is sufficient in our pipeline to go through the next few years in order to achieve our long-term growth aspiration of 2 to 3%.</p>
          <p>I would just like to come back quickly to Lucas questions, because I answered too fast. On the dollar effect, the CapEx Lucas is annually, 150 to 200 million on income, that is a quarterly number. I'm sorry about that. Next question please.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had just a question on tax. The third quarter tax appears to be a little bit above guidance. So I was wondering if you could update the guidance for Q4 and the full year. My second question concerns disposals where Peter, I think you clearly said they are going to be running below previous expectations. So are you able to update your guidance for net investment of 35 to 36 billion for the full year? And my final question, going back to Athabasca, if you could just clarify whether Phase II, the phase that you are now delaying, was included in the 800,000 barrels a day of projects where you don't have FID? And was it also included in the guidance for 2 to 3% volume growth or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Irene. On the tax side, I think tax you need to look at from where the earnings streams are coming from. And quite clearly, we had a very strong third quarter on upstream income, which normally has a higher tax rate. If you go back to our 2007 20-F, you see our quarter tax rate per business in there. So there is a business segment mix, but there was also regional mix, and there was also some one-off items when you actually look at our divestment streams et cetera. So from that point of view, the tax was affected by that. I'm not giving annual tax rate. I think if you look at '07, this gives you a good indication on where long term our tax actually will be.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx question, the 35, 36 which is for this year, that remains unchanged because it includes roughly 30, $31 billion of organic CapEx, some $10 billion of acquisitions and some 5 billion of divestments. We achieved 4.7 already by the end of September and I'm comfortable with having 5. So we have achieved that or we'll achieve it. So I think the total number for the year will be unchanged. As you know, we don't give outlooks, but I have always said in the past that the round costs what we see in the market is an inflation of 10%. Yes, indeed, oil prices have come down, commodities have come down, certain costs will come down, but it's by far too early to actually give any impact of that in the shorter term into next year. You also know that exchange rates are moving and fluctuating quite a bit. So we need to wait for all of this before we talk again about 2009 CapEx. For the time being, I think the 10% inflation is a good number to use.</p>
          <p>On the oil sands, let me just make a few comments on the oil sands. On a Shell share basis, once we have implemented the Expansion number 1, the 100,000, we will be around at 150,000 barrels a day, which is roughly 5% of our current crude production. So relatively a small amount. Just to set the whole thing a little bit into perspective, is it part of the 800,000 down to 6 billion? Yes, it is part of that one. Is it part of our long-term aspiration of two to three? I think there is a per year growth. Yes, there is a high number of projects in there. And whenever you talk about pre-FID projects et cetera, there is always a probability that something goes ahead and something doesn't go ahead. So that's why we have said it's a long-term next decade aspiration which we have. It is every year. It can have swings. You can have years with much more and other years with less. If you take an FID of such a project now in '09, '10, that production impact comes somewhere in '14, '15. So I think the 2 to 3% as a guidance -- aspirational guidance is the right way to look at it and we will work on that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen and congratulations, Peter. Just a quick question on volumes. You've indicated 250,000 barrels a day of volumes from new projects by the end of next year. You made a comment on Nigeria and your thinking on lost barrels there, on what exactly you're doing to try and get those barrels back and the potential for those returning at some stage in 2009. And maybe also give us, if you can, just an update on the status of your two big projects in Qatar, in terms of their progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, thanks for your question, I take them. Nigeria, you know the story. Three companies offshore go and buy a large well, an LNG plant, in spite of all the difficulties, they can fulfill the obligations. Onshore, an area as big as England -- or bigger than Scotland, then we have a lot of problems there. We have two problems which are the most important to say here. There is the security one. Our staff can't work safely there. And then we have a problem that especially the government, they don't come up with the cash calls, and that affects future production, not necessarily production today. But if you don't invest, you have all your decline rates et cetera.</p>
          <p>At this moment, it is the production, let's say, the number of wells we can't produce is about the same really for the whole year. But having said that, it is not exactly the same barrels out of action. Because what happens, and that's your question, what do you do about it. Every time your staff can't work safely there, you start a process with the local authorities, the local chiefs as far as possible, the groups who make life difficult to us to work there, the government of Abuja. And very often after some time, you can resume work there. Then you have to check whether it is safe. You may miss pieces of equipment et cetera and then you can restart. Now why are we then not gaining, because we have discovered that in other part in the Delta, you may have new problems. So at this moment, we have only minimal wells out of action and we don't have new guidance.</p>
          <p>The two projects in Qatar is first of all, what happens there is quite unbelievable. In Pearl, we have now -- we estimate 35,000 contractors busy building all the plants. That's also a bit more than two year hardly anybody, 35,000 now. In Qatargas number 4, our LNG plant, we have more than 10,000 people involved in building that. So there you have, if you go to this Ras Laffan only for Shell, we are close to 50,000 persons building those plants. Yeah, we have so far the -- we don't have full expected developments. We have to realize there is special costs as well, but as you look at the total picture, that is still within the assumptions that we have made.</p>

          <p>Afternoon gentlemen. Congratulations also Peter on your appointment. And my first question is in connection with that. Some very well-placed or apparently well-placed sources seem to be strongly under the impression that you had been ruled out or ruled yourself out of succession. And I wonder if there is anything you would like to say around that about that.</p>
          <p>Second thing was just on LNG volumes which continue to be down year-on-year. And again possibly relating back to Nigeria question, can you just comment on why that is -- that your existing portfolio appears to be somewhat under-performing volume front? Thank you.</p>

          <p>We have some in that we smile to each other because we said before this teleconference, all questions related Peter I will answer and all questions related myself, Peter will answer. But this was a quite personal question. But let me do it as follows, Colin, is that we are simply delighted that Peter is prepared to step up to the Chief Executive post. And in Shell, we emphasized it this morning in the press conference is we like to make from Shell a real meritocracy.   Everybody can go to the first job. But it is important to note that he is the first non-British person to do so. And that basically shows we are truly a multinational company. The second question of the volume, I leave that to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, kindly just -- thanks for your words anyway, Colin, and always and absolutely excited to go for it. And we'll really build on the excellent base which Jeroen has actually built for the last few years. But can you just repeat the second question because you were breaking off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question was just on LNG volumes, which continue to run below last year. And obviously, you've got some new portfolio pieces coming into the picture. But it's just why are things running so weak? And I was wondering in particular if that related to the performance at LNG in general, particularly in view of the fact that you do have the sixth train there now which could be available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, now it's clear, yes. The answer on LNG is no. So we are happy with how we are progressing there. The total energy sales volumes were 3.1 million tons, which was 6% lower than in the same quarter a year ago. This was mainly as a consequence of planned maintenance shutdowns in Australia and in Malaysia and changed cargo lifting schedules compared to the same quarter last year. The last year, we brought things into Q3 and this year, that's not the case. And that gave us a little bit an artificial difference. Overall, all LNG contracts were met in the quarter. We expect Q4 volumes to increase from Q3 levels due to lower maintenance but also due to the start up of North West Shelf Train 5. And as I said already earlier on, looking into the next year then with Sakhalin coming in, that give us more. So nothing kind of wrong in the volumes this quarter; it was just two effects coming together. LNG pricing, we are obviously very strong and we had actually a record energy profit quarter in Q3.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I would just add my congratulations to those of many of my peers. I asked for a similar update from one of your oil peers the other day. And I can appreciate that you have sustainable and attractive cash returns at the 60 to $90 per barrel level. But all things remaining equal, how low does the oil price need to go before dividends and CapEx are not covered in Shell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I start and Peter can fill you in because I like to show that we have never lowered our dividend since '94, '95, and even -- and that had to do with the war, before the war et cetera. So we are very strongly committed to our dividend policy, and that is at least in line with inflation and make sure that if we make such a statement, of course, we have done our homework about modeling, about all kind of assumptions. Over to you, Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me give you a little bit longer answer here. But I think, let me start with the fact that due to kind of two planning cycles, whenever you look at your things, you do a very long term one where you look at projects. And that is net present value derivative. So we use a grid of low, high and medium prices rather than a single point forecast. We look through the short-term peaks and the lowest part of the prices. We look really for the long-term business. Today's prices are well within our ranges, so no change to the basic philosophy that we have for project screening.</p>
          <p>The second one you do is obviously you look at your cash for the near term for the next three, five years. That's where you run. And I have been very consistent on this over the last few years. You cannot get kind of blinded by the fact that you have got high oil prices and you are at a high end of the cycle of refining margins. You need to cut that out and look through that, and, because we all know we are in a cyclical and volatile business. So there you obviously plan for the next few years to actually keep your dividend according to your policy. And Jeroen just described that, be on your post-FID project. The worst thing you can do is that you have a need to cut, so you just run them through. You look at your pre-FIDs at the same time and you again manage and invest throughout, through the cycle. And with the balance sheet which is 7% geared only without the off balance sheet, you have enough financial muscles actually to do that.</p>
          <p>So the average oil price over the last few years was actually 70 barrel -- $70 a barrel, we should not forget that, yes we had a spike in the middle. We generated $120 billion of cash and we invested and paid back to shareholders 104 and kept 60 billion in the balance sheet. So I think that's the way we manage and are comfortable with that. And I think with our growth aspirations around unlocking the 10 billion barrels of resources through a million barrels of production, that's the way you want to run this. So I'm happy where we are at this stage and I think our dividend policy over the last few years has shown that we can actually weather the storms and be prepared for them..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow up on that? Just by implication there, are you implying that you would use gearing if the oil price fell back to $40?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gearing on the balance sheet is planned, that in such a way that you can weather the storms in the shorter term. And if you have got good projects, you have a low gearing and you're happy with your returns, your investing, that can be done. That's not an issue. But I have always said over the last few years, strongly supported by Jeroen and the Board, you have got four legs in our financial framework: the first one is dividend, the second one organic growth, CapEx, the third one is maintaining a balance sheet, i.e. serving your debt but also maintaining a gearing ratio of throughout the cycle max of 25% and then if you have money left over, you do something else with the guidance -- inorganic growth, more organic growth or buyback.  And I think that has served us well as a framework.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen and I add my congratulations. Most questions have been answered, but few remain. The derivative fair accounting, should I assume seeing the fact that the minus with the rising oil prices is about the same level as the plus in the decreasing oil prices that this is a cap which has sort of kept constant or is this is a coincidence and is it just dependent on day-to-day trading with certain caps and bottoms? The second question is you mentioned good LNG prices I understand especially in Asia. How is this going forward in the fourth quarter and the beginning of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I take them, Jeroen. On the mark-to-market, normally, when you look at trading, we are looking at a window of three to six months where this kind of deals which you are doing are happening. So we normally we get things back within two quarters. So when prices were rising in the second quarter, we had 750 million actually being when we took a snapshot at the end of the quarter there were taken. We are actually giving us a loss. But I said already back then, normally, that comes back when these deals are actually maturing. So you have the 800 million coming back this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now under normal circumstances with little bit less volatility than what we have seen the last three, four months, we would have effect of plus/minus 50 million in GP, maybe plus/minus 100 million in Oil Products and Chemicals. And we consider this as normal business and then we will not let you know because that's just part of our results. If they go outside certain boundaries, then I will just tell you every quarter on what that means. But you cannot type or forecast this. I think in my opinion when you model these stocks, you should just leave these accounting things aside and look through that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the LNG prices, I think I would just say remember Asia-Pacific is a Japanese crude kind of diet-driven pricing. So it's a percentage of the oil price, and we said from time to time if it's $100, then typically you may look at 16% of the, on the LNG side. I think, therefore, you see the fluctuation but you have a delay-effect in that, in the results depending on how the oil price moves. So if you ask me what's happening next year, I need to give the question back because the news has to tell me the oil price, which we are not going into because we don't want to forecast that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Joe Toby. Congratulations again to Peter. And my questions are basically focused on financial types of items. First item relates to the pension plans and related potential liabilities changes probably have affected to some extent the assets that are behind them, has the company quantified the expense of any potential charge-offs or additional costs on that account. Similarly, in the financial area obviously there has been a set of major changes in the American and European banking <mark type="inaudible" /> Southeast Asia. Has the company quantified the extent of its potential write-offs and exposures on those? I will set aside any questions on the foreign exchange exposures for the &#x2013; if I may just use them as a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, thanks for the congratulations. The first one is on pension plans, I think it's too early to say that because I mean I had a number which was end September. I can tell you at the end of October ones or the weekly ones I get completely different. So I think we need to let this go throughout the year. You can actually see how we are kind of running our pension funds. If you go into the 2007 20-F, you see the allocation to equity, fixed income, cash et cetera. I think like all pension funds, obviously, asset levels have come down.</p>
          <p>I think so far so good. You may remember that we had a surplus last year, but as I said, it's a little bit too early. It also depends a lot on obviously the assumptions you have for your liabilities which have discount factors in it which are driven by bond rates et cetera. So you need to wait until the end of the year. I think at this stage, I would expect the charge coming into P&amp;L from pension to increase next year. But I think if I look at the total picture, I don't see that as too material.</p>
          <p>The banking sector, we saw this coming rather early, so we reacted early, we put a, our cash but also we managed our counterparty risks in a very good way as a very direct impact of quite a number of institutions going the wrong way or going bankrupt. I can tell you we are around 16 million or $17 million losses; that's all what we will be have at this stage. Otherwise, such -- we have managed this very well. And I think a great thanks to all of our business and finance colleagues in Shell that have done a tremendous job here. So I think that's on this one.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Neil McMahon [Sanford Bernstein]. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations Peter. I've got a few questions to hassle you with. And the first is really on gas to liquids. You noted in your press release that you had got good gas to liquids pricing. Just trying to figure out, did you have like lots of extra volumes on the market in the quarter? I think they are relatively low. And was that driven on the loop side or was that from the diesel side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think generally that's 14,000 barrels daily production, Neil. It was positive. It was higher prices and higher volume. I think it's in the specialties most probably, but I think we will get back to you. I am not entirely sure in which product it is -- or it was. But we'll get back to you. But it is very small volume at the end of today, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question is really around your acquisition strategy. There has been quite a number of acquisitions you have done yourself over the last few years and the latest in Canada. But if you look at the U.S. lower 48 and the various companies in distress in terms of their share price, are you considering doing any more acquisitions around tight gas in the Rockies or shale plays towards the Gulf Coast or towards the Eastern Seaboard or are you writing-off any further acquisitions in that area now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil this is, always as you know, this is of course a sensitive question. So we have to look out what we say. But what can we say about it. We have a long-term strategy as we have shared with you in quite some detail in our strategy update in March. So that is the current thing there. And given a certain assumption for oil or gas prices, we always compare them what is better for the company is that to invest in oil projects to develop the projects, you have to build it and then so many you see later they come on stream, do I go for mostly barrels today. Now mostly barrels can be already producing assets or assets which are under development as well. That's a balance which I have to make all the time. We are in that context basically practical business people.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if I looked at to the total picture over the past years, we found it was very good to run with a pretty conservative balance sheet as we have done. The way we will take it forward is that the same as normal businessman. We look at all our opportunities. And I think you are seeing that we don't do very wild things, and I expect that we continue those kind of lines. So we do not exclude any things we don't do or we do do, but it should fit in our strategy and it should be the best way the company which is the safest thing saying the best for long-term shareholder interest.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last question. Just looking at your position in the Santos Basin in Brazil, I noticed in your portfolio update, there doesn't seem to be many plans there. Could you just give us an update on what you are actually seeing there in terms of your first discovery and any plans whether accelerated or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a side job, Peter is already sitting there, because Peter, you always think as a CFO, but he has a regional responsibility as well, which is South America. So he can certainly give you better data.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks Neil. Let me be clear here. Not having it on the portfolio slide is actually not correct because if we look at what we are today, the biggest IOC producing in Brazil. We have got 100,000 barrels BC-10 project coming on stream next year. And we have done a lot of exploration, and some of our partners have actually briefed the market on that. We have, if I'm not mistaken, actually 10 wells next year to be drilled. So there is a lot going on there. And we are very active in pre-sold and non-pre-sold acreage. So I think when we normally give exploration updates on an annual basis, we will then talk about this again. But Brazil, we are very active there on the upstream side in actually progressing with our business,</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. Congratulations Peter. I have got three questions. The first one regarding Canadian oil sands is to what extent do you believe you could benefit from the potential cool down of the very overheated environment and specifically in terms of operating costs, so the variable OpEx? Secondly, could you update us on the cost cutting measures and initiatives such as the outsourcing of the IT or sourcing center and maybe you remind us the annual amount you are targeting? And the third one, could give us your decline -- well, could you remind us what was the decline rate on the portfolio for the periods on the upstream portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure I understood your second question, but rather than clear it, Peter will answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the oil sands, which really is aimed at what we are operating today, which is already the 155,000, 100% capacity and the 100,000 incoming on stream pretty soon. I think from a optimization point of view, right, we are not going for another expansion at this stage. Having two mines then actually, we can start to debottleneck both lines. And this has a lower capital intensity, but on the other side, it also gives advantages on how your operating costs longer-term actually then are developing. So that's one way of looking at it. Then you can work on the mine efficiency in that sense and hence you get lower replacement cost. So I think there is quite a bit which we can do and we are very much developing this at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost cutting, yeah, it's quite a bit going on in the sense that we do not need a new program; that is already running for quite a while. It's Jeroen's top quartile program. All businesses and all functions are working on that. As you mentioned actually, the functional programs like IT and finance, yes, the infrastructure was outsourced; that works very well. On the finance side, we are now 3500 people in shared service centers across the world. So we are bringing them out of mainstream finance into locations where we actually have some salary arbitrage, but more importantly, we have some economy of scale.</p>
          <p>What we have said in the past, this is roughly $0.5 billion on an annual basis, the impact of all what's going on across the businesses and in the function. So that's the kind of number which we have given. But I think it is really moving now, it's accelerating. So we are very happy with that drive. But as I said, we don't need any new initiatives because we do it already for quite some years now.</p>
          <p>On the decline rate guidance, 3 to 6%, over the last two years or so, we have been between 4 and 5%. So more or less in the middle of the 3 to 6%. So that's -- one is the long term and the other one for kind of the near term hastily which I am giving you here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon Peter, congratulations. I had a couple of short questions. First, back to Canada, I assumed that the 6 billion or 1 billion equivalent barrels of resource is a recoverable number. Could you confirm that? And if so, what kind of recovery rate is being utilized?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

These are qualified as resources and that's what we expect to produce. You try to see that as a percentage of oil in place. That's your question Mark, is that --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you have a revised cost estimate for the Phase I expansion at Athabasca?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer on the fist one is yes, we have had these effects already in Q3 and the renegotiations are going very well. On the diversions, which is your spot sale question, typically, we have 55, 60 ships a quarter and you can take kind of 5 to 10 to 15% could be actually diversions. It depends a little bit quarter on quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And my final question relates to the performance of the Chemicals, which I guess I just can't understand how in the margin environment appearing in your slides, absent undisclosed non-recurring effects over and above what seems to be a small impairment that the results could be so weak, Peter.</p>

          <p>You think they are very weak, Mark? Let me first catch your base..</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About 500 million below where they should have been I think, Jeroen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't try to be defensive about it. But what is -- what do -- I'm not sure by the way it's a 500 million figure. But what have you seen, yes, really can't impact, not that so much damage, but you didn't have electricity, all those kind of things. That is one important factor. Secondly, we are a liquid cracker rather than a gas condensate cracker. And especially in our U.S. portfolio, this broke us up over the summer. That are two important factors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To give you two more, Mark, there is 80 million of the hurricane costs in it, which you have cost of margin. So that's one. And the other one is actually, we had another strong quarter in Nanhai in China because of the demand slow down within China in the third quarter and post-contributed actually quite significantly through the results and that's why we are lower.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon gentlemen. Just two questions. Firstly, can you remind us of your share buyback policy and whether your share buybacks are tied to disposals? And secondly, in your comments earlier, you talked about the historical correlation between oil prices and costs. And you also said that it was too early to see the impact on next year's CapEx or inflation. So what's your best guess of how quickly costs can adjust to lower oil price environment? I mean are we talking about six months, one year or 18 months? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The buyback policy is very simple. We have our four financial building blocks, which I said already is dividend, it's organic growth, it's the safe conservative balance sheet. If there is cash surplus, then we can either choose to buy it back, we can choose to further invest in organic growth or we can actually do inorganic growth acquisitions as well. So they are not straight type back to divestments; it's the overall cash flow and balance sheet structure which drives this. So it's market circumstances which we take into account and obviously also take yield thinking into account when we look at our share prices.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, it is quite clear. It's too early to see it and that's why we have said at the moment up to the last let's say 6, 8 weeks and the price is coming down so far, we have roughly a 10% inflation. And I think that's something which you need to think about when you look at our CapEx figures for next year. There might be impact coming later on but typically in a CapEx number, it takes, I would say 12 to 18 months to actually get the full effect of cost decreases in. You may see it little bit early in OpEx, but typically we work with two to three years of contract. So it takes a while before these things come out. And then you need to structure your balance sheet in such a way. So I think that's the way you need to look at this and you may not see the impact from a cost point of view that early in the CapEx number, but please be reminded, we can always postpone project and therefore that will have an impact obviously in the absolute amount which we spend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. Paul Andriessen, Fortis Bank, Netherland. Another two questions about CapEx. What is your room for maneuver at all to throttle down on upstream CapEx given that you stick to the 3 -- 2 to 3% growth outlook for the next decade and progressive dividends? And the second question against let's say around 13 billion organic CapEx of this year going into next year, how much is already committed on existing projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I take the second one first and come back to the first one. As I said on the pre -- post-FID project, we will -- we are committed and we go through that. And these are the major pillars obviously of our capital expenditure. So no change there; we take a long-term view on oil prices and performance of these projects. And I think the worse you can do with an oil and gas business to do a stop-and-go policy on capital expenditures, that's from a strategic point of view and also the right thing to do. As I said earlier, when you look at your cash flow and your balance sheet structure, you take into account how you are going to actually structure it in a low oil price scenario in a medium and in a high one and given that we are at 7% of a gearing ratio at this stage, we have got an extremely solid balance sheet and hence we can follow through with our dividend policies and we can follow through with our organic growth strategy which we have outlined in the past. So I think we are very strong, we are in the right position for this downturn. We have always said, we don't believe in these very high oil prices. We do believe in long term high oil prices we have said that. But I think you are -- you need to measure the -- or go through the stormy waters as Jeroen calls them and continue to work on the same issues and pay your dividends. So I am very happy where we are.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. I just wondered if you could give us some thoughts on the availability of financing as you are seeing at the movement for projects, which were approaching FID over the next 12 months or so and I guess specifically wondering if this is a possible source of delayed FIDs on those project which would traditionally require project financing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I take this, I guess Jeroen. I think there are two answers to do this question, there is a Shell answer and a market answer. From a Shell point of view, we have only a very few projects where we actually do project financing. Normally we are a self-financing organization or company. And we if can't actually finance and don't have the financial muscles, then most of them will not go into a project. So from that point of view, I wouldn't see at this stage that because of missing project financing a project would not go ahead.</p>
          <p>There is obviously a wider question on partner strengths and that's where you assess your counterparty risk with whom you are actually developing these projects et cetera et cetera. And there is the wider market and I think there you have a point that most probably some projects of weaker companies, weaker in the sense of financial stability maybe already burdened with high CapEx and high leverage already that they most probably will have to postpone or take other partners in. Now I think that's what Jeroen referred to it in the earlier part, the financial crisis, the economical crisis had some challenges, but it also has opportunities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. You have mentioned in detail the criteria leading to your FID process. I was just wondering when it comes to exploration, how do you envisage your exploration effort given the current commodity price volatility and given the sharp increase next...<mark type="audio gap" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You broke away. Probably easiest to repeat your question. So you talked about the FID process and then we had difficulty to catch your question. Can you go again Dominique?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. I'm sorry for the line. So you've detailed the criteria leading to your FID decision. I was assuming that cost trend coming to your exploration results given the current commodity prices, volatility and given the fact that you have sharply increased your exploration as well over the past couple of years, how do you envisage exploration into the coming months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good question. Exploration. I think the best example is we spent a lot of exploration money this year on the Chukchi Sea.  That is Arctic area close, not that close, but relatively close to the North Pole. How do you do that? First of all, if you do that exploration, you know that you first have to explore, then you have to develop projects. This is offshore, so and then after &#x2013; and you hope to be, not lucky, you hope to find the good stuff to develop that. But it will take many years before the production starts. This is the kind of basins where we expect after that production has started that you continue to produce for quite some years as well.</p>
          <p>So basically, you have to take the kind of view here is what will be hydrocarbon prices many years or partly more than a decade away. So short-term price swings, as we have seen over the past several, have hardly have any influence with that. And of course, in order to assume those prices, we get inspiration from our long-term energy scenarios. As we have -- as we have published that.</p>
          <p>However, I would like to add two things. First of all, it is not only about prices for gas or oil assumes it is very important how this work, the royalty regimes, how can the cost recovery go for the taxation, et cetera. These are very important assumptions, nobody can say what is the tax for 15 years but we have learned over the past years that usually tax regimes of countries are relatively constant, and in certain other countries they change all the time. So you take that into account. Last but not least, Chukchi Sea's a good example, what is the percentage of chance that you have majored oil or gas finds and here I would like to explain that we did have experience from some time ago, where that say from the 80s because we have been drilling there and we know a lot about the geology. What we took in account as well, is if we found new fields there is that we think we have the right type of competences and capabilities not only to do a good job from an economic point of view, relative to the competition, but we think that in Shell, we can work very well in a responsible way in those Arctic and environmental sensitive areas. So that's how we do it.</p>
          <p>Operator, can I close the conference?</p>
          <p>Sorry, don't do it, because before we close it, Peter would like to say something specific. Can I close the questions part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I take over. Before we close, let me remind you that we will be releasing Q4 '08 results on the 29th of January '09. In the same way that we update the markets last year, we will give you the 2008 reserves figures with the annual report and the 20-F, not with the fourth quarter results. We will do that somewhere in March as I expect the annual report and 20-F to be filed then. Let me also clarify that the '08 reserves reporting will be on the current SEC definitions. If the SEC adopts new reserves definitions this year, we expect these definitions to be put in place for 2009 20-F filing, not for '08.</p>
          <p>So thanks for all -- to all of you for joining the call and have a nice afternoon. Thank you.</p>
