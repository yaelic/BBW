          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Inditex conference starts now. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Inditex's CEO. This presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session, comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone and the second part to the questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex's results for the interim half year 2009. I am Pablo Isla and here with me today are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO; and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, our Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>I would like to cover a few of the highlights. First, the results for the first half 2009 show that Inditex continues its ongoing international multi-concept growth. Net sales in local currencies have grown 9%. In line with the strategic priorities presented to you last March, operating expenses are tightly under control. Let me also highlight that we have kept our strict focus on capital efficiency, resulting in a strong generation of cash over the period.</p>
          <p>In terms of growth, we have maintained a strong international expansion over the period. This has resulted in an increasing share of international sales, reaching 68% of total versus 65% at the same point of the previous year. I would like to highlight the rapid growth we are experiencing in markets with strong potential in Asia. As a result, Asia has grown for 10% to 12% of group sales in just one year.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez who will provide some of the detail behind the headline numbers, and I will join you later for the outlook section. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first half of 2009, Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;4.9 billion. Sales in local currency have grown 8%. We have achieved an EBITDA of &#x20AC;799 million and net income of &#x20AC;375 million.</p>
          <p>Starting with sales, let me tell you that new segment space has contributed 11% to total sales growth in the first half of 2009. Like-for-like sales were down 2%. The translation of sales in currencies different to the euro have deducted 2 percentage points from reported sales growth, due to lower exchange rate versus our reporting currency. In terms of gross profit, this line has increased 5% to &#x20AC;2.7 billion. This has resulted in a gross margin on sales of 55.3%, mainly due to the evolution of currencies.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 8% in the period, mainly due to the addition of new retailer space. Regarding the efficiencies for 2009 that we announced to you last March, we are on track to reach the target of &#x20AC;75 million.</p>
          <p>The evolution of current account is in line with the performance of the business. Inditex continues to show a strong financial position. The net cash position has reached &#x20AC;961 million at the end of the first half of 2009. Let me remind you that this year we have changed our dividend calendar. Therefore, this cash position already includes the payment of our interim dividend of &#x20AC;343 million in May.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>I will go briefly over the performance by concepts. As you can see in this chart, the majority of the concepts have continued growing sales significantly over the period. In the case of Zara, the growth rate in the first half of 2009, 5%, is due to the lower number of openings versus the first half of 2008. As we mentioned to you earlier in the year, the calendar of openings for Inditex and particularly for Zara is biased towards the second half of 2009. Regarding the younger concepts, Stradivarius and Bershka have performed above the average and Oysho and Zara Home below the average.</p>
          <p>I am now handing over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcos. Leveraging on our experience in ecommerce, we are expanding our presence as a multi-channel retailer. Zara will launch online sales for the autumn/winter season 2010. The initial launch will take place in Spain, France, Germany, the U.K, Italy and Portugal. This will be followed by a progressive rollout in all markets in which Zara is present.</p>
          <p>For the rest of 2009, we will continue to invest profitably in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns. In 2009, we estimate that the store opening program will result in around 10% retailer space growth.</p>
          <p>Our capital allocation process remains very strict. We expect capital expenditure in 2009 to be &#x20AC;600 million. Additionally, as you know, significant logistic investments to support our expansion until 2012 were completed in fiscal 2008. Regarding the start of the autumn/winter season, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from the 1st of August to the 14th of September are growing by 9%.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Mr. Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, just a quick question on the online launch. Firstly, what proportion of group sale does Zara represent in the online launch countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on the country because there are...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Adding together, adding Spain, Portugal, U.K., Germany, Italy and France.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Adding all the countries, you would expect because as far as there are countries &#x2013; you would expect around 60%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of Zara sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. 60% of total sales in those countries are Zara sales more or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on a group basis is that more like about a third or something like that of group sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't understand your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Zara's turn over in those countries, what's the average percent of group turnover?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, but you know more or less the weight of the different countries &#x2013; you just see Spain is around 30% of total group sales, and then you have the other countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in terms of any initial testing, what sort of advantage have you seen from adding online channel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question, sorry, is related...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To the online launch &#x2013; in testing the online channel, what sort of revenue benefits have you seen from any trials you've conducted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're referring to the Zara Home online sales or what is your question exactly about? Or what...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about the online sales (9.28).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...or what are our expectations regarding Zara?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our expectation regarding Zara, Zara online sales, that is your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's too early to talk about any particular figure. So what we are announcing right now is from the balancing (9.46) of Zara in these markets in the autumn/winter season and progressively the rollout in all the other markets in which Zara is present. We think it's a relevant and strategic move and &#x2013; but we think it's too early to give any precise figure about what we are expecting. We think it's a very interesting channel for us and at this stage I think it could be too early to talk about any expectation about sales for this channel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Richard Chamberlain from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a question on the gross margin, please. I wonder if you could just give a bit more color on the drivers of the gross margin in the first half? I know you tend to talk about this much on a sort of quarterly basis, but I wonder if you can just talk about the gross margin drivers in the second quarter, whether that &#x2013; it came in a bit weaker than I thought and I wonder if that was higher than expected currency impact or more from inventory drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main driver in the evolution of the gross margin was this &#x2013; evolution has to do with currency impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of inventory control, is that roughly the same last year in terms of markdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very similar, okay. And then just another one on the Zara online launch, could you say how much this is costing to set up and also whether it's going to be a pure play online launch or whether you'll have a catalog with it as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding costs, not a big impact compared to our cost base, so nothing really significant from that point of view. And what we are planning to do is to have our own site <mark type="inaudible" /> to be the platform for the online sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there won't be any kind of catalog...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No catalog.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's just going to be pure play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are just thinking about Internet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes now from Mr. Warwick Okines from Deutsche Capital. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. I just wonder if you could tell us how much of the 75 million cost savings you've delivered in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say in euro (12.35) terms, the proportional part of it, the target is very ambitious for the whole year as you know and we think the target is achievable and we continue working on obtaining this additional savings. So, in the first half you could assume 50% of the initial target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And could you give us some indication of the CapEx spend for the <mark type="inaudible" /> year, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx already spent through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the year to January 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the next year. No, but it would have a lot to do with the space growth. As you know logistic investments have already been made, so there is not any additional relevant CapEx from that point of view. So it has a lot to do with the evolution of space growth. But I think it's too early to quantity exactly the figure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is too detailed to talk about right now. From which warehouse, is your question, are we going to manage the logistics?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I see that you're confirming your &#x2013; the space growth rate of 10% for the current fiscal year. At one point in the previous conference thought you were pointing to a risk a number of stores being delayed in 2010 because of shopping malls being delayed. I wonder whether you see this risk now moderating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the situation remains very similar to the one we were talking about in the first quarter results conference call. There could be some delays, not &#x2013; in any case it would not be a relevant figure. Also at the same time new opportunities arise. So, well, it can always be the case, some shopping malls being postponed from one year to a different year. But nothing very different to what we submitted to you in June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. With the online project, very excited to see the development of this, you're already pointing out to the fact that after these markets would be rolling it out to our bazaar market, I think that the natural move would be to extend it to other formats as well, other concepts as well, like Massimo Dutti and Bershka. Do you envisage to do that if the Zara rollout is successful in subsequent seasons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that the Internet is becoming a more and more relevant channel. And regarding the other format, it would not be &#x2013; it would be illogical to continue expanding Internet to all the other format, but there is no specific plan right now in the short-term about the launching of the other formats in Internet. But in the medium-term you could assume so because it's a channel that is becoming more and more relevant. We began with Zara Home; now we are launching Zara, which is the biggest <mark type="inaudible" /> I would say, and in the medium-term you could expect other formats also to go online.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. You pushed down your CapEx <mark type="inaudible" /> fairly aggressively over the last few years. Has this now reached the bottom or do you think you can make further progress in terms of reducing your overall cost per store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, you know that specifically this year we have target to reduce CapEx per square meter by 15%. See, this is part also of the efficiencies plan. Obviously, we always try to obtain efficiencies, but we believe that we <mark type="inaudible" /> for that we're doing over the 2009. This is very much where we have to be right now. We always try to obtain further efficiencies, but we believe that the <mark type="inaudible" /> doing in 2009 is very much taking things to where they want them to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Could I just ask a follow-up on the online offer? Are you going to offer a collect store and that goes for the potential to take returns back to store or is it going to be completely divorced from the store network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, about all the details I think that &#x2013; the commercial details to the &#x2013; will be explained in due time. But it wouldn't make any sense to forget about the fact that we have stores for returns or for possibility for the delivery. So, of course we'll have in mind that we also have stores. But regarding all the details, we'll announce then in due time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I was wondering about &#x2013; a little bit about the local currency growth of 9% that we've started seen already in the second half of the year. Now that's pretty much in line with the local currency growth we've seen in the first half, but you will have a significant much more amount of store expansion expected in the second half. So, does that mean that the implicit like-for-like is deteriorating a bit, what we've seen so far in the last half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know that we believe that six weeks is not a very important period of time, especially because August is not an important month in terms of sales and we prefer to look at like-for-likes on a seasonal basis. What I can tell you regarding your question is that the space contribution, at least in this period, is very similar to that of the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So even though there's a difference in how you're ramping up the sources space contribution will be around the same levels for the two periods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're talking about just six weeks, so it's not very relevant.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Regarding Zara Home online sales, we prefer because on commercial reasons not to disclose what percentage online sales represent. What we can tell you is that we are very satisfied with the evolution of Zara Home online sales, but we prefer not to disclose the percentage that it represents because of commercial reasons. And regarding the second part of the question...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding OpEx you see that operating expenses have grown by 8%. Remember that in general it's difficult for operating expenses not to be connected to a space growth and our expectation remains for operating expenses to be in line with the space or slightly below, but no big change here.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm just coming back to the online effort and try to understand to what extend it's going to require additional CapEx in IT or in logistics. Is it all going to be driven off your existing CapEx or should we expect an increase in CapEx in 2010 versus 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, existing CapEx, so no increase. You should not expect any increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Also, on the &#x2013; you mentioned 10% space expansion for 2009 and I was just wondering, what was that space expansion in the first half of 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the first half space growth was more or less 11%.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Could I just ask a follow-up on OpEx. You operate quite as highly incentivized models, and I assume that one element of the reduced OpEx growth this year is down to an assumption of lower variable contributions. Would that amortize steadily over the year or would it have a bigger impact on OpEx in the last quarter of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding OpEx what I think &#x2013; what we're saying is very much in line with what we've said in the full-year result presentation and the first quarter results presentation. We have an ambitious target for the year which is to obtain &#x20AC;75 million additional savings. We are on track with this ambitious target. We are acting in all the different lines of the &#x2013; of OpEx, now we are acting on rental expenses, procurement, head count, personnel expenses at these two levels. So we are acting in all the different lines.</p>
          <p>We are developing efforts to &#x2013; for viable costs to represent a higher proportion over our total cost base. As we have and transmitted to you in previous conference calls, now we could assume that around 40% of our cost base is viable. And we continue making a lot of efforts from that point of view regarding all the different lines. So the target for the year remains to obtain the &#x20AC;75 million additional savings. And as Marcos was saying before, this year you could assume cost growth to be slightly below space growth for the whole year because of all these initiatives.</p>
          <p>What we can say is that we feel satisfied about this cost control measures that we are developing all across the company, which is something that is being done at every level, at every format, at every country. And so all the company now is very, very cost conscious and this why we think this target that we announced at the beginning of the year, the &#x20AC;75 million additional target, is ambitious but achievable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that 40% there I believe is equally expressed through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our last question in the conference call comes now from Mr. John Guy from MF Global Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. My first question is with regards to the Spanish trends you've seen in the second quarter. Noticeably, that a certain point in a &#x2013; the bigger store sales has a significantly better performance relative to its smaller players, only down about 1% &#x2013; 1.9% year-on-year in July. I was just wondering how Zara performs in the second quarter and are you noticing any change in trends overall in the Spanish market from the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you can imagine Spain is a market that we know very well in which we feel very comfortable. In Spain, we are trading above the figures published by the statistics office if there are any. It is true that Spain in terms of like-for-like is below the average, but the spread between the average like-for-like and the Spanish like-for-like has not deteriorated any further. So what we've seen is that there is no further deterioration in the Spanish numbers versus the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up with regards to the Zara online announcement today, obviously you see significant opportunity, but with regards to any impact to Zara stores, can you envisage online will cannibalize significantly the stores that you already have in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not expecting that at all. We think it's complementary. And we are not expecting at all any type of cannibalization. No, not at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>We are now finishing the telephone Q&amp;A session to address the questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, now we are going to start to answer the questions that we have just received through the online platform. So there is our first question coming from A. Carlson talking about the pricing environment that we are seeing among our competitors in the largest <mark type="inaudible" /> markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For those I'll say, regarding our commercial policy, no significant changes with what we've transmitted to you before in previous conference calls. We maintain broadly our commercial polices in the different European and world markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have another question coming from Ibersecurities which is asking about the target like-for-like for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say about this is that of course we continue operating in a challenging retailing environment and our target for the second half &#x2013; knowing that this is a very ambitious target, but our target for the second half as managers of the company would be to have better like-for-like in the second half than in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another question which is pretty detailed, it is about the evolution of payables into the current accounts, the reason why the payables are lower versus last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I &#x2013; what I would say is that regarding the current account it's difficult to compare with the previous year mainly due to the different calendar in three factors. First one, the different dividends &#x2013; dividend payment; the second one, the different fiscal accounts; and third one, the different calendar of openings this year results in a lower number of payables for suppliers of fixed assets.</p>
          <p>So this is why all-in-all, the current accounts this year are difficult to compare with the previous one. The case, specific of payables, is due to the lower number of openings resulting in a lower number of payables for &#x2013; to the suppliers of fixed assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have another quick one that has been already answered about the performance in Spain and the operating expenses performance &#x2013; potential operating expenses performance for the full year. There is just a few here try to know if we are going to promote the online sales to any specific advertising campaign.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We are not planning any relevant change regarding our policy from that point of view. Of course, we will have marketing initiatives, but we are not planning any big change regarding our current policies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have had question specifically about the Lefties format, how many stores we may have at this point in time in Lefties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know Lefties for us is not a concept, it's a channel that we have used mainly to clear damaged goods from the collections coming from Zara. So the Lefties is just part of a platform, but it's &#x2013; we don't have any specific plans for Lefties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have another question, which is pointing to the strong cash position, we have just obtained at the end of first half if we can explain drivers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the first half of 2009, our cash generation has remained strong due to the tight control of operating expenses and efficient capital allocation process. As you know, the net cash position of &#x20AC;961 million at the end of the first half of 2009 already includes the <mark type="inaudible" /> of an interim dividend of &#x20AC;343 million. We will maintain the ongoing revision of our capital expenditure terms and also try to obtain efficiencies in our operating expenses in order to maximize our free cash flow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have another question, which is &#x2013; having in mind the dollar evolution so far and having in mind our hedging policy, the potential impact we may experience at the gross margin level of dollar evolution versus euro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All-in-all combining our commercial policies or hedging &#x2013; our vision remains the same. Our role will be to <mark type="inaudible" /> a difference of 50 basis points versus the gross margin of the previous year would not be any surprise for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question so far, well, I would say this has been already answered, it's about the sustainability of the cost growth rate of the second quarter regarding Q3 and Q4, I don't know if you want to add some more color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I would say &#x2013; I would repeat what we were saying during the conference call that with all these initiatives we are developing inside the company what we could assume is cost growth to be slightly below space growth for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you very much to all of you for joining us during this conference call for the first half results presentation. And as you all know, we'll continue being ready to answer your questions directly through the Capital Markets Department. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
