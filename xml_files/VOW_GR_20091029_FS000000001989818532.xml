          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Volkswagen January to September 2009 Results Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Ms. Christine Ritz, Group Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volkswagen's conference call on the results for the period January to September 2009. I am joined today by Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Finance and Controlling; and by Detlef Wittig, Executive Vice President, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Group Sales and Marketing.</p>
          <p>As usual, you can also follow the webcast and download the chart from our website volkswagenag.com/ir. Questions can be sent by e-mail or called in. Before we start, I would like to mention that as usual after the presentation, we will first respond to the questions of analysts and later answer those of journalists.</p>
          <p>I would now like to pass you over to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and a warm welcome also from my side to this call today. Since our last earnings call that came to live, we have certainly been busy here at Volkswagen. Times such as these remains very important to keep the close eye on the operating business.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to say that we continue to perform positively despite the tough overall environment and significantly better than the overall market. Our products have proved to be the right ones at the right time supported in those small parts by government actions in Germany, China and Brazil. However, as the benefit of government support eases we are wise to remain cautious on the true state of underlying demand.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for January to September was &#x20AC;1.5 billion, following a typically weak third quarter, due to summer factory shutdowns. This performance reflects in particular that the incredible performance of our Chinese joint ventures is contained in our financial results as we consolidate the earnings here at equity.</p>
          <p>With a negative financial result, profit before tax came in a fraction under &#x20AC;1.1 billion. In this uncertain world, we have continued to work hard to reduce stocks even further with a positive impact on working capital.</p>
          <p>Automotive net cash flow came in at just over &#x20AC;5 billion. And we added a further &#x20AC;1 billion in the quarter to automotive liquidity, reported a closing balance of &#x20AC;13.4 billion</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand over to Mr. Wittig, who will take you through the development of our deliveries to customers. Mr. Wittig, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and from my side also a warm welcome to you, ladies and gentlemen. On the first chart you can see the development of the world car market, passenger car market this year, first by each quarter and then by months, for the third quarter, in comparison to last year's figures. And you can see that after a dramatic decline of minus 21% in the first quarter, then the world market showed first signs of relief, at least statistically, and in the second quarter by a minus of 13%, followed in August and September, the market grew by 2% and 1% respectively. But I would like to repeat again, statistically and I will explain this a little later.</p>
          <p>So the result of this quarter three is that it is almost on the same level as last year &#x2013; as last year and with a weak third quarter already, and that's why I would like to add a note of caution.</p>
          <p>As the car market started to decline last year from May the comparison with last year's figures show, naturally statistically, signs of improvement, while in reality the markets have only stabilized on a low level that is being shown and demonstrated on the next chart.</p>
          <p>This chart compares the development of the world car market with the year 2007 which we regard as a normal year than 2008 and this year 2009 by months. And when we look at this chart and compare this year's progress with it normally of 2007 we can clearly say that all see that also in the third quarter of 2009 that this quarter is far below the 2007 levels and there is no sign of recovery.</p>
          <p>The next chart we show our &#x2013; Volkswagen Group deliveries to customers as compared with world market and here you can see with the gray figures the variance rate of the world market as compared in the black figures or dark figures the variance of our &#x2013; sales of our deliveries to customers. And you can see that in contrast to the total market that we recorded visible upturn. Since May already, our deliveries to customers have shown positive year-on-year development. And this growth continued in July and August and in September and our deliveries in the third quarter as a total stood up at plus 9.1%. That is shown in the last column to the right. We are better doing than the overall car market. The car market in the third quarter, as mentioned before, was at last year's level, at last year's weak level. And this is certainly and clearly supported by the scrapping incentive in the German market where we achieved a result of plus 26% and also by the developments in China and in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In China, and in Brazil also, governmental stimulus packages and in Brazil mainly tax incentive supported the market and naturally also our sales results. As a result of our outperformance, outperforming the total market, we are gaining actually globally market share.</p>
          <p>Next chart, once more again the world car market in comparison to our Volkswagen Group deliveries, but now going specifically through the different areas of the world, different regions, and it shows that the success of the Volkswagen Group is not only specifically focused on one area but it is in all areas around the world.</p>
          <p>When I start with the North American market, you would see the two columns there, the minus 26% of the car market in the North American market &#x2013; car market. This is passenger cars plus light commercial vehicles. And we suffered from minus of 8.6% compared to the 26% minus of the total market. So we did better.</p>
          <p>The same situation in Western Europe, the car market down by nearly 5%. We were down by 3.8%. This was mainly due to our short supply situation and changeover of the Polo generation of cars. Central and Eastern Europe, this is one of the most and &#x2013; most hit car market areas in the world. The car market went down by minus 46%, as you know.</p>
          <p>Russia as the largest market there went down by 51, 52% and we performed comparatively better with a minus of 30%. South America, the market is down, the total market is down by minus 6.9%. We were at last year's level with a slight minus of only 0.2%. And the rest of the world, you can see the figures there. But I would like to stress and I have to stress especially Asia-Pacific, and Asia-Pacific here we see that we were able to expand our sales by 31%, while the market was up by 10%. So our success is not, and I would like to repeat this, is not generated in one specific area only, but it is consistent in all world regions and when it is consistent there must be a driving factor, and we regard as our driving factor our young, attractive and value-oriented product range.</p>
          <p>Now turning to with the next chart to the absolute numbers of deliveries to customers by these market areas, and the first column shows the total Volkswagen Group sales figures. We delivered 4.79 million cars to our customers, which is more or less at the same level of last year. And from our previous reports, you know that our expectations were much lower. So we are above our expectations.</p>
          <p>Western Europe, including Germany, our deliveries declined by only 3.8%. We delivered 2.2 million cars to customers. And that was especially supported and boosted by Germany with a plus of 21% as far as our sales figures are concerned supported by the German governmental scrapping program.</p>
          <p>Central and Eastern Europe, a minus of 32% as mentioned before, 288,000 cars. We were gaining market share at the same time and in the Russian market we were climbing up to the number three position in the Russian market.</p>
          <p>Our deliveries in South America reached the same level as in the first three quarters of 2008. And in Asia-Pacific we sold more cars after nine months now than in the 12-month period of a year ago, with over one million deliveries to customers in the Chinese market, which is a plus of 37% for us. The Chinese market became now the number one market for the Group. While we were, with the Volkswagen brand already in that category, Chinese market being the number one market again last year for the brand of Volkswagen, this year for the total Group.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the sales performance of the individual brands of the Group, into the next chart. Volkswagen Passenger Car as our strongest brand, delivered 7.5% more cars than last year. So this is a plus of 7.5%. I think this an excellent performance, up to now just over three million units and &#x2013; in the case of Volkswagen driven by strong demand in Germany and in China and in Brazil. Those were the sales-driving markets.</p>
          <p>Audi's deliveries, yes, were down by minus 7.5% to 705,000 cars. But as premium brand Audi marginally benefited from the stimulus programs in Europe and in the United States. Audi was able to outperform the direct premium competitors, its market &#x2013; and improved its market position in the premium segments substantially making Audi now the number one brand in the premium segment in Western Europe and with a major distance we are number one in the premium market in China as well.</p>
          <p>&#x160;koda's deliveries decreased by 5% to 504,000 cars suffering from weak home markets in Central and in Eastern Europe and certainly also still being influenced by the strong Czech currency. SEAT, yes, suffered a decline of 11% as the Spanish market was down by nearly 30%. We consider this comparatively a good performance. And in Western Europe, SEAT gained market share. Bentley was down 46% in the first three quarters of 2009 compared to last year due to the financial crisis, which hit the high luxury sector especially in the United States and in the U.K. Nevertheless, despite that downswing of the sales, Bentley also gained market share in its sector segment.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles deliveries to customers declined by 30% down to 268,000 units. But when we sort of utilize the effect that last year we had in our numbers included 42,000 trucks and buses, which we now handed to MAN in South America then the comparison looks a bit different. Then our light commercial vehicle deliveries declined only by minus 23% while the commercial vehicle market in Europe &#x2013; the light commercial vehicle market in Europe went down by 27%. So we are at a very stable position and even marginally increased our position on the European market.</p>
          <p>Scania was heavily impacted by the very weak truck market. Truck market above 515 ton suffered a minus 30% decline. However, the figures that we are showing here reflect only the start of our &#x2013; of the consolidation in our books during the course of 2008.</p>
          <p>We now like to have a quick look at the development of our new car stocks worldwide. I think this is of most interest to you because of the impact on our working capital.</p>
          <p>At the end of last year, December 2008, we had worldwide a total stock, total new car stock including dealer level, of 1.2 million cars. And you'll see that by March at the end of the first quarter, we were able to reduce that stock level already by minus 140,000 cars down to 1,050,000 cars by drastic cuts or through drastic cuts of production in the first quarter and certainly additional sales activities and by the end of June, we went even further down and now at the end of September we managed to reduce our stock down to a level of 780,000 cars which is a minus or a reduction of more than 400,000 cars as compared to the situation end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Situation of low stocks now, end of September, indicates a certain under supply situation already especially as far as Volkswagen Audi are concerned in Germany and in China and also in Brazil. So we will have to and we will optimize the situation within the next forthcoming months.</p>
          <p>Now let me conclude my statement here by looking ahead and showing a few highlights on some of our new models, which will then provide a strong basis for our continued sales performance in the forthcoming months. At the top left there is the new Polo with its best-in-class combination of quality, design and driving pleasure. By now, we have taken more than 100,000 orders for the new Polo in the European markets. And it is already a success story in the, what we call the A0 segment.</p>
          <p>After the market introduction of the five-door version, we are now adding the three-door version of the Polo starting this &#x2013; next month in November.</p>
          <p>Up the top right, there is the Audi A5 &#x2013; the Audi S5 Sportback complementing the Audi A5 Sportback that was introduced in September and with the S5 version we will go to market in February next year. So along the lines of the Audi brand guidelines more sportiness, less fuel, latest technology in engine transmission and drive trend has really been in line with the Audi slogan, Vorsprung durch Technik. The Sportback, the S5 Sportback was displayed for the first time at the Frankfurt Motor Show.</p>
          <p>We are turning to &#x160;koda, with the &#x160;koda Superb Combi. We will certainly set another sort of highlight according to the &#x160;koda brand guidelines of roominess and of elegance and the Superb Combi will be introduced on the European market beginning of next year.</p>
          <p>And finally the new transporter Multivan, our modern large size salon has been introduced on the markets right now this month and this is the first glimpse on what is going to come out as far as product offer is concerned, supporting our sales performance in the next forthcoming months.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and I would like to return over to Mrs. Ritz.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Wittig. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, can you take us through the financials, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course I can. And before I start I think it's very important to mention here that although our total Group deliveries to customers were down just 0.2%, as Mr. Wittig explained, our vehicle sales, excluding our Chinese joint ventures at 3.7 million cars were down 10.7%. Important statistic as we look in depth at our financial performance.</p>
          <p>Our sales revenue, which again excludes our Chinese joint ventures, fell by 9.7% to &#x20AC;77 billion. Whilst Scania was not fully consolidated for the whole of 2008 in contrast, 2009 has also been impacted by the sale of our truck activities in Resende to MAN.</p>
          <p>Looking at the details, the drop in sales volume translated into a negative impact of 8.9 billion of sales revenue. Price was positive at &#x20AC;0.6 billion, while strong sales in Germany only partially compensated for deterioration in the overall mix for a net minus &#x20AC;0.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Positive impact from the dollar only partially offset negative influences from the British pound and to Brazilian Real amongst others for a net negative of &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Our Financial Services division reported an improvement of &#x20AC;0.8 billion owing to higher sales of leased vehicles.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to operating profit. Operating profit declined to &#x20AC;1.5 billion, down 3.4 billion on January to September 2008. And surprisingly given the sales figures we have reported, volume, price and mix had a significantly negative impact of &#x20AC;3.5 billion. Currency was a further drag on earnings of one billion. The currencies were the British pound and the Russian rubel as well as other emerging market currencies.</p>
          <p>Our intense focus on cost continues both with respect to our product but also with our overheads which combined with depreciation led to a combined improvement of &#x20AC;1.1 billion. The one-off gain from the sale of our heavy trucks activities in Brazil is reduced to &#x20AC;0.4 billion as through the year we also lose the benefit in the operating result of the related truck sales.</p>
          <p>Scania continued to show remarkable resilience in the phase of the very dramatic downturn in the truck sector and remains just in the black before PPA adjustment. And to complete this chart, Financial Services reported a decline of &#x20AC;0.3 billion due mainly to higher provisions.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to cash flow. Operating cash flow improved 21.7% to &#x20AC;9.4 billion. This positive performance is substantially related to a strong improvement in working capital of &#x20AC;4.2 billion resulting in particular from our strict inventory management. As we move into Q4, we will see some reduction of these gains as due to seasonality factors our demand for working capital will increase.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx ratio of 5.7% is in line with our target. Lower revenue impacts the calculation here, however, the more significant influence is our expansion into the U.S., India and Russia as well as further investments in power train and new model such as the new Polo.</p>
          <p>For the first nine months of 2009, our reported cash flow from investing activities stood at a net &#x20AC;4.3 billion or &#x20AC;5.5 billion when adjusted for the sale of the our Resende activities, up 13%. It is precisely this investment phase that we are in at the moment, which underscores our need to have a robust financial base as we enter into the transaction to form an integrated automotive group with Porsche, of which more later.</p>
          <p>Together, net cash flow for the Automotive division was an impressive &#x20AC;5.1 billion, up 5.2 billion versus the comparable period in 2008.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to liquidity. The improvement in operating cash flow only partly offset by our investing needs, resulted in a further improvement in liquidity of the Automotive division. At September the 30, Automotive net liquidity stood at &#x20AC;13.4 billion that's up 5.4 billion versus the year-end 2008. Gross liquidity for the Group stood at &#x20AC;29 billion.</p>
          <p>Our strong financial footing provides valuable security for our long-term planning and is a robust foundation for our financial services activities. I firmly believe that success in our industry today is founded on the twin principles of great cars and the great bank as we have it today.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look now at the financial performance of our nine brands. Earnings declined across all of our brands with the exception of commercial vehicles, which benefited from the sale of our activities in Resende resulting in a net plus of &#x20AC;390 million. Volkswagen Cars reported a profit of &#x20AC;335 million for the nine months benefiting from the pick up in sales in Germany and Brazil, proving insufficient to offset the challenging market conditions elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Audi's operating result reported a very impressive &#x20AC;1.2 billion, maintaining a margin of over 5% demonstrating the robustness of their business. &#x160;koda posted a positive operating result of &#x20AC;162 million. SEAT, currency continues to have a negative influence in combination with the severe decline of Central and Eastern European market. SEAT continues to be dragged down by the collapse in demand in their home market.</p>
          <p>Given the exceptionally tough heavy truck market, Scania showed a remarkable positive of &#x20AC;98 million, helped in no small part by the strength of their service activities before purchase price allocation.</p>
          <p>Financial Services reported &#x20AC;468 million, down 276 million on the comparable 2008 period. And finally, as reported earlier, our sales in China grew remarkably from January to September that's that our joint ventures recorded a proportional operating profit of &#x20AC;525 million that's up 110% on the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now this leads me to our 2009 outlook, which you can read in detail in the interim report. As we have consistently commented throughout 2009, with our strong brands and young, fuel-efficient model range, the Volkswagen Group is clearly demonstrating that it is well prepared for the current economic and market situation. For this reason, we believe that the Volkswagen Group will perform better than the market as a whole and will be able to gain market share during the economic crisis.</p>
          <p>The Group's sales revenue 2009 will be lower than in the previous year in particular due to weaker sales volume. Rising refinancing costs plus worsening mix will serve as an additional drag on earnings. We're countering this trend in particular, through disciplined cost and investment management and continuous optimization of processes within our 18 plus strategy.</p>
          <p>Based on the business development in the first nine months of 2009, we continue to expect that our earnings will not reach the level of previous years. In the phase of these challenges, we expect Volkswagen group to close 2009 with a profit.</p>
          <p>Now let me add a note of caution here with regard to 2010. With the ending of government incentive and continuing weakness in underlying demand, tough market conditions that we face today will endure. All indicators point to a strong contraction in the German market, although the delivery of orders taken before the scrapping incentive closed will provide something of a cushion here.</p>
          <p>The ending of incentive schemes will also see lower levels of sales in other Western European markets while we expect Central and Eastern European markets stabilize at a low level. Looking outside of the Europe, we expect some growth in the U.S. as well as a small positive in Brazil and India, expect the Chinese market to continue to expand, although at a lower level when compared to this year.</p>
          <p>Summary, we remain cautious and predict no substantial recovery in the global market next year. And finally, as promised, showed update on the agreement to form an integrated automotive group of Volkswagen and Porsche.</p>
          <p>As you all know, back on the 13th of August we announced that the Supervisory Boards of both Volkswagen and Porsche agreed upon the creation of an integrated automotive group of Volkswagen and Porsche. This will build on the achievements and history of both companies leading to the creation of a stronger, more competitive, integrated automotive group. Together we are now working on the fine details of the contracts of implementation, which we expect to conclude soon.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen will then take a 49.9% stake in Porsche AG, the operating company, that's up slightly from the former concept of 42% paying approximately &#x20AC;3.9 billion.</p>
          <p>We have announced the shareholder meeting for December 3, where we have asked our shareholders to agree to an issuance of up to a 135 million new preference shares on one or more occasions in the period up to December 2014, maintaining our medium-term financial flexibility. I must stress that this represents a sealing to the shares we could issue in this timeframe. Our goal is to ensure our medium-term flexibility and to secure our strong rating.</p>
          <p>Now part of the transaction is the sale of the highly profitable trading activities of the separately owned Porsche Holding Salzburg to Volkswagen, which will then bring us to a merger of Volkswagen and Porsche SE in 2011.</p>
          <p>For the merger we will use the methods of evaluation which is called IDW S1 which will ensure the thorough and transparent valuation for all participants led by an independent auditor. We have conducted an extensive due diligence exercise in reaching this agreement. Both myself and my colleagues on the Board of Management are convinced that this is a fantastic opportunity for the shareholders of Volkswagen and will speed the emergence of Volkswagen as the world's most profitable car company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. We will now move to the Q&amp;A session, starting first with the questions of analysts.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today will come from Horst Schneider with HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. Three questions, if I may, the first one is on the German order situation after the scrappage scheme has expired. Maybe you can provide some indications to which extent orders have declined on an average after the scheme expired? And then in the context of that also I would be interested in the incentive development after the expiration here of the scheme.</p>
          <p>Then the second question that I have is regarding Q4 outlook. You mentioned after Q2 that Q2 will be the strongest quarter in the course of 2009? Can you confirm that so that means that the Q4 again below the Q2 results in terms of earnings? And then the third question that I have refers to a special item in the balance sheet regarding other current liabilities. I see here that this item has increased by &#x20AC;900 million versus the second quarter. Maybe you can give us here some details what is behind that increase? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Horst. You have two &#x2013; three questions for us, sorry. So the first question is related to the German market. If we can give you an outlook after the end of the scrapping scheme what do we expect for this year or for next year, what is the development here? The second question is &#x2013; regards to our outlook for the fourth quarter. You would like to know if the fourth quarter will be below the second quarter because we communicated earlier that the second quarter will be the strongest one this year. And the third question was related to the special items and the increase in other current liabilities. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to take the first question, asking for the scrappage scheme impact and the time now thereafter. Let me say that we were certainly all surprised by the very positive impact as far as the demand for cars are concerned while the German total market went up in the first nine months of this year by a plus of 26%. So what we do expect is that the market this year will end up at a level of maybe 3.7 million cars which is, when we started looking at 2009 by the end of last year, roughly 900,000 cars or one million cars more than we originally expected. So that is the impact of the scrappage scheme on the total market.</p>
          <p>Now we, especially as far as the Volkswagen is concerned, we are up this year as compared with last year by 32%. So are gaining. We were gaining in the German market and naturally after the expiration of the incentive program, the governmental incentive program, order entries went down by 50, 60%, nothing unusual, something that we expected. But what is most important is that we were able to accumulate an order bank of roughly 500,000 cars this year, all Group brands involved in Germany, which is roughly 50% of the order entry that we had during the first nine months. What we sort of try to evaluate is what is the incremental part of it and when we look at the incremental part of it through checking with our customers and through market research, we do see that there is roughly a 60% incremental sales volume, which gives us an additional 300,000 cars that we did not expect.</p>
          <p>And as we are running at full speed in production, we will not be able to satisfy all this year. So we will have an order bank taking us into the next year, even now. And to finalize my comment, to finish my comment, even though the order entries are going down and now after the expiration of the scrappage scheme, we have accumulated an order bank that will take us into the next year, into maybe even half of next year in order to sort of work our way through.</p>
          <p>So as a total we can simply say that, yes, orders &#x2013; order entries are now going down. But the high level of order bank is something that we did not &#x2013; could not expect before and that is the positive effect of the German scrappage scheme, supporting sales volume, supporting incremental new customers to us, supporting employment and supporting certainly revenue and profit contribution as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can continue on with the comment on the second question on the fourth-quarter outlook. And I think Mr. Wittig already made an important point here, because on the basis of the respective ruling by the German government, we are allowed to ship cars where the orders have been taken under the regime of the scrappage incentive in 2009. We can ship these cars also in the first half of 2010. So this clearly supports for &#x2013; the automotive industry to the extent that we have no, let's say, artificial date like a year-end where all the orders on that basis would have to be fulfilled.</p>
          <p>Or in other words, we are looking at -if the word is  evitably applied in the given economical framework conditions, but a more normal fourth quarter as significant part of the order backlog relates to 2010. So on basis we are looking at a situation where and I can't say, as in almost any normal year, the second quarter will be profitwise the best quarter, but we clearly will be positive in our fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Then the third question on other liabilities, this relates to an increase of provisions and &#x2013; in other liabilities and it's clear that as we continue to operate on a reasonably conservative policy that that's the typical position where we would hedge certain potential risks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, sorry to ask this again, is it just due to an increase in the provisions that increase in other term liabilities is it right or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's two effects, one coming out of an increase of provisions and the other part is other liabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And that might turn around in the first quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have to do a judgment of course almost at the end of the period but expectedly this could be the case.</p>

          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll move now to question from John Lawson with Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Firstly, may I return a bit to this fourth quarter, what I now understand therefore is that your expectation is that production rates will rise through the year-end and that you expect that to continue to &#x2013; continue through December. I just wanted to check that. And in terms of cash in the fourth quarter, clearly you've said that you would have nearly 7% CapEx for the year. I mean, if I take that literally, there's still three billion to spend in the final quarter. I wonder whether you could just comment on that issue for the final part of the year.</p>
          <p>And then if I may just turn to Financial Services, I notice your capital finance penetration remaining pretty steady, 32.6%. China was 16% of the Group last year but it's running 25% right now. Could you just confirm what's the Financial Services penetration in China is? I think I am right in believing that it's very low, but it'd be hopeful if you would just comment on that too. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, John. So, we have three questions. The first two questions refer to the fourth quarter. First of all you would like to know if you can expect a production rise in the last quarter and second question was what cash development do we expect in the fourth quarter and &#x2013; when we have to consider certain CapEx rate for the full year. And the last question relates to the FS business which penetration rates do we have at the moment in China. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as production is concerned, first of all, let's make sure that we have the same understanding here. When we say production rates then it is mainly meant to talk about the daily level of production volume. So this is to say that, first of all, if you look at a period and we compare, for example, the fourth quarter with the third quarter where we had this vacation periods, then it's clear that the fourth quarter should be higher. But at another occasion that I was trying to make it pretty clear that since quite a while we are operating on a reasonably stable level of production rates for the simple reason that to change that would mean that we would have to waste a lot of money on that. The possibility to ship significant part of the order backlog we have on the books today next year is of course heavily supporting the intent to keep the production rate as stable as possible.</p>
          <p>So to the second question concerning cash flow and net liquidity and CapEx, it's clear first of all that we will start slightly to build up inventory and we have to do this. I think Mr. Wittig made the point already because currently we are quite heavily under stocked and this is going to absorb some liquidity throughout the next months to come of course. Then the other issue is CapEx and while you'll certainly recognize that looking at the first nine months we are still in the corridor of the 6%, but quite normally because a number of equipment will have their final fittings installed and we will give approval that the jobs are done. We have to look at a quarter where a CapEx should come up.</p>
          <p>So we stick to the point that we will not be able to keep the CapEx to sales below 6% for the full year, which also of course has certain effect. Nevertheless we of course will maintain a pretty positive net cash flow and net liquidity situation.</p>
          <p>Then on Financial Services, while we are maintaining quite a stable position in terms of penetration rate in the developed markets, we still, in a few emerging market situations, China is just one of them, we're still operating on a reasonably low level because &#x2013; and I think I was trying to point this out several times. We of course have to support our automotive brands. Once they are trying to get a foothold in emerging market situations, that's one thing. But of course we'd like to keep the risks we take there on a reasonable level. That's why in China the penetration rate is still a one-digit number and even in the last couple of months, it's been below 5%.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question today from Jerry Hun from Exane. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. It's Jerry Hun from Exane BNP Paribas. Just following on free cash flow, the comments you have had just made for the positive free cash flow and net liquidity position is for the full year or it's for the Q4? And the second question is about the cost cutting. When we look at what you've achieved in the first nine months, we see that you are roughly on the same speed as what we saw during the previous year. Could we expect to see this rate to continue going forward when we enter 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all my comment was related to the full year. And of course as far as liquidity, net liquidity was concerned, it was meant to the &#x2013; show the situation. Moving through the fourth quarter where I said that we will of course absorb part of the liquidity which is stated at the end of September by a more substantial portion of CapEx and of course also some additional stock which we need because we are currently heavily under stocked. As far as the cost cutting is concerned, yes, we are even to a bit better apples-to-apples compared with 2008. And if you are targeting on this number of product cost improvements of at least one billion, we are still fine with that target and we don't see any reason that we would cut &#x2013; have to cut short on this for 2010.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from Daniel Schwartz with Commerzbank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hello. Daniel Schwartz, Commerzbank. First question would be on the capitalization ratio of R&amp;D. It seems that increased quite a bit in the third quarter compared to the first half. Could you please comment on that?</p>
          <p>The second question would be on the introduction of MQB in 2011. Will that require a significant extra CapEx spending in 2010 or is that covered with your normal five, six, 7% CapEx ratio in 2010?</p>
          <p>And last question would be whether you expect an impact from the plans of the German government to change the taxation of company cars? How important is this segment for Volkswagen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. We have three questions. First question is with regard to our capitalization rate, if we can comment on that development in the third quarter. Then you are asking, you referred to the MQB, which is planned to be introduced in 2011 and if therefore we have an extra CapEx to expect in 2010 or if these expenditures are covered by our planned CapEx ratio. And the last question refers, if we expect any change or if expect an impact of the change of the government with regard to tax on company cars. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to take the first two questions. First of all as far as the capitalization rate in terms of R&amp;D is concerned and we are slightly up in the third quarter compared with the average of the first three quarters. But we are still on a very reasonable basis in spite of the fact that we are in the middle of very substantial push in terms of the product portfolio. And you're well aware about the scheme we do apply which is approved by auditors and that's why I might say at this point there is no flexibility for the management to opportunistically take any sort of decisions. It's defined milestones in our R&amp;D process. And if any of the projects would pass over either one of these milestones, certain part of the R&amp;D cost would be capitalized. So, everything running normal there.</p>
          <p>On the MQB related investments, the question was, if I got it right, whether this would push on a higher CapEx situation in 2010. And I clearly can say here that of course the MQB related investments, at the end of the day are reflected by the car project and are considered that also in our calculation, which we run and therefore it's always meant to be part of our target CapEx to sales of 6%.</p>
          <p>I only have to make it very clear here and that's the main trigger here as we are currently in a process of building partially unfortunately already finalizing new plants in India, in Russia and in the U.S. We are in the middle of a very intense investment cycle, which means that this year and next year we'll not be able to hold on to the 6%, but we'll come out a bit higher. And this year as I already stated it could mean that we will come out at around seven, hopefully a little bit below. And I don't have to say that it's always related, on the one end, to the CapEx here, on the other end of course to sales and there are of course some uncertainties.</p>
          <p>But we are clearly continuing to tailor our investment program whether it's product or structures on the basis of a 6% CapEx to sales ratio and MQB-related investments would be included in that.</p>
          <p>Yeah, talking about potential governmental support for company cars or fleet, first I would like to have a look at the view at the German market. In normal times the German market at a, say, at a size of three million cars does have 1.8 million cars, so 60% of the fleet sales and roughly 40% of private demand. That has changed during 2009, this year, because of the scrappage campaign that supported private sales, private purchases only, which simply says that instead of a market of normally 1.8 million cars in fleet and the major portion being company cars, we are only looking at something like 1.2 or 1.3 million cars. So the mix ratio has turned around. Instead of 60% fleet it's now only 40% fleet.</p>
          <p>If the government would like to continue somehow stimulating the German market or having a soft landing for the German market, it would be certainly recommendable to have a closer look at the fleet market and to have a closer look at the company car market.</p>
          <p>As far as our position is concerned, I think it's known that within our model ranges the Volkswagen Passat is leading in the company car market. We are number one by far, though we would, because of that, most welcome a governmental support there. The Passat is the choice of companies as far as company cars are concerned, choice number one. The famous user-chooser decision in fleet business is in favor of Passat. And Passat share of company cars and fleet sales as far as our Passat model range is concerned is up to 70, 80%. So that's why we would very much welcome this but as we all know there is only a discussion and no decision yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will move now to Adam Hull with WestLB. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. It's Adam Hull from WestLB. Three questions, if I may. Firstly on China, you mentioned it being the largest market, could you talk a little bit as to why you expect 2010 to be up slightly, I think, you said? And maybe you could talk a little bit about whether you assume that the extension &#x2013; there will be an extension of the current low VAT on the engine down to 1.6 liters, do you expect that to be extended, and maybe a little bit on the pricing condition and general conditions affecting the margins in the market there?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the short-term working scheme, I don't know if you can give us a number on what the benefit you're receiving in Q3 or perhaps nine months in Germany and possibly in some of the other countries, just to give us a bit of an idea as to what the benefit is? And then finally, on the scrapping scheme, you're obviously getting a volume boost, but the question clearly is what is the incremental margin on those kind of cars? I mean, would it be of the order of kind of &#x20AC;1,000 per car, is that a kind of sensible working assumption? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Adam you have three questions for us. First question refers to China and the development, which we expect in 2010 for China, you would like to have some more details. The second question is about the short-time working scheme, the benefit which we probably had or have. And the last question is &#x2013; refers to margin which was the impact here probably due to the scrappage scheme. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as far as China is concerned, we enjoy a dynamic extension rate of the Chinese market actually at today 45% plus. Whether this can be continued for the next coming months or for next year, there's certainly a question mark, and we all know that this has been stimulated by the government incentive program. And again when we look at a macroeconomic &#x2013; with a macroeconomic view on it we know that the government is stimulating domestic demand in order to make up for missing export activities because of the world market crisis, the financial crisis. So if the world market and world economy would get back, this could be also a signal to the Chinese government to reduce their stimulation package for the domestic market.</p>
          <p>At the present time we have no signals that the Chinese government would reduce the stimulating program. On the other hand, we do not expect that they continue this forever and that they continue to support a car market increase rate of 40% or something like that. But even if it would be only 10 or 20% next year, then the Chinese market would grow beyond the nine million cars threshold, so a major market in the world, including light commercial vehicles and trucks, it will be and it is today already the largest car market in the world.</p>
          <p>On that point of view we expect that at least a growth rate of 10 to 20% will continue after the 40%, 45% this year. And we do take advantage of it, because with the present threshold of 1.6 liter engines we're well positioned in the Chinese market because we do produce such engines in the Chinese market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, to the second question in terms of the advantage coming out of short time working scheme &#x2013; schemes, there is of course some effective, if everything is put together, it's a, maybe, two-digit number but very low digit two-digit number. And probably let me put it that way the key advantage of these type of schemes is, simply speaking, you do not have to reduce head count and then take a lot of money just to again hire people, get them trained but it's possible to keep the competence in the company. So if &#x2013; as long as the judgment is and we have said in our company that we are looking at a situation where limited period of time will have over capacities but on a reasonable basis, we can't define when we will have an acceptable capacity utilization again. It's a very valuable approach to be applied to people if that was ever necessary on short time working schemes.</p>
          <p>Now as far as the scrapping incentives are concerned, it's clearly a situation where first of all, we have to admit I think altogether that it's been introduced as something to support historically unique situation in the automotive market. And in that sense, I think, it played a very positive role. But essentially the market turned, as Mr. Wittig already explained, into a situation where the product mix and also the mix between the private customers and fleet customers clearly was changing in a very dramatic way.</p>
          <p>So on that basis, it doesn't say that under the scrapping scheme cars would necessarily make less money than in other situations. The key point is that if you look at the German development which just volume wise is a very positive one but it's characterized with a very substantial increase in the number of private customers, who are away from any average type situation in the past, who are buying small cars. That's more or less the situation which you can also read of course in the P&amp;L statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow up on the short working scheme, the low two-digit number, is that for the nine months or for the &#x2013; for Q3? And still, if I could, on the scrappage, I mean, is &#x2013; we're talking, I guess, on the boost of volume is primarily of cars under &#x20AC;10,000, so is that a broad estimation of &#x20AC;1,000 a car or could it be more like too, I mean just to give us a bit of a feel for that boost? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the short time working, if we were looking at single quarters, we definitely would talk about one-digit numbers. And on the margin of cars, as you are well aware, we would not talk about total numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the short term working, finally, just to finish up, am I right in thinking that you primarily &#x2013; it's primarily been Audi and Commercial Vehicles so far, not really VW brand? And could you just give us some indication of how long you could potentially, in a weak market in 2010 or even beyond that, how long you could still apply for short term working for the VW brand in Germany? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think, first of all to the overall situation, it's important to understand that we are not talking about applying short time working for all of our companies, in all our locations. It's just very much a single-location situation where normally cars &#x2013; bigger cars are being manufactured where we all know that for a number of months demand was on a reasonably low level. Now there is very little remaining and it's difficult to say from today's point of view on whether we at all need to embark again on the short time working next year, and in that sense also it's difficult to say where we would potentially apply that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Tom from MMR Work. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two short questions. Do not know whether they have perhaps already been answered because I was in the MAN conference call at the same time, I think, like many of us. Perhaps one shot on the P&amp;L, I see that your gross margin has improved in the third quarter and the decline in profits compared to Q3, 2008 was mainly due to the substantially lower other operating results. And perhaps you can elaborate whether there something special was behind that.</p>
          <p>And the other question is on the German market as a whole. We have seen that people potentially or customers got used to substantially lower car prices. Whether you see any difficulties in bringing these prices up again in the future when people are now used to &#x2013; they have as part of goals at around &#x20AC;10,000 and you in general though ask for around &#x20AC;16,000 for a new car? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we have two questions. The first question is if we can give some details about our other operating result. And the second question is &#x2013; it refers to prices, if we can actually bring prices up in the next couple of months. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well talking about the prices, first of all in a world market that is at best stagnating and I am talking in the world market outside China or in most of the areas the market is sliding down, it will certainly be difficult to bring prices up. The best we can imagine is that we keep our prices stable and stability is also, I think, a very good signal to customers and at the same time, we try to also protect the customer investment in a car by protecting the residual values. And protecting residual values refers Tom &#x2013; staying out of the discount race, because any discount and especially cash discounts on a car are then a lot of deteriorating residual values. And our proposition to customers is, our value to the car and especially as far as residual values are concerned, we have to look at one hand on pricing but on the other hand also at supports, cash discounts promotions where we would like, as a summary, to keep prices stable and to refrain from discounting cars at the same time.</p>

          <p>Going back to the question on the other operating results, the drop was mainly due to lower currency hedging gains and a bit of higher writedown on receivable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we have still a huge interest in asking questions, I would like to ask you to raise one question only. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will take our next question from Marx Volvertan from Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. I will keep this very brief. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch just on &#x2013; you mentioned currency just then. When we look at the currency impact on earnings, are we now seeing U.K. revenues translated at the real actual exchange rate or is there still a profit be made on U.K. currency hedges at the present time? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Marx let us clear the question. You have a question about the impact coming from currency on our earnings. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Twofold answer to the question, if I got it right, once we talk about sales revenue of course there aren't any hedges on that basis. It's &#x2013; just the actual exchange rate hits it. If we talk about profit impact, yes, of course, we still have some significant hedges in place, which did materialize also in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I know I am not allowed to follow up, but when does the U.K. hedging benefit finally and, e.g. when will we see U.K. profitability at an actual real level? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you're well aware, we normally have a medium-term hedging strategy, which on average runs at around three years. And that's it and the remainder of course is heavily depending on how the currency develops any further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll move now to Christian Breitsprecher with Oppenheim. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. It's Christian Breitsprecher. I have a question regarding the situation with Qatar. Are you aware whether Qatar holds any options on preference shares as well? And may be a brief question, and secondly, why didn't move above 50% at Porsche AG, why not 49%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Christian would like to know if Qatar has any options on preference shares. And the second question is related to the participation of the stake in Porsche AG, and why we did announce that we would take a stake of 49.9% and not 50. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we don't have knowledge on whether Qatar is in possession of preference share or options on that. Second question, taking &#x2013; if I got your whispering right, so let me answer that way, taking the majority at this time in the operating company of Porsche has not been and is not an option under the agreed transaction structure and it's also not necessary in order to and that's why we actually want to initiate an integrated group with Porsche or to start generating synergies. So the participation of 49.9 is well and truly sufficient here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll move now to Aringt Edingworth with Credit Sussie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. One question on Porsche again. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, could you update us, when you intent to take on the helm as Porsche's CFO, please? And also looking a bit further out into future, could you imagine any scenario where Porsche could issue ordinary shares at a lower price than preference shares? Could you see any valuation scenario where that could be the case? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Aringt has two questions for us actually. So the first question is he would like to know when Mr. P&#xF6;tsch join the Board of Porsche SE. And the second question is if we can imagine that the Porsche SE will issue new ordinary shares in the future and if the ordinary shares then be lower than the preference share price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I can only reconfirm what I had said a couple of times and that's that currently we are working on the formulation of the contracts of implementation and we are confident that this task will be accomplished soon. And just to give the appropriate understanding, these contracts I am talking about will detail the concrete steps of the transaction and to finalize on these contracts actually means that the phase of negotiation would come to an end and that's exactly then at the right point in time when Dr. Winterkorn and myself will assume the respective responsibilities at the Management Board of Porsche SE.</p>
          <p>The second question, I mean, it's hard for me to imagine that such a situation could occur, but you might pick from the statement that we didn't really operate on such a basis in our transaction schemes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The last question from an analyst is coming from Michael Punzet with DZ Bank. It was a written answer, an e-mail answer, according to the quarterly report, he calculated the PPI burden of 50 million in Q3, if this is correct and can we expect the same amount in the upcoming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first assume that we would refer to <mark type="inaudible" /> mainly and then I think I gave a number of somewhat close to 200 million for the full year which then translates roughly to 50 million for a quarter and that's why the assumption as such is right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. There is one question coming from a journalist as far as we've seen. So let's go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll move now to Chris Jan Hettner from MonTrust. Please go ahead. Mr. Hettner, your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry. Can you hear me? I just wanted to ask really quickly, could you give an indication about where inventories would be at the end of this year, whether it should be normalized in 2010 or are we talking about a million at the end of every month? And just how much longer are you willing to tolerate the heavy losses you see at the SEAT before you act more substantially? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have two questions. One is &#x2013; refers to the inventories. What do we expect we are at the end of 2009 and in 2010, and then you would like to know a little bit more about the situation at SEAT, when would that improve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as the inventory situation is concerned, I mentioned in one of the charts that we are actually at a level of 800,000 cars. So giving the situation that we are faced actually with an undersupply situation the figure below one million cars seems to be a good number, but substantially below one million cars I think that's the ideal level that we are going for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question on SEAT is a little bit pushing on the envelope in the sense that we wouldn't act already and that would simply not characterize the situation. I mean, it shouldn't be of any doubt that SEAT is hit by the situation that in the core markets of SEAT in the South of Europe, specifically in Spain we have probably the worst situation at all with high two-digit negative developments compared with former periods and consequently SEAT is only substantially hit by this market situation.</p>
          <p>What do we do? We're introducing new products and the quality is up to the highest standards. We're taking cost out. We took a very important structural decision in a way that the Audi Q3 will be built in Montreal, in one of the SEAT plant and in doing so we of course make use of the capacity available. So from today's point of view there is no situation foreseeable from today's point of view where we would have to take any structural steps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean, it's not as if SEAT hasn't in the past disappointed with its results, this seems to be sort of a reoccurring pattern. I know there is couple of years it's managed to make slight profit. But you don't believe if there is any need to make any sort of more permanent changes to what's going on at SEAT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think, as already said, when we say permanent change than I think it's a structural step that another brand is making use of SEAT capacities. And that could easily absorb up to almost 20% of the installed capacity of SEAT. I think that is the right way to go because it's cost wise and competence wise attractive parts SEAT is in possession of. As I already said of course we are also doing the best we can in terms of brand building, introducing new products and the like. But there is no basis currently to take any further decision on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on, I believe Q3 is coming out in 2011, if I am not mistaken, so is there any hope for SEAT to actually even be profitable in 2010 or we have to wait until the Q3 fills utilization at the Montreal plant before that happens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly as we've pointed out a couple of times, 2010 is definitely not going to be an easy year, neither for the other brands nor for SEAT of course. I think there shouldn't be too much help on any black figure situation in SEAT. But the other point is also very clear. If we didn't have a clear view that medium term and not looking too far into the future SEAT could be in the black, then we would have to take other steps than we have taken so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So we have time for two last questions. And two journalists are still waiting. So I would recommend to stick to one question only. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll move now to Christopher Rowland with Dow Jones. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. There has been some noise again that recently that Volkswagen might increase its stake in MAN at some point soon and/or possibly take a stake in Suzuki. Are these two scenarios something we would have to keep on our radar in the fourth quarter or early next year? Or do you first of all, most want to complete the Porsche merger and then afterwards look at any potential further expansion? Maybe you could give us an update on Volkswagen's priorities and a timeframe for any potential move in that respect? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Christopher Rowland with Dow Jones has a question, is there any news with regard to MAN or any other corporations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give an answer not too long but which represents the essence. I mean, it certainly is not a big surprise that currently there are a lot of opportunities around. On the other hand, we have our hands full with transaction with Porsche and we believe it would not be wise to burden the company right at moment with further corporate steps. So that's why we are concentrating currently on the Porsche situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So now we have the last question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from Mark Schneider with Handlesplast. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, when do you expect Volkswagen returning to the strengths of the year 2008, which was an all-time high? Do you have a concrete expectation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Mark has one question for us. When does Volkswagen come back to the strength of 2008 and then when do we see such a profitability? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think first of all we have to have a common understanding on the favorable conditions and of course one can hope that things might improve a little bit quicker, but I think the biggest likelihood is the situation where it's going to take until 2012, first of all, until we might see the volume we've seen in 2007 again. Now volume of course is not everything. I think that we would take a little bit too easy if we just were looking on the volume side of the business to say, well, we need this as firm basis to return to the level of profitability we've seen in the other years. So I think we should be there quicker. But we also should be very clear it's not going to be an easy one and certainly not in very short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. So we would like to come to an end now. Thank you for taking part in our conference call. Good-bye from here in Volkswagen.</p>
