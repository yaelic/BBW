      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mattieu. Good morning, everybody and welcome. I'm happy to share with you today the 2010 earnings. But before going into the details of the earning, I just wanted to remind you of what the global pitch you raised for us because I think it's important for you to understand what we have done in 2010, what we intend to do further and after that.</p>
          <p>The first point I'd like to make is AXA has been successful in building over the 25 last years the leadership position in our core businesses. We are the first global Life Insurer. We are the third largest property casualty insurer. We are a very significant player in asset management and we've built this position successfully over the last 25 years over committing to very difficult crisis both at the beginning of this century and over the last three years, which makes us confident that we will continue to build further our businesses in the areas where we want to expand adapting ourselves to the new world. What has been our journey? Recently 2007, 2009 we have weathered the storm. We have successfully gone through the financial crisis, of course there are areas of the business where we have seen some difficulties and I think we have some lessons to learn from the crisis going forward. But overall, we have remained profitable and we have solidified our position.</p>
          <p>2010 has been an interesting year. The earnings are, I think, overall satisfactory. They are setting the ground for our ambition, but it's also a year where we have started to reflect on the lessons of the crisis and where we have started to build for the future, which makes us confidence that in 2011 and beyond, we will be in a position to further consolidate our leadership and combine value and growth.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly come back to what are our key beliefs, how do we see the world in our businesses because I think it's important to understand where we are despite all the changes which have affected the financial scene over the last years. The first point which I think is important, is to understand that major markets will still represent the majority of the global insurance revenues mid-term, fencing in asset management with some segments growing faster than the overall market and with pressure on productivity in these markets.</p>
          <p>The second point is that high growth markets will continue to experience a faster growth than major market, so this leads to the necessity of reorienting, repositioning the business. We have the very strong belief that in our businesses, diversification is an advantage, diversification across businesses, diversification across geographical lines.</p>
          <p>We are convinced that proprietary networks are strengths, but also that we need to develop alternative distribution models, which combines I would say all the advantages. We know also that it's critical for us to develop on top of multi distribution, multi-access to get closer to our customers.</p>
          <p>We think in asset management, that active asset management as a value, as a value for our clients, as a value for us insurers, so these are our key beliefs which are leading us to, I would say understand what the long term builders of our strategy should be, and it's leading us to reaffirm them. We will continue to focus on insurance and asset management on a worldwide basis.</p>
          <p>We will continue to look for geographical diversifications, even if we want to be selective and have strong market shares in the markets we are in. We want a model combining multi distribution and multi-access, and we want to have a more agile, a more proactive portfolio and capital management, which leads me to underline the point where we as a group needs an active transformation to reflect the post crisis reality.</p>
          <p>We understand that there are things to learn and that there are areas where we need to confirm or adjust the Group. We want to focus in major markets, in the segments where we think the growth is going to be higher than average. So it's going to be more selectivity in major markets. It's also going to be more aggressivity in emerging markets. We want to allocate a larger share of our capital to these markets. And as you have seen in 2010, we have already started that.</p>
          <p>The next point is about the balance sheet, the risks and the flexibility. The crisis has made us see how we could improve our risk management. They are some areas where we've made mistakes, which we have corrected. It has also told us a lesson as far as financial strength is concerned, even if our financial strength has remained significant, strong, we understand that we have probably at certain phases of the cycle underestimated the sensitivity of the market through the leverage. And this is something we want to take into account going forward.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, more than ever we are convinced that the pressure on productivity is going to be high. And therefore we are going to insist on the efficiency of our operation. So you think it's not revolution, but it's an evolution and a transformation of the Group, which we have started in 2010 confidently but very firmly.</p>
          <p>And if you look at what we've been starting to do; we have started to improve the margins in major markets and you will see in the numbers, which are going to be detailed in a few minutes, that there has been a strong margin improvement. Look at what the margin increase on the new business value has been on the Life side. Look at what our ability has been to increase prices on the Property Casualty segment.</p>
          <p>The second important point, as I was telling you a few seconds ago, after the more selectivity in the major markets, more aggressivity in the developed markets, our growth in the emerging markets has been stronger. Life &amp; Savings APE are up 25% with a very high new business value margin in the high growth markets.</p>
          <p>The second point in high growth markets, if you look at property casualty, we've had the ability to very quickly grow our property casualty portfolio. We have at the end of 2010 1.3 million more clients than what we had at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>2010 has been unsatisfactory, disappointing to us in one area, which is asset management, we recognize that. We have seen significant outflows. The AXA Rosenberg coding errors has led us to see very significant outflows at AXA Rosenberg and has created a repetition issue there. We are addressing these concerns.</p>
          <p>The investment performance both at AllianceBernstein and at AXA Investment Managers is improving. There are areas within AXA Investment Managers, which have had a very good 2010. So we think the asset management after a difficult 2010 is well positioned to see a turnaround in the years to come.</p>
          <p>The other points I would like to insist on to highlight the key elements of 2010, the way we have been building our organization further and preparing the future. We have now a new organization by business line combined with our geographical organization.</p>
          <p>These <mark type="inaudible" /> organization is there to help us extract better economies of scale, help us improve our technical results and both Jacques de Vaucleroy and Fran&#xE7;ois Pierson are heading the two business lines on top of their other responsibilities have a quite full agenda for 2011 and beyond. I think this is going to help the Group performance overall.</p>
          <p>The next point, which is important, is 2010 has been a year where we have promoted the new generation of CEOs within the Group in very important operations and we will see some of them today. We have a new CEO in the U.S. Mark Pearson, who as before that, the CEO of Japan. We have Jacques de Vaucleroy, a new CEO for NORCEE, but also for the global business line, Life &amp; Savings. We have a new CEO in the UK, we have a new CEO in Japan, we have a new CEO for Asia P&amp;C, we have a new CEO in the Gulf, this shows you that we have &#x2013; and we are very proud of that, a very significant management that's enabling us to prepare the future.</p>
          <p>The second element, which is important in terms of transformation and evolution of the Group is the strategic moves we've made with significant shifts in capital allocation. We have been, I would say, more agile in major markets selling our UK Traditional Life business, of course the cost of this operation is affecting the net income this year, but we think it was in the best interest of our shareholders, it was in the best interest of the Group to do that. It has enabled us to reposition a significant amount of capital to other developments.</p>
          <p>We are progressing in Asia where the APH operation is on its way to completion and should be completed before the end of the first half. So this results in approximately 15% of the shareholders' equity of the Group being reallocated at the time where if you look at the M&amp;A scene in our sector, very little is happening, in fact we have been moving very significantly and probably more than many of our competitors.</p>
          <p>The activity has not been limited to this very visible M&amp;A operations. We've also in 2010 gone forward with very significant agreements of joint ventures and with some M&amp;A operations in smaller markets reflecting our will to build positions for the future.</p>
          <p>The most important and visible is probably the joint venture we have with ICBC. The only joint venture of this nature in the Chinese market associating a bank with an insurer to distribute products there, it's opening us the access to the Chinese consumers. Even if we have a minority stake in this venture, we are providing a lot of know-how. We think it's going to be a very successful joint venture and change the scale of our operations in China.</p>
          <p>We've also been penetrating new markets &#x2013; Romania, Belarus, Serbia, Azerbaijan, increasing our position in Malaysia. So this is part of our effort to build our position in emerging markets. Last but not least, I just want to remind you about the changes, which are going to be created by the completion of the APH deal.</p>
          <p>Once completed, the proportion of the new business value in our Life &amp; Savings operations, which is going to come from Southeast Asia, will increase from 20% to approximately 30% of the Group new business value. So even if 80% of the existing wealth in the world remains in the major markets, a significant proportion of the new wealth is created in the emerging, this operation enables us to be positioned there with a very strong footprint.</p>
          <p>So let me now briefly go into slightly more elements as far as the earnings of 2010 themselves are concerned before I hand over to Denis. The first point is, as I have already told you, the very significant increase in the new business profitability. The NBV margin in the Life &amp; Savings operation is up from 18% to 22%, which we think is a very significant progress.</p>
          <p>In Property &amp; Casualty, the current year combined ratio has improved by two points. It would have improved more had we not had a very large amount of natural catastrophes in Europe in 2010 and we are confident that in 2011 it's going to significantly improve further</p>
          <p>Solid earnings, underlying earnings are flat, adjusted earnings are progressing 20% at &#x20AC;4.3 billion reflecting the fact that the financial markets are progressively coming out from the crisis</p>
          <p>The net income has been affected by the UK disposal, if you take out the loss generated by the UK disposal and if you look at more or less what would have been a more recurring net income level, it would have been progressing by approximately 18%.</p>
          <p>More important, because this have been a source of concern for you and a source of questions, there has been a strong cash generation and value creation. The operating free cash flows are up in 2010 from &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;3.7 billion. The Group embedded value per share is up 11%. All these elements combined make us look confidently at the future and at 2011 and as such that we are going to propose to the shareholders meeting a 25% increase in the dividend.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, the balance sheet, the economic capital ratio is up to approximately 175%, showing that we are well prepared for the introduction of Solvency II, the debt gearing is at 28%, slightly up because of the foreign exchange impact on our hedging strategy. Denis will elaborate on that. And this is one the points where we want to take your message into account and looking forward, what we intend to do as Denis will share with you, is to have a gearing ratio navigating between 25% and 30% according to the cycle, according to the opportunities; so these are they key elements I wanted to share. And I'm now going to handover to Denis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like now to give you more details about our 2010 financial performance. First starting with the earnings of the Group, our underlying earnings, as Henri told you, are essentially stable compared to last year at &#x20AC;3,880 million. The earnings are pretty much stable in Life &amp; Savings and in Property Casualty, you see a dip of the asset management earnings of 26% on a comparable basis, which explains largely that on a comparable basis, at constant, scope and currency, our underlying earnings declined by 3% and I will come back to that later.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted earnings were up 20%, thanks mainly to higher realized capital gains and more importantly lower impairment charges than in 2009. Net income, down 26%, and net income would have been up 18% if we have not sold a large part of our UK Life operations with an exceptional charge of &#x20AC;1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, a strong value creation with our Group EV up 11% to &#x20AC;14.9, in fact we had a % operating return on our Group EV, which more than offset to decline interest rates, which reduces the total return to 11%.</p>
          <p>Our dividend per share increases by 25%, we have put it just at the bottom of our indicative ranks of 40% to 50% of adjusted earnings, and this gives a dividend yield of 5.5% at the share price of the end of the year of 4.5% of the current share price.</p>
          <p>Our operating free cash flow, the dividend stakes through the holding company by our various businesses increases from &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;3.7 billion, this is a topic on which we have given you more details starting at our November Investor Day. The increase is quite important on the Life side where our free cash flow increases quite substantially and G&#xE9;rald will come back to that later in the presentation. So our net free cash flow at the Group level is in excess of &#x20AC;1 billion, which is in line with what we indicated to you in November.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet confirms its strength, Solvency I at 182%, this is largely the reflection of a slightly lower interest rate. Our economic capital, internal economic capital model gives a Solvency in excess of 175%. As you know, this is a model that still remains to be validated in the Solvency II framework by our supervisors. But this is the way we've been measuring our Solvency economically internally for a number of years. And finally, our debt gearing is slightly up mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.</p>
          <p>Moving to Life &amp; Savings business; the scope of our Life business is quite large, Henri indicated that we were the number one global insurer with more than 40 million customers with a fairly diversified geographic presence, substantial presence in Asia close to 20%, and in the U.S. 17%, Europe and Latin America doing the balance and also fairly balanced from a type of this business standpoint, we have Protection &amp; Health representing 31%, General Account Savings 25% and Unit-Linked 31% with Mutual Funds being the balance. And finally, a very balanced distribution mix with agents representing 46% and third-party distribution more than 54%.</p>
          <p>In terms of new business sales and margins, there is clearly bifurcation between mature markets where our new business sales have declined by 5% but this was clearly a focus on margins, our new business margins in mature markets have increased from 16.4% to 20.2%, while in high growth markets our new business has increased by 25% with a stable margin.</p>
          <p>Looking now at a different breakdown of our Life business; this is a disclosure that we started to give you at our November Investor Day. The first parts of our business is the Protection &amp; Health business, which was more or less stable declining 4% in volume but increasing six points in margin. The decline in volume is largely a reflection of a discontinuation of a cancer product that was not profitable in Japan.</p>
          <p>On the general account savings side, the decline is more pronounced, 11%. And you see that we have a negative margin of 1% in 2010. This is clearly a concern. This is also we believe temporary because 2010 saw very low interest rates during a large part of the year. We've therefore been very focused on this issue of profitability of general account savings and our volumes have come down principally in France and Belgium to reflect the fact that at the current interest rate environment it was difficult to sell those products at a profit.</p>
          <p>Unit-Linked was stable but the margin increased from 12 points to 23% in margin terms. This is a reflection largely of the return to profitability of our U.S. VA portfolio and markets and we'll comment further on that later. So in total, a good increase in margin with the slight decline in volume.</p>
          <p>Our Life earnings have increased by 1%, the investment margin was up but the investment spread was 76 basis points in 2010 versus 68 in 2009. We had also higher fees and revenues, thanks to higher unit-linked balances. This was more than offset by a decline of our technical margin, which is related to our U.S. VA portfolio, we had positive one-off in 2009 but we also had to strengthen our reserves for lower surrender assumptions in our old VA portfolio, which was partly mitigated by a DAC offset of &#x20AC;0.5 billion. So all-in-all, an increase of 1% of our Life earnings.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Life earnings again by sub-segments, the General Account Protection &amp; Health business was stable in earnings. We had an increase in earnings on the saving side reflecting the increase in investment margin and an increase of the earnings from the Unit-Linked business within which we've isolated the U.S. VA business to show you that despite a decline in profitability it was still profitable in 2010 with &#x20AC;147 million pre-tax earnings. And finally an increase in profitability of our mutual funds, thanks to an increase in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the P&amp;C business, first an outlook on the scope of our business. In the last decade, we have substantially increased our footprints in P&amp;C moving from number six to number three or four global insurer, more than 55 million customers in 30 countries at present, which is concentrated in Europe for the most parts with a small presence in Asia and Canada, relying 50% on proprietary networks, agents and direct and 50% from third parties. With the balance of business which is 62% personal lines and 38% commercial lines, motor being by far our biggest line at 44%. And we are a leader in more than 10, I mean, top 10 in more than 10 markets.</p>
          <p>Our revenues were up 1% on a constant currency basis, 5% on a nominal basis, and you see here a contrasting picture between personal lines where we have increased our exposure by 4%, average price increase of 3.8% and strong net inflows 1.4 million customers versus commercial lines where our presence declined in revenues by 3%. The average price increase of 2.1 points being more than offset by selective underwriting and lower sum insured, so a decline of our personal lines portfolio.</p>
          <p>Here again it's interesting to look at how our footprint has evolved between mature, high growth and direct. Our revenues were stable in mature markets but we have improved our current year combined ratio by 2.1 points. We have an increase of our revenues by 6% in high growth markets and also a sharp decline of our current year combined ratio and our revenues have increased by 19% in direct. We have a presence in direct P&amp;C in more than 10 countries and our current year combined improved by 1.4 points. In total, our current year combined ratio improved by two points during the year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the totality of the business, underlying earnings declining by 2% on a constant currency basis. Improved current year combined ratio in spite of still a high cost of natural catastrophes 1.7 points of combined ratio versus 1.9 points last year. Lower prior year reserve developments of 3.3 points compared to 5.4 points last year and a fairly stable combined ratio, all-year combined ratio at 99.1%.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to Asset Management, as you know we have two asset managers in AXA, AXA Investment Managers and AllianceBernstein, which have their own business model, which is slightly different, with a footprint mainly in Europe for AXA IM and mainly U.S. and Asia for AllianceBernstein. I won't go into the details but those are two fairly complementary asset managers. And I'd like to go more into the details of what happened in 2010 in the business.</p>
          <p>Our average assets under management improved by 3% to &#x20AC;863 billion, we had as a result of that higher revenues by 5%. But we had significant outflows in those businesses.</p>
          <p>At AllianceBernstein, the outflows were concentrated on the institutional segments. They were very modest in the retail and private client business, and they were concentrated on the equity part of the business, while fixed income had &#x20AC;7 billion of positive inflows. I'll come back to the performance, investment performance a little bit later.</p>
          <p>At AXA IM, also significant outflows of &#x20AC;20 billion, with all the outflows concentrated at AXA Rosenberg at &#x20AC;29 billion, partly offset by positive inflows, net inflows in the other expertises for &#x20AC;9 billion and the outflows were concentrated in the first and the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking now at performance first at AllianceBernstein, you can see on the top left of the slide that the performance since March '09 has been quite substantial at the AllianceBernstein Global Value Funds, quite substantially in excess of the benchmark by more than 20 points.</p>
          <p>If you look at recent performance, there was one bad quarter, the second quarter of '10, which corresponded to the euro crisis, but in all the other quarters since the second quarter of '09, the AllianceBernstein Global Value Funds had an outperformance against the market. So we believe that AllianceBernstein has passed the trust in terms of its outflows and its performance has clearly rebounded.</p>
          <p>Moving now to AXA IM, AXA IM has a number of expertises both in the mainstream fixed income and equity areas but also in the alternative space with real estate, private equity, funds of hedge funds and structured finance. All these expertises are in very good shape, which explains the &#x20AC;9 billion positive inflows in 2010 compared to the &#x20AC;9 billion negative in 2009 and if you exclude the provision that was taken on AXA Rosenberg, the performance of the company is improving in terms of earnings.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the Asset Management business as a whole, you see that the earnings, underlying earnings, declined by 26%. When you look at this in more detail, you have to take into account two exceptional elements, one exceptional positive in 2009, which was a positive tax benefit at AllianceBernstein of &#x20AC;62 million and one exceptional negative in 2010, which is a provision for the AXA Rosenberg coding error after tax.</p>
          <p>And you can see that if you exclude those two elements, underlying earnings in asset management would be at 12%, which reflects the underlying improvements of the business.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to hand over to G&#xE9;rald Harlin for the presentation of our balance sheet and embedded value. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Okay. And our shareholders' equity improved by &#x20AC;3.5 billion. And this increase was mainly explained by three different elements. The first one is the net income net of dividend, the second is the increase in the capital gains and the third is the foreign exchange positive impact.</p>
          <p>On the left hand corner of the slide, you can see first the unrealized capital gains, unrealized capital gains increased for both equities and for fixed income, for equities from &#x20AC;2.7 billion to &#x20AC;3.1 billion, all these figures are net; net of PB, net of policyholders, bonus and net of tax and for fixed income from &#x20AC;2 billion to &#x20AC;3.1 billion. At the same time, just in the middle, at the bottom you had the off balance sheet unrealized capital gains, so these capital gains are not in the shareholders' equity, it corresponds to real estates and loans and it increased from &#x20AC;2.6 billion to &#x20AC;2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to the debt, so our debt increase from &#x20AC;13.5 billion to &#x20AC;15.2 billion, mostly explained by the foreign exchange. You can see that our gearing ratio moves from 26% to 28% within the 25% to 30% range according to the cycles that have been mentioned by Henri. You can see also that the interest coverage improved from 7.9 to 8.5 times. This is due to our higher realized capital gains.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the embedded value and free cash flows, the Group embedded value increased by &#x20AC;3.7 billion and <mark type="inaudible" /> improved from &#x20AC;30.4 billion to &#x20AC;34.2 billion, of which the VIF increased, the Value of Inforce business from &#x20AC;18.5 billion to &#x20AC;20.1 billion, the two main elements of this slight improvement corresponding to an operating return of 24% is first the operating return at plus &#x20AC;7.2 billion, mostly coming from the Life operating return at &#x20AC;6.1 billion but also on the net underlying earnings coming from P&amp;C, from asset management and from the holding company corresponding to &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have a negative investment experience explained by the change in the market conditions with low rates and higher spreads. So moving to the new business return, so the new business return increased from 10.3% to 10.9%, first driven by lower new business strains and lower capital requirement. Second, also improved business mix like in the U.S. and Mark will elaborate on this. At the same time, moving from 10.3% to 10.9% confirms that we are well on track to deliver our target, which is to improve the internal rate of return by at least 200 basis points.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Life free cash flows. So you can see that our Life free cash flows increased on a net basis from &#x20AC;0.8 billion to &#x20AC;1.4 billion between '09 and '10. This is explained by higher free cash flows on the Inforce business and lower new business strain, mostly in the U.S. on the new business. We expect in 2011 to improve the free cash flows from &#x20AC;1.4 billion to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. So that means that you can notice that we will almost double the Life &amp; Savings free cash flows between '09 and '11.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the cash flow emergence in Life. You maybe remember that we presented this slide already in November. We confirm that we have a &#x20AC;17 billion free cash flow, which is expected to be released from 2010 over the next five years on the Inforce business.</p>
          <p>On top of this, we have the expected free cash flow that will be generated by the new business, with the new business written first. Second, we will have actions to improve value on the existing book in order to improve the pattern of our cash flows and also we will take some actions to release more capital from existing book.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everybody. I am Mark Pearson. Some of you may have met me at Investor Day, while I was running AXA's Asian businesses and more recently in AXA Japan.</p>
          <p>I've been very lucky with AXA to have operated in fast growing markets like Hong Kong and Asia. I've worked with very diverse products and distribution models. And for the last few years, I've been in the low interest rate environment of Japan. For those you who are not familiar with the Japanese market, it is the second largest Life Insurance market in the world. And I've been very pleased to be part of the management team that was able to distribute the first ever dividend to the shareholder of &#x20AC;366 million in late 2010.</p>
          <p>As part of our normal succession planning last year, Henri asked me if I'd be interested in taking over from Kip on his retirement. Obviously, as an insurance professional, I was very excited to have this opportunity and will be delighted to be going there.</p>
          <p>Of course, I hope to bring something of value to the U.S. business. What I do know is there's no magic bullet, it's about finding the right balance in managing product development, risk management, and expense management to grow the value of the business, generate cash flows, and ensure continued growth in underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>I took over in the U.S. on the 11th of February, so it's very recent but you all know Henri, he doesn't believe in extended honeymoons. So I am here to share with you my first impressions. And I am very pleased we have a new audience Kevin Byrne, who will get all the technical questions we have today on the U.S.</p>
          <p>So focusing on the U.S. In terms of volumes of sales, we received 70% of sales from our VA book. As you know, it's been a challenging area in the last two years, and we received close to 30% of sales from our Life portfolio. In terms of value of sales, of course, it's weighted heavily towards the Life Insurance book.</p>
          <p>On the variable annuity side, there's been a significant amount of work in the last two years to replace products, redesign risk profiles, and bring in new innovative offerings like Retirement Cornerstone and Structured Capitable Strategies. I have to tell you, as an insurance professional I've been very impressed with the quality and the quantity of the new initiatives launched by the U.S. team in 2010, it positions us well for the future.</p>
          <p>On the Life side, we increased sales by 3% over the last year, as measured by APE. We are participating in markets we want to and that we expect will be higher growth areas such as variable life, universal life and selected markets.</p>
          <p>I want you to know as well that I'm very comfortable with the multi-distribution approach we had in AXA Equitable, particularly when it's underpinned by such a large professional and highly productive salesforce. We have more than 5,000 strong retail salesforce with above average productivity and retention rates.</p>
          <p>Although, we had 5% less sales in 2010, the value of those sales were significantly up and the new business margin increased from 7.3% in 2009 to 12.4% in 2010. This means that the new business value in the U.S. increased 62% from &#x20AC;73 million in 2009 to the &#x20AC;122 million in 2010 and the momentum is good with us.</p>
          <p>Cash flows are also emerging. We've been able to increase statutory capital to $4.8 billion and this is after paying a dividend of $370 million in quarter four. For those of you follow risk-based capital solvency, we had an RBC ratio of 380% in 2009 and for 2010 we expect this to be somewhere north of 400%. The key takeaway for me here is that we can pay dividends while supporting the increase in statutory capital. Of course, due to the global financial crisis, there have been challenges with the U.S. variable annuity portfolio and I can assure you I was as interested as you all are to understand more about this and so I thought it'd be useful to share this attribution page with you.</p>
          <p>For me the key takeaway is that there has been positive contribution to underlying earnings from our VA portfolio, &#x20AC;159 million in 2009 and &#x20AC;98 million in 2010. The reduction in 2010 reflects reserve increases of about &#x20AC;100 million due to change in lapse experience and assumptions, which we disclosed to the market last November.</p>
          <p>Looking at the risk in the VA book, the basis, which should not be an issue now as we have efficient allocation through the indices we are using for hedging. We do have exposure to increases in hedging costs if we have extended periods of volatility and we need to continue to watch positive behavior on lapses.</p>
          <p>So for me in summary, the new business we are writing is significantly less sensitive to interest rates and volatility and the inforce book has strong risk management controls around it.</p>
          <p>So a recap on 2010 and where we are heading for 2011. 2010 was a strong year of transformation in the U.S. New innovative products and redesigns are gaining strong traction relative to the market and comprised close to 40% of total Life and variable sales in 2010. We continue to manage, actively manage equity volatility through the AXA Tactical Manager, which we launched in 2009 and which has now been expanded to our inforce brands. And as the incoming CEO, I have been really happy to see both strong customer and employee satisfaction levels.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to 2011, our focus is on execution rather than developing new strategies. We will continue to grow value by providing a diversified, innovative and balanced product offering that meets the growing needs of our customers. As a team in the U.S. we remain committed to the quality and growth of our earnings, positive cash flow generation, increase in capital value on the basis of disciplined risk management.</p>
          <p>I believe we have significant assets in the U.S. particularly with our loyal and large retail distribution network and wholesale partners. We want to increase our distribution management flexibility, make sure we drive the efficiencies through the business, look for opportunities to invest and always focusing on customer and employee satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for listening to me. I'll now hand over to Nicolas who will take you through AXA France.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. Good morning. So I am Nicolas Moreau, the CEO of AXA France like Mark have been part of the field that have been changing roles in 2010 and the outcome of the year for France I will present to you. I wish I had Fran&#xE7;ois Pierson in the room, who is responsible for most of it. So the year for 2010 in France been a year focused on profitability and growth of the bottom line rather than growth of the top line. And as you can see, both in P&amp;C and in Life &amp; Savings, we have been able to grow underlying earnings in 2010.</p>
          <p>If I take both line of business one-by-one, in P&amp;C AXA France has clear leadership in the market both in commercial line and in personal line. And we have been able to grow ourselves by 3% in 2010. 4.2% in personal line and 0.8% in commercial lines in a declining market, which despite the rate increase we have been putting into the market, 4% in motor 5 to 8% in household have allowed us to grow our market share in the market.</p>
          <p>So with P&amp;C, this investments on restoring profitability on this line of business, despite that we've been investing a lot in innovation, in creating new products, packaged products, in commercial lines and working on developing our EO and E17 our Internet solutions for <mark type="inaudible" /> market. The business we've been doing on the Internet, directly subscribing motor products on the Internet have been representing around 20,000 new policies in motor for AXA France.</p>
          <p>On the Life &amp; Savings business, which shows that we are very selective in the business that we are writing and this was shown to you at APEA. We have been starting to underwrite large guaranteed tickets in the market. Tickets that were coming either from our financial banking partners or the IFA markets. This has led us to decrease by &#x20AC;80 million APE in our Life &amp; Savings business, this is a willingness to grow our NBV margin and our earnings.</p>
          <p>The focus for the year have also been on trying to create value in the Inforce business with some innovation like <mark type="inaudible" /> which is a mechanism where the credited rates to our customer will vary depending of the size of the assets reserves or the rate of Unit-Linked business <mark type="inaudible" />. This has allowed us to grow our margins on the inforce and also give the right incentive to our customer throughout this division so that we increase the rate of Unit-Linked product in our books.</p>
          <p>As you can see on this chart, we've ended the year with 20% rate of Unit-Linked products in our new business, in our production. This is well above the market at 14% and I can tell you at the beginning of the year it is on the same trend around 20% to 22% of Unit-Linked shares. This is due to both <mark type="inaudible" /> of our networks, the launch of new product with a new unit-linked product and risk management product and with <mark type="inaudible" /> that is now being well accepted in the market.</p>
          <p>We've also been renegotiating the distribution agreement with <mark type="inaudible" /> in France, you are again trying to discriminate between our partners that are bringing sizable tickets and the one that are bringing us low margin businesses. This has been quite reasonably well accepted by other distributors and most of this agreement now are 80% rate of signature of all these new distribution agreements.</p>
          <p>We added also a huge emphasis on protection with the launch of a new product Family Protection that has been a real success in terms of sales. We have been writing another 120,000 new policies on this product compared to last year of 22,000 policies. And this emphasis on protection will continue in the coming years.</p>
          <p>So now if we move to the priorities in 2011, I think the focus on the growth of the profitability for us is still very well in our minds. So the focus will be to grow on the most selective and most profitable segments of the market. P&amp;C is a market that has now woken up and have increased rates by the end of the year. So we'll continue the trend. We have been first movers there and so we'll continue to increase price in 2011. You might have seen that in the price and continue to be quite selective in underwriting.</p>
          <p>We are launching a new product, which is an international product for SMEs where French SMEs that are investing or working aboard, we will be able to cover them throughout the world of business benefiting from the infrastructure of AXA Corporate Solution, which is quite a promising product for the mid-market where we had a <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>On the Savings market, there is a continued emphasis on the Unit-Linked product, both in term of new sales but also on conversion of the books. We have initiatives, selective initiatives to try to go see our customers and try to help them to convert a part of their asset reserves in unit-linked. So this will continue which is quite important.</p>
          <p>We will also position ourselves as a specialist of the financial advice. We have a huge distribution network in France both are salesforce. We've got a very specialized network of tied agents called A2P, AXA Financial Protection. So A2P is around 800 and our agents, generic agent network 4,000.</p>
          <p>So we want to capitalize on his physical presence on the field to give advice to our customer rather than doing profit push. This I think is much better to build our franchise to strengthen our franchise and we'll be launching a big initiative of individual retirements and building this physical place.</p>
          <p>The other initiative that you might have seen is around banking. As in banking, product for us great line of products to strengthen our distribution network and to support them to give them another product to sell. And we will continue these effort during the year and in the coming years. And we have got a special initiative also on inforce valuation. We've got &#x20AC;100 billion of reserves. And I've created a dedicated team who's function will be to extract more value from the in-force both in term of managing of costs, of administration costs, but also optimizing the capital and optimizing the margin. So this is also an important initiative for us.</p>
          <p>On the Life and Protection &amp; Health, we'll continue the focus we have done before with the launch of a new proposition in protection for self-employed workers and a launch of the long-term care offering, building of the government's initiative to support this type of products. And, of course, as all of the AXA subsidiary, we are working quite hard to improve our productivity and deliver the savings that we've got to deliver. This is also a big initiative for us.</p>
          <p>On top of it, another Transversal initiative is to modernize and strengthen our proprietary distribution network mainly using the Internet and the multi-access so that our agents feel the sales force are able to communicate very well with our customer and this customer can communicate with them in a seamless way.</p>
          <p>So that's France. Now I would hand over to Jacques de Vaucleroy for NORCEE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. NORCEE <mark type="inaudible" /> Central and Eastern Europe, this is a diverse region with mature countries and more able markets, so no surprise that we have <mark type="inaudible" /> where we will be &#x2013; where we are focusing on profitability and value in the mature markets and we are looking into accelerate and strengthening our growth position in the emerging part.</p>
          <p>I think the evolution in both of our business line is <mark type="inaudible" /> from that side. On the Life &amp; Savings side, you have seen in the mature markets a very, I would say, similar approach to what Nicolas described in France, reacting to the evolution of the interest rate side for repricing our products both on the general accounts side and the unit-linked side, you've seen re-pricing on the general accounts side, for example, in Belgium; you are seeing VA re-pricing in Germany and Switzerland.</p>
          <p>At the same time, diversifying from our traditional approach and developing new products clearly emphasizing protection in Belgium but also in other countries specifically in Belgium. We've launched in Germany a new long-term care product. In Germany, you have the traditional health product where you have the choice to remain in the public system or choose for the private sector approach. And you can also have an additional offering now. AXA Germany was the first one to launch it, which is a long-term, optional long-term product, which is covering, you could say, long-term in there.</p>
          <p>This was launched in May of 2010, and we were able to get a very nice success for this first year.</p>
          <p>AXA Protect Invest is a medium-term saving product with capital guarantees and the opportunity to benefit from the upside of the equity market. This was an innovative product that Switzerland has launched this year, another example of the diversification of some additional product.</p>
          <p>In the emerging market, there on the &#x2013; currently we are trying to explore new growth avenues, first geographically with the acquisition of a small life insurance company in Rumania. We see that the acquisition of the platform for them going based on our own efforts.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we're trying to leverage the fact that we are in six different countries and developing one single IT platform for the entire region. We start in Poland, the idea is to do the rollout faster in the other countries, Czech and Slovak will be the second countries to go to. This platform is looking at covering policy administration, claims, new business, money-in/money-out; so it's really you could say the central part of the value chain and we start in one country. The first rollout is expected in Poland in the second part of this year.</p>
          <p>And finally, while pension products are very important, we have started already in 2010 and we're continuing them in 2011, <mark type="inaudible" /> from this pension product and offering traditional savings and pension products mainly UL and protection. These products represent already 43% of EBIT in 2010.</p>
          <p>On the P&amp;C side, not very different also, for the much you can see from what you have heard from Nicolas, clearly on both I would say commercial and private lines, the focus is on improving the profitability of the Group. You have seen in commercial lines <mark type="inaudible" /> underwriting that has been done in most countries but specifically you could say in Germany on the medical liability side, the whole portfolio has been freeing the returns and while there has been new tariffs, the same occurred in Belgium on the work and compensation side.</p>
          <p>P&amp;C marketing <mark type="inaudible" /> have been quite diversified, you already have combined ratio at 98.5 with very, very big difference, Switzerland below the 90s, it was a fantastic and very good year in Switzerland; on the other hand Germany more natural events more large claims <mark type="inaudible" /> large frequencies so there is clearly difference by countries, but the approach is the same.</p>
          <p>On the Central and Eastern European front, P&amp;C is smaller for us but we have important position in some countries and Ukraine is one good example, where we are the number one in that country with 11% market share. The market itself was negative last year but we were able to come with positive growth and we have gained market share, at the same time the company is slightly profitable, which is I think very a good performance, and this has motivated us to continue to develop ourselves.</p>
          <p>And therefore we did sign an agreement for the acquisition of the second largest insurance company in Belarus, it is in fact the largest private company in that country, small country but we see there is a growth opportunity, and in fact we see it as a way to combine it with Ukraine in one geographical cluster. 2011 is to a large extent more of the same, continue to develop the same approach for both Life Savings and Property &amp; Casualty, I have not mentioned distribution, but clearly we want to continue to bring forth our distribution capacity, proprietary network on one side but also banks and brokers.</p>
          <p>We switch to Asia, I want to give you a quick focus on our operations in Asia. First &#x2013; and I think it was already presented before, very, very large sales growth in the region 39%, which is certainly one of the best and that has been done in all our channels, but particularly in Bancassurance we'll come back on it.</p>
          <p>It's not always known but we have a very leading position in Indonesia and Philippines where we are ranked in both second, number two both markets. We've also significant market shares in Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia. For example in Thailand, we are the number five in new business, in Indonesia we have <mark type="inaudible" /> new businesses.</p>
          <p>Henri mentioned the partnership with ICBC which is first a very important development in China, you see on the left part of the slide, that we are very diverse in term of distribution with a real multi distribution model with the agents, which is in fact at the origin but the traditional way of distributing product in Asia, well focus is on productivity. You see a very large part of our distribution, which is coming from Bancassurance and where clearly there the focus is on leveraging the network of our partners and adding insurance advisors in the branch.</p>
          <p>And you see them in other, <mark type="inaudible" /> to a large extent emergence of a new type of distribution like telemarketing and telemarketing is growing very well in Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia. Right side, is a zoom on our bank partners, I will not cover ICBC as already has been done.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, we are in partnership with Bank Mandiri, which is the largest retail bank. The bank joint venture delivers 64% of the sales. This is a bank with close to 1,800 branches in the country. So, very, very solid position there.</p>
          <p>In the Philippine, we are in partnership with Metrobank, which is the largest private bank with about 600 branches, also very strong position. Same for Thailand with Krung Thai Bank, the second largest bank, close to a 1,000 branches in the country. It delivers about 50% of the sales in the country. So, you see very, very solid position. And to a large extent, this is not easy to get this type of agreements. There is a &#x2013; not many of these banks that are available for partnerships. So clearly very strong strategic position for us, which is to a large extent we believe will give us long-term sustainable advantage in the region. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jacques. Let me briefly sum up and give an outlook. If I go back to the 2010 numbers the way we would characterize them is satisfactory in a still difficult environment. When I look at 2011, I would say confident outlook.</p>
          <p>Not going to come back to the 2010 numbers. We will come back to you in June to discuss with you in much more detail the operational actions, which are linked to our Ambition AXA program and who are supporting our medium-term vision.</p>
          <p>The way I would characterize the view we have at this stage is simple. It's selectivity, aggressivity, efficiency. Selectivity in the major markets to be able to capture profitable growth; aggressivity in the emerging markets to build on the fact that the growing proportion of the new wealth will come from this market; efficiency, because everywhere we are seeing that the very solid positions we've built over the last 25 years enabled us to reach a further step there and to be more low competitive then most of the players because of our global scale.</p>
          <p>If I look at the immediate actions for 2011, which are making us confident that 2011 is going to be a year of progress. The things I would highlight are in Life &amp; Savings, the acceleration of profitable growth. The world economy is improving, we should benefit from it and we will interpret that benefit from our own actions. We think we will see an increase in the unit-linked. We think we will see a further improvement in margins. We will also insist on the cash flow. We think we will achieve the &#x20AC;1.7 billion of free cash flow generation on the Life side.</p>
          <p>On the Property Casualty side, we are pretty confident that we will bring the current year combined ratio further down to around 100% because we'll be able to push further price increases and because we will also benefit from our productivity gains.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, where no doubt 2010 has been a difficult year with a lot of headwinds, we think that we have a significant turnaround potential. So all in all, if I sum it up, we all emerging from the second crisis we've gone through in a decade. We've learned our lessons from the mistakes we've done. We have very strong positions worldwide. And we are confident that the efforts we are doing joined to the gradual improvement in the world economy are going to benefit us and position us well for the future.</p>
          <p>That's it. And we are now ready to answer your questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thomas Jacquet from Exane BNP. I have three questions. The first one on the Chinese deal with ICBC, is there any figure you could share with us beyond the number of branches that ICBC has? In particular, do you have the mid-term ambition in terms of market share in this market?</p>
          <p>My second question is a more technical one. Two days ago, we had U.S. budget and apparently they plan to change what they call the dividends received deduction. Is it going to have an impact on your business and on your accounts?</p>
          <p>And my last question is regarding external growth. How would you rank currently your appetite for sizeable operations beyond the small deals we are all supposed to see? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we'll take all these questions. I mean, I'll take the first one. I suggest Mark take the second one and Denis will take the third one. On China, of course, I mean ICBC has an impressive number of branches, but the way I would address the issue is different. If you look at the Chinese market, the foreign insurers cover a market share, which has &#x2013; there are 23 foreign insurers in China, their market share in the Life segment has decreased over the last ten years from 10% of the market to 5%.</p>
          <p>If you look at the biggest Chinese players one by one, they have more than the total share of the foreign insurers.</p>
          <p>ICBC is the largest bank in China. It's the only joint venture they have, they have a lot of distribution agreements in insurance but they are non-exclusive. The only joint venture they have is the joint venture they have with us. And their intention is to have a very significant market share in the global Chinese, I mean, internal Chinese Life &amp; Savings market, which means that they want to be among the first five, six, seven largest players in China.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the market share of the large players in China, and if you look at how much do you need to have if you want to be one of the major domestic forces, you will have an answer. That's why we think that this is going to enable us, even if we have a minority position. And this was the price for accessing the real market. This makes us quite confident that this is going to change the scale and the profitability of our business in China.</p>
          <p>Look at the Indonesian deal, we're associated to the first bank in the country, we have become the second largest player in the market within a very short period of time, an welcome sight to what you see in many of the markets where you need seven, eight, nine, 10 years to become profitable in life we have become profitable in the third year. Mark, do you want to take the dividend received?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I will. A couple of points on DRD budget proposals. Firstly, this is not the first time there had been proposals. It's been included in budget proposals twice before and has not gone through because of lobby efforts, so it's by no means certain to happen. And if it does happen, there will be no impact on 2010 or 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking further out, if we do crude estimates on it, the maximum impact to us would be about 7% of earnings, U.S. earnings. That's our estimate. I am just looking for Kevin Byrne to nod to confirm whether that's correct or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that would be less than 1% of the Group earnings. Moving to the third question, our appetite for sizeable acquisitions, I would like to make a few comments. First, there are very few sizeable acquisitions available in high growth markets, which is our area of focus in terms of acquisitions. Second, Henri has commented very clearly that we are mindful of our leverage and we are &#x2013; and don't want to increase our leverage beyond 30%, and would like to eventually bring it back closer to 25%. Therefore, if we have sizeable acquisition opportunities in the near future, we would have to find ways to reallocate our capital and make also disposals to fund the acquisitions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Actually I had a question on the P&amp;C, you are making a real turn today, I mean in 2010 and today on toward profitability, with best-in-class in Europe having combined ratio around 95% or even below of targeting, so does it make sense for AXA to have such a target ratio?</p>
          <p>And my second question is for Denis, the interest rate environment is improving dramatically for insurers, could you tell us what is your hope or wishes in terms of investment yield for 2011 for Life and Non-Life and how does it compare with 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the P&amp;C combined ratio, and Fran&#xE7;ois may want to add to that, we have said that we wanted to go to 100% current year combined in 2010, an improvement of 2.4 points. We have achieved an improvement of two points in 2010, so an improvement <mark type="inaudible" /> of a further 2.4 points is quite ambitious.</p>
          <p>We are clearly conscious that this is not our end game, our end goal is more in the area of 95%, 96%, but it will take a few years to get there, so not only price increases but also other technical improvements, but you don't get there in one year. Fran&#xE7;ois, you want to add anything on the P&amp;C combined targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. I can repeat that you have just said. We are very confident to our capacity to reach our target in 2011 because we have for the second time increased our prices of plus 3% after an increase of prices in 2010 of plus 3%. We have improved our re-insurance activity to protect us on cap net and we've really improved also our expense ratio in 2011. So we confidently believe in our capacity to reach our target. And for the next year, we'll do better. But at this level of combined ratio, we were at this level at 96.9% in 2006, so <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And I mentioned our current year combined, which is 102.4%, our old year combined is at 99.1% and we continue to expect that we will be able to improve it. Now moving to the yields on our portfolio, our portfolio yield in underlying terms was 4% in 2010 and on an adjusted basis, including capital gains 4.1% both in Life and in P&amp;C. As you know, the duration of our portfolio is between five and six years on P&amp;C and between eight and nine in Life. Therefore, the increase in the interest rates only translates into an improving yield gradually over time. So we should expect to have a slight pick-up in 2011, I don't know maybe between 10 and 20 basis points. G&#xE9;rald, any clear view on the pick-up in yield in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes let's say around 10 basis points. At the same time, that's true for P&amp;C, for Life. It doesn't mean that it will mean 10 basis points as a whole on the margin side.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />.I've got two questions, please. First, the first one is related to asset allocation. Could you update us on your strategic asset allocation under Solvency II? I mean, would you consider that you are currently well diversified <mark type="inaudible" /> risk appetite, would you consider that you will be ready to take some more risk on the asset side, you are buying private equity et cetera considering <mark type="inaudible" /> to the asset side?</p>
          <p>The second point is on, any update on the fiscal contingencies in Europe, we talked a lot about fiscal deficit in Europe, could you update us in France but maybe as well in other European countries where we have that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, G&#xE9;rald would you take the first one? I'll take the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes as far as the asset allocation is concerned <mark type="inaudible" /> maybe you can refer to page 33 of the appendix and you'll have on this slide the asset allocation, so not a lot of change compared to last year. The main class of asset remains a fixed income for 83%.</p>
          <p>Second part of your question was about are we prepared for Solvency II? Yes, we are prepared for Solvency II and as you know we are already managing our company from <mark type="inaudible" /> point of view in the Solvency II environment. Our listed equities represent 4 points. On top of this we have private equity and you will see in the graph that we increased our private equity, to date it should represent 1.4 points and keep in mind that in order to benefit from the rise of the equity markets we have also the possibility and the Solvency II environment to buy option, which means that we can benefit from the rise of the market without involving a lot of capital.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, we are still benefiting from an environment today, where just prices are quite high and they remain at a high level even staying on excellent risks since the average rating of our fixed income portfolio is still A+.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the fiscal changes in Europe, 2010 has been affected by additional taxes in financial institutions in some of the European countries. It was not on the total an insignificant number. We hope 2011 is going to be quieter, but with lots of governments trying to reduce their budget deficit it's clear that financial institutions are a target. Having said that, let's say we're not seeing immediate threat. We have been with Jacques more concerned by what we have seen in Central and Eastern Europe related to pension funds where some governments have clearly taken steps in the wrong direction.</p>
          <p>As far as the tax landscape in France is concerned, how could I put it diplomatically? It's difficult to see as of today what the final line is going to be. Nevertheless, we have the feeling especially listening to some members of the parliament that life insurance is probably not the number one target. Because I think the national representation starts to understand that if you want to have long-term investments in this country, the best way is probably not to destabilize life insurance, which has been a form of long-term savings and probably one of the very few ones in this country.</p>
          <p>So I think the argument about long-term investments are needed if we want to have growth and employment is an argument which is starting to be well understood. So this makes us probably marginally more optimistic, even if at this stage there is not a lot of clarity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add one point on taxes, our underlying tax rate was up four points in 2010 compared to 2009. But we are still benefiting from positive one-offs, tax one-offs overall. So our pre-tax numbers would have been better than our post-tax numbers. But we still have positive one-offs.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. Good morning. I've got a few sort of number type questions. Firstly, I noticed that you've started paying a dividend from the U.S. I think you said $270 million or $370 million, can you just talk about the outlook for that going forward because your cash flow from the U.S. in 2010 was over &#x20AC;550 million. So clearly you're still not fully able to pay that cash. Can you just talk about the environment for dividends in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you talk about the 100% current year combined ratio, an obvious question as you know, what is your view in reserve releases in 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good. Mattieu, do you want to take the U.S. dividends <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So in the U.S., our dividend is constrained by several factors, but I would say the overarching one is the fact that we cannot distribute more than 10% of our statutory surplus. And Mark has shared with you what our statutory surplus is. I think it is 4.8 billion from memory. So that gives us 10% the maximum is for 80. So we didn't distribute the full 10% in 2010 so there is a little bit of room but not an infinite room to grow the dividends.</p>
          <p>And in terms of outlook for the &#x2013; on your second question, outlook for positive developments on prior years, it's extremely difficult to gauge this and give you a precise guidance on this. But you've seen that as we had told we will have lower positive developments in '10 than in '09 <mark type="inaudible" /> I would tell you that we should have slightly lower positive developments in '11 than we had in '10 but I cannot give you a precise number. But this is just a function of replacing the cycle where we are. Prices are going up, it's a period where we have lower positive development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question. I think there was a question in the room. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Pierre Flabbee, Kepler Capital Markets. Couple of questions on Protection &amp; Health, first could we know what will have been the trend in the new business margin excluding the termination of the Japanese product?</p>
          <p>And in terms of outlook, could we know what you expect in terms of margin evolution considering competition your appetite for growth on the one end and on the other end, might we know what could be the dollar to euro sensitivity of this business could it be comparable to what G&#xE9;rald Harlin mentioned on the P&amp;C?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. G&#xE9;rald, do you want to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that means that without the &#x2013; you, to be sure I understand your question. Your question on Japan was which one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What will be the margin results of the cancelled product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That means that the trend is still up, that means that we have a downtrend in terms of APE but in term of NBV margin we are still on a positive trend, so that's what I can tell you. And you can see in the appendix on page 23 of the press release that in Japan we have a 76% NBV margin, which is plus 14%, that's in the middle of the page. So you can see that this cancellation of this product had a negative impact on APE, because APE is at minus 18%, of which we could say that the cancelled products maybe explain 15% roughly. So you can see that this initiative had a quite positive impact on demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Precisely that was my question, without this positive push, generally speaking <mark type="inaudible" /> how much it's stable, is the valuation positive, negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's positive</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And for the outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean Protection &amp; Health is clearly a segment where we want to allocate more capital because we see it as an area where the margins are better and where the business is more resilient.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the margins in the new business I mean you have the sensitivities in embedded value report. So the evolution of the margin is going to be a combination of the evolution of the mix. And as Henri told you, we should expect to have a higher proportion of Unit-Linked, which is positive for the margins. And if interest rates continue to go up, this also translates into a higher margin. If at the same time, we have slightly higher volumes in '10, we would also benefit in terms of unit costs. So the outlook for the margins is clearly positive.</p>

          <p>I wanted to ask what sort of Group earnings growth you think is realistic going forward? I mean, if we look back to the old 2012 target you were targeting something around 15% growth per annum. And I wondered if you could share with us what level of growth you think is realistic in the new environment and also which products, which country, any color that you can give us on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great questions, Nick. You know that we do not want to give too precise a guidance. I think we've been giving you the, I would say, the elements to build what should be the prospects. The microenvironment is getting better, but we know all still fragile. We think that there are elements which are going to enable us to grow the earnings coming from the microenvironment and elements, which are going to come from our own actions.</p>
          <p>It's clear that increased macro growth will help P&amp;C. It's clear that increasing interest rates and growing equity markets will help both P&amp;C and Life. We think that actions to improve the underwriting, to focus on profitable products, and to decrease the costs are going to help our own operations. All this makes us confident in the future but I will stop short of giving you a precise number.</p>
          <p>I think we can have attractive numbers, but I will stop short of giving you a very precise number because I don't want to be caught in a situation where we give a precise figure assuming a certain evolution of the external world and then see a very different evolution of this external world, which impacts us without then people understanding that this has an impact. So we are confident in our businesses. We think that the efforts we are doing joined to the improvement in the macro outlook are going to &#x2013; I would say help us show more palatable figures going forward, but I won't give a very precise figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you for that. But I can understand entirely that you don't want to give precise figure. Could you give us some sort of degree of your confidence; I mean, if markets are reasonably stable would you say for example, that double-digit growth is something that you would be targeting at a Group level?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning all. Couple of questions actually. Asset management represents 7% of your underlying earnings at the moment. Now I understand there's a bit of sort of pickup and recovery in that; but are you happy with the scape of your asset management contribution to the overall underlying earnings given the fact that earnings is obviously a powerful cash generator and has been a powerful driver of earnings from some other groups who've got larger asset management components within their overall group. That was one question. The second question was on the Life investment margin, which I think expanded from 68 to 76 basis points in 2010; could you talk a little bit about why that was and what prospects the investment margin are for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrew. I'll start with asset management and Denis and G&#xE9;rald will take the second question. The asset management was clearly the difficult spot of 2010 because of the outflows and also because of the &#x2013; I would say exceptional hits we had to take in the earnings related firstly to the coding error at Rosenberg and also to a certain extent to a one-off on real estate at Bernstein. So what we think is that a) we won't see exceptional negative one-offs in 2011.</p>
          <p>Second, what we think is that we see a gradual improvement in the financial markets. So the asset base should go up. Certainly, we think that we see improvement in the investment performance at AllianceBernstein and the good investment performance at AXA IM, the outflows should progressively take a better look. So clearly for us asset management looking forward is one of the areas where we think there is a significant turnaround potential in terms of earnings and in terms of, I would say, cash earnings.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I mean we all know that once you have some damage to an Investment Management franchise, you do not turn that around in six months it takes a longer period of time. But as Denis was showing you in the call presentation, we think that there things are as much as they can well on track at Bernstein and at IM. So it's an area where think we will see earnings increase going forward, and therefore, also the cash generation increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, on the investment margin, the improvement in investment margin was more related to a decline in the crediting rates than it was relative to an increase in the earn rate. There was a modest increase in the investment, I mean in the earn rates, but a more substantial decline in the crediting rates. We believe that the current margin is sustainable. I would not commit to an increase of that margin. We believe that again we've seen the trough here in terms of investment margin in 2009 and we are confident that we can maintain it. We would not commit to an increase of that margin going forward.</p>
