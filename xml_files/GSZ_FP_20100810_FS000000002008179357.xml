          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I'm G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet, Chief Executive Officer of GDF SUEZ. I am delighted to be with you and to welcome you to this call with Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli and G&#xE9;rard Lamarche. Together, we'll present our first half results, the outlook for the full year, as well as our recent developments.</p>
          <p>As you know, we also announced today that we reached an agreement with International Power to combine our BEI and some other U.K. and Turkish assets with International Power assets. For this specific transaction, we will hold a presentation that would be also webcast together with International Power at 10:00 AM London time, 11:00 AM Paris time, just after their first-half results presentation.</p>
          <p>I will start now with our main figures and achievements over the period, then G&#xE9;rard Lamarche will speak in more detail about the first-half accounts, followed by Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois who will give you some insights on gas markets.</p>
          <p>First, our key figures; the group is growing. It's growing with an EBITDA at &#x20AC;8.2 billion, increasing by 4.3%. The net income group share amounted to &#x20AC;3.6 billion, up 9.3%. Efficio saves stands at &#x20AC;1 billion over the semester, in line with our expectations. Meanwhile we are maintaining our strong financial structure with net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at 2.3 times and gearing of 48%, despite a net debt increase due to scope and ForEx impacts of &#x20AC;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>May I also draw your attention to the share buyback program of &#x20AC;500 million nearly achieved so far. It is part of our 1 billion program announced in July 28 and postponed after the onset of the financial crisis. We maintained both our financial targets for 2010 and the target for 2011 that we set in March, which had an increase of EBITDA in 2010 compared with 2009, and plus 15% growth in 2011 compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our main achievements over the first half. I would like to highlight three major points. First, in response to the Gulf market situation and as we already told you, we have continued renegotiating most of our long-term gas contracts over the temporary period. Some agreements have been finalized and some negotiations are still ongoing. Second, with the implementation of the public service contract signed late 2009, we obtained two successive tariff highs, plus 9.6% as of April 1, 2010 and plus 4.8% as of July 1, 2010. On this specific subject, I would like to remind you that we are ready to pass on any cost reduction that we can negotiate with suppliers to customers while maintaining our positive margin. Third point, our industrial development is progressing well, in particular with 3 gigawatts worth of new project in fast growing markets.</p>
          <p>Indeed, we continued to pursue our developments and we have reinforced all our industrial positions during the first half. I would like to mention some of them. In particular, first in electricity, we won $1.7 billion contract for building and operating 2 new power stations in Oman, Barka 3 and Sohar 2 for 1,500 megawatts and with 15-years PPA. We're also successful in Saudi Arabia with US$ 2.1 billion contract to build 1,700 megawatts power plant; a 20-year PPA has been signed in connection with the contract. In Poland, we are building the world's largest biomass power plant, 190-megawatt capacity. We concluded also a partnership with E.ON to participate actively in the new nuclear in Italy. We also signed major supply contracts in Peru worth &#x20AC;1.5 billion and in UK for &#x20AC;680 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding our regular asset rotation and as announced, we sold as announced our 24.2% stake in Elia, Belgium electricity transmission operator with a capital gain of &#x20AC;240 million. Both in electricity and gas, I would underline the planned acquisition of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale's 49% stake in Gaselys, our trading subsidiary. Our project is to merge Gaselys and Electrabel trading desk, strengthening our ambition in this area to become a European leader by 2011. This partnership has been a success story, and now GDF SUEZ and Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale decided to achieve their own goals independently.</p>
          <p>In gas, I was proud to integrate the LNG Mejillones terminal in Chile after less than 24 months of construction. GDF SUEZ started in May the delivery of the 2 million cubic meters per day of LNG. We also have acquired a 9% stake in the 55 billion cubic meter Nord Stream project, which will open a new route to Russian gas towards Europe. The project is already under construction, and we expect it to be commissioned up from 2011 for the first site. Gjoa, the Norway gas field, will be commissioned in the fourth quarter as expected. In terms of asset rotation, we sold our 38.5% stake in Fluxys. Fluxys is a Belgium natural gas transmission operator, and we sold it with a capital gain of &#x20AC;422 million.</p>
          <p>And finally, in the energy services, we set up a joint venture with Gazprom in energy efficiency. And also in environment, we finalized the step-up in Agbar. We have now the majority control of Agbar through our subsidiary, SUEZ Environnement.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to G&#xE9;rard Lamarche for further comments on our first half account.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. I am very pleased to present GDF SUEZ's financial performance for H1 2010. As mentioned, these results show a strong performance despite a difficult economic environment and continued volatility in energy prices. First, I'll set out the 2010 half-year results which demonstrate that we are well on track to deliver our target. Then I will comment on the key elements of our strong cash flow generation and the balance sheet. Then I will conclude with our 2010 target that we confirm.</p>
          <p>I'll start off by making a few comments on the key figures from the P&amp;L. H1 results confirmed the group's capacity to deliver growth and improve profitability. As you can see on the slide, although the total sales are stable, the group achieved a 4.3% increase in EBITDA to &#x20AC;8.2 billion and a 5.1 increase in current operating income to &#x20AC;5.2 billion. Net group share is up 9.3% to &#x20AC;3.6 billion.</p>
          <p>And now let's have a look to the EBITDA to the operations. On the following slide, you have an illustration of both balance and the robustness of our business model. EBITDA is up by 4.3%, as I've mentioned, across the group compared to last year, despite a tough gas market which weighted significantly on the earnings of Global Gas &amp; LNG.</p>
          <p>The results of Global Gas &amp; LNG has been impacted by the recession more than any other business line. The economic downturn has led to contraction in revenue of this branch, 11%; a fall in gas price and a serious competition, and it also reduced the number and the profit of the arbitrage opportunities achieved in this half year. As a consequence, as you can see on the chart, the Global Gas &amp; LNG EBITDA is down by 827 million as anticipated. And overall, we maintain &#x2013; we confirm that we expect that the 2010 EBITDA for Global Gas &amp; LNG should be back to a normalized level close to 2007 EBITDA at &#x20AC;2.3 billion. But all the other branches more than compensated these effects on the Global Gas earnings, and the group EBITDA is up by 4.3%. And we can stress a couple of good news. The first one is that we have the positive impact now of the new tariff framework in France. We have a strong performance in Poland, the EBITDA is up 16% and the earnings are up in Brazil, in Europe and in Asia with strong double-digit growth of the earnings. We have 11% growth of the regulated infrastructure business in France and 9% growth for SUEZ Environnement.</p>
          <p>Now let's come back to the group results. And I'll run through the P&amp;L from the EBITDA to the net income group share. Depreciation, amortization and provisions amount to &#x20AC;2.8 billion, up by 160 million versus H1 2009, mainly due to the scope change and the asset commissioning. We still expect 600 million increase in 2010 on a full-year basis compared to 2009. Asset disposal mainly includes the sales of Fluxys with a capital gain of &#x20AC;422 million, sales of Elia with a capital gain of &#x20AC;238 million, the profit of &#x20AC;1.4 billion on this line also include the impact of different transactions and merger in Chile, 177 million, and different transaction at the level of SUEZ Environnement for 300 million. Overall, we have realized over the last two years &#x20AC;8.5 billion of disposals.</p>
          <p>Financial charges increased by 362 million in H1 compared to H1 2009. This is due to net debt increase, the roll-up of last year mark-to-market and a little bit less dividend received. Finally, the net reserve group share grew by 9.3%, up to 3.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look &#x2013; a closer look to the balance sheet. I'd like to make a few comments on the strong financial structure of the group. The free cash flow at 4.7 billion enable us to self finance both the CapEx and the shareholder remuneration. The decrease compared to last year is mainly attributable to the variation of working capital, which is itself due to the reverse in the trend in the commodity price. Since we have an increase of the commodity price we have more receivables and we have more value in the stock. We have invested &#x20AC;3 billion in net CapEx by the end of June 2010, 2.5 of which are disposals, so the net is 3 billion. And we confirm the net CapEx for the full-year, this will remain in line with our program of 10 billion of spend per year.</p>
          <p>Net debt increased by 3.5 billion to reach 33.5 billion, mainly due to foreign exchange, the appreciation of the dollars which account for &#x20AC;1.6 billion, and variation of <mark type="inaudible" /> for &#x20AC;2 billion. And this is the full consolidation of Agbar &#x2013; this is mainly the full consolidation of Agbar at the end of June. The average cost of net debt has increased from 4.6% &#x2013; decreased from 4.6% to 4.4% and the gross debt average maturity is stable at 6.1 year. Our balance sheet, as you can see, remains very strong and flexible with the net debt representing 2.3 year of EBITDA and 1.6 year, including the assets under construction; the gearing is 48%.</p>
          <p>To conclude, we'll deliver higher EBITDA in 2010 versus 2009. As I mentioned earlier, we also <mark type="inaudible" /> an annual &#x20AC;10 billion net industrial CapEx in profitable projects. We are also confident that the group will reach the efficient &#x2013; the efficiency plan target. We maintain our commitment to provide to our shareholder with an equal or higher dividend than last year, and we have approve our objective of maintaining a strong A rating, taking into account also International Power.</p>

          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today, I will briefly focus on the developments of the gas markets during H1 and their consequences on our business. As regard the gas market and excluding our infrastructures &#x2013; gas activities, which have performed very well during this first semester, I believe that we can draw two main conclusions. First, our Global Gas activities have suffered a lot, given the gas price disconnect. Our revenues had decreased to a very low level. We do not expect further new deterioration, given if a recovery of revenue may come very progressively.</p>
          <p>Second, our retail gas activities in France which have processed the <mark type="inaudible" /> France, have benefited both from the new prices environment, i.e., a new price formula, and cold weather. They are for the first time largely positive, above &#x20AC;300 million. If I come back to our Global Gas activities, H1 2010 compared to H1 2009 is &#x20AC;800 million lower. This sharp decrease can be explained first by less arbitrage opportunities compared to H1 2009, which was clearly exceptional, around &#x20AC;330 million more than the average. And second, but the very tough conditions resulting from both the level of market prices and the spread or disconnect between spot prices and long-term oil index prices. This spread peaked in April this year reaching even &#x20AC;12. Altogether, we consider that this adverse price situation has contributed to &#x20AC;400 million to the decrease of the revenues out of 800 million. Direct consequences have also been less volumes due to the increased competition and reduced margins. We do believe that this very difficult environment will not be compounded further and we even see some recent positive improvements in three directions. First, the price disconnect has been more than helped since April to 5 to &#x20AC;6 versus 10 to 12.</p>
          <p>Second, market prices and volumes are better oriented. NBP for instance is up 40% compared to end 2009. And third, LNG activities have recently resumed, particularly in Asia, where we contemplated plus 20% increase in volumes this year. And finally, our E&amp;P activities results have been also globally stable. The impact of gas prices reductions on our sales have been offset by the oil prices increase during H1. Naturally, the group has acted to mitigate this adverse environment. What have we done? First, we've used all our flexibilities possible in our long-term contracts to increase our supplies on the market. Second, we have managed our gas balance to reduce the spread impact by a dynamic hedging policy. And third, we've decided to preserve all margins at the cost of temporary market share decrease. And naturally, we have entered into negotiations with most of our long-term suppliers to review on a temporary basis our long-term contracts, commitments. The purpose of these reviews was first to inject some market price indexation instead of oil index prices; and second, to increase the volume flexibility to lower <mark type="inaudible" /> commitments in order to offset the impact of demand reduction and to allow us to switch to more market supply.</p>
          <p>Without being too precise on our negotiations, let me just tell you that on average we have been able to increase the market price indexation share to around 15% in each negotiation &#x2013; renegotiation that we have done. Globally speaking and up-to-date, the overall market price share in our portfolio &#x2013; in our long-term portfolio and given the fact that not all contracts have been renegotiated, amounts to a figure close to 10%. The contribution of these negotiations is expected mainly from year-end 2010 and 2011, and will secure the guidance announced in March. Let me remind you also that the E&amp;P sector will see at the end of this year the start of production in Gjoa in Norway, making a significant contribution to our E&amp;P activities in 2011, approximately &#x20AC;300 million on a full-year basis.</p>
          <p>To conclude, first, very tough H1 2010 conditions in the gas market, which have largely impacted our results on Global Gas &amp; Energy. Second, we do believe that in term of reduction of revenues we have clearly bottomed out. And third, we see some positive signs of market recovery, even if this still needs to be confirmed.</p>
          <p>I will let now G&#xE9;rard conclude.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. By way of conclusion, I would like to say that during the first half of 2010, the group demonstrated the strength of its business model with solid and profitable growth despite, as you have heard, a difficult gas market environment. This has enabled us to maintain our ambitious &#x20AC;10 billion per year investment program until 2011, which allows us to offer an effective and sustainable shareholder remuneration, and we can do this while maintaining a sound financial structure. Our financial health on one hand and our balanced and diversified business model on the other places the group in an ideal position to quickly benefit from the return to growth in its major markets. We maintain our targets for 2010 and for the medium-term for 2011.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. My colleagues and I are ready to answer your questions now on H1 results. May I remind you indeed that you will be able to ask your questions on the transaction with IP during our common presentation at 9.30 a.m. London Time, 10.30 Paris Time. Thank you.</p>
