          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ING Groep Second Quarter Result 2008 Conference Call on 13th of August, 2008. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Thomas Weerheim.  Please go ahead sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Thomas Weerheim, welcoming you to ING's second quarter 2008 conference call. Before handing this conference call over to Michel Tilmant, Chief Executive Officer of ING Group and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer, let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comments are subject to a number of variables including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movements in securities markets including equity markets and underlying economic conditions and changes. The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered by unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables.</p>
          <p>Good morning Michel and John. Michel over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning all and welcome and thank you for joining the call this morning. I am here as a matter of fact with John Hele, CFO and Koos Timmermans our Chief Risk Officer as well as Tom McInerney, our Head of the US Operations and we've prepared for you a pretty extensive presentation. I hope that you will bear with us for the next few minutes, long minutes and after that we will be more than happy to respond to questions.</p>
          <p>First of all, if you turn to the presentation on page three, we are happy to report that we have recorded underlying net profit of 1.9 billion in the second quarter although down 28.8% from the second quarter 2007, due to lower investment income and capital gains.</p>
          <p>We are happy to say that we have limited direct impact from the credit and liquidity crisis in the second quarter. But at the same time you can see that we are not immune to the challenging environment around us. We are happy to record that all capital and leverage ratios are well within targets. And also I'm happy to say that our commercial growth continued very strongly despite increasingly competitive market.</p>
          <p>On page four, you can see the net profit in the second quarter and with the separation with capital gains and I think what is nice to show is that our core earnings, if you look at the blue lines are relatively strong even compared to the two last quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>This also is shown by our EPS development which is down 20% less than the net underlying earnings and this is because of the share buyback that lifted to the earnings per share by &#x20AC;0.05 a share.</p>
          <p>I don't think I need to comment a lot on the challenging market circumstances. I think that you know all about it. You know the stock market, the credit spreads, the yield curve and the Morgan Stanley index real estate. So I think that you &#x2013; it's fair to say that the market deteriorated. Only one bright light to some extent is the yield curve in the US which has widened quite significantly.</p>
          <p>Page seven; you can see that the direct impact from the credit and liquidity crisis was limited. I don't need to comment on the numbers and Koos Timmermans will go into more details later on, on those pretty benevolent numbers.</p>
          <p>On Page eight, I think it's remarkable to notice that the underlying profits adjusted volatility in the financial markets impact basically stayed pretty well compare to the second quarter of '07. So I think that you can see here that we have experienced big swings in some categories of revenues. For instance, if you look to capital gains net of impairments, there is a change of 400 million compared to last year. I remind also last year, we had the ABN AMRO capital gains which were pretty exceptional. If you look to the fair value changes real estate, I mean, there also we had still in the second quarter '07 a net positive revaluation of 120 million. This time, we had a net devaluation of 180 million. That's a swing of 300 million. And that's quite significant.</p>
          <p>In Private Equity, we had a positive revaluation 140 million. We have now still a positive revaluation but only 12 million, that's a swing of 128 million, so I think those are certainly impacting our overall result.</p>
          <p>I think if you go more in detail into the various business lines I think that you can see that Insurance Europe is down 42%. It's essentially due to weaker investment income, despite that the growth in Central Europe is pretty strong with sales up 21% and despite expense in Benelux decline, but that's where basically you can see the impact on real estate revaluation and the private equity differences. That's essentially what explains the difference between this year and last year.</p>
          <p>On the Insurance Americas, there is a decline of 37%, but about 28% excluding foreign exchange. It's essentially because of credit related losses and lower investment income and also lower fees as the value of the portfolio has declined. Life sales though is very strong with plus 21.5% excluding ForEx and the value of new business plus 86% excluding ForEx. So think what we can say in the United States, we have big volume, good client traction, but we are affected in our investment portfolio income.</p>
          <p>On Insurance Asia/Pacific, minus 20%, I think this is kind of a pause in the growth we have seen in the last three years, but profits are up 1% excluding ForEx, but sales there are down 10% excluding ForEx and John will give you the detail later on.</p>
          <p>Banking -- Wholesale Banking has a decline of 40%, but if we would exclude ING Real Estate, the profit would have increased by 24%, and especially because financial markets performed extremely well in the first two quarters. The revaluation of ING Real Estate amount to less -- minus 238 million before minority interest and I think there will be an explanation of that given by Koos later on. Client balances are 4%.</p>
          <p>In Retail Banking profit declined 10% because margins remain under pressure, but client balances were up 8.6 billion in the second quarter despite the competition that everybody experienced. Operating expense also declined in The Netherlands.</p>
          <p>And ING Direct had the second best quarter ever for ING Direct. Client balances are up 8.2 billion in the second quarter versus first quarter excluding currency effects. Interest margin rise to 93 basis points and outflow stopped in the UK. So all in all a good quarter for ING Direct driven by the US performance, thanks to the yield curve.</p>
          <p>I think what is important, when you look at those numbers, certainly for the management of ING is to reflect on it and say what I operate these in the current circumstances, what are the things that we have to focus on? And I think that I would say that first of all is to stick our strategy, to look for profitable growth. That means maintain focus on commercial growth, plus cost control, plus margin control. So I think that's what we are concentrating our efforts to. And as well as continuing our disciplined risk management which has served us very well in the last quarters and also disciplined capital management which has served the shareholders very well in the last quarters.</p>
          <p>Let me also say that business-by-business we are continuing to manage the business fundamentals. If you look to Insurance Europe, I think that important point is that we have reduced the equity exposure in the Netherlands, given the market circumstances and also we are continuing to reduce expenses and this program of restructuring is progressing well.</p>
          <p>We are also going to introduce a new generation of life insurance products in the next -- within the next six months in the Netherlands. We have decided to create a single operating platform for Central and rest of Europe to leverage scale and accelerate growth. We now have back office and IT infrastructure in every country. We will basically create one single operating platform for those counties. We also continue to invest. We have invested and we made the acquisition of the pension company of Oyak in Turkey. And finally we have received approval to start the life insurance company in Ukraine.</p>
          <p>Turning to Insurance America, I think that product development continues to focus on reducing tail risk while maintaining competitive position, that's important. Second, we continue to review our risk appetite, asset allocation, ALM guidelines and expansion of hedging program within the context of the current market circumstances. It's interesting that our retail life sales are outgrowing the market and we benefit from the strategy we have developed two years ago. And this reduced the volatility of our US product portfolio and reduced policy cost and therefore improved profitability over the long-term.</p>
          <p>We have invested in a super-senior CLO program to take advantage of historically high credit spreads and we've also continued to make some strategic acquisition, add-ons acquisitions with the acquisition of CitiStreet and the Santander pension fund business in Latin America.</p>
          <p>In Insurance Asia &#x2013; in Asia we have to very rapidly work on product innovation to compensate the negative impact of the market downturn with the new products, and we are going to launch new products in Australia, Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
          <p>We continue to expand rapidly our bank distribution with sales started through Japan Post that's very important and Thai Military Bank in Thailand and finally ING Australia extended its distribution through the acquisition of Pinnacle Partners and Financial Lifestyle Solutions. So we continue in the insurance business to develop our sales.</p>
          <p>On the banking side, when its comes to Wholesale Banking, we are driving certainly to improve our market share and we are advertising, we are marketing more, we are selectively hiring key staff to increase skills. At the same time, we are putting together cost initiatives to bring the cost income ratio to 55% for the Wholesale excluding ING Real Estate. We have also adjusted the transfer pricing between the deposit side and the asset side of the balance sheet to reflect higher market cost for funding in new lending. And also we have reduced the duration of the assets to increase flexibility in the current interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>On the Retail Banking side, given the competition for savings, we have introduced new products in the Netherlands and in Belgium and thanks to those products, we have remained very competitive and we have experienced inflows of deposits in the recent past.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on cost containment in those mature markets, we have two transformation programs underway in the Benelux and one in Belgium, one in the Netherlands and they are on track. We have changed the transfer pricing in this time to encourage deposit growth and we are continuing to expand our mid-corporate business because we want to increase our market share in Netherlands.</p>
          <p>We are investing also in growth, in distribution in Poland, Romania, Turkey and India and we start a new greenfield in Ukraine in June.</p>
          <p>ING Direct, we introduced targeted pricing and marketing actions to acquire new customers and retain increased share of wallet of existing customers. We have shortened the duration of assets to increase repricing flexibility. We are continuing to roll out different products to increase customer stickiness whilst diversifying income stream. We have made selective acquisitions such as Interhyp, to increase mortgage distribution capacity not only in Germany but also toward Europe and we are sharpening our mortgage acceptance policy in order to make sure that we don't have an inflow of bad customers who basically would be refused in some other places so we are very carefully tightening our mortgage criteria.</p>
          <p>So you can see that we are really taking initiatives in all our lines of business to increase over the long term our business.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to talking about risk management and capital management, I'll let John do that and go through that at a later stage, but you can see on page 14 what are our priorities.</p>
          <p>On page 15, you can see the familiar graph of client balances which shows that the net production of client balance has been pretty strong the last quarter with about 30 billion. Mostly in &#x2013; on the credit side I have to say because there is a lot of demand on the credit side at this point of time.</p>
          <p>I'm glad to tell you, page 16, that expenses are under control and you can see that we continue our policy to control our cost with a lot of discipline in mature market plus 1% increase over year-to-year which is given the today's inflation pretty good. And at the same time we continue to invest in the future by accepting that a growth business invests more resources for the future.</p>
          <p>I'm glad to report that all capital ratios are within target, page 17, with the spare leverage capacity at 3.9 billion after the finalization of the share buyback program and after having paid 1.7 billion of dividends to shareholders.</p>
          <p>In line with previous practice, and policy, interim cash dividend was set at half of last year total dividend. We have not changed our 15 year policy in that regard and the dividend will be paid in cash.</p>
          <p>I think looking-forward, financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility, limited liquidity, and intensified competition for deposits, which we see continuing into 2009. We are executing our strategy in the context of this challenging environment by focusing on growing client balances, while keeping a close eye on margins and expenses.</p>
          <p>We continue to adapt our product range to meet our customers' changing needs. We invest to expand our distribution in growth markets and we are containing our costs in mature markets.</p>
          <p>And as markets remain volatile, we will continue to manage our risk and capital with discipline. And while financial markets are expected to put pressure on results in the short term, we are confident that ING will continue to create profitable growth for our shareholders over the long term through the breadth of our business and the strength of our franchise.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn to John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm on slide 21. I will review four topics, give a brief overview of our key performance indicators that we introduced a short time ago, I'll review the market environment and the impact on the results trying to give you some insight into that. We will briefly review our margin analysis for the insurance businesses and also talk on capital management.</p>
          <p>On slide 22, is our overall Group key performance indicator which starts primarily with our client balances which is getting very close to &#x20AC;1.5 trillion. We show operating expenses, underlying profit before tax and economic capital relative to those client balances.</p>
          <p>In the circles we give below each of the graphs are the trailing four quarter averages, so for example our operating expenses were 95 basis points on a trailing four-quarter average relative to client balances. And you can see as Michel mentioned our costs are clearly under control particularly relative to our client balances. We give for you this quarter, a second number below, which is 94 basis points for example for operating expenses and that number is the ratio for the current quarter. So you don't have to calculate that yourself now, we give it to you so you can quickly see not only the average trend, but the trend in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our underlying profit before tax is 60 basis points relative to these client balances, trending down because of lower investment results primarily, but still showing a very solid 24% return on true risk capital in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, I won't go through each of the business lines KPIs, they are here for your information. We're happy to take any questions on them, but for the sake of time, I would like to suggest I move to slide 29.</p>
          <p>On page 29, we show the value of new business, which climbed almost 30% on a more profitable product mix. We show the trend in both APE and value of new business. We've highlighted for you the VNB that we got from the Romania second-pillar pension fund, which was a limited time opportunity, but really a great opportunity when you look at the value we added across the board there. We had &#x20AC;267 million VNB in the second quarter up from 207 a year before, 31 million of that was a change of methodology in expense allocations as well as including our Group Life contract renewals in the Netherlands, so about half of that increase was from methodology changes. Still a very solid increase across the board for Value of New Business when you take into account the currency impact that impacted this.</p>
          <p>Now looking at some of the market environment and the impact on results, starting first with our interest margin on page 31, you can see our total margin increased to 105 basis points and we show the longer term trend here driven a lot by ING Direct which recovered to 93 basis points driven mainly by the US business. The margin also increased because of now the inclusion of ING Bank Turkey.</p>
          <p>Slide 32, shows the impact of the equity markets and we go back for several quarters here. A year ago we had quite some large capital gains primarily due to the ABN AMRO holdings that we had. We took advantage and sold 573 million of that in the second quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>As Michel mentioned we took the opportunity in the rally in April and May to reduce our equity exposure and recorded 729 million of capital gains in the quarter. We also saw 349 million of equity impairments in the second quarter. So we had a net 400 million of capital gains, very solid dividend payments, 307 million in the second quarter. So we tend to have a bump in dividend payments in the second quarter compared to the other quarters due to seasonality.</p>
          <p>Now equity impairments, there is always a lot of questions on this, how do you decide on equity impairments under IFRS? It is done on a security by security basis. And it's an or test and it's based on the fair value or the market value of these equities. So it's different in equities than from the credit and from debt impairments, which is driven on a credit analysis not on a fair value and market analysis.</p>
          <p>For equity securities, there is a two-trigger test and it's an or test. So if you have a prolonged or significant decline of the fair value below cost that is evidence of impairment. So, we draw a little graph for you here. If you hit both of those: prolonged and significant, and we say below 25% and longer than six months, then clearly, you're probably in an impairment area unless there's going to be a quick rebound and evidence of a quick rebound.</p>
          <p>But for those that are in the or area, so you've had a significant decline or you're longer than six months, that's sort of the other area for which we've drawn some lines for you here and we evaluate these equities security by security looking at the impact, what might be happening, will it be recovering and we set an impairment if it won't be recovering. The dots on here are the equity securities in which we impaired the &#x20AC;349 million in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We also have an impact in our earnings on slide 34 with DAC unlocking. This is quite an impact in the first quarter. Our basic rule of thumb was 10% down is about 100 million charge on net DAC unlocking. We do get -- the derivatives are offset this as well and this is a pre-tax number here. We saw 25 million negative DAC unlocking in the second quarter. We also had a positive DAC unlocking due to a change in assumption for surrenders in other areas in the calculation of the DAC, so that was a positive number, but we thought it would just be clearer to show you this slide so you can see the trend on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of on slide 35, another major impact in the quarter was the negative revaluation on real estate. This was recorded in Wholesale Banking and had that large impact in the quarter. You can see the operational result. We had a slight negative 72 million in Q1. We had 285 million in Q2. Of this, &#x20AC;195 million before tax and minorities was the Summit portfolio in Canada. This is was a series of industrial properties across Canada, which we own and we own it -- we own half of it with an external fund, which is managed by ING. We also have a 10% indirect stake in that fund. So the gross number is minus 195 million. But 78 million of that will be charged to minorities when you get down to our net profit.</p>
          <p>This portfolio is highly leased, it's 96% occupancy, but this is a change in the market value of these properties which flows through the P&amp;L. The underlying performance of the assets is good, but it's simply a change in the view of the market value of this one portfolio.</p>
          <p>Our loan losses on slide 36 are trending toward more normalized levels. Last quarter we gave guidance that through the cycle value would be 40 to 45 basis points based on Basel II numbers. We had 36 basis points net in the quarter. So you can see it's slowly trending up here towards this -- the basic level. But we give 40 as the very long-term return here across the board.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 37, what do these basis points mean in terms of numbers? We show you the underlying net additions for loan losses. And you can see Wholesale Banking is now up slightly over 100 million, Retail Banking 66, and ING Direct 50. It's driven -- the Retail Banking is driven by the inclusion of ING Bank Turkey and also we shifted mid-corps from Wholesale Bank into Retail Bank and so that's most of the increase there. And ING Direct is just a progression of accumulations for US housing mortgages, but they are performing still very well compared to other prime sectors.</p>
          <p>On slide 38, we give details on the corporate line. This is where the excess capital gains on equities is recorded, the 669 minus the impairments and the notional income which is allocated to the businesses.</p>
          <p>So this is, I think, the area where we're exceeding analyst expectations was we did take this opportunity in the second quarter to record some equities and reduce our equity exposure. We also had a positive change on fair value in derivatives and this was on some equity hedges and swaps related to the core debt we have in the US.</p>
          <p>In the Corporate Line Banking on slide 39, we also saw positive FX-results based on our capital hedging and that was a positive. So that was slightly above the normal run rate for the Corporate Line Banking as well.</p>
          <p>Looking at our margin analysis, where we breakdown for you the insurance margins. Clearly you can see the trend here going back to a year the lower investment margins and slightly lower fees and premium based revenues. That's because we have a lower asset base due to the markets and currency. The technical margin was quite solid in the quarter and expense remained under control. So this breaks down into the components of our core earnings in Insurance. We have for you in the appendix each of the lines of business for the margin analysis.</p>
          <p>Slide 42 explains this in some more detail, with some wording &#x2013; it &#x2013; the slide moves the opposite way from the previous slide. It goes left to right instead of right to left, just to be clear but the numbers do match but we give you some text here that explains it a little more.</p>
          <p>Lastly I'll talk on capital management. I have two slides in here, but we have a detailed appendix for you in Appendix 1 for reference that walks through how we do capital management. We're please to take questions for you on this. It is essentially many of the slides that we talked about in our IR Symposium when we walked through capital management updated to our capital structure and numbers today. We've had some requests for this from various people so we thought we would include this for you as a reference document.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital management though on slide 44: we start with our shareholders equity, and this walks through the basic components of it. We did have an unrealized revaluation of debt securities of minus 3 billion that was offset by deferred interest crediting to life policyholders; it's known as shadow accounting in the accounting world. But essentially this is offset on an economic basis because our liabilities go down as well. The 3 billion is due to higher interest rates and in essence most of our liabilities on the insurance side would be down as well but because the vast majority of them are at book value, you don't see that on an ongoing basis. This is why this 3 billion and the 753 are netted out on the next slide on slide 45 when we talk about our adjusted equity. This is the number that we talk and work with our rating agencies and our regulators with.</p>
          <p>And just to sort of make this point clear, when you look at our AFR, our Available Financial Resources, versus that actually went up in the quarter and that's the difference between the market value of assets and the market value of liabilities. So I think it proves that this 3 billion on an economic basis was offset.</p>
          <p>I'm going to turn over now to Koos Timmermans, our Chief Risk Officer to discuss risk management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, John. On page 47, I outlined a few areas what we like to discuss. First and foremost is the pressurized asset classes. We're going to take a look through the real estate exposure. Overall we are largely mortgages originated as well and I'll give you a snap shot overview on that portfolio. We'll take about loan loss provisioning and liquidity.</p>
          <p>We first go to the key points on the risk management side. I think we've had a very volatile quarter at the same time even after the quarter things turned even more volatile, nevertheless what you've seen in our numbers is a very limited direct impact of the crisis. But actually you've got to look at this on a going forward basis as well and that is why one of the things what we do as well in this presentation is give you an overview on scenarios and what would happen there in the Alt-A portfolio.</p>
          <p>Own-originated mortgages our conclusion is they continue to perform well and if you look at the structure of our balance sheet and the liquidity that looks robust.</p>
          <p>Moving first to subprime, if you look at subprime, the subprime portfolio was 2.2 billion which is held fair value at the 30th of June was close to 80% a slight deterioration as of the 31st of March and you can see it's similar like in the previous quarters. It's a slight outperformance of the ABX index. Now that's a logical one as the ABX index contain less AAA at the moment than our portfolio so in general you see them moving a bit in line with ours outperforming. Overall market value 2.2 billion, 450 million downgrades at the second quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at the and that is especially important if you hold portfolios like us more on a buy hold perspective than it is important to look at the underlying pool and what that is doing. So first and foremost on page 50, what you see is our subprime portfolio and we see there the credit buffer. And the credit buffer is the dark blue line showing at 30% on average. So that is the buffers which we still have due to the fact that there are junior tranches which pick up losses first.</p>
          <p>Now, one of the issues is if you look at the actual cumulative losses, that's on the left hand of the graph, those are still fairly low numbers. And you see a deterioration there, but actually it's low. Now this doesn't say anything or this doesn't say everything because if you have more junior or more recent vintages it starts &#x2013; losses start to accumulate at a later stage. So it's already better to look at delinquencies than at the pipeline. And as you know what we do with the pipeline is we formulate it as anything what is 60 day plus delinquency, bankruptcy, foreclosures; we take that and we multiply that at the certain moment with a loss given default. So what you see in the graph in the middle and on the right hand side is an increase of delinquencies and if you multiply times a 50% loss given default, you see your calculated pipeline losses. Overall, if you look at subprime, what you see is a slight deterioration but it seems to be leveling out a bit. That is the development bill so far on the subprime portfolio.</p>
          <p>If we then move to the Alt-A portfolio, we have in total 22 billion of Alt-A. And that's primarily held by ING Direct 18.7 billion and Insurance Americas has 2.9 and we have a little bit and pieces of remaining.</p>
          <p>If you look at the portfolio there, we had market value declines only modestly after -- at the 30th of June and in essence that was more interest rate actually going up rather than credit spreads tightening. I mean, so it's a widening. So this is more actually an interest rate movement, albeit that if we look at the month of July, there you see basically a more illiquidity in this market as a subsequent event. And more illiquidity and you see more Level Three pricing, a short update on that side is that at this moment private label RMBSs, it is more difficult to repo them, it is more difficult to own them. So in essence what you hear is margin haircuts of 20%. So this is a more illiquidity issue which is going on at this moment.</p>
          <p>If you look at, so market value growth at the 30th of June very modestly, one of the things what you see in the table over there is we have Direct Americas and the other unit. In the other unit you see a fair value of 90, whereas actually if you look at the rating, it's lower rated. This is because this is a trading portfolio and in a trading portfolio you pick up bonds at a certain price and what we do with fair value is we take a percentage of the price at which we purchased it. So since that inventory is refreshing a lot, that is why you see a relatively higher number. It's not that this is a forgotten type of portfolio.</p>
          <p>If we look at the Insurance Americas Alt-A, in the Insurance Americas what you see is again credit buffers to 16.5% over the second quarter. What you see is cumulative losses low, delinquencies pipeline rising, especially so in the second quarter from 5.6 to 8% and therefore estimated pipeline losses going up as well. So you see our multiples moving down from eight times to 5.9 times. And what you see is here we are talking averages, we also have the tail of the portfolio. So those are the more weaker bonds in the portfolio and that is where we took some impairments.</p>
          <p>If we look at the ING Direct Alt-A portfolio there what we always do is we first make a distinction. The distinction what we make is per product and so we have fixed rate product, we have ARMs and we had option ARMs and that is what you see predominantly in the matrix under there.</p>
          <p>Overall market value of this portfolio is close to 82%, the fixed rate component of it is holding up at 90. The market rate deterioration is more in the negative amortizations. Those are the type of RMBSs where there is an option to defer interest and that deferral interest will that represents re-cost risks at a later stage, so in other words, higher potential delinquencies in this portfolio.</p>
          <p>At the same time also what you see on the option ARMs is higher credit enhancement for this particular asset class. If you move to again the portfolio and the underlying pools as compared to our pipelines, in ING Direct the Alt-A portfolio, first let's look at the total, what you see is buffers of 15.4% in terms of credit enhancement, but at the same time delinquencies moving up and as estimated losses as well. So our multiples go from 8 times to 7 times to 5.7 times where it is right now. Assuming in specifically owned vintages and for instance to the more recent 2006 vintage, that is where you see that our multiple at this moment is at four times.</p>
          <p>Let's then zoom in on the segment of the Alt-A portfolio which is called the negative amortizations. So as I said with the negative amortizations, thresholds predominantly at 115% of the principle of the bonds, most of the recast, so that is when the mortgage holder hits its 115% level than there is a renegotiation of their contract. That recast period is predominantly in 2010 and 2011. What you see on this portfolio is the average level of credit enhancement that is at 26.9%, so that is a relatively high credit enhancement on this portfolio. But at the same time what you have to see is delinquencies on this portfolio are moving up quicker.</p>
          <p>Pipeline multiples here of 5.1%, also what you see is on the left-hand graph, at the bottom you see a distribution of the prices of the negative amortization portfolio. S&amp;P, they recently -- they doubled their loss estimates on the negative amortization from 8% to 15% and I will come back on this S&amp;P scenario. But in average if you compare that with the average buffer of the portfolio that is 26.9%.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the parts of impairment, what I would like to share with you is the part -- how do we look at this portfolio and when do we take things to the P&amp;L. First of all, I mean we are holding this portfolio from a buy hold perspective. So we are looking at whether those bonds are money good or not over a longer period of time.</p>
          <p>What is for us important in that is we look at the coverage ratio. So we look at the credit enhancement and we compare that with the estimated pipeline losses and then we say like, well, how much is the coverage? If the coverage is more than two times, while you don't have at that moment its still more in the zone where you say like well not an automatic trigger is there.</p>
          <p>If the coverage is between one and two times it is on our watch list, it goes to our impairment committee and we really study the bond individually. If it is below one, then the bond should be impaired unless there is an absolute objective evidence right now that you should not do it, but there the default is more that you should do it. So this impairment test resulted at the end of June at 35 million impairments on the Alt-A portfolio.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, I think you need to look at these things more on a forward-looking basis as well. And what we'd -- what you see in the market and that is something what you see on page 57, is that while both S&amp;P, they increased the ultimate loss projections for the Alt-A mortgages and they increased their ultimate loss projections for the different classes from Option ARMs to fixed but more or less they doubled it. And why is it? It's basically a projection due to the fact that the delinquencies are moving up rapidly and this is also why they have increased their ultimate losses on this asset class.</p>
          <p>Also you see that with Fitch at the moment, Fitch, they have &#x2013; they already announced in April that they were going to do a review of the rating methodology of the Alt-As. And I think they have done that review right now, and what they have included is more 30 day plus delinquency in their analysis. So, they come to relatively higher projected delinquencies and that results in a downgrade of the portfolio what they did in two tranches still so far August 1, and August 8, and that is affecting a part of our portfolio as well.</p>
          <p>And then you have investment banks, and investment banks they have different ideas and thoughts on how the ultimate losses on this portfolio can end-up. So, there is still a wide range of estimated losses. And at the same time, it is moving up based also on the increased projected losses.</p>
          <p>Now, what we did is we did the sensitivity test. We took the S&amp;P scenario of the ultimate losses and we applied that to our portfolio and that is what I'd like to share with you on page 58.</p>
          <p>Now, you have to take some simplifications there, what we did is, we said like if the ultimate losses of S&amp;P's, if that would apply to our portfolio and we don't take any benefit of excess spread during the lifetime or we don't take any benefits of prepayments. So, we almost say like the ultimate loss scenario is applying to our portfolio what would happen? And what you see is in the graph on page two, you see actually our ING Direct Alt-A portfolio, and you see that it's the circle, the red circle with the 15.4% average credit enhancement on the total portfolio.</p>
          <p>Then, if you take the S&amp;P's loss projection at 14.8% then, for instance on the NegAms then you see that some of the bonds will fall through the S&amp;P's trigger. So, 126 bonds they would breach our credit enhancement following this S&amp;P scenario. So, what would that result in? In essence, what we would see from a credit perspective, we would see that there would be a shortfall from a credit perspective of 200 million versus the credit enhancement, and that is the outcome of this scenario. At the same time, a credit loss is not the same as an impairment because at that time we would have to impair the bond and that is rightly down to a market value. So a 200 million of a credit loss, would in this case result in 400 million of an impartment, which you would have to take over the lifetime of the transaction.</p>
          <p>So this is an estimate, a scenario of what we run. So it's S&amp;P's on our portfolio, magnitude and timing why is an answer a bit indirect with the 200 and the 400 million. A few things are important. One is indeed the ultimate delinquency development of the mortgages. The second part is the market prices at the moment that you have to impair something. Third element is the structure, the complexity, the excess spreads, when is actually the precise deterioration in the portfolio happening. There is a few ifs and buts, but nevertheless we've thought like it's interesting to share this scenario with you and to give you some of the sensitivities.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, if you look at the current cumulative losses of the mortgage pools they are still negligible. If you compare it with the current credit enhancement, if you look at the estimated losses based on the current delinquencies, then we are still more than adequately covered yet despite the deterioration which we have seen over the second quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at the future and if you run an S&amp;P's revised scenario, then you see some of the impairments trickling in over the life of the deal in the order of the 400 million, if I would apply an S&amp;P scenario.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the CDO and the CLO portfolio. In the CDOs and the CLOs you see that our net exposure has gone up. And the net exposure has gone up basically because of protection written with super-senior tranches. What we have done there in essence is, yes, we've written some protection, but be assured this not on subprime or Alt-A mortgages or on an asset class which is very correlated, the underlying portfolio is basically investment grade type bond portfolio and the attachment points are relatively high.</p>
          <p>Also on the Wholesale Banking side we added to the CDO/CLO exposure, but you have to take it from me that we do is we take iTraxx tranches so if we are investing in a certain iTraxx tranche we add that to our CDO/CLO exposure because technically it is a slight type of credit. It could be that other ones define this as a derivative or an index derivative but we take that as CDO/CLO exposure.</p>
          <p>Other things, if you look at the CMBS portfolio, in essence the CMBS portfolio was roughly stable both in terms of amounts as well as in terms of valuation and I share with you some of the statistics in terms of the fair value, the ratings and the credit enhancement as you can see.</p>
          <p>If we look at the real estate exposure, on the real estate I'd like to point out that overall the amount is slightly down as compared to the previous quarter. Why is it down slightly? Well, first we have had some divestment. It was actually relatively small and I think the &#x2013; there is one other part which is reclassified from mark-to-market into available for sale portfolio but that's only relatively small. So overall the amounts are still there.</p>
          <p>If you look at this portfolio most of it, in terms of revaluations, is done on a yearly basis by external counterparties. If we look at the exposure overall in terms of risk, it is still well diversified in terms of the different types of exposures which we have as well as the different countries where we're operating in. So that is that sort of determines the risk characteristics of this portfolio.</p>
          <p>If we go to -- let's have a look at our own originated mortgages and that is something what we see on page 64. On page 64 what you see is we have roughly 250 billion own-originated portfolio 250 billion. Out of that what we have is an average loan to value of 72% and I think it is important to see that if you look at the serious delinquencies development, the 90 day plus on the non-performing loans, it is relatively stable. So if we look at it Q1 to Q2 then you hardly see any movement except for the US. So in that sense more the conclusion from this is in the rest of the world you don't see a lot of deterioration on the mortgages yet.</p>
          <p>If you look at the US mortgages, there what we &#x2013; let's zoom in on that part. There what you clearly see is a deterioration of the 90 day plus. Why is it? Well, first characteristics, it's a &#x20AC;19 billion portfolio, primarily consisting of hybrid ARMs so 5/1s that means like five year fixed and then it starts to reset to a one-year floater. In average if you look at the underwriting criteria there are loan to value 70%, FICO scores 743. So that all more resembles prime, 98% owner-occupied and in essence if you look at the graph on the right hand side, what I've given there is three things. One is ING Direct, the dotted line, so that is its development of the 90 day plus delinquencies. Why is it moving up? I think there are two things. One is aging of the portfolio and the second one is trend in a market. So those two factors are there.</p>
          <p>What we did is we compared that with the prime industry fixed rate. The unfairness about this is the prime industry fixed is more than 30 years fixed, but then again, there is no prime equivalent 5/1 graph, which I can make. So what I did is I shared it with both. First the fixed rate, the red graph and you see it is moving in line with the 30 year fixed and the other one is the ARMs graph. And the ARM graph is clearly moving up on the prime side. But overall, as a conclusion what you can see is this portfolio is more behaving prime-like than non-prime.</p>
          <p>Then if we zoom in on the Dutch portfolio, I still like to share with you because of the sheer size of the portfolio. One is it looks worrying in a sense that you have rising graph there but before we get worried you have to look at the y-axis what you see there is the cumulative losses are basis points.</p>
          <p>So those are relatively small amounts and in essence, what you see happening is the residential mortgage had -- we have relatively high residential mortgage debt to GDP, but at the same time, if you look at the house prices I mean house prices the specific characteristic of the Dutch market is that we have some geographical constraints supporting the house prices at the moment. Also, if you look at the loss given defaults on the Dutch mortgage, it's relatively small. So overall, you can say cumulative losses relatively limited. Also just one thing to mention if you look at the portfolio on average more than 55% of the mortgages in the Netherlands are fixed rate.</p>
          <p>Move over to loan loss provisioning. On the loan loss provisioning side, what you see is in average you see an increase of the loan losses. It is more actually moving in line with the total amount of loans. You have seen modest credit migration and portfolio growth as two of the explaining factors, portfolio growth is probably the bigger one at this moment.</p>
          <p>Then let's move over to the liquidity side. And on the liquidity on page 70, I think what we can still say is that our portfolio is diversified in terms of the amount of liabilities which we have on the balance sheet and which we appreciate very much. Nevertheless, what we did over the month of July is we issued a serious amount of longer term loans as well to enhance our liquidity profile. And why are we doing that? Well, first, these were reasonable markets, second part is our balance sheet on the asset side is growing as well because securitization markets are still not working so more and more assets go over a balance sheet but we always keep our liquidity very much in check.</p>
          <p>So in the end if you look at the conclusions, limited in direct impacts of the credit crisis still so far, limited impairments at this moment. Sensitivity test applying that from S&amp;P who based on the deterioration started to create forward-looking scenarios with ultimate losses, that would create 200 million of credit losses over a several years creating a 400 million impairment if we would apply this S&amp;P scenario. Home originated mortgages working well, and if you look at the liquidity profile that is sound. So that is the credit risk side.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you Koos. Let me close this session by repeating our key points. I think that underlying net profits are 1.9 billion, down 28.8% from the second quarter '07, essentially on lower investment income and capital gains. There is a limited direct impact from credit and the liquidity crisis in the second quarter. But, of course, we are not immune to the challenging environment around us. Despite of that all capital and leverage ratios are well within target and commercial growth continued despite increasing competitive markets.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, as markets remain volatile, we will continue to manage our risk and capital with discipline. And while financial markets are expected to put pressure on results in the short term, we are confident that ING will continue to create profitable growth for our shareholders over the long-term through the breadth of our business and the strength of our franchise.</p>
          <p>And now we are open to take questions. Please open the floor.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Spencer Horgan at Deutsche Bank here. Just two questions please.</p>
          <p>In terms of the loan loss increase quarter-on-quarter, I think you've pointed to three specific cases which drove the number in Wholesale Banking. But I just wondered if you had a sort of more broad outlook like on where it could go over the next two or three years or so? Presumably it will at least get cross-cycle averages, but do you think that there is a danger that it could go to, for example twice cross-cycle averages or is that quite unlikely?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on the spare leverage number, it's a hypothetical question, hopefully we never get there, but what happens if it gets to zero? I guess if it wasn't for Basel II it might already be below zero, so I sort of wondered how sort of a serious situation that is?</p>
          <p>And thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay on the loan loss increases the little bit disappointing answer is that right now if you look at what happened is it's a little bit across the board. So I don't have a clear directional part that you say like it's only in this section that things have developed. So we had a little bit of increases on the Retail side with the US mortgages. We had a little bit of increases specific files on the Wholesale side, but not really something where you can say well that is a trend, I think still what you have is the overall trend and that is less releases and some more increases so the 40-45 basis point on Basel II credit risk weighted assets, yeah that is something where we see that we are moving to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the question on spare leverage what happens if it gets to zero, well, spare leverage is an actively managed tool. We can always reduce exposures and risks. We can always slow down growth &#x2013; our risk weighed asset growth. That would free up some capital because of course the earnings come in each quarter. We also have spoken to the rating agencies, these targets and the numbers we show you are on a 10% debt to equity at the Group. Our diversification we believe actually supports 15 and we have said that in times of stress or in a major acquisition we would be willing to go to 15 for a period of time. That would add 3 billion of capacity which we would then work over time to get back down to about the 10% level. So we do have flexibility in this number and we are very attentive to it. We have capital plans and contingency plans on the shelf ready to execute if we need to so execute them.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question is regarding the equity market hedges, I think one of the slides were indicating that it's 5 billion. Can you talk about the capital position in the insurance business and how that compares with your internal requirements and if you would potentially increase those hedges just to protect the capital base?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding the technical margin that you showed on page 41, I think it is. Has there been an increase in the mortality gains? There seems to be a sequential increase quarter-on-quarter and I was wondering if there is some seasonality in the numbers as well?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly and finally, could you also give us an update regarding your M&amp;A strategy? You talked about the spare leverage and better flexibility. Would you consider continuing smaller deals going forward or do you want to keep the powder dry given the market circumstances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will -- it's Michel Tilmant here. I will respond probably to the last one and then turn to John Hele. I think that our approach or strategy view has not changed. And our strategic discipline has not changed. So we basically continue to put priority on the organic growth. And we are open to make fill-in acquisitions provided they correspond to the filter of strategy, that they correspond to the filter of execution and the filter of risk.</p>
          <p>I have to say that given the current circumstances today, our tendency is clearly to keep our powder dry and not to stretch ourselves by making new acquisitions even fill-in acquisitions. Now, at the same time, we have the ability to do a fill-in acquisition if we feel it's really so strategically compelling and so attractive from the financial standpoint that we cannot let it go, but at the same time, we are very prudent and we want to exercise discipline. And I can tell you that in the last month we have turned down a number of opportunities which were attractive, but not attractive enough to basically pass the test of the current situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Turning to the hedges we have on the equity portfolio, we have 5 billion of out of the money puts to hedge this portfolio. They are there to protect in case of a major downturn, to protect our capital ratios. And we kind of roll these on an ongoing basis and move these forward. We have not sold the upside though on this portfolio. We think we want to keep the upside. We actually spent money to buy these hedges and the value of these do move through our P&amp;L in the quarter and we had a slight positive move on these. But these are really there to protect in case of a major rapid downturn, that we are not caught with a major equity problems in our ratios for the rating agencies and the regulators.</p>
          <p>The second question on the technical margin, there was a 70 million gain of net relief for the technical margin in the quarter. It was due to disability and profit sharing provisions in the Netherlands. And so that 70 million is in that technical number. It's still quite positive. That would put it at about same level as the first quarter which was pretty solid, but -- and there is no seasonality in mortality that we've ever figured out, it's just you have some cycles and once in a while you get a quarter of mortality being higher than normal, but it sort of averages out over time.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone. This is William Elderkin here from Citi. Three question please.</p>
          <p>First of all, in terms of that S&amp;P scenario analysis on the Alt-A portfolio, is that an S&amp;P potential case or an S&amp;P worst case kind of outcome?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of the risk costs, can you give us an idea of what the sort of the modeled amplitude of risk costs are on through the cycle? I appreciate the sort of 40-45 basis points is a sort of through cycle level, but really where the peaks and troughs could get to?</p>
          <p>And finally, there is a chart in presentation slide 17, showing how the spare leverage has developed. I was a bit &#x2013; I suppose I didn't quite understand where the hybrid that you raised in the second quarter, I think 2.8 billion of hybrid, how that feeds into there? And similarly I see you've reduced the equity exposure quite materially over the second quarter which I thought would release risk capital and so on, which didn't seem to be there either. I just wondered if you could explain that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you want to do the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Maybe &#x2013; it is Koos. Let me first go through the S&amp;P's case in terms of scenario whether it was a worst or central case and what I can tell you is &#x2013; if I look at the specifics there because S&amp;P doesn't give the precise roll rates or what they expect in terms of PDs. What I do know is for instance, I &#x2013; but I can send that later on to you, the ultimate losses specified per product class like subprime, ARM, NegAm, fixed rate. What they do is they say like 2008, 2007 NegAm is 14.8% and in 2006 it's 11.84%. So we just took those cases and it's a whole matrix of product and vintage rates. And on subprime, for instance, they take 2007, 2008, 27% in 2006, 23%. So it's just their latest update on what they've stated on the 30th of July. That is the part what we have used.</p>
          <p>If you look at the moment at the expected credit losses, I still think that what we have is right now absent of a material deterioration of the economy I mean we still stick to this &#x2013; through the cycle 40 to 45 basis points. And I think okay the point is always you will have some &#x2013; you could have some peaks over a quarter like. For instance, this quarter we had one case which is related to a fraud. So that gives you an incident in your portfolio. So quarter-by-quarter it is difficult to precisely maintain this. And please note that we've always understated over losses, risk loss, if you compare it to what we previously calculated, it was always lower, I think right now, and especially in 2009, yeah, we are expecting this 40-45 basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. But really what I was getting at, I mean if I look at the slide on page 36, I mean it's come from '03 46 basis points and now back at 36, but I mean the portfolio has evolved lot since then. I am just sort of trying to get a sense of, in a normal bad case scenario is 40 to 45 basis points a sensible number to be assuming or one &#x2013; would one expect the full portfolio to perform a little worse than that in more difficult times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think, well what you do have is first, if you look at portfolio evolvement over time a few of the developments what you have seen is in general the portfolio by itself. And if you look at the slide with the 77 basis points, this was on the far left hand side because maybe what you are alluding to is can we go back to that type of scenario? I think, since that time what we've done is our portfolio composition changed because, in essence, on the Wholesale side, I think criteria on credit risk they have been tightened. At the same time, if you look at the average credit rating of the whole balance sheet of ING that improved because we had the development of ING Direct in the portfolio. So that is still why I feel like the 40 to 45 is a sort of reasonable estimate of where you end up with at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I'll follow-up on that one later. And finally, just on the development of the spare leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure, the -- we raised lower Tier 2, not Tier 1, but if we raised capital even a hybrid until we use it, it's offset by cash or it's netted out of the calculations. And only when we need the capacity to use it to do a share buyback or for risk-weighted asset growth would it affect the spare leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would the sort of reduction in equity weighting have a favorable effect there as well? Assuming that uses less risk capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reduction in equity rating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You seem to have been selling equities in the second quarter and...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's reduced economic capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that would reduce economic capital across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But not spare leverage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Bruno Paulson of Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bruno Paulson of Bernstein here. Thanks very much. My first question is about real estate revaluations and that we seem to have seen very low losses outside the Canadian area. You mentioned that we get annual revaluations. I was wondering if you could tell us what the phasing of those annual revaluations is over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Alt-A, you've argued in the past that you've got very short duration on Alt-A, around two years on the ING Direct portfolio. I was wondering how much protection you still think that offers you and how the durations have moved out with the drops in fee payments?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, a more general question on the outlook for the Benelux economies. The view at the last quarter was relatively positive but not much sign of distress has been seen. I was wondering how much that view has changed over the last three months? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In terms of the revaluation it depends upon the country, some do rolling throughout the year, some do once a year. But if we have an indication of positive or negative changes throughout the year, then a more formal study is done. And that's exactly what was done with the Summit portfolio. That typically was done one-third each year but we did a full valuation in the second quarter because we saw a trend happening and did a full revaluation across the board on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can I rephrase that question then? Why have we seen, given the movement in indices that you showed, why have we seen outside Canada such small negative revaluations so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the revaluations haven't had a major impact yet across the board. It's mainly been in this Canadian portfolio. We saw some UK deterioration and some Australia deterioration but we also saw some positive revaluations across the board in some of our other properties, so these sort of net out across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think -- it's Michel Tilmant here. I think there is also a differential of listed and unlisted real estate. The real estate which is straight on our books as specific investments behave well because the market continues to behave relatively well. Occupation (sic 1:14:49) [occupancies] are full and so on. But I think it's most what those who are in real estate funds where the fluctuations in the mark-to-market is playing a role.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Uh-huh. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe with regards to the second question and the short duration and the impact there, this is a sort of two-edged sword what we are talking about. Because the first thing what is important is indeed for ING Direct given the fact that we buy mortgages, those mortgages the ideal duration for investment of those mortgages is more closer to two years. So this is one of the primary reasons why we are not in 30-year fixed rate bonds. So our sweet spot from an ALM perspective was always somewhere around the two years. Hence we have a lot of 5/1's in the portfolio and hence we have a lot of floaters as well.</p>
          <p>But indeed the shadow side of it is, that given the fact that you have a short duration there is a reset risk and if interest rates move up then the customers they have more difficulties repaying. Now one of the developments what you see happening there is on the first side the duration, if we look at our balance sheet that has been moving up. So in technical terms what you see is annual prepayments are a little bit lower and that leads to weighted average lives of deals which become a bit longer and that leads to duration on the asset side of our balance sheet becoming a bit longer. So, if I say it's simple, you could say 2.25 years was something what we had and that is more moving out to the three years, because they have less prepayments. So that is our balance sheet, so, a tendency to lengthen.</p>
          <p>If you look at the customer side, yeah there is a risk that if interest rate starts to move up that at that time there will be more delinquencies. Now here this is exactly the uncertainty and that is especially what you have in the NegAm securities, because it is not only an interest rate component, because you could say maybe in the US interest rates will stay a bit lower and we are talking about the primary recast period 2010, 2011, but you have to look at not only the interest rate, you also have to look at the fact that there will be some prepayments and some amortization schedule kicking in after the recast. So as in general this is exactly what gives the uncertainty around these bonds. But there's two elements, one is interest rate and the other is this specific recast feature and that's indeed a 2010 and 2011 issue, hence the difficulty to project the precise delinquency estimates on this type of portfolio and that is also a part which explains why these bonds are valued lower at this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to your question on the balanced economy, and I'll let Koos jump in as well here that we have not yet seen signs of major slowing in the balanced economy. It still is moving along. The impairments we saw in the second quarter in Wholesale Banking were around leveraged finance and specific names in our leveraged finance book. But as you know, the general corporate loan portfolio both in mid-corporates and in the larger size cases still it's performing quite well. But I think the expectation generally across the board is that the European economies in general will be slowing in &#x2013; slowly in the coming future. Koos, anything to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, well added to you, I mean there was one leveraged finance case and there was something in trading commodity finance but that's it. Still it's a bit incidental and un-directional at the moment.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Duncan Russell of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with our question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. First question, in the bank risk-weighted assets grew quite quickly and could you just give some color on why that happened?</p>
          <p>Second question the equities you sold just to reconcile those numbers were they &#x2013; does the equity exposure you give include some real estate funds? So did you just sell plain vanilla equities or did you sell some of the real estate funds or real estate securities?</p>
          <p>And third question, the dividend policy; I know it's consistent with what you've done over the last I think you said 15 years, to pay half of the full year dividend. But as you said yourself, it's not &#x2013; these are exceptional times for financials, so did you not consider just keeping the dividend flat year-on-year? And what's your thinking in terms of the full year dividend currently?</p>
          <p>And then finally, the CLOs, CDOs where you increased your exposure, just wondering why you are doing that? You have quite a lot of leverage already in your balance sheet. So just wondering why you are really bothering and what sort of return you expect to make? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding the dividend policy, again, we felt that &#x2013; we have a policy in place since 15 years and I think that there were no reasons at this time to change the policy. But I think if you look back 15 years, for those of you with that perspective, I think that there has been times at which we have basically not automatically increased the dividends and areas where we kept it flat over the year before despite this policy of being up. So I think that's &#x2013; at this point of time we reserve the right to fix the final dividend according to the circumstance we see in the next six months and that is part of the policy also.</p>
          <p>When it comes to equities, I think, let me say that we have essentially sold straight equities. And then your first question is far as...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The risk weighted asset growth in the bank and it's driven by both Wholesale Banking loans and also some growth in mortgages. Around the world we are in one of the solid positions to be a bank with a healthy balance sheet and solid balanced funding and we have taken advantage of that in this quarter to continue to make loans at a good margin. You can see our overall margin is increasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's just for the sake of completion. I mean risk weighted assets they went up over the quarter, but as compared to last year '08 now the methodology changed Basel I, Basel II. And so it was a downward shift at the start of the year but indeed first quarter increase, and that is basically bond market and securitization markets not performing and more closed deals</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final question on CDOs and CLOs, why did we enter that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at it in the end, what you do see is quite attractive spreads at the moment on the corporate side, but at the same time what you also have to realize like if you take CDOs and CLOs, one of the points which you have to look at is how diversified and how sensitive to risk factors is the underlying portfolio. And we felt at this moment if you look at it from a risk return perspective, as long as you have a good underlying pool of corporate credits who are paying decent credit spreads and at the same time, you have the credit spreads, which are -- so credit spreads are good, attachment points are relatively high on these CDOs then we feel like this is still an interesting business where you can selectively invest in where you expect some returns in the order of 20% at the moment. So we are not feeling uncomfortable with modestly increasing this type of risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just have a quick follow-up. Thanks so much for the answers, but just a quick follow-up on the structured credit portfolio and your comments about downgrades etcetera? Under what circumstances would you be a forced seller of these Alt-A securities? Can you hold if these securities get downgraded to A, BBB? Can you hold them? Is that part of your credit policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's an interesting question because this part, the good thing is we are not funding this portfolio by Repo. So it does not -- we don't have any margin or collateral or one of the other aspects because this is one of the things, which is depressing the price of these securities, if you look at haircuts or margins. Rating triggers don't play a role too much there either. I think for us what is important in the end is still how is the underlying credit performing. And here is one of the interesting things because even if you take a category like NegAm, let's take two situations. The one is you keep the bonds and you have a 26% loss absorption still at hand. On the other hand you can sell it and then you lose 30% right now. One of the things indeed is that if you take that difference, 26% credit enhancement right now and the 30% loss if you sell it right now, the difference or if you add it up, it's 56% of credit losses, which you could still absorb. 56% of credit losses that is by the way the same as 80% house price declines and 70% delinquencies. So you try to look at this from an economic perspective and this is how we are making our evaluations. Then there is one other aspect and that is you could even say we are a forced buyer of mortgage-related product because in the US we are a thrift. So for us it's not a discretion that can completely get out of it because 50%, I think, of our assets need to be mortgaged-related assets anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Farooq Hanif of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I wondered if I could just pursue this question of loan loss provisions again from a different angle. Thank you very much for your patience, but you talked a lot about the actual provisions and the additions. In the corporate loan book, specifically but also everywhere. Are you seeing arrears going up? So have you yet seen loans past 90 &#x2013; past due 90 days going up, but especially, in the corporate loan book? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two, you talked about the peak in the resets in the Alt-A in particular sort of being 2010-2011, but presumably, you're going to have quite a big increase given the duration of your portfolio, quite a big increase next year too. If you could just give some sort of numbers on that, that will be useful?</p>
          <p>And the last point is when you compare the ING Direct mortgage book, the ARM -- hybrid ARM mortgage book with the sort of prime index in terms of portfolio losses to-date, surely there must be some differences in maturity between your book and the average index book? Because I know that, for example, in ING Direct in 2007 you had a gigantic increase in mortgage lending in the US. So I just wondered if actually you might trend towards -- more towards more of the kind of ARM index at next year and what the risk of that was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Farooq. I think let's -- first part -- let's look at the corporate loan book, if you as we like do we see 90 day plus delinquencies or anything signaling there which go -- which is going up then the answer is those signals we have not seen yet.</p>
          <p>At the same time, what we do see is our watch list, I mean, we have before something moves to a phase that you take provisions, things and in your watch list. And one of the things which drives your watch list is your internal ratings on certain counterparties. So there what you see is indeed a gradual increase of your watch list, but that has not materialized in sort of late payments at this moment.</p>
          <p>If I go back to the question that was on the graph of originated mortgages and the comparison of that with, for instance, our fixed rate and our ARMs prime, the graph, I showed I think there is a few comments to be made. Indeed, there is no exact comparison to be made, because fixed is fixed and ARMs are ARMs, but I have no prime equivalent. So in that sense the comparison falls short, but on the other hand also note that indeed our portfolio is relatively young. And that is why PDs are increasing. But at the same time we have witnessed over the last years with interest rates going down, a lot of refreshment in the fixed rate as well. So in that sense, it is not that the index is very old, but then again, I got to look at the precise constitution of the index and how much of the recent vintages are in there. But my assumption is that even in that index, you will have a quite a lot of fresh bonds as well given where the interest rates have gone to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've also had a question about the resets on the negative amortization portfolios. It takes between four to five years for most of these to reach their caps in negative amortization. And that's why we've said that peak is going to start in 2010-2011 and 2012 because the largest sales were in '06 and '07 from these. What we're seeing just beginning this year is some of the '04 sales and next year will be the '05 and there is a big question as to will the behavior of the '06 and '07 vintages be different from the earlier ones. And that's why there's such a wide range of views on this by really a wide range of people. We view we just have to watch and adjust as appropriately each quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I just also just follow up on that, I mean &#x2013; you talked about the downgrades in &#x2013; because of &#x2013; from rating agencies because of, again, model and approach changes in August 1st &#x2013; since August 1st. How much of this is going to affect you? You talked about how you &#x2013; you are not obviously looking directly at the ratings, because you want to understand the behavior of underlying credit. But how worried are you about this change of approach from S&amp;P and sort of pressure that comes from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in general -- I think the best what we can do right now is more follow the market and follow the market projections carefully. The first point is ratings as such indeed are for us not a trigger to buy or sell. I think what we find more interesting from the rating agencies is the different assessments on how the delinquencies are progressing. The difficultly you have right now indeed is that there is a wide variance around it and it is just what John indicated that we with the new '06 and '07 vintages you would like to see that they have a similar type of curve or shape as the previous vintages. This is something which is not known in the market, but I think in general what we do with our process of looking at these bonds, but also at impairing them is we try to follow the markets and the most recent objective evidence and we take it as of then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we also on our selection of our '06 and '07 securities, we have very high structural credit attachment points. We bought truly the super-senior elements of these and its really trying to project forward and think through three major factors, house price declines, the defaults that happen upon reset with negative amortization and then your loss given that default and how those all work together and that's &#x2013; there is a wide range in that I think. The comfort we take is we still have very high credit attachment points in these securities that we've selected.</p>

          <p>And one really, really final question and really apologies for taking up so much time. When you talk about the Wholesale back book having been depleted I mean that's where most of your releases have been coming from, so the 15 basis points this quarter and 17 in the quarter before. So are we basically unlikely to see major releases now? Sort of thinking about the very short term forecast?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are always some releases we find each quarter but you can see a general trend down across the board and it's hard to predict releases. It depends upon the health of the portfolios that come up.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Time for two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Holmes of Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, couple of questions, please, firstly on the capital. I wondered whether you could say whether the 15% diversification benefit which you currently include in the Group capital ratios is going to be fully recognized under Basel II and Solvency II. I mean basically the point I am trying to get at is do you think there is danger that this benefit maybe withdrawn at some time in the future?</p>
          <p>Second question is looking at your equity book, could you update us on what your policy is? Are you going to reduce it further or is it now at the right level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The diversification benefit is a Group benefit that we apply between the bank and insurance. We run the bank on Basel II with a balance sheet and ratios and capital. We run essentially our insurance company already on Solvency II type framework.  Of course we have to pay attention under Solvency I because that's still the current framework underway. But we not only &#x2013; we even publish numbers for you technically that are pretty close to Solvency II.</p>
          <p>When you take those two capitals together we have a framework on top with leverage at the group our target is 10% and that's we've used a conservative target. We've spoken with the rating agencies already about going to 15% and we would do that in regard to if we had a special acquisition we would want to get through or perhaps in very tough times. We'd be willing to go to 15% with the view that we would get that back down again to 10% over time. So we are going to stay at 15 through all the cycles. And the ratings agencies are comfortable with how we are managing this and with the diversification between bank and insurance but the Basel II framework would not apply and neither actually would the Solvency II. It's really a rating agency question at the group level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask John &#x2013; can I ask follow-up question on that. How do you sort of see this diversification benefit in the wider context because as I understand it, it's really only Benelux companies, financial services companies, bank, insurance that are receiving this benefit at the moment. If you look outside Benelux you don't -- I'm not aware that any other companies are receiving this benefit. I mean, how do you think this can be reconciled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sure. If you had a small insurance operation, part of a banking operation or other way around, it may be more inherent in how they do their calculations or part of it. We have a separate legal structure, bank and insurance as do a few of the Benelux companies and that's why we communicate the diversification this way. But you can see it even quarter-to-quarter as interest rates move up and down, it causes the bank to make money and insurance to make less as rates go down, for example. As rates go up the insurer has more capacity and that initially hurts the &#x2013; squeezes the bank a bit more, and so there is just a natural inherent between a banking business of the savings bank primarily and of a life insurance company. There is this natural diversification benefit and if you go back five or ten years in earnings you can actually see it on an ongoing basis. And this is the proof we give to the rating agencies along with highly sophisticated models that Koos works through and we have convinced them over time that this does make sense to some amount. Its not 30%, but clearly we believe it's at least 10 and we think it's the target number is 15. But we're going to run the company on a day-to-day more conservative level being at the 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fine, that's very clear. I'm not denying that there is diversification benefit. It's just that it doesn't seem to be a central policy either at rating agencies or indeed at the regulators on this issue and I mean there are other bank insurers in the world that do not appear to be applying a similar benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regulators regulate a bank or regulate an insurance entity, but the holding company on top is regulated only as a holding company of a bank or an insurance company. There is a different point of view on it. It's really the rating agencies and I think the quotes written on us by our rating agencies that rate us do refer to this diversification benefit and I think that is a clear proof of the pudding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think also that if you look -- I think we benefit for the very good structure that has been put in place at the creation of ING. And I think very few companies in the world have basically structured their business between insurance and banking like ING did and that has been clearly recognized by the authorities, and I think that's something to some extent &#x2013; I won't say unique, but I think very close to be unique what gives us a clear advantage -- competitive advantage compared to the others.</p>
          <p>I would like just to go back to the equity book. Let me first say that if you look historically, ING has always had a very large equity book and benefited from that book over the years quite strongly. At the same time, in the recent years, we have been &#x2013; and in that equity book there is basically two portions; one was basically the equity portion of the asset and liability management book of the various insurance companies. And second, a surplus which we called the strategic book. I think that but, in the past those two were basically comingled in one big book.</p>
          <p>I think what's -- what we have done most recently is basically differentiate between the ALM book which basically has been put down to the various insurance companies and kept the strategic book at the group level. Now at the same time, in both the ALM books of their various insurance companies and in the strategic book, first of all we've reduced structurally the overall amount in the past compared to a few years ago. And second, I think that we've managed this more actively in terms of &#x2013; basically work through the cyclically of the equity market by writing protection on our books both in the ALM books and the strategy books.</p>
          <p>So, I think at this point of time, we see that we are pretty well protected and I think the question is &#x2013; and the real question for me is let's keep protected until we need to but at some time we need also to reopen the positions to basically continue to get the benefits within the ALM book and to some extent although, less extended than in the past in the strategic book. So, I think that's where we are today, but we have to manage this pretty dynamically, which we do since a couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what would you say is the strategic part of the 11 billion that you've got the moment? Can you put a number on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, yes, Koos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you have is you have in the insurance company in the Netherlands for instance where we have the portfolio close to 5 billion. So that is the part, which fits that ALM profile. At the banking side, we have, I think it is in total 2.5 billion and that is the stakes, which we have in the company. So you can consider them strategic, but from a different prospective, we see these as strategic holdings, but not so much in ALM profile foreign insurance company. And so, those two, I would rate typically strategic. On the other part, if you look at wide definition of the credit -- of the equity side, we have strategically said that in the US portfolio, we like to see some increases in the private equity and in the alternative space and that is also a strategic element and Tom, I think it is in total or...</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from Carlo Ponfoort, of AEK. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Carlo Ponfoort from AEK. Three questions.</p>
          <p>My first question is on Retail Banking. In the press release you mentioned strong competition of savings puts a lot of pressure on interest margins. I want to know if it's mainly the Netherlands and Belgium what you are talking about or is it also in Poland?</p>
          <p>My second question is on the Alt-A book, if we are looking now we're already six weeks in the third quarter. Is there a trends that 18 billion Alt-A is further declining?</p>
          <p>And finally, my third question is on ING Direct, I must say the US was performing quite well, but on the other hand I see in Germany, quite a negative trend that's now continuing in past five quarters. Profit is already down 34% compared to the year and you see no real assets growth and so my questions is more in Germany going forward, the rate at the moment you are providing is 3.25% and of course competition is severe in the German market? That's all my questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, first of all on the savings market. Let me say that the competition for savings is a bit everywhere in the world and not only in the Netherlands and Belgium, and that we see that in any country, including Poland. But at the same time, I think in Poland it benefits us, because we are one of &#x2013; we have basically taken a pretty aggressive marketing stance in Poland, to basically grow our business. So, we are probably one of the major benefit &#x2013; beneficiary of this.</p>
          <p>In the Netherlands and Belgium, I think, we have introduced new products in the first quarter, and the second quarter to basically attract our customers and to increase our volumes. And I'm happy to say that our volumes are increasing at a nice speed, particularly most recently. So, I think, that that's good.</p>
          <p>I think that when turning to ING Direct, I think, first of all, I would like to say that we have always say that diversification of our business portfolio in ING Direct was a key ingredient of our strategy. And I think that history has proved us right in this, because we have seen in the past that the Europe had a very nice yield curve and basically was generating the profits when the US had a flat to negative yield curve and was little bit struggling. And now we see exactly the reverse, where the US has a very nice yield curve and is basically able to make a nice amount of money, nice profits when Europe is struggling a bit, because of the shape of the curve. So, no, of course, I think that in Europe despite this curve, there is a lot of competition for savings.</p>
          <p>In Germany is also a country in which there is a lot of competition, but there also we are seen by most people as a very competitive and we are basically putting our pricing in a very competitive range. We are also introducing different pricing strategies to respond to a certain demand of customers. We are also introducing new products like the payment accounts and that basically attracts more customers.</p>
          <p>So I think that -- I think we are always balancing here the overall profit of ING Direct as a whole, our competitiveness long-term in those markets, the attractiveness for customers and I think the diversification model works. So we should be happy and I hope that maybe that the yield curve will reopen slightly in Europe in the coming year and that should give us some additional breathing space. So I think that's basically where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the &#x2013; it's Koos. On the Alt-A section there are further deteriorations. Let me answer that in three parts. One is if you look at values. So do we see further deteriorations? One of the things is, clearly, over the month of July there is witnessed a decline in values of Alt-A securities. Overall, you can say anything what is private label, at this moment is declining in value and that is the factor which I mentioned and that is the fact that indeed there is at the moment no natural holders of paper, because nobody can easily finance it. So liquidity plays a role.</p>
          <p>But then one other factor that plays a role and that is credit as well. And if you look at credits, what I hinted to you in the presentation is underlying pool performance you do see a deterioration. Now part of it is expected because there is normal with the aging and it's also if you look at credit enhancement that is something what you can absorb.</p>
          <p>But that brings to the third part and that is more the outlook. I think what we just received from S&amp;P is refreshed outlook, so based on current pool deteriorations you see raters creating new scenarios, which basically have doubled the amount of expected losses ultimately in the portfolio. So in that sense, you try to run your portfolio against the most fresh scenarios, which you have seen and that is where you live with and that is where you base your calculations on. So I think an element of future deterioration is what is embedded in the scenarios, which I see right now with S&amp;P.</p>
