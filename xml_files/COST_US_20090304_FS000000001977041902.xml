          <p>Good morning. My name is Chastity and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Second Quarter Earnings and Sales Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chastity, and good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our second quarter fiscal 2009 operating results for the 12 weeks that ended this past February 15th and our four weeks February sales results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 1st.</p>
          <p>As with every call, let me start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, our 12-week second quarter fiscal 2009 operating results for the quarter, earnings per share came in at $0.55, down 26% from last year's Q2 EPS of $0.74. This compares to current First Call consensus of $0.59 which, needless to say, has come down over the past several weeks, from the low to mid 70s to its current level of $0.59 as a result, I believe, mostly related to our February 4th announcement that Q2 earnings would be substantially below where First Call was at that time.</p>
          <p>As outlined in this morning's release, this year's second quarter earnings results are a result of several factors, virtually all of which negatively impacted our results for the quarter. These include several factors impacting gross margin, which I'll go through in a few minutes, a negative swing in our year-over-year gas profits in Q2 by about $0.04 a share, FX headwinds as I mentioned in the first quarter when the U.S. dollar strengthened.</p>
          <p>Our foreign earnings results, when converted and reported in U.S. dollars, this hurt us in the second quarter by about $27 million or about $0.04 a share, pre-tax the 27. That is assuming FX exchange rates were flat year-over-year our foreign operating results in Q2 would have been higher by this amount.</p>
          <p>Additionally, while sales trends during the quarter showed some improvement in January, February as compared to December, the all-important month of December with larger sales levels and increased penetration of bigger ticket non-food items was the weakest of the three four-week periods.</p>
          <p>And these weaker sales results, of course, were despite the aggressive pricing we did early in the fiscal quarter to drive sales. We believe that, that aggressive pricing roughly estimated is somewhere in the 3 to $0.04 a share range.</p>
          <p>Also, while our inventories came out of the holidays quite clean, we incurred higher seasonal markdowns year-over-year in Q2, roughly an estimated $0.03 a share.</p>
          <p>LIFO was actually a penny a share pickup in the quarter, about 7 million pre-tax. I'll talk about that later. And lastly on the expense side, we actually did fairly well controlling expenses given the sales weakness, although our costs for employee healthcare were up a little this quarter despite a small offset to that.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the 12-week quarter, reported total sales came in at minus 1% and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was reported at a minus 3%. For the quarter, both total sales and comp sales were significantly impacted by both gasoline price deflation, and by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>On a comp sales basis, the minus 1% comp sales decline that was reported, if you exclude gasoline deflation, would have been plus 4%, so quite a big swing there because of the price of gas is so much lower.</p>
          <p>And total company comps, again, reported at minus 3% for the quarter. If you exclude both the gas deflation at our gas stations and exclude the FX changes that we've seen of recent, so on a local currency basis, if you will, that minus 3% reported would have been a plus 5 for the company overall.</p>
          <p>And in terms of sales for the four-week month of February, it's similar to the quarter in terms of the impact of these factors, excluding gasoline deflation, the 0% reported U.S. comp would be plus 4. And excluding gas and the impact of the FX changes, February's total company reported comp of minus 3% would have been plus 5.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest this morning, our opening activities and plans. After opening eight new locations in the first quarter, seven net of one closing in Las Vegas, we opened a new Las Vegas location and then spent a few months converting that one into new Costco Business Center which we just opened in the first few weeks of Q3 here.</p>
          <p>So, a net of seven locations in the first quarter of this fiscal year, since Q2 end on February 15 -- we opened nothing in Q2. But since Q2 end on February 15, we've opened three new locations. New Costco warehouses in Lakewood, California and in Honolulu, Hawaii. And as I mentioned, our new business center in Las Vegas that being our seventh Costco Business Center. We now operate 553 locations around the world, and that includes the 31 in Mexico, the only ones which we don't consolidate all the results into our numbers.</p>
          <p>Also this morning, I'll review with you our online results, membership trends, additional discussion about margins in Q2 and trends, our balance sheet of course and with that I'll go down the income statement here.</p>
          <p>In terms of our quarterly results, as I mentioned, sales for the quarter, 12 weeks ended February 15 were 16.5 billion, down just under minus 1% from last year's Q2 of 16.6 billion.</p>
          <p>On a reported comp basis, Q2 comps, as I mentioned, were down 3%. The minus 3% reported comp figure for the quarter was comprised of a minus four in December, a minus two in January and a minus three in February. The minus three comp was, of course, negatively impacted, as I mentioned, due to the strengthening U.S. dollar which was about a little over 4 percentage points of impact on the company.</p>
          <p>Our international comps, as you saw in the press release, in local currency, were actually up 8%. But once converted into U.S. dollars, given the dollar strength in the past several months, were reported at minus 11. So a big swing there. And gasoline deflation, as I again mentioned, had a big impact such that the minus 1% comp would have been a plus four.</p>
          <p>In terms of the minus 3% comp for the quarter, we always break that down into the  -- of course, the comp is the product of average transaction size and average frequency. The average transaction decrease -- as compared to that -- to get that minus 3 comp for the quarter, included an average transaction decrease of minus seven for the quarter and it bounced around six to eight in each of the three months, a seven in December, a minus six in January and a minus eight in February, pretty much a seven average. And the average frequency increase of almost plus 5% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>I might add that the frequency trend during the quarter past three months continued to improve. As many of you know for the years that you have followed us, our historical frequency trends tended to be generally in the 0 to 2% range, pretty small range there. Over the summer we saw it improve somewhat, I think in part because of a lot of press we got on gasoline prices, as prices were spiking and the value proposition, of course.</p>
          <p>During the past three months, we saw December, January and February frequency being in the mid 3s, in December, around four in January and a little over 5% in February. So while our members are buying a little less each visit, they're coming in more frequently and as I think you will see in a moment, continue to be quite loyal in terms of renewal.</p>
          <p>Included in the average transaction decrease of minus seven, again it gets convoluted because of the weak FX and the gasoline deflation, FX being again a little over 4 percentage points of negative to that minus 7 and gas deflation being about minus 3%.</p>
          <p>So as you can see the average transaction ex those two things was pretty darn close to zero.</p>
          <p>In terms of cannibalization, not a big impact in Q2 or in Q1 as we've opened as you know in the low 20s in terms of number of units in the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>For the February reporting month, much like the quarterly comps, a minus 3% reporting comps were a combination of an average transaction decease of minus 8, which includes of course the FX impact of a little over 4% and the gasoline deflation impact of around 3%. I might add that in terms of gas year-over-year, the average sales price per gallon in each of the second quarters was down 41% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>And again as I mentioned, we had a great frequency in February of plus a little over 5%.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales by geography, not a lot has changed. California, which we have seen going back several months ago at the beginning of this economic downturn, during the summer we saw a little bit of an increased spread in terms of &#x2013; as things were softening, it was softening a little more there, as that gap of California relative to the rest of U.S. for us had come back a little bit closer to normal.</p>
          <p>And even in California, again if you look in terms of traffic or frequency comps in California, in Q1, all of California was a shade under zero, about 0.5% minus, and in Q2 around 3% positive. So again we're seeing &#x2013; the frequency is not the issue, we're getting people in. They're just buying a lot more food and sundries and fewer bigger ticket items of course.</p>
          <p>Internationally, again, showing pretty good results in the quarter while international, expressed in U.S. dollars, was in the minus teens both for the quarter and the month of February. In local currencies they were in the high single and low double digits, and for the quarter in the mid to high single digits in the month of February itself. So again internationally, despite economic turmoil plenty of places around the world we're seeing some very good results in local currencies there.</p>
          <p>In terms of categories &#x2013; our merchandise categories for the quarter, it's still the story of the haves and the have-nots. Food and sundries and health and beauty aids and fresh foods continue to be positive. But again generally non-foods, hard lines and soft lines overall are in the have-not category although there is few shining lights within that.</p>
          <p>Within food and sundries, for the quarter, tobacco continued to be a little bit negative. That may reverse itself with an upcoming increase in price simply related to our upcoming federal floor tax on tobacco of I believe $6.5 a carton in April.</p>
          <p>Other than tobacco, all the other sub-categories were up year-over-year with dry groceries and canned goods being the strongest in the low double digits and other strengths in the mid to high singles in frozen and refrigerated goods.</p>
          <p>We've seen increasing shift, I might add, within some of our private label. As you know for those who have followed us, we've seen private label sales penetration company wide go from below 10% several years ago to the high teens over the last couple of years and continue to increase 0.5 to 1% a year it seems.</p>
          <p>On the food and sundry side of our business we've seen in the last six months about a 300 basis point spike in penetration, and talking to Tim Rose, our head of Foods &amp; Sundries, a lot of that has to do &#x2013; his feeling is a lot of that has to do with the fact that in this economy, despite many items that have great brand loyalty and are great quality, KS items, Kirkland Signature items, have continued to show increased penetration on that side.</p>
          <p>Within the 2% hard lines, minus 2% hard lines comp, not a whole lot very thrilling, actually not a bad number overall. Stronger sub categories, tires and automotive, we also include health and beauty aids in our hard lines although that's &#x2013; I view that more as food and sundries and the like in terms of when we talk about the haves and have-nots.</p>
          <p>Again, we continue to see some unusual things within majors which was just below flat for the quarter and month, TV unit sales just in February were up over 50%, dollars up just barely over 0%. In other words, big price point changes downward in those products.</p>
          <p>We have been quite opportunistic in that area as you know over the last several months and provided great value to our members.</p>
          <p>Other areas as we lead into the spring season that we see weakness in -- we expect to continue to see weakness in things like garden and barbeques and patios and the like again, bigger ticket, non-food items.</p>
          <p>Within soft lines comps, again negative, not a whole lot thrilling, generally everything is in the high singles negative to low 20s negative. The one stand-out is small electric, surprisingly, which is a category within there. That was slightly positive for the quarter and quite positive in the month. Just anecdotally looking at the items, things like coffee makers and food savers and toaster ovens are up again 30 to 60% in many cases. In some cases related to some of the mailers that we are doing with the coupons.</p>
          <p>Fresh foods, like food and sundries is positive in the mid singles, bakery being a little bit of more of a standout on the positive side than the other categories, but nonetheless, all of them positive.</p>
          <p>Moving down the income statement line in Q2, in terms of dollars, membership fees were up 4% or 10 basis points. That was a $13 million increase to 355 million or 2.16% of sales. That 10 basis point increase is again a little deceiving in the sense that while it is up as a percent of sales. And again the gas deflation alone, if you just assumed flat gas prices year-over-year, I think a more correct way to look at that would be it would have been up 3 basis points. So, again a good showing, given the economy and we're certainly gratified by the ongoing improvement in these numbers.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong renewal rates and continued increasing penetration of the $100 a year Executive Membership. And due to no new openings this year in the quarter compared to seven new openings in last year's second quarter, while our new membership sign-ups in Q2 were down a bit, about 7% year-over-year, much of that negative variance relates to last year's Q2 opening of seven new locations comparing &#x2013; again compared to none this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of number of members at Q2 end, we stood at 20.7 million Gold Star at the end of the quarter compared to 20.5 million at the end of the first quarter and 20.2 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. Primary business at 5.7, up from 5.6, grounded at Q1 and year end, business add-on continues at 3.4. Recognizing what you see is -- partly is these add-ons want to become executive members. In many cases, they are being converted into their own primary membership.</p>
          <p>But all told, total member households 29.8 million at Q2 end, up from 29.6 at Q1 end and 29.2 at year end. At February 15, Q2 end, our paid Executive Members continues to grow, little over 8.2 million, an increase of about 175,000 since Q1, entered about 15,000 a week. That level of increase, a little lower than in recent quarters, but again I think that's pretty good, given no new openings in Q2 this year.</p>
          <p>We also have seen a little bit of a pickup in when we sign-up new members in terms of how many are signing up immediately as an Executive Member, if you talked to our Marketing Department, they would suggest that a lot of that has to do with better marketing initiatives in place. We got a little better at doing that.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership renewal rates, they continue strong, essentially at our all time high at the end of Q2 &#x2013; at the end of Q1 '09 I had mentioned that the business renewal rate was 91.9. For the end of Q2 that was 90.22, so it showed a little bit of improvement there. Certainly on the Gold Star side 85.7 at the end of Q1, 86.1 at the end of Q2. So we are still I believe in 87, but very close to 87.5, and we are certainly gratified in this economy that we see this level of member loyalty and renewal.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin came down on a reported basis, 31 basis points from 10.73 last year to 10.42. Again well jot down a few numbers here and then I'll walk you through them. The line items would be core merchandising, second line item, ancillary businesses, third line item, 2% reward, fourth line item, LIFO and other fifth line item would be other and then total of course.</p>
          <p>In terms of trends, just looking at the last three quarters, Q4 '08, Q1 '09 and Q2 '09, on the core minus 19 basis points in Q4 '08, year-over-year, minus 13 in Q1, as compared to its prior first quarter a year earlier and in Q1 minus 7. Ancillary, plus 6, minus 46 &#x2013; I am sorry, minus 6, plus 46 and minus 19 basis points. 2% reward, minus 2, minus 2 and minus 9. LIFO, minus 14, plus 1 and plus 4. Other, minus 4, 0 and 0. Which would give you total of Q4 '08 we reported gross margins year-over-year down 45 basis points, in Q1 up 32 and in Q2 minus 31.</p>
          <p>As you can see our overall margin again was down 31 basis points. But the 7 basis -- I'll start with the core merchandise. The minus 7 basis points year-over-year core merchandise results appears a little better than reality because it results in large part from lower sales penetration this quarter of the lowest margin gasoline business.</p>
          <p>Our gas business &#x2013; whereas it represented 8% of sales in Q2 of '08 last year, this year represented 5% of Q2 09 sales, and again with the price per gallon down 41% that's certainly evident. That's the sales penetration of our core merchandise business that was up year-over-year, so our gross margins of this core business which is food and sundries, hard lines, soft lines and fresh foods were reported in this matrix to be down 7 basis points, it was actually on like sales, those departments margin over &#x2013; divided by those departments sales it was actually down 57 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our largest merchandise department, food and sundries, was down year-over-year by nearly 70, in large part due to some of the investment pricing that we mentioned in the press &#x2013; both February 4 and today's press release about the investment in pricing on select commodity items.</p>
          <p>One last comment on sales and margins results, deflation of basic products we are seeing &#x2013; we have seen it. We saw a little bit Q1 and certainly into Q2. Sales are &#x2013; we are seeing that in our sales, despite the fact that sales have reported pretty well. We are seeing that deflation and margin dollars are being impacted by it as well &#x2013; by that as well, so that's part of the issue in Q2.</p>
          <p>Examples of recent price declines across the board on commodity items: milk and eggs in the minus 10% to 15% range items like trash bags in the minus 25 to 35% range, nuts in the minus 5% range. So, again a lot of commodity prices coming down and we expect to continue to see that for a little bit.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook going forward, overall again we'll have to see each quarter, keep in mind we'll work foremost to drive top-line sales which may sometimes require some sacrifice of gross margin. I think we saw some of that in late November in Q1 and in early December in Q2 as I described a little bit to some of you.</p>
          <p>This is the kind of the perfect storm driving, insisted on driving sales, as well as taking advantage of the underlying price declines that we knew would come in some of the products as commodity prices were falling and really getting out there in front of that to be a bit more competitive and we would hope that some of the increased frequency is a product of that.</p>
          <p>The impacts from the increasing Executive Membership that was a little unusual in Q2 in the last several quarters, it had been an impact on margin of minus 2 or 3 basis points which would imply an increase in sales penetration to Executive Members of one or two percentage points given they get a 2% reward. What the minus nine implies is that it's a little over a 4% sales penetration. Now, we believe this is a good thing that reflects increasing sales penetration to our most loyal members.</p>
          <p>LIFO, as you recall, it was a small credit or income in Q1 of $2.2 billion pre-tax and about $7 million credit to Q2. This reflects again the same deflationary trends that should continue into Q3 and possibly beyond, we'll have to see. We should point out that the moderate LIFO benefit recorded in Qs 1 and 2, exclude the effect of gas deflation that has occurred since the beginning of the year, because we just are not confident that gas prices will stay this low and certainly don't know when they will turn.</p>
          <p>If gas prices continue to be as low as compared to the prior year, we might realize some additional positive LIFO adjustments in the upcoming two quarters. One offset we're aware of as I mentioned this $6.5 a carton floor tax on tobacco, the cartons of tobacco in the U.S. that of course will increase the cost of tobacco. In many ways that may be very much an offset to any LIFO credits we get on gas. Again it is LIFO, non-cash, but nonetheless something that will impact the reported EPS.</p>
          <p>Moving down to SG&amp;A, our SG&amp;A percentage Q2 over Q2 was higher by 39 basis points coming in at 10.11 compared to a 9.72 as a percent of sales last year in the quarter. Again quickly to jot down a few numbers, the line items are: operations; second line item is central; third, equity which is stock options in our issues; fourth is quarterly adjustments; and fifth, would be total.</p>
          <p>Again looking at three columns Q4 '08, Q1 '09, and Q2 '09. Going across operations was plus 21 in Q4 '08 meaning lower by 21 basis points, plus is good, Q1 '09 minus 16 and Q2 '09 minus 34; central plus three, minus three and minus four; equity related charges minus 3,0 and minus one; quarterly adjustments, minus six, minus 12 and zero. It's for a total of a plus 15 in Q4 '08 year-over-year and minus 31 in Q1 '09, and a minus 39 in Q2 '09.</p>
          <p>A little editorial on these numbers, again it shows operations was higher SG&amp;A by 34 basis points, but again, this is mostly related to sales levels. And just like gross margin percentage, where it helped us, correspondingly impacts negatively reported SG&amp;A, and a minus 34, about 21 basis points of that 34 basis points relates to the sales deflation, gasoline deflation.</p>
          <p>Our central expense was higher year-over-year in Q2 by 4 basis points as you can see in this chart, again the same story as it relates to sales. I will tell you that while we haven't had any lay-offs in central or our regional offices, which totaled about 8,000 people of our 140,000, we have instituted a hiring freeze about two months ago. And that remains in effect for the time being.</p>
          <p>We do, at the warehouses of course, after every seasonal and Christmas, have seasonal, what we call seasonal lay-offs. In some cases, we dug a little deeper there, but I believe that the most extreme examples that we -- people who were laid off were part-timers that had a tenure of less than six months with the company, and will be the first to be hired back should they want to be hired back, and usually that takes a few months.</p>
          <p>So overall we're very pleased with the fact that our sales have remained there in the positive direction in these last few months. And, we were able to withstand the fate of many companies out there as it relates to hiring and lay-offs.</p>
          <p>Stock compensation expense, not a big deal there. Again, I think the actual expense has come down a shade because of the lower stock price. But, up a little bit as a percent of sales simply because of the lower sales results.</p>
          <p>Benefits; overall our benefits in Q2, our benefits percentage was higher by 9 basis points. Again, dollars increased about 4% on healthcare, but just below flat sales. Again, the more we can get sales driving and it will flavor up with roughly the same type of healthcare costs, so that will be good. Overall, not a bad SG&amp;A performance given the sales levels and given gasoline deflation.</p>
          <p>Next, on the income statement, pre-opening expense, last year, 9.7 million or 6 basis points, this year, 7.3 million or 4 basis points. So 2.4 million lower, and 2 basis points better. Of course, last year we had seven openings, this year none. But again, it's the timing of openings. We incur our pre-opening expense in some cases, several months before the actual opening. And in addition, we had some opening just after the quarter as well. No real surprises in those numbers.</p>
          <p>In terms of provision for impaired assets and closing costs in Q2 '08 last year, we actually had income on this line of $2.9 million, basically about $0.5 million of impaired expense, closing cost expense offset &#x2013; more than offset by a $3.4 million pre-tax gain on a property sale. So all told, operating income, Q2, '09 was down 21% year-over-year from 504 million last year to 399 million this year, or a decrease of 105 million.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line; reported interest expense was slightly higher year-over-year. Q2 coming in at $25 million, up about 1.5 million from 23.5 million in last year's Q2. These amounts mainly reflect the interest expense on our $2 billion debt offering we did in February of '07. The reason that the net interest expense is actually down or improved by 2 million has mostly to do with the offset to interest expense, which is part of this line item, capitalized interest. That was actually lower year-over-year by $1.6 million.</p>
          <p>Now, interest income and other was lower year-over-year by 33 million in the quarter, coming in at 7.8 million this year compared to 40.6 million last year in Q2. Just under two-thirds of the lower income figure was lower interest income due to significantly lower interest rates being realized on our investments, and a little bit of that lower, most of it is just year-over-year market changes in interest rates. A little bit of it is changes in the composition of our cash related investments to safer government backed type securities like government money market funds.</p>
          <p>Another big chunk of this delta was the reporting of our half of Mexico's earnings on the equity method on this line, where given that the peso was gone from roughly 10 pesos to the dollar several months ago to about 15 pesos to the dollar today. So again, on reported U.S. dollars on this line that has an impact there as well.</p>
          <p>Overall, pre-tax earnings were down 27% from 521.5 million last year to 381.9 million this year. Our tax rates were pretty much the same year-over-year, 37.2% last year &#x2013; this year and 37.1% last year. So, no real change year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Quick rundown of the balance sheet, 3.282 billion cash and equivalents, inventories of 4.995 billion, other current of 1.414 billion, total current of 9.691 billion, net fixed assets of 10.354 billion, other assets of 692, and total assets of 20.737 billion.</p>
          <p>On the right side, the short-term debt of 173, accounts payable exactly at 5 billion, other current 3.825 billion, total current liabilities 8.998 billion, long-term debt of 2.198 million, deferred and other of 332, for total liabilities of 11.528 billion, minority interest of 88, stockholders' equity of 9.121 billion for a total of 20.737 billion. Some of you ask each time for the depreciation and amortization, which of course will appear ultimately on our cash flow statement when we issue the 10-Q. But for the quarter, depreciation and amortization was 160.9 million and year-to-date 315.7 million.</p>
          <p>In terms of our balance sheet, strong balance sheet: debt-to-cap of 21%, and in terms of accounts payable ratio if you just take the numbers, the accounts payable divided by inventories, or inventories divided by accounts payable -- I'm sorry, accounts payable divided by inventories this year was at 100%, down ever so slightly from 102% a year ago. That includes quite a bit of construction payables for our new openings. So if you take and look at just merchandise payables a year ago it was 84%, this year 83%.</p>
          <p>In terms of average inventories per warehouse, last year in Q2 it was 10.45 million. This year it was 9.625 million, so an 8% reduction or $825,000. Now again, FX is part of that, about 475,000, or over half of that $825,000 reduction is the strong U.S. dollar. So when we convert foreign inventories into U.S. dollar inventories &#x2013; foreign currency inventories into U.S. dollar inventories, we see that's lower there, so &#x2013; but even taking that out we had about $350,000 year-over-year decrease.</p>
          <p>It's spread among many of the departments, the largest chunk is in majors, some of that we believe is simply again price deflation on many of those items, so cost deflation as well. No inventory concerns, we feel we did a good job of taking the markdowns early and reducing commitments on certain seasonal items. We continue to see that as we get into the post-Christmas season, the spring season here and things like patio furniture, barbecue grills. We've -- like many retailers out there who are conservative and have the ability to cancel a little bit along the way. So, hopefully we'll be able to manage our markdowns there, we'll have to see.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, in Q2 we spent 339 million last year in the quarter. In Q2 this year we spent 289 million. Based on where we think we'll come out for the year of 21 net new units, including one in Mexico, we'll be probably right around the 1.5 billion range, shade lower than our original plans for the year but nonetheless, a pretty substantial amount.</p>
          <p>Now I get a lot of questions about real estate, what's going on with prices and availability. Availability is going up, and prices are coming down but I need to say they never come down as quick as you want them to. We are talking with property owners and developers who previously would not even talk to us.</p>
          <p>In some cases, short-term, where deals haven't been started yet, to the extent that the developers got into some financial trouble or and the banks have taken over a couple of the projects we had ongoing, it may even delay it a few months where we're &#x2013; things are sorting out. I think long term this economic downturn and what it's doing to the commercial real estate market is probably a net positive for us over the next 3 to 5 years in terms of giving us more availability of better sites at perhaps and hopefully a little better price.</p>
          <p>In term of Costco Online, both Costco.com and Costco.ca in Canada, very profitable business, last year did 1.7 billion. It too, as you would expect, has been impacted this year by the economy and certainly given our &#x2013; the nature of our focus, many of our items are big ticket discretionary items like electronics, like home furnishings, like jewelry and the like. In Q1 sales were up slightly, but recall September for us was pretty strong, and October and November when our sales started to come down a little bit.</p>
          <p>In Q2 sales were down slightly in the mid-single digits, again I believe a reflection of penetration of these bigger ticket discretionary items. We've seen our average ticket on Costco.com go from the low $400 range to the high $300 range. Our e-commerce as I mentioned the business is very profitable. And the sales have been below plan as you might expect. That being said it's a good business for us, and we'll continue to capitalize and grow it going forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion, as I mentioned, in Q1 we opened eight new locations and closed one. That was really the closing of the &#x2013; our original Las Vegas location which we have since, in early Q3 here, reopened as a Costco Business Center, but so a net of seven openings in Q1, no openings in Q2. We plan five new openings in Q3, and eight new openings in Q4 which would give us 21 openings, less the one relo, so 20 net openings, in addition one in Mexico, so 21 for our company.</p>
          <p>If you look at the 21 on our starting base of 543 at the beginning of the year it's about 4% unit growth and perhaps a little over 4, 4.5% square footage growth. At Q2 end our total square footage, for those of you who keep close tabs, 73.7 million square feet.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in terms of stock repurchases, as you know that we began repurchase of stock back in June of '05. We purchased through this past September just under 89 million shares for about $4.8 billion. We still have repurchase authorization under our Board authorized program of about $2 billion. We currently are not in the market and we have not been as I mentioned since last early fall. We are prepared to be in the market as conditions warrant and we'll let you know when we are.</p>
          <p>As mentioned on our February 4th press release and conference call, given the volatility and uncertainty we aren't providing guidance for the quarter and the year, but hopefully give you some insight into how we've done in the quarter and what we look forward -- what we see going forward.</p>
          <p>Lastly I'll mention that we have supplemental information including balance sheet and quarterly LIFO charges and opening schedules in our Q&amp;A that we put on our Investor Relations site later this morning.</p>
          <p>With that let me turn it back for questions and answers to Chastity. And I will be happy to answer to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard, good morning everybody. Can you -- when you look at the second quarter, the 57 basis points of core margin erosion. I know you're not going to give us a back half EPS view but for terms of modeling purposes, do you think that's a good proxy or do you think it could be a little bit better?</p>
          <p>And then also on the &#x2013; I think you walked through all the components except the 19 basis points of ancillary margin compression in the quarter, could you just kind of flesh that out for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would hope that the &#x2013; the minus 57 was better, recognizing it includes seasonal markdowns which were higher than planned, but for a good reason to do. It included that "Aggressive pricing" which as I &#x2013; I don't know if I mentioned on this call, but when we did that, as you'll recall we did a little bit of that at the end of Q1 as well in November.</p>
          <p>What we did is &#x2013; comps were starting to weaken, we felt very strongly we wanted to drive sales in the right direction. We saw commodity prices starting to come down and knew that it was a matter of weeks not months where many of the underlying procurement costs would come down. We did what we're good at. We tried to drive sales and ate some of that margin. So given that you never know what's going to happen tomorrow in terms of sales, I think as I mentioned, we're prepared to sacrifice margin if comps are going in the wrong direction. At least in the last couple of months they've been going in the right direction, so based on that, I would hope that it's a little better than that. Again, we'll have wait and see each quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the ancillary business margin down 19%, that is basically gas -- that could be up or down. Our underlying margins in the various ancillary businesses &#x2013; photo, one-hour photo is probably the weakest as people, even though we're getting a lot of business and a lot of specialty printing with the books and all of the things you can do online and then come pick up at Costco, for the most part, you know, people are storing more things on their computer and not printing out much copies until they want print out what they want. So that's a business that's a challenge in the industry.</p>
          <p>The pharmacy is, despite its challenges with $4 prescriptions and Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare Part D and everything else going on out there, we seem to be doing pretty well in pharmacy.</p>
          <p>Food court is strong. We've cycled, I think it was a year ago we were anecdotally talking about holding prices despite huge increases in things like cheese. I think one of the national pizza chains actually had a cheese surcharge &#x2013; price surcharge for a period of time back then, but that has reversed itself now with the procurement costs and within the food court we see strength in take home items like the full cooked pizza which is quite strong right now, again I think the fact that people are eating out less and eating in more at home.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then just moving down the P&amp;L, historically I think you have said roughly a 4 to 5 hurdle rate. You know, with your traffic up north of 5% and food becoming a bigger piece of the mix, is it costing more for you guys to generate each sales dollar or in other words, less dollars falling to the bottom line for every sales dollar you generate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have a couple of things going on right now that does &#x2013; I look at even our health care costs which again in real dollars are up 4% notwithstanding no layoffs. To the extent that we've cut hours back of a few people, we're still paying 100% of their healthcare even they're working 70 or 80 or 90% of the hours they used to work, so that has an impact there short term, hopefully short term.</p>
          <p>Also, some of the deflationary nature, I mean anecdotally we sold almost 60% more television units for a 2% increase in price. Our margins, our percentage is fine, but we're seeing more labor involved in getting those dollar sales. And then if you look at some the discretionary pressures on, I looked at one that, again, it's a more extreme example, but something like garbage bags which in the last couple of months the price point has come down over 30%. Units are up 5 or 10 which is good, but dollars are, which means dollars are down less than 30% but we're not making all that margin back. So again, as you certainly know, we're also figuring out how to drive bigger sizes of items and we continue to do that to help offset that.</p>
          <p>But those are the things that I think make it a little less predictive of saying if I give you comp, underlying comp &#x2013; if you give me underlying comp, I can give you what the SG&amp;A is going to go up or down. We feel pretty good about controlling our expenses, recognizing that we're getting a little benefit also from some of the packaging changes which in part is the greening of manufacturing but some of the square boxes I talked about instead of round containers, better more tight packaging on paper products with new technologies by the manufacturers. All of those things lower freight, lower handling expense. So on a very small basis it's helping in margin and SG&amp;A or offsetting some of the other things that are hurting it.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I appreciate the comments on the garbage bags, etc. but if you look at the products where you proactively went lower on margin, how was the price elasticity on some of those categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, honestly, we don't look at it and then determine we won't do it again because we only got a 5% bump in units when we thought we might have gotten a 10. What we try to do and I look at it more as we run our business, when we saw the underlying U.S. comp go from a 5 in September to a 2 &#x2013; this is without gas. 5 in September to a 2 in October to a one in  November, we're saying, hey, we're going to &#x2013; and knowing that there were several commodity items that were going to come down in price in the weeks to come, let's be proactive and take them down fast. If it costs us 10 or 20 or $30 million, we're going to do it.</p>
          <p>That's us, guys, and so we are less concerned &#x2013; we know it &#x2013; we believe it helped. We see our frequency up when our brethren out there are not seeing these types of numbers and we are going to do that from time to time as we see fit. I think Jim has talked about in the past, though we are a for profit company and we are trying to go in that direction. We feel we are being better served and our shareholders will be better served as we come out of this economy maybe a couple of years from now, maybe a year from now, because of the things we're doing right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you look at how you effected those discounts, was it done with couponing or was it done with in-store signage? How did you show that to the consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mostly just lowered the price. We are not big at putting out bright yellow signs saying, "New lower price." We don't do that, but on the kind of commodity items that we're talking about: milk, cheese, butter, chicken &#x2013; our customer gets it. The couponing, like the multi-vendor mailers that we do, generally those are negotiated with manufacturers where a lot of those costs, other than perhaps the private label items which are both across the manufacturer and us, those are the types of things that we'll &#x2013; that we negotiate and the vendor pays for a lot of that but just lowering prices is where we do it.</p>
          <p>They get it. Sales are &#x2013; I hate to use the chicken example again but on an item that we are selling almost a 1 million a week of, that chicken, a million units a week, we went down from 5.99 back to 4.99 about 8 or 10 weeks in advance of the underlying cost to us coming down. Our margins in chicken from three months ago, they went down by half and they've nearly doubled going into the next month, back to a healthy margin.</p>
          <p>So again, I am sure somebody can show us that if we had not lowered it we might have actually made this month a little extra dollars but when you see the type of frequency and member loyalty we have and the underlying sales growth, we think that's the right thing to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. Just following up on the margin, just share your outlook in terms of deflation and procurement costs, and it sounds like much like we saw this past quarter, we should expect ongoing investment in price. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I hate to use the word, but I think it was a little bit of a perfect storm if you look back at November. Again, we're looking at comps going from five to three to two to one. We're looking at commodity costs starting to really come down a lot, knowing that it's a matter of weeks not many months before the costs to us are going to come down.</p>
          <p>And, that's a little different than now, where &#x2013; yes, there's continued price deflation and we'll take that. But we don't necessarily have to always take it eight weeks in advance; particularly, when we see comps going in the right direction here. So I think that's a little &#x2013; I think that's a little bit different painted picture there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you got ahead of it, I guess last quarter and now perhaps...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ahead of it, maybe there is still a little of it, but not as much back in late November and December. Keep in mind, we're not the only ones out there pressuring manufacturers. So on the one hand, you read in the paper that some very large, very great consumer products companies are talking about increased prices sticking, and I think you could think that there is more than just Costco out there that can say; oh, yeah?</p>
          <p>And we're out there everyday and Jim and Craig here are putting the pressure on the buyers to go out and get it. We have a unique position in a sense also that we don't have to carry three brands. And, we can choose between brands that are going to be more aggressive and help us, help our member. So I think it doesn't happen overnight. We respect the fact that for years, there was probably some pent up demand for some price increases as the retailers could push back hard during those periods of small inflation.</p>
          <p>But there's some big inflation here that had come last year, and when &#x2013; and every time when it was explained to us, it's because resin prices went up this, and electricity costs went up that, and feed prices and grain prices went up x, y and z. We know what those prices are now, and we're going back for it. So I think you'll see both. And, again the manufacturers will have to choose what they want to do also. But, we think that there is some opportunity for the manufacturers to help our members as well here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then shifting to private level, big spike up in that penetration, about 300 basis point spike, help us understand there the margin opportunity. Are you seeing, have you been as aggressive on private label? One would assume given that penetration is &#x2013; how helpful has that been in terms of offsetting margin? Does that represent as healthy of a margin as we once saw?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; certainly the private label margins tend to be better, but this is not the extreme example of replacing some branded sales where it was a commodity football item out there that was always selling at 5 to 8 % and we've replaced it with a $0.75 price point, at a 20 to 25% lower price at twice the margin percent, so at more margin dollars per unit.</p>
          <p>Some of it is more that I think while it will continue to help margins as it plays out over the next year, what we've seen in just the last few months really for the first time is what is it more than just a gradual increase in penetration? It's that our feeling is that somebody looking at $20 price point on a branded sundry item and say, hey I can save 6 or 7 bucks, or I can save 4 or 5 bucks on a 15 -- 3 or 4 bucks on $15 item. The brand loyalty changes a little bit. I think part of it is also the quality; once they try it, they like it, but that is &#x2013; that's &#x2013; there are items out there right now where the brand hasn't come down. So that 3 and $4 dollars on a $20 item might be 6 or 7.</p>
          <p>These are finite examples. But I don't think it's just the low hanging fruit anymore, so yes, there's a net margin percentage pickup. There's a pickup in dollars but not huge, but that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess my question is the differential in terms of the margin on private label versus national brands, has that narrowed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it's only narrowed in the sense that the original low-hanging fruit was taking the ultimate hugely brand loyal item that everybody discounts out there, diapers, paper towels, you name it, that is 8 to 10% margins or even 5 in some cases, where we can replace it with a 12 to 15% margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just my last question, it seems as if the sharper prices are striking a chord, you're seeing incredible traffic. But the fact is the model is less equipped to handle smaller tickets and greater frequency. It would seem to pressure the cost structure. And understand, you are looking to add members in the eventual upturn. But could you be doing something perhaps to mitigate the pressures on the cost line as traffic continues to move higher and ticket comes down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we still &#x2013; it's the old saying that each buyer has 20 priorities that are number one. One of them is on food and sundries items and increased pack sizes. We're constantly doing that. We're constantly going from a six pack of canned goods to an eight pack where we can. I think we've found our limits in many water and soda items. The darn thing is we've gotten up to 30 counts of water and power drinks and what have you. And we have had to increase the plastic so it doesn't break when you pick it up and we don't want you to hurt your back either.</p>
          <p>So but on a lot of &#x2013; I saw examples at just the last budget meeting where we were looking for bigger sizes of our own KS tuna and the number of cans and size of the can. So we're &#x2013; that's how you combat a little bit of it, but I wouldn't say that's number one on the list. We're driving our business right now. And again whether this economy in its current state lasts 3 or 6 or 9 months or 2 to 3 years, it's probably somewhere in the middle. We'll incur part of those costs while it happens right now. And there is not a lot of magic bullets. We're &#x2013; I think some of the greening stuff that I mentioned, we are seeing freight improvements, not only freight rates but pallet throughput on &#x2013; because we get more items on a pallet.</p>

          <p>Hi good morning, Richard. Questions I have, first, on the increased penetration of the Executive Membership spending, did this reflect accelerated growth in spending by Executive Members or a slowdown in spending by non-Executive Members?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a little of both. I mean the fact is they tend to be a more affluent and certainly more loyal group. I think part of it is the fact that as I mentioned that we are more successful today converting people to Executive Member than we were a year ago. By the way, gas is part of that too. Even though gas as a percent of sales is down a little, gas doesn't &#x2013; it's not disproportionate to the Executive &#x2013; to the Business member.</p>

          <p>Not at all. We get more &#x2013; gas is going to probably be volatile as long as we're around. And every time it goes up it becomes the topic du jour at night on television. And we have seen that enhance our value and frequency. And despite again the requirement for a thicker stomach lining in terms of reporting gas profits, on any rolling 12 month period it's been profitable. And there was as I joked, it was embarrassingly high profitable in Q1 and slightly not profitable in Q2, and that's the nature of that beast. But we if we could have a gas station at every location, we would. We are constrained, of course, because of the size of parking lots and traffic mitigation issues and the like. But we are constantly in every existing location that doesn't have one. Where we can we want to put one.</p>

          <p>On the gas, can you talk a little bit about gallons trending? And when you look at your overall traffic number for the business, where do you think all the share gains are coming from within retail?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I assume gallons are coming from again I think this is my own feeling, not some analysis we did. But I think for the same reason you are seeing people willing now to save 3 and $4 on a $20 item which despite brand royalty versus KS. The same reason there is a few more people probably going out of their way to save a few bucks at the gas pump. And it's reinforced every time that somebody on the news talks about gas.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to get back to the larger sizes too, that stuff is always a better value. And again everything right now is reinforced out there. That average family that's eating one or two fewer times in restaurants every week, the fact that our pizza sales or whole pizza sales are up in the food court dramatically, the fact that penetration on 15 to $20 price points are up. People are willing to save 3 or 4 bucks. All that stuff is in my view the common reaction to what's going on out there. And so I think we'll continue to drive towards what we call sensible upgrades of sizes, some customers sometimes argue that we've exceeded that sensibility, but we keep trying.</p>

          <p>One last question for you, Richard, is, when you look over the next several months and with discussions with the buyers, do you think that deflationary trends will be greater than what you've experienced over the last three months or four months?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>I hope so. I mean we're out there, that is probably the focus right now of our buyers on those items. We want prices of the underlying raw material costs and electricity costs to make it and we want it, and we want to give it to our member and we want to be first.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>They got the Binder part right but got the first name wrong, but that's all right. It's Dan Binder. Couple of questions for you. First on the &#x2013; if we just go back to the 57 basis points of gross margin erosion, it sounds like the inventory's in pretty good control. So the markdowns presumably won't continue as I think you pointed out. But if we were to look at sort of the piece that was attributable to more aggressive pricing, I think in your preannouncement call you had said that rough and tough. I think you said you were sort of back 75% back to the way of -- back to normal on the items where you did cut prices. And I'm just curious how do the margins look today on those items that you cut prices on versus what they looked like prior?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well they're going to be less negative or hopefully going towards better. And the 75% were in the items that we did, we are still, there still may be a little more in the future. There is nothing driving that goal right now. And again, if you look back when that trend line over again September through November was south, in terms of underlying comp. There was a, if you will, a call to action to do a little more of that. I think I would hope you'll see it a little better. And -- but we'll find out in late May or early June, when we announce Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The improvement in the renewal rates was pretty significant. I think you have probably like 15% more members renewing during that November to January period than any other time during the year. How much do you think the lower prices may have helped to boost those renewal rates above what you would typically see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if Jim were here, all of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter]. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it's all of the above. It's a fact that we have always seen the Executive Member be more loyal. I mean, to get, to use the 87 number, Execs are in the low 90s. So that 25 or 28% of our membership base by definition is the one that they see the value, and you see they're willing to pay twice as much. And so by us being more successful at converting new members or signing up new members as Executive Members to start with, by our success in figuring out how to keep talking to the same ones that have said no in the past without upsetting them that we're asking them again, but we've done I think a better job of that. So that helps as well.</p>
          <p>I am hoping that some of the press out there, not the Wall Street press, but the news press recognize that what we are doing in some of the price reductions, unlike a lot of people, a lot of retailers out there, we are helping the consumer out there too. We are doing it so we can drive business. But, we are being aggressive on that. And that's hopefully that drives sales when our members know that we not only treat our employees right, but we're bringing down prices.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I am not sure if you have mentioned it earlier. But, was your, if we adjust for the currency impact was your membership dollars up closer to 8%? That was kind of what we were coming up with, just want to double check?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they were up. They were up. But, yes, I mean, if it had been flat currencies, it would have been higher by about 4 percentage points.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Okay, so close to 8. And then on the &#x2013; in terms of the new store productivity on the stores you opened in Q1, how are you feeling about those thus far, in terms of what you're seeing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are fine. I might add that the two that we &#x2013; the two new warehouses that we opened in the last few weeks, arguably in very successful markets for us, Los Angeles and Honolulu, we are not only pleased with the sales levels, but with the &#x2013; in our view the net new business we are getting. Now, they are only a couple of weeks old, two weeks old. But, we're getting off to good starts in those.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. A question I guess, if we were to kind of look at your operating income trend, and look at the growth in membership fee income. If you were to strip out just the membership fee income, you would have sort of operating profits down, something on the order of 70% year-to-year. Obviously, that's allocating no expenses whatsoever to membership fees. I am just wondering, what's the right way to look that? How much of your overhead, do you think ought to be allocated against the membership fee income, if we wanted to look at those too, sort of the merchandising...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would do very little. I mean, yes, there is an ongoing expense of running the membership return desk. And mailing out 29 million or whatever &#x2013; lower number because some of them are auto-renewal. But, the fact of the matter, at the end of day, we have always looked at our membership fee as part of our total gross profit margin. And if we're at roughly, if membership fees in the second quarter were 2.16 and gross margin was a 10.42 that's a 12.6, in good times approaching a 13. That 13 is roughly an 11 and a 2 or that 12.5 is roughly a 10.5 and a 2. And, no matter how we get it, that's our model. So I know it's nice to be able to strip it out, needless to say, we wouldn't be getting them unless we did what we did in the warehouse so--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a fair point, and that's sort of the basis of the question, not wanting to overweight or underweight the allocation there, just in terms of how you look at it internally. And I guess, another question would be, I think you indicated in the pre-release call that gallonage was even stronger in January, gas gallonage on a comp basis. Has that continued into February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll see, gallonage has been positive, and there is no indication that it's going to switch. One, that's -- I think what you're alluding to is the fact that, on the way up in prices, when gas was hitting 3.5 plus dollars, not only was the price per gallon up, but the gallons itself was up better than normal. And the fear of course was that, well, now that nobody cares anymore about price of gas as much as they did when it was approaching $4, are people going to then come less frequently because they don't need, they don't see it on the news every night. To our pleasant surprise that did not occur. But, I think probably it gets back to the point I made on some of switch to private label. People are going further to save 2 or $3. And so again, everybody is on the value train here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess final question on the &#x2013; at the very beginning when you quantified sort of the sources of the profit difference, was that all compared to last year's second quarter or was that compared to what you might have expected a few months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, if you look at what First Call for Q2 was as we began our fiscal year, I think it was about the same as last year, plus or minus a penny or two. So it's really kind of both relative to what expectations were, First Call and arguably we were perhaps providing a little more guidance six to eight months ago, so that roughly that $0.74 number last year, I'm pretty sure it was pretty darn close to what the expectation was in Q2 this year at the beginning of the year, of course, it has come down. And so in that regard, it's the &#x2013; either way you look at it is the same. When you look at it, if you took last year's number versus this year's number, that $0.19 change times about $7 million is $130 million pre-tax.</p>
          <p>Again if you look at gas and the FX, each of those was in the mid 20s. So that's about 50 of the 130. So everything else is the other 80, a shade of it might be expenses, but the vast majority is all the things we've talked about that impacted margins.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. With regards to some of your prepared comments on aggressive pricing, I think you said it was a $0.03 to $0.04 hit. Was the majority of that from the reductions in pricing on seasonal merchandise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was all really consumables: chicken, milk, cheese, butter, garbage bags, things like that. That was entirely good stuff that I mean, in terms of sales. We wanted to be aggressive and the customer knows those prices and if we can show it, they'll see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as we think about kind of moving forward through the rest of '09. How should we I mean it sounds like the levels, it sounds like you're not being as aggressive. But, how should we think about kind of relative to what we saw in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're going to be as aggressive in terms of our mindset. Again, I think given that, November was like the third or fourth month in a row of downward trending underlying comps. Prices started to fall, underlying commodity prices, and so we knew it was a matter of weeks, not months.</p>
          <p>And we're not perfect, but we're not being aggressive just to damn the torpedoes here. We're going to still try to grow our bottom-line as well. But there may be weeks or months when we want to be more as aggressive. And so, I think the general view out there should be that it will be not as aggressive, but we're going to still be aggressive relative to our competitors. And we're going to do as necessary. So I think we all have our fingers crossed to you guys that we won't need to be that aggressive. And we're trying to do &#x2013; we have a tough job. We're trying to lower prices and raise margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what are you doing in terms of communicating the sort of more aggressive pricing your customers or mainly that they're in the store and that they recognize the prices are lower...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we would ask each of you to call your friends...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we don't have big bright yellow signs saying it. We don't &#x2013; needless to say, don't advertise sales. Our view is the customer gets it. They are &#x2013; in our view they are more value conscious today than ever before. And I think we see that again in the fact that gas frequency has continued despite the price point has come down 40 plus percent. We see that with the people willing to save 2, and 3 and $4 on a 15 or $20 branded versus Kirkland Signature item, more so than they have ever before. And that's what we think drives our business. And I can guarantee you though that somebody out there on the call from one of the news agencies, it will become a not as big as we'd like, but they'll get the word out too that we are doing what's right for our customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then with regards to the categories that you are seeing deflation in, are you seeing an increase in volume there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But again, it's not always proportionate and with the same steepness of slope. Again, what I have in front of me is just some charts from the last budget meeting a week ago, from some of the buyers. And there is examples of where a branded &#x2013; these are non-food sundries type items, whereas the branded item in the last 20 weeks is flat or down 5% units, and the Kirkland Signature item is up 10 to 30%.</p>
          <p>And so, we therefore stamp it, well it must be because of the &#x2013; and this is not a new item. This is an existing item that's been around and all of a sudden that big delta. Not on every item, and needless to say, certain items are more brand loyal than others and in certain items there is no private label yet, as Jim would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question, I am not sure, I don't think you gave the exact penetration, but the percentage of sales that Executive Members represent? And then, are you seeing the same increase in traffic by that customer or is it greater?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know the traffic question. I know that just &#x2013; the simple math of the impact on basis points to margin 2%, a 2 basis point impact year-over-year negative to margin. That's a 1% increase in penetration. In Q2, it was 9 basis points. So, that's about 4.5%.</p>
          <p>I don't want to be &#x2013; sound arrogant about it. But we have &#x2013; the Kirkland Signature has become a brand. When we see in leading consumer comparison magazines when they are testing 12 SKUs of this like item across 12 different brands, we're usually one of two or three out there that are private label brands that are right up there that are at the top of list in terms of quality and value, and price. And so, in many cases, our brand is becoming a brand.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sandra Barker of Montag &amp; Caldwell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard. I had a question about items where there is deflation and the price is going down. Will your degree of price pass through to the customers be what you would consider sort of normal? Or will it be more aggressive than you maybe might have been doing during your margin enhancement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, first of all, our normal is aggressive. And recognize arguably we're always going to try to maintain some dollars. But again, when the selling price on an item out there for Costco is at $15, and I am making number up here. But, let's say the cost therefore was 13.50, we made 1.50 on it. So, we made about 12%. When the underlying price went from 13.50 to 9, like a garbage bag in the last few months, we might try to make 14 or 15 as the case may be. But still, that's not going to cover the 35% reduction in price point. So, we will lose gross margin dollars on that. But that's normal for us. Conversely there, we're still trying to find those items where we can make a little more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second question has to do with just inventories of discretionary merchandise. Are you being ever more tight on the way you're planning that? I mean, how do you look at that, as that continues to be weak are you just continuing to control that more and more tightly sort of as you might go on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is both. I mean, I think of things like electronics, the fact that nobody else out there &#x2013; nobody else out there is selling 50% increase in units. They are all experiencing 30 and 40% decreases in average selling price. We have the ability to do that. Now in fact in a case like TVs there is almost a limit to how much we can do, because, I mean, how many more TVs can we sell to our members right now?</p>
          <p>Clearly, going into the spring season here, which for us starts the day after Christmas, way back in June, July, when we were making commitments to barbecue manufacturers, grill manufacturers and patio furniture manufacturers and pool accessories. We are &#x2013; again, this is anecdotal, it's not across all items but I think it gives you a direction. If in a normal year, we'd be buying 8 or 10% more units, we might be buying 10 or 20% fewer units at the extreme, maybe 5 to 10 in some cases. But in addition, we were able to &#x2013; we were able to negotiate also increased cancellation capacity.</p>
          <p>So, if we are bringing in 20 containers of an item that by certain dates, certain -- by date certain, we can cancel some of those based on their manufacturing schedule. And so, there have been some instances already, I'm not going to name which items, where we may have planned units down 10%, but we have also &#x2013; we have already cancelled a few orders such that unit sales will be down 30%.</p>
          <p>Now, there is others that are just fine by the way. And so, I don't want to imply that all categories. But that's the nature of the beast right now. It's a hell of a lot easier for us when we can focus on one item and do that. Clearly our focus is driving non-food sales for all of the reasons. But those are focused &#x2013; we're turning the food and sundries a lot faster. We have a lot of capacity to turn those other areas physically. And so, that's where &#x2013; the focus is on non-foods. If we get somebody to buy another 100 or 200 or $500 item, that's a lot better than getting them to buy 50 more $20 items or $10 items.</p>

          <p>Sure. Just lastly, you didn't talk about anything particular in terms of availability of new brands or what that environment is like, or also getting special treasure hunt type deals?</p>

          <p>It's good. That's probably the one thing I didn't ask the buyers about in terms of giving some examples. But I mean you see some not just in apparel, but in luggage and vacuum cleaners, I'm just thinking aloud here, some well known name brands out there, and we're &#x2013; and electronics. And again, a lot of that's going to stick after the economy. So, that's a net positive. But again, if you look at apparel, despite increased brand availability, apparel is down slightly, which is heck a lot better than the traditional apparel. It hasn't made it plus 10, it's just made it a lot less than minus &#x2013; a lot better than minus 20 or 30.</p>

          <p>Hey, good morning, Richard. A follow-up on the discretionary question. Do you have any sense at this point as to where the mix may bottom in terms of when the comparisons start to become easier on the discretionary categories and when we may get some mix relief on margins?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, well, it started in the summer. But it was exacerbated. I think if you looked at the Dow Jones Industrial Average and track it really hit into October and into November.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Richard. That's East Coast time, of course. Can you just talk about where you are in sort of penetration of private label and how you are using it, are using a strictly price points. Is there any margin opportunity in that as it gains traction and recognition? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the latter, yes, there is always &#x2013; we of course have a higher number on it anyway. We allow a higher number internally. We saw some initiatives available. In many cases, we get darn near the highest end, as compared to branded, which again could range from 5 to 40. Even though the cap on branded is 14 and private label is 15, I would say compared to each of those categories, capacity of 14 and 15, we're a lot closer if we can, we can get a lot closer to 15.</p>
          <p>We are using it to &#x2013; certainly using it to drive business and making sure that we are also &#x2013; ultimately when we create that loyalty with that item, as you well know, we have it for life, as long as we continue to show the quality in that 20 or at least 20 or in many cases, more percent value.</p>
          <p>So I think that what the, on the one hand in some categories like apparel, this downturn economy has helped us with availability, in certain non-food categories. On the food and sundry side, in health and beauty aids and the like we are getting help for a different reason on private label versus branded. The fact that people are not just looking to save $100 on something, they are looking to save 2 or $3 on something.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's the penetration like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I am sorry. Penetration is, I want to say, somewhere between 18 and 19 total company on the food and sundries side, which is about 50% of our sales. It's about 22%. So it would be in the probably mid teens on the non-food side recognizing, non-foods most electronics there, it's all brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so has that grown over the last six to 12 months significantly, as people traded down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The biggest growth we have seen is on the food and sundries private label, in the last, since year-to-date, so the last 26 weeks, 24 weeks. We have seen, in a normal year over the last 10 years you might see a half a point to a point increase in penetration. We have seen over 300 basis points penetration.</p>
