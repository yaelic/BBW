          <p>Welcome to the Ericsson's Analyst and Media Conference call for the Third Quarter Report. To view visual aids for this call, please log on to www.ericsson.com/press or www.ericsson.com/investors. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>As a reminder, a replay will be available one hour after today's conference. &#xC5;se Lindskog will now open the call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. With me here today I have Hans Vestberg, who is President and CEO of Ericsson; also Jan Frykhammar, who is our Chief Financial Officer; and Johan Wibergh, Head of our Business Unit Networks.</p>
          <p>Before we open up our presentation, I must remind you that during the call today we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Keep therefore in remind that the actual results may differ materially due to factors mentioned in today's press release, as well as discussed in this conference call. I would also like to encourage you to read about these risks and uncertainties in our earnings report as well as our Annual Report.</p>
          <p>And with this said then, I'd like to hand over the call to Hans Vestberg, who is our hosted speaker today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, &#xC5;se. Yes, we will briefly go over the material together here me, Johan and Jan and then we will, of course, open up for questions.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the sales, sales ended in the second quarter of 47. &#x2013; well in third quarter of SEK 47.5 billion. That was sequentially, basically flat and year-over-year up 2%. If we make it for comparable units, it was down 5% comparable units and adjusted for currency.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, it has a less of an impact negative quarter that we have had earlier. We have had 4 quarters of negative growth. This was the first quarter and then on &#x2013; in full quarter that we actually had a positive growth of 2%. Even though it's small, it's an important one for us.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the segments and we will come back to them, but basically it was Networks with mobile broadband that's growing well and Global Services continuing to show good growth. Both, of course, are impacted by currency as well where we see Professional Services, of course, in local currency, being up 10%.</p>
          <p>We will talk later on, or Johan will talk about, the component shortage that we talked about in the second quarter, where we already then said that we will have an impact in the second half of 2010. On the other hand, we said also we should see some gradual improvement. So we will come back to that.</p>
          <p>Multimedia, I will come back to that as well, but Multimedia stay on the same pattern as before, with negative growth of some 30%. We will come back to that as well.</p>
          <p>So Johan, let's hear about Networks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans. So sales grew in the quarter with 6% year-over-year, and it's been driven by mobile broadband, and then specifically very much related to the success of iPhone and Android-based devices, and especially strong markets were U.S. and Japan. But there is also of course a correlation to where smartphones are growing.</p>
          <p>Yes, we had a positive impact from the acquired Nortel business and its CDMA EV-DO and same connection to mobile broadband there as before. And 2G sales picked up somewhat in India and China, but we have still overall slow voice sales.</p>
          <p>As we said then in the second quarter, we would then have an impact in the second half of the year from component shortages. It has eased somewhat, and but we still have an impact of SEK 2 billion to SEK 3 billion due to component shortages.</p>
          <p>Margins have improved, as we saw, the strengthening is basically coming from business mix, we had a favorable product portfolio and &#x2013; but also the cost savings we have been doing and then also we usually have in the third quarter, we have a seasonal low operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Hans, back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We were talking about Global Services then, up 3% for the whole Global Services. We see the slow natural roll of business very much connected to that. We have less of turnkey contracts at the moment and we have had that for a while right now. So there is no news in that, but Professional Services continue to grow in local currency with 10%.</p>
          <p>We can also say that Managed Services continue to a very good growth, up 46%. However, there we need to remember that this is the last quarter where we have spring in the current quarter, but not in the previous year's quarters and in the fourth quarter will be more comparable, still good growth. And we signed up some 30 new Managed Services contract in a quarter, which 8 of them was renewals. The margins of Global Services basically stayed stable, a little bit up. The same goes with Professional Services, ended on an EBITA of 16%. So very good stability on the margin side and the growth side.</p>
          <p>And on the margin development, we see some impact from the supply chain bottlenecks, as we need to go out and do installation a couple of times so that they start to costing us some. On the other hand, it's lack of turnkey projects, so those are sort of easing in of each other.</p>
          <p>Multimedia, we have now seen three quarters, running around 2 billion, 2.5 billion in sales, down some 30%. Same reasons that were seen in the three previous quarters and even in the fourth quarter last year. Asia, Southeast Asia, Middle East and Africa, which is a stronghold for revenue management and many of the applications and provisioning systems that we have has &#x2013; have had much lower investment levels from operators, much &#x2013; due from cautiousness. And that is continuing to impact.</p>
          <p>So the TV business, that was the first one that we alerted on from an investment point of view, when we came into the more of a cautious period after the financial crisis, or in the financial crisis, that is now coming back and we see more interest and we see a growth in the TV businesses.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, the margins came back to a EBIT level of breakeven, improvement from the last quarter, even with a flat sales. However, the management of Multimedia is &#x2013; continues working to get back to profitability and they have initiated plans to see how they can get back, and that will encompass how to sell more, because it's more a volume problem than a margin problem here. But as we're looking into all other improvements when it comes to product rationalization at that time. And then &#x2013; so that's important.</p>
          <p>If we move slide and talk about the joint ventures, and here you see Sony Ericsson is there, Sony Ericsson running around with a sales of &#x2013; running on the sales of &#x20AC;1.4 billion to &#x20AC;1.6 billion has now turned for the third quarter making profits, which we think they have done a tremendous job coming from those volumes and turning it around in such a short period, that doesn't mean that they are sort of out of our challenging time. But definitely their product portfolio and what they are doing is encouraging. And they had some 4% operating margin in the quarter.</p>
          <p>ST-Ericsson reported late yesterday night, basically same volumes over the quarters. Some improvement on the losses, especially due to the cost efficiency. Here we are continuing to bridge together or merge together 3 companies, NXP, ST and Ericsson Mobile Platforms to get out with the new models and those are planned for next year, mentioned in the press release that will have some design wins on the new products, which is very important for us. And here we continue to seize efficiency gains, but most important the new product portfolio coming out.</p>
          <p>You can see in the last here that Ericsson share in JV earnings has turned and are now flattish in this quarter coming from huge losses in last year. And the main reason is from the Ericsson's turnaround that is really what is making difference here.</p>
          <p>If you then move to the regionals &#x2013; regions, you can say in general that we have had some impact on the strong Swedish Krona in the quarter on several regions, as we are trading in dollars, and selling hardware and software in dollars and euros. That's huge but still has an impact. We also, as Johan mentioned, there is very much the component shortages very much sort of in the mobile broadband portfolio and the products. That is cross over all the regions. So it's no regions that is less or having more stable or less stable situation. All are impacting unfortunately.</p>
          <p>And we talked a lot about the modernization in Europe. In the second quarter, we can say that we had no impact in the third quarter. I'd probably thought having impact in next year. So for the decision on modernization, as we can view it from our side has had a good positive development for Ericsson and we will come back when we can communicate on the deals that has been closed.</p>
          <p>If you look at the regions in general, I will not dwell too much on it, but you can see that mobile broadband and services are the parts of the portfolio that has the good momentum. You can see also we have more regions now having year-over-year growth. We have more that have a sequential growth than before. North America is of course picking out with a very good growth of 223% and very much fueled by the mobile broadband, both on CDMA, HSPA and HSPA+. That's sort of where it comes from. But also North America has a Sprint deal, which is important on the service piece of it.</p>
          <p>India, quickly mention that, second quarter was the low point since 2005 on the equipment side, both security issues that we're going to ship. Secondly, the 3G auctions that had come up just made a stop in a market, until they have defined.</p>
          <p>Second, in the third quarter, we started shipping 2G equipment and we're up sequentially 58%. However, no 3G equipment shipped in that quarter, but the decision of 3G vendors was done in very much to a large extent in the third quarter. And we can say that we maintained our market share in India on 3G versus the 2G. And the ones that has been communicated that we continue to be the main supply to Bharti on 3G, for example. That will start rolling out in the fourth quarter and then during 2011.</p>
          <p>China also had &#x2013; China and Northeast Asia, I have to say, that's the region that had a good development as well, 24% up year-over-year and 51% sequentially. Here we have Japan being one important driver with mobile broadband. We saw also in the quarter investments on 2G in China. In the quarter also we included LG-Ericsson, the Korean sort of company that we have been working with the Korean market. There are no significant or immaterial sales and margins from that in the quarter.</p>
          <p>However, important to say that the LTE race is now on in Korea, and we have now a company that can address that, which I think is a good timing. However, if we're going to win or not, that's a later question, but we are well positioned with our Korean company now.</p>
          <p>Jan, I leave it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans. Then we are on the slide with the heading profitability. I think just a few remarks on this slide. The gross margin of 39%, same level as in the second quarter, improved compared to last year. There are no changes into the reasons why we stay flat. It's business mix as well as continued impact of the cost savings.</p>
          <p>On the operating expense, main reason I would say, if you look at the sequential reduction is the seasonality. And basically we had also higher costs, thanks to the fact that we have integrated directly acquired companies, so same reasons really as in the second quarter there as well.</p>
          <p>If we take the next slide and go to the balance sheet ratios, here it was not easy to be a CFO of the company in the second quarter and report negative cash flow then. On the other hand, I am really happy to talk about the improvements we have made on the days of sales outstanding in this quarter and I think we have really focused in on collecting cash and improving also the inventory levels. However, the inventory level is high still.</p>
          <p>Part of that is related to the normal seasonal build up, but it's also so that some of the impacts of our supply chain is still impacting inventory. I would say that the third reason is that we also are driving or buying material now for volumes in Q1 and Q2 and that has a small impact on the inventory.</p>
          <p>If we then look at &#x2013; take the next slide and look at the slide that is called change in gross cash. Here you can see the green, nice box that of an operating cash flow of 11.8 billion in the quarter and an adjusted cash flow &#x2013; if you then adjust for cash outlays related to restructuring where we then have 12.7 billion of operational cash flow in the quarter. That's something we are happy with. If you look at the change in net cash improvement in the quarter of almost 10 billion.</p>
          <p>Next slide, cost efficiency. We have said all the time that as a company we continue to have both capital efficiency as well as cost efficiency high in our agenda. The main area selectivity that we are carrying out in the company is with regards to rationalization of products, seeking synergies and efficiency gains in service delivery, as well as, of course, the transformation activities in our managed service business.</p>
          <p>In the quarter then we took charges for restructuring of SEK 900 million and we did cash outlays of the same amount. Now if we look at what remains to be paid for in terms of cash restructuring, it's 3.8 billion. We have also then guided for a number for the fourth quarter as we see, and that's important for us and in our dialogue with you to get better transparency on the expected restructuring charges, and you see the number there of 1.5 billion. It's with the same reasons, I would say.</p>
          <p>So with that said, I hand over to Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And I will just come back to the four focus areas that we have in the company. You've seen them many times, but this is how we &#x2013; running the company put up incentives and we're trying to really to create value and see that we are doing a great job and grow faster in our markets.</p>
          <p>As it was outlined in the report, the first half year of 2010 on the CapEx side had a negative growth. I would say that the second half in 2011, it still remains to be seen. From a market point of view, we actually came &#x2013; we came back somewhat from a declining business to having a small growth. That's important. We continue to be very focused on that and we're doing changes in the company to address our portfolio and be strongly with our customers and see that we sell the full solutions when we did the regionalization.</p>
          <p>Best-in-class margins, we continue to work hard with the margins. We have seen a sequential and a year-over-year improvement for many reasons &#x2013; for a couple of reasons. I think both the mix, but also the cost efficiencies that we've done will continue to try to find the best efficiency gains even though we will not have a global program, as Jan said.</p>
          <p>The cash conversion, we have a target of about 70% cash conversion and we are there right now and we continue to strive for that. We had a strong third quarter, but it should be viewed over a longer period, we usually say, looked over a year. And that's where we have the focus to continue to earn, make at least 70%.</p>
          <p>Our JV earnings is coming back to a zero. So if it's growing enough, then that's probably a different question, but definitely coming from a big losses last year to being zero right now, very much driven by Sony Ericsson, and we will continue to support them in that transition.</p>
          <p>That would be then our presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans, Jan and Johan. And operator, we are ready to take questions now.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Detailed information is provided in the report and Ericsson's Investor Relations and Media Relations teams will be happy to take any additional questions and discuss further details with you after the call. We now have the first question from Mr. Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Hans, I had a quick question. You mentioned in the release that there was an increased interest on the part of operators in network sharing, particularly in Europe. Is this LTE, Wideband CDMA? How large an impact you expect this to have on the size and timing of rollout of, say, 4G? And if you could comment on what you think the pace of rollout in 3G in India is going to be, I'd appreciate it? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ed. When it comes to network sharing, we have seen that for quite a while in Europe, especially in the market where there are several operators and it's everything from passive, and in some extent also the active sharing.</p>
          <p>We have seen, as I said, a couple of them. We're going to see, going forward, at least the interest and the discussion is quite high on the passive side. But on the active side, we're going to see what's going to happen. So it's a little bit early to say, Ed. I will come back on that when we have those types of developments. But definitely, there is a lot of discussions around it.</p>
          <p>When it comes to 3G in India, we will &#x2013; as soon as the contracts are cleared, we will start shipping as soon as possible. So, of course, we will &#x2013; already in the fourth quarter shipped some 3G equipment, but much will also be shipped in the 2011. India is a large country, and so we will not be able to do whole country in a quarter. So it will take some time. But it will be shipment for certain regions or cities, which some operators are focusing on in the beginning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But this should affect your margin profile, should it not, given that you're doing a lot of 2G there, which I'd expect to be much higher margin product than 3G?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Depends on how they select to do with, but if it's going to be purely the new footprint on 3G, there will be some pressure on the margin. On the other hand, we don't know the pace this can be done, because it's quite a lot, and a lot has been decided in the third quarter, of course. But we will ship 3G equipment in to India in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Rod Hall from JP Morgan is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thank you for taking my question. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. I just had &#x2013; I have two actually. I wonder, Hans, could you just comment &#x2013; I mean, we've seen now revenues kind of creeping their way back up for the whole market, not just Ericsson, to levels that we saw maybe in 2008, 2009, not even quite at that level. And at best, it looks to us like next year we're looking at maybe low single-digit growth for the overall market.</p>
          <p>I just wonder if you could comment sort of the radio access network, in particular, whether you think the market is actually a growth market or not? I mean, do you think that that market can accelerate to double-digit growth on an annualized basis, or do you think it's more like a low single-digit growth market that just continues to grow that way over the next couple of years? And then I have one follow-up to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rod. I think on the radio access, we think that, if you go start from the outside and thinking about the consumers and the smartphones and all of that, we think that radio access will be a very important piece of that business to really meet the demand from the consumers. At the same time, we have modernization coming install base that is installed in many places. It actually can be very much improved from a technology point of view, but also from a power saving et cetera and all of that. So, yes, we believe it is &#x2013; it will grow. But if it's low single-digit or whatever that is too early to say. But given the underlying market trends with smartphones and all of that modernization, it should be a possibility for growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, it just seems like the equipment just gets more and more efficient and as a result the effective price per unit of bandwidth keeps coming down. So it's just not clear whether we have a market that's a low growth market or it's something higher. At this point, it looks like a lower growth market. So, okay, I mean, I guess there is no more &#x2013; nothing else you could say about that.</p>
          <p>The second question I had is on provisions. It sounded this morning like you were saying, and maybe this is more for Jan, you were saying that structurally you're taking lower provisions on the RBS 6000, is that correct when you compare the RBS 6000 provision level to prior generations of base station? I mean, should we be expecting provision to kind of run structurally lower as we get more and more RBS 6000s in the mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start and Jan will answer. The question that I got was LTE, and my answer was that so far on LTE we have not had &#x2013; as we say, I mean, provisions usually reflect the risk level. And of course, if we get new technologies coming out, usually we have &#x2013; the provisions would have go through tailor rate a little bit higher. We have not seen that on LTE, and LTE is on rate base itself. So that was my answer, I used to clarify that. Jan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think also that when it comes to the rural provision level, you have to look at the business mix as well. I mean the business mix during this year is really much more of upgrades. And I mean a few years ago we had much more of turnkey projects and so forth with a different risk profile. So, I mean, let's see what happens in the future. But right now the provision level reflects the business mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Johan. I also would like to give an add-on then. So RBS 6000 is our latest generation of base station that we launched in the second quarter. We have a tremendously good reception of it from our customers. It's a base station that can handle all wireless technologies and it is &#x2013; also then be used to LTE <mark type="inaudible" />. It continues to go quite well and it will be a important product for us in the coming year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As carriers enter the second phase of mobile broadband, will that be the event that pose a lot higher demand for more networks? Is tier pricing of catalyst for step function that will increase also demand for networks? Maybe if you can help us, let us know, what investors should look for to be a positive catalyst to accelerate demand for networks?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark. I think you mentioned two of the important trends that we should look for. I think tiered pricing is a very important piece of it to us than operators can match their cost and revenues in another way. And they can advance both high-end users and low-end users and probably also machine-to-machine over time. So tiered pricing on mobile broadband is an important indicator for the market when it comes to their possibility about gaining growth from an operator point of view, and of course consequentially towards investment.</p>
          <p>And the other indicator that you asked for, I mean, I think smartphone is a very important indicator as well. And then when it comes to the networks and the usage from them, and it was initially of course iPhone, but today it also goes for many other types of phones like the Sony Ericsson's Android phones.</p>
          <p>So, I think, that those too are two important elements. Then which operator and which moment they're going to invest. It's a little bit different how they build their network from the beginning and what they were expecting and then preparing for. So, but the leading indicator, tier pricing, smartphones are important.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And all these things you feel may be &#x2013; there will be a point where things can actually accelerate so that networks is just not a GDP growing segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little bit difficult to say, because when I generalize on the whole world, it is sometimes difficult, because there are of course regions that are investing quite heavily right now in mobile broadband, and there are others that are not. But in general, the transition that we see in new ones, <mark type="inaudible" /> networks, that pace that mobile broadband is growing well and that the voice related equipments are declining. So we see investment on mobile broadband definitely.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hans, just &#x2013; thanks for that. Just a question along the same lines as the previous one, really when we just look at the U.S. and Japan now that are in a very strong growth phase and you underscored the importance of mobile broadband there. I'm just wondering how long do you think it will take until that comes to Europe as well? And is the network modernization that you're talking about in Europe, is that part of that mobile broadband spending that we're going to see in Western Europe as well, and perhaps at lower margins than what you see in the U.S. because it's more competitively priced? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start and Jan will follow up. I think that, yes, rightly mentioned, the growth that we see in Japan and North America is very much driven about smartphones and the mobile broadband. Johan, can talk about Europe and what's happening in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we have seen a clear development of mobile broadband over the last year. It was initially driven then by PCs and dongles, but the last &#x2013; I would say at least the last two years the most important growth factor has been the smartphone, so is the iPhone and then the Android-based phones, which according to Google, they're not activating more than 200,000 per day right now. And, of course, those are then the factors that are driving uptake. Also the iPad will &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> will have a positive impact even though still volumes have been small.</p>
          <p>So, we then expect and we can then see that where uptake of smartphones are increasing that, of course, then it drives traffic in the 3G networks and hence need for more expansions and capacity upgrades. And some may have a lot of capacity already, other may be strained, and depending on the investments come. The timing there is depending on how much is being used.</p>
          <p>Modernization in Europe will support this. Fourth-generation LTE will also support and drive this. And of course, due to these factors then you have different development in different countries. Finally <mark type="inaudible" /> questions I had before, this is supported by the different business model. As we get more advanced business models, you get the bigger uptake and hence the bigger usage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. If we look back to '97 &#x2013; sorry, 2007 and I think this is just to Rod's question as well, there seems to be very little growth in the core networks business despite this huge boom in mobile data traffic and despite acquiring Nortel.</p>
          <p>So my question for you Hans is, do you think Ericsson needs to widen its addressable market to reach other end segments of operators, perhaps in cable or satellite or other markets? And how do you see potentially using now the 35 billion of net cash to try to haze in some consolidation in the industry that might ease some of the pricing pressure that clearly operators are quite happy about?</p>
          <p>And then a quick question for Jan, were there any sales of receivables in the quarter? And do you anticipate for 2011 having a further restructuring program as we've seen from many of the past years? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And on the first question, I think that as long as our portfolio can address the needs of other industries and other operators, we will definitely pursue that as well. And we see the traction that more and more other industries are looking into sort of standard technologies. So I think your question is right that, yes, we will see possibility with cable companies, utilization companies doing either managed services or technology. And so that &#x2013; yes, it will be natural for us from our portfolio point of view.</p>
          <p>And on your other question, Richard, regarding what we're going to do with the net cash flow with CDMA, any possibility for industry consolidation. I think a good industry consolidation was the Nortel acquisition that we made. It was not apparent, maybe that we needed CDMA in the portfolio. We will follow whatever is happening in the market as a leader and see if there is something we need to do in order to keep or strengthen our position. At the moment, nothing specific on the radar screen, but we are all the time browsing and seeing what's happening in the market.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Richard, let me try to answer your two questions then. The factoring was at normal levels in the quarter, when it comes to the continuous improvement or ambition, we have to work in a more efficient way and so forth. I mean, that's something that we as a company will continue to do, of course. We will come back in the fourth quarter with &#x2013; or after the fourth quarter with more of a guidance, if I may say so, on the level of restructuring charges for 2011. Now, we gave a number for the fourth quarter, but let's come back in January with a number for 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one for Jan, perhaps, on the OpEx side. You've made a couple of comments around costs related to LTE trials and also CDMA integration costs kind of peaking right now. So just wanted to understand how should we look at the OpEx seasonality going into Q4? If I look at the last three to four years, the SG&amp;A charges have increased by about 2 billion to 2.5 billion in Q4 over Q3 and R&amp;D has increased about 1 billion. Should we expect a similar kind of level in Q4, or would there be any differences given the drivers?</p>
          <p>And then second one for Hans perhaps. If you could just maybe talk about some of the drivers for gross margins going into next year? I know you've discussed network modernization, HSPA in China, 3G rolling out in India. But putting it all together, what does it sort of imply for gross margins for the Group? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Anuj. I think, first of all, on the operating expense, I don't expect any different pattern than a normal seasonality here on the operating expense. I think on the ISIT, mainly, integration costs related to the acquisitions from Nortel, I think we have peaked there in the second and third quarter. So that portion will probably go down a bit. On the other hand, we have a big activity level when it comes to LTE trials and that will continue throughout the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gross margin drivers, I think one of the most important drivers is volume. Of course, that is an important driver on the infrastructure side of it. Then, of course, it is the type of business we're doing, not the country we're doing, which as I've said so many times before, if it's expansion, upgrades or if it's new footprint that &#x2013; of course that makes it important.</p>
          <p>In services, it's other drivers, of course, is more &#x2013; our way of transforming business and offshoring, onshoring doing everything that, that as smooth as possible. That is an ongoing work everyday. Those are the drivers for us to keep up the margins. And, of course, new product is also an important point that Jan brought up. I mean, we come up with a new radio base family, which is also important from a cost point of view.</p>
          <p>So, I think, those are the drivers for us when we look into the cost of sales and what are the drivers to see that way we drive cost down.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much. I had a question on balancing growth with margins. I think you said in the past that you wouldn't really want margins to go above 20%, perhaps for fear of upsetting operators, and as of now have gone above 20%. And over the last few quarters we've seen some of your competitors perhaps win a number of contracts that might suggest they'll start to gain market share.</p>
          <p>So I was just trying to understand why perhaps you haven't been as aggressive chasing some of those contracts, whether you're holding back for network modernization or whether Q3 is just a little bit of an unusual quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Stuart. I'm not really recognizing a couple of the comments. I now think that, as I said before, I think we are doing well on the network modernization in Europe. That said, sometimes we cannot reveal the deals that we have won because customers doesn't want us to do it.</p>
          <p>I think we're doing well. We are definitely keeping our market share in Europe. And we all the time balance the growth with the margins, but also sometimes growth is important for &#x2013; because volumes are also driving the bottom line.</p>
          <p>So I think it's a balance for us, but we all the time, I don't think we have changed any view on how we work on that. It's nothing unusual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, I was just wondering whether or not you might use that profit, that margin to be a little bit more aggressive going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was another question. I just thought about the Easter now. We're going to use it in the best way to balance growth. Growth is important for us. So we're going to balance it in the right way. But on the other hand, we have said that we want a good profitability as well in order to make our investment in R&amp;D. Technology leadership is so important for us, so we can generate that. So we're going to balance it going forward as well. But, of course, when we see opportunities, or market share, or new footprint, we're going to be, as usual, be working on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add there as well to it. I mean, when we met here at the Capital Market Day, we said that we are on a &#x2013; we are not happy with the current level of profitability and that we, over a long term period, would like to make sure that we gradually improve, right. And I think that that is something that is important for us. Still as Hans said, of course, footprint drives volume and so forth as well. But over the longer or mid-term period, I mean, we are trying to improve the bottom line.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could you give us a bit of a sense of how your clients in North America are spending money with you, because there are lot of controversies around what sort of spending really mobile broadband triggers? Is that mostly spending on the core network on the backhaul, or is it on the radio network? And on the radio access network do you see a steep increase in the number of sites and number of base station that operators are deploying to cope with the growth of smartphone usage, or is it mostly money spent on upgrading existing equipment and existing site? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Johan comment. But before we start commenting, first of all, you know how sensitive we are to disclosing what our customers are investing, I think that's very important. And then &#x2013; and so sometimes we ask you to ask them, but Johan can in general terms probably talk about what we see in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, when we speak about mobile broadband, I mean, what products that drives the first will be in the radio base station side, then at the backhaul, and then there is something called the controller RNC, and there might be further more transmission. So these are the products involved.</p>
          <p>And so, in some cases, operators are need to deploy a bigger coverage, because if you still look, there is something like 5% &#x2013; if you take where we have GSM today, 2G coverage, that's almost 5% of the same coverage that has between 1 megabit per second and 3G coverage. So there is still a lot of coverage that needs to be built out.</p>
          <p>Secondly then, there are capacity increases and they go all over the shelf, capacity increases in the radio base stations, you need to buy new carriers or upgrade a hardware to handle higher speeds. You need to install more mobile backhauls, more transmission equipment, and you need to increase the capacity on the RNC. And then there might be further on capacity increase in transmission. And each operator has an individual situation on what do they need and to buy out, et cetera. But these are the general areas where we then &#x2013; that are benefiting from mobile broadband growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in North America, you have two things. First of all, you have more capacity upgrades on 3G, because in North America we invested in 3G quite recently, so there is no need to modernize it. And then secondly, North America is deploying LTE fourth-generation, also which is the modern course.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Thank you, Hans and Jan. It seems as though most of the change in operating profit quarter-on-quarter was due to the steep drop in SG&amp;A, which was down by about SEK 1.4 billion sequentially. Can you specify what drove that? I think I heard you say something about FX in the press conference this morning, but I was hoping you could clarify your comments there and help us to quantify that and whether &#x2013; comment on whether it's sustainable or not into the fourth quarter and beyond? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Matthew. What we said this morning was that it was seasonality, and it is seasonality. So that is the way you should have interpreted the answer. And on the &#x2013; what was the next question, was that first question?</p>
          <p>Okay. So I think that's &#x2013; I think, as we said in the second quarter, it is important to understand these different elements. I mean, we have had a bit of an ISIT integration cost related to Nortel, CDMA and GSM. The bulk of those costs were in the second quarter and the third quarter. We think we are &#x2013; we have peaked in that respect, but those are not billions obviously, just to be clear on that. The LTE trial activity, however, is intense and we think that that will continue throughout the year. The other reasons are simply seasonality.</p>

And looking into the news, it looks like Huawei is trying to team up a lot more closely and then actually try and get into some of the larger carriers with sort of recent hires such as Gordan England. Just wanted to get your take on that. Is that a concern for you, or do you think that margins will remain structurally higher?</p>
          <p>And then just a second one in terms of India. Are you seeing a little bit more bundling with services or equipments from some of the Chinese vendors, and is that going to cause you further margin compression? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hello, Zahid. It's a little bit hard for me to comment on their movements in either of the markets. I mean, I think you have to ask them yourself, but we face the competition all over the place and I think there's nothing different from before, and we're going to see what's going to happen in North America.</p>
          <p>And in India, I think that operators define quite much how they want to buy, et cetera. So that's sort of how their solutions are made for the customer. So I'm not sure to answer any question perfect, because I'm not sure how you want me to answer because, I mean, I don't fit with that knowledge, or at least the knowledge that I can talk about.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. We're already doing it. We have done that for quite a while in India.

But it's more depending on how the customer wants to buy. It's much smaller. But we have the flexibility, when we have a technology leadership, when we have the service arm, and then we can bundle it up to customer wants to do business with us.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I've got a couple of questions. On the restructuring, the SEK 1.5 billion in Q4, I was under the impression your major program was over. So what specifically is this for? And just in terms of magnitude, Jan, is this the kind of level you should expect going forward, or is this inflated for some reason, just to give us some idea like. I think it's important for investors to understand, if you're going to keep restructuring, we can't &#x2013; to leave estimates out there. Therefore it is going to be a major SEK 5 billion or SEK 7 billion or SEK 10 billion charge to depress earnings, that leads lot of volatility, I think, in the shares potentially.</p>
          <p>And then for Hans, on the gross margin, everything you speak about, unless I'm interpreting it wrong, really seems to emphasize network modernization, India 3G, LTE, all things that we would associate, at least for the next 12 to 18 months, being low gross margin. So are you basically telling us gross margins have peaked? Thanks.</p>

          <p>On the provisions, I think that, first of all, as I said before, I mean, we have always had a certain level of restructuring. I mean, we are in 175 countries and we have quite a big portfolio. There's always going to be up and down, but we will not have a global program. Now we have a little bit higher in Q4 and the reason, basically, is that we come from the regionalization that we made in the second quarter, that is now coming together and they see efficiency gains.</p>
          <p>Regarding next year, I think Jan has already answered that, that we will come back to &#x2013; come back on that, but again, we will not have the leverage that we had the last couple of years if we don't announce any major program, we will run on a lower level. But we will never have zero, that you can never expect from a business like ours. Jan is fine with my answer. I'm looking at him.</p>
          <p>Gross margin, now we used to &#x2013; want to give some color on what type of business were in front of us. Of course, we're going to have expansion and upgrades as well. Now we talk about Europe modernization and 3G India, that's the two things we are talking about. There are other businesses as well.</p>
          <p>I mean, services has consistently been very good and managing their margins as well. So I think it's a balance of it all and we talk little bit more about the new footprint, where it's coming and where do we see the pressure coming. That doesn't take away. We will continue to work with efficiency, rationalizations, new product portfolios, et cetera, all the time to see that we can keep it. But of course, there are some impact of modernization during 2011 and 3G India as well, but let's see where it ends up.</p>

          <p>Kai Korschelt from Deutsche Bank is on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I had a couple, please. Hans, you made a couple of questions, I believe a few weeks back, in a Swedish newspaper around competition, I think particularly from the likes of NSN increasing for deals like network modernization. So I'm just wondering if there's any bit &#x2013; been any update in terms of how aggressive your smaller competitors have been, and whether that has had any impact on pricing?</p>
          <p>And my second question was, I think you alluded to 2% year-on-year growth, but could you break out for us, please, what the organic sort of ex-M&amp;A and ex-FX growth was, both on a year-on-year and sequential basis, please? And then my third question is on CDMA revenues in the U.S., is that still strong and for how long do you think that the strength continues? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, I probably need to change your view a little bit. I've never talked about NSN doing something. I never speak on the competition. The only thing I have said, as I always had, when new footprint comes up, that's when competition is. That happened on 3G in 2002 and 2003 in Europe, and it happens now in the modernization. So I don't see any different view on that than you &#x2013; the Swedish media might portray it a little bit different, but the same story as before. Competition is tough, has been tough for a long time. That's what we have seen.</p>
          <p>When it comes to CDMA, the other &#x2013; I don't have. On the CDMA, we had a normal quarter on CDMA, maybe little bit less, because it had been so strong in the first half. But I think more the operators going to define how long CDMA will be around, but it will definitely be for quite a while. I mean, the base &#x2013; consumer base on CDMA in North America is large, very large. So of course, it's going to require investment on CDMA for quite a while. It's too early for me to speculate when that is going end, or when it's going to start declining, et cetera, that we have to come back with. But we are basically are focused on a couple of really very important customers in North America. So we have to come back on that.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I &#x2013; I can add there a bit, Hans. I think, if you look at the overall &#x2013; if you remember what Johan said in the beginning here. I mean, we had, of course, a positive development on that business, thanks to the EV-DO or the mobile broadband in North America. I think in the quarter, we saw some seasonally lower revenue from the CDMA business, nothing to be worried about, I think. And also, we had a couple of percentage points' impact from the FX there. So just to add to Hans comments.</p>

          <p>Operator, we can take one final question now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our last question comes from Mark McKechnie from Gleacher &amp; Co.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and then good work on the name there. So, Hans and Jan, congrats on a good solid quarter. My question is on the component tightness and specifically two things. One for Q4, again, I know you don't give guidance, but you're typically up pretty strong, 25% to 30%. Do you think components might limit that to some sub-seasonality here in Q4? And then, maybe if you can tell us some of the components that are tight and how you see those playing out into next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd start with the first question, I missed a little bit on the second one. When it comes to the components, as I said already in the second quarter, and Johan mentioned as well, there is shortage of components that will also impact the fourth quarter. We see, however, gradual improvement, everything relative depending, of course, on the demand and this especially now to our mobile broadband portfolio what Johan answered when the question was raised, what is actually left in the mobile broadband, those type of equipment.</p>
          <p>So we will have to come back when the quarter is over to see where we ended up, but there will be impact in the fourth quarter from the component shortage. And it is important for me to mention that, because I have customers that want to have deliveries, but I cannot really meet the demand. So it's equally important that they know it is actually a tough situation. But we are working very hard and we have seen a gradual improvement as said, and our organization is doing everything to mitigate the challenges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And an addition there is that, if you look at this fantastic currency or Swedish Krone that is very strong right now. I mean, if the currency stays on this very strong level, we will start to see the impact as well in the fourth quarter and let's see where we end the year and where we start next year. But you have to look at that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, one more follow-up on the component side, and I appreciate it. But it's interesting. I know you don't like to talk about competitors, but Nokia/Siemens, your friends in Finland, had &#x2013; their margins were pretty trick &#x2013; weak and they mentioned, they had tight components at the high end, it seems like you bucked that trend a little bit. Is it fair to assume that you did a better job on your mix, maybe you allocated the scarce components to higher margin business relative to your competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, you are sitting on better facts than I am, because I cannot draw the conclusion, because I don't know how they have worked in the quarter. I think that our organization has worked very hard. Still I have to emphasize about our customers that have not been satisfied with the delivery from us, they want more.</p>
          <p>So, I don't know how they have handled it. I think we are handling very professionally. We have the very good supply orientation, have had work diligently with this still we had an impact. But we have had this as a number one focus for the quarter all over the company. And then we will have it in the fourth quarter as well. But I'm not sure of our friends at this stage has been working with us in the quarter.</p>
