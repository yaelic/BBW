          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the presentation of Xstrata's Half Year Results for the Six Months Ended 30 of June 2012. These results, if I read the newspaper, seem to have been anticipated with a lot of interest and I hope that we are going to be able to address that in our presentation this morning. And in that context let me also welcome those who are attending the presentation via the webcast and those also who are listening on the telephone.</p>
          <p>Now with me this morning are the other members of our Executive Committee who I think are familiar to most of you. So, at the front of me are our CFO, Trevor Reid; Santiago Zaldumbide, Executive Director and Chief Executive of Xstrata Zinc; Peter Freyberg, Chief Executive of Xstrata Coal; Charlie Sartain, of Copper; and Ian Pearce, Chief Executive of Xstrata Nickel; and Peet Nienaber, the Chief Executive of our Alloys business. Our Chief Legal Counsel, Benny Levene; and Thras Moraitis, the Executive General Manager Strategy comprises two other final members of the Executive Committee.</p>
          <p>Before I carry on maybe it's a good moment just to pause and just note that this will be this is Peet's last results presentation. He retires in a month's time. And you know Peet and Santiago were the two colleagues that I joined when I came to Xstrata, I don't know, 11 years ago now in October, running the two businesses of the group and who essentially stood with me and then with Trevor in terms of thinking how to build the group up.</p>
          <p>But Peet has run Xstrata Alloys from long before that and in fact with his mentor started the company which then went public, then were bought by Glencore, then came into Xstrata and has run that operation in the most exemplary fashion. And in the last few years in quite, quite difficult and complex circumstances with the increasing in power prices and the inherent complexity of running operations in South Africa and has done the most outstanding job and he has been a very highly talented executive and a great pleasure to have a colleague with the Executive Committee and somebody who we are going to miss a great deal at Xstrata.</p>
          <p>So, I guess on your behalf and on our behalf I think I should pause and say to Peet a really large thank you for the great contribution you've made to the building up of what I think is now this great company. And we wish you well in retirement and we hope that you'll bring as much rigor to the animals on the farm as you bought to running the facilities at Alloys and I'm sure that we'll continue to have many, many years of shared experience together but just in a different form, but thank you very much Peet.</p>
          <p>I should also note that Santiago, who has to be one of most remarkable executives that I've ever worked with, is having a rather special birthday tomorrow. And while I'm not sure it'd be appropriate this results presentation to lead you in a happy birthday, happy birthday Santiago, which I'm quite tempted to do, I have to say, just to see the expression on his face. But I think again on behalf of all us, Santiago, many happy returns for tomorrow. What an incredible, incredible <mark type="ph" /> earnings (4:00) you've had and what an amazing contribution you have made to, not only Xstrata, but to the corporate life in Spain and to the zinc industry. And, again, it's such a great pleasure to have you as part of the team.</p>
          <p>So, moving on. Our financial performance in the first half of the year reflects a cyclical downturn in commodity prices as well as the transition year, which we foreshadowed to the market last year and again this year when we produced our results in February, where we migrate production from certain legacy and end-of-life operations to our next-generation of lower cost mine.</p>
          <p>Our commodity prices fell significantly, and particularly for nickel and for zinc, compared to the same period last year and were the major contributors to reduced profitability, while we were shielded from the full impact of lower spot coal prices by higher annual contracts.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA was $4 billion, was 31% lower than the same period last year. Our earnings per share fell to $0.75, 23% lower than the first half of 2011 on a pre-exceptional basis. We've declared an interim dividend of $0.14 per share, 8% higher than last year's significant increase, marking our confidence in the medium-term prospects and our robust balance sheet, with gearing at a pretty comfortable 19% in the midst of a peak year for capital spending.</p>
          <p>So, against this background of lower prices, the cost pressures arising from our transition from older mines and ongoing cost inflation across the industry, operational performance, I think, remains quite robust. In the second quarter, volumes, as you know, rose across the group, providing us with very decent momentum to achieve our expectations of higher volumes in the second half.</p>
          <p>Now, despite the challenging environment, our businesses again achieved over $100 million of real unit cost savings, continuing our unbroken record of net cost reduction in real terms, which we've managed to achieve and reported on every single reporting period.</p>
          <p>Following a detailed review by each of the business units, we have identified significant additional cost savings for the second half of the year to more than offset the cost pressures we expect to face. Safety performance continued to improve in terms of total recordable injuries including contractors to 5 million hours worked.</p>
          <p>This year marks the tipping point of the strategy to transform our portfolio through organic growth that we have consistently pursued for the past five years. And that strategy has delivered long-life, lower cost operations, with further embedded growth potential, such as the Mangoola and Goedgevonden coal mines, Nickel Rim South and the major expansion of the Antamina copper-zinc mine, all producing at or above nameplate capacity. By the end of the year, ten projects will have reached commissioning, accelerating our transition from certain legacy end-of-life operations to new and expanded efficient operations.</p>
          <p>The Antapaccay copper mine in Peru has now started commissioning and in total four copper projects will start production this year. Koniambo, New Caledonia will deliver its first ore to furnace before the end of year. And Tswelopele ferrochrome pelletizing plant in South Africa will improve efficiency in our ferrochrome business and the Lady Loretta and George Fisher zinc-lead mines in Australia will commission ahead of schedule</p>
          <p>Our business will be transformed in terms of asset quality, cost competitiveness and further capital-efficient growth potential. Now as you've read, we've deferred around $1 billion of capital expenditure from this year. And we'll return to this later. But we've done this without impacting any of our approved projects and we reviewed our unapproved project portfolio to prioritize the highest returning projects and considered the timing of future investments.</p>
          <p>So with that as a brief introduction, I'm going to hand over to Trevor, who is going to take you through the key points of our operational financial performance and then we'll elaborate further on our program of organic growth.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Mick. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As usual, we've provided a very detailed report on our financial and operating performance in the packs that you have. So, once again, I am going to limit my presentation to the key points.</p>
          <p>After a strong start to the year for commodities, renewed turmoil in the Eurozone and a slowing growth rate in China has severely affected commodity prices in the first half of 2012. Lower prices across every commodity were the main driver of a 42% reduction in operating profit to just under $2.5 billion. Foreign currency gains reduced the net interest expense in dollar terms and you will also note our lower income tax expense, which reflects a one-off reversal of circa $450 million of prior-year tax provisions.</p>
          <p>Now if you strip out the impact of this reversal, the effective tax rate before exceptional items was 24%, which is slightly lower than the 26% effective tax rate for the first half of 2011 due to reduced earnings in some higher-tax jurisdictions. I expect the effective tax rate to be around 15% for the year, which, if you exclude the write back, is equivalent to around 24% for the full year on a normalized basis.</p>
          <p>During the first half of 2012, we had to recognize a number of non-cash exceptional items in the income statement, which in total reduced earnings by $253 million. These include an impairment of our investment in Lonmin following the release of their 2012 interim results, an impairment of goodwill following the announcement of the closure of our Brunswick zinc mine, and the recognition of a non-cash loss upon the sale of a 51% controlling interest in our hydro-electricity project in Chile to a specialist power generation company.</p>
          <p>Following the enactment of the mineral resources rent tax in Australia which became effective on 1 July, we have had to recognize an exceptional deferred tax credit. Now, this treatment is completely in line with our peers in Australia and you can expect to see similar items in their accounts.</p>
          <p>Our share of earnings from non-controlling interests fell 44% due to reduced earnings from Alumbrera, where restrictions imposed by the Argentinean government caused us to temporarily suspend copper sales to export customers during the second quarter. Attributable profit before exceptionals decreased by 23% to $2.2 billion, giving earnings per share before exceptional items for the half year of $0.75.</p>
          <p>Now, if you exclude that non-exceptional tax adjustment, our earnings per share was $0.59 per share. Operating EBITDA decreased by 31% to $4 billion, again, reflecting lower commodity prices during the first half and, in particular, lower base metal prices, which accounted for the majority of the reduction.</p>
          <p>We were partially shield it from the impact of lowest spot coal prices during the second quarter by our exposure to sales under longer-term fixed price contracts. Lower prices across every commodity reduced operating profit by $1.1 billion compared to the first half of 2011 and were the main driver in the reduction on operating profit down to $2.5 billion. Average nickel prices fell 28%, lead 21%, zinc 15% and copper 14% during the first half. Lower base metal prices represent 85% of the $1.1 billion sales price variance.</p>
          <p>We continue to experience inflationary cost pressures for key inputs, although we have observed that the rate of CPI and mining industry inflation has slowed. The combined impact of CPI and mining inflation increased costs by some $386 million in the first half of 2012 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year and represented the total annual inflation rate for our businesses of some 6.5%. The inflation rate has decreased from record levels seen in recent years, and we expect this to moderate further in the medium term as a number of mining companies delay or cancel proposed projects.</p>
          <p>The stronger US dollar against the currencies of commodity producing countries added $261 million to operating profit, partially mitigating the impact of inflation. Nickel and coal production volumes rose, while zinc volumes were maintained despite end of life operations at Brunswick and Perseverance mines in Canada, but were offset by lower volumes in our copper and ferrochrome businesses.</p>
          <p>In total, lower volumes reduced operating profit by some $639 million, reflecting the transitional nature of this year for our copper business.</p>
          <p>During the first half our businesses achieved real unit cost savings of some $105 million. Efficiency improvements at our zinc operations, higher coal production from lower cost operations, increased production and improved head grades at Raglan and Sudbury nickel operations and lower power costs and higher production at Falcondo ferronickel operation more than offset headwinds experienced in the some of our copper operations.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization decreased mainly due to the lower volumes in the copper business and partially offset by higher production in the coal business.</p>
          <p>Now our copper business is currency undergoing a significant transition as we close a number of our material lower grade operations and commission new lower cost mines and expansions. By the end of the year we will have commissioned four new or expanded copper operations providing a significant increase in lower cost copper production.</p>
          <p>Despite the stronger second quarter, copper production volumes declined by 18% in the first half, compared to the previous and sales volumes were some 25% lower. This production decline was of course largely foreshadowed at analyst presentations during the course of last year and again at our 2011 results presentation here in February of this year.</p>
          <p>First half earnings were reduced by planned lower production at end of life mines including Tintaya and Ernest Henry open pit, as those operations transition to their respective expansion projects, and planned lower grades at Collahuasi.</p>
          <p>In addition, challenging geotechnical issues in Tintaya restricted mining rates, while at Collahuasi reduced production and operating conditions from an extended ball mill outage and adverse weather also impacted volumes. The combined impact of these factors on earnings was $530 million.</p>
          <p>Earnings were further reduced by $262 million, as we were forced to suspend sales from Alumbrera, as we sort to resolve temporary restrictions imposed by the Argentine government. But I am pleased to say that the situation has been resolved to the point where we have been able to resume concentrate shipments and we should fully recoup the backlog by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>There were reduced volumes in our Ferrochrome business due to lower capacity utilization to respond to power buyback requests from Eskcom, the local electricity provider. And in our Nickel business, the schedule of custom feed processing and &#x2013; meant that we processed a greater portion of lower margin third-party material which offset the positive impact of the higher mine production from our own mines.</p>
          <p>While zinc mine production was broadly flat year-on-year, higher grades at our Australian Zinc-Lead operations only partially offset lower grades at the Canadian Zinc operations, as they approached the end of their operational lives. And Antamina continues to mine its copper-rich ore zones and consequently produced lower volumes of zinc.</p>
          <p>Coal production increased by 13% in the first half as a result of increased thermal coal volumes across every division, as a result of the contribution of new mines at Mangoola, Goedgevonden and ATCOM East, the successful return to production of the Blakefield South mine and the completion of the boxcut and commencement of development at Ulan West.</p>
          <p>Thermal and coking coal volumes were also higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, as our Queensland coal operations benefited from fewer production disruptions after the impacts of wet weather and longwall moves in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Xstrata's operations generated $3.2 billion of cash during the first half and free cash flow was almost $1 billion. Investment into our proved organic growth projects continued to ramp up in what is our peak year for capital spending. Expansionary capital spending in total for the first half was $3.3 billion, around $900 million higher than in the first half of last year. Net debt increased to $11.4 billion, but despite the higher levels of investment, gearing remained at a comfortable 19% compared to 15% at the beginning of the period.</p>
          <p>Our major projects continued to make good progress and we spent just over $600 million at the greenfield Koniambo nickel project in New Caledonia, where first ore is expected to be processed by the end of this year. Engineering and procurement are now complete and construction is progressing well. Around $400 million were spent during the period to progress the Greenfield Las Bambas copper project in Peru, following the receipt of the final site construction permits in May, after some delays in getting that permit. Las Bambas is now in full construction as Charlie will outline in more detail later.</p>
          <p>The Antapaccay project in Southern Peru incurred $300 million to bring the project to commissioning as we announced earlier today. And other major items for capital spending included $270 million at the 8 million ton per annum Ravensworth North thermal coal project in Australia. And $230 million spent in advancing the brownfield Ulan West coal project.</p>
          <p>I think it is also worth noting that for the 22 approved projects which are not yet producing, but which will commission over the next couple of years, we have already invested in excess of $10 billion.</p>
          <p>In May 2012, shareholders approved a special resolution to allow Xstrata to pay dividends without deduction of Swiss withholding tax. The approved reduction of the share premium account has enabled us to create a distributable reserve, from which the payment of the 2011 final dividend of $0.27 per share, and subsequent dividend payments will also be made without deduction of withholding taxes.</p>
          <p>Our continued confidence in the medium-term outlook and our strong financial position has enabled us to continue our progressive dividend policy. And the board has proposed an interim dividend of $0.14 per share, which amounts to $414 million, and will be paid on 13 September to shareholders on the register at 31 August. As in the past, we expect to pay interim and final dividends broadly in a one-third, two-thirds ratio.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And I'll now hand back to Mick.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Trevor. So recent falls in commodity prices have, as in late 2008, sort of reignited suggestions that the recent era of elevated commodity prices and strong demand and the inability of the supply side to respond sufficiently to that demand is sort of drawing to a close, the lack of conviction syndrome. And now there is no doubt that we've reached another cyclical slowdown within a longer-term trend. Yet the fundamental drivers of the secular uplift in demand, which we based the whole thesis of Xstrata going back to 2002, continue to exert significant influence.</p>
          <p>The urbanization and industrialization of very large, young or working age populations is not yet complete and in some countries the inexorable process is only in its infancy.  Indonesia, Mexico, Russia are forecast to join China, India and Brazil as being one of &#x2013; among the largest economies by 2050, implying significant growth from this point.</p>
          <p>Now looking back through history, seismic shifts in the world such as the industrial revolution, the industrialization in the United States and Japan, the post-war recovery of the 1950s and 1960s, have all endured for more than one decade. The urbanization of China and other emerging economies is following similar trajectories, with the distinction of being the order of magnitude greater in size, pointing to perhaps to an even longer duration.</p>
          <p>But the economic cycle will of course continue to turn even within these longer term trends. And since midway through the first quarter of 2012, our <mark type="ph" /> set of radar (21:45), which is the &#x2013; uses the leading economic and end-use indicators point to cyclical economic weakness in 2012. And the short-term trough that we find ourselves in today arises from the combined impact of fiscal austerity in the OECD economies, slower recovery in the United States and tempered growth in China as that government reined in certain overheated elements of its economy.</p>
          <p>So all commodities have been impacted in the current environment and I have noted a concern however, that the current weakness in the thermal coal price might be reflecting more than just tempered cyclical weakness. And in particular the implications of shale gas for thermal coal is a current hot topic. And I thought therefore a small digression at this stage to comment on this aspect would be appropriate.</p>
          <p>Unconventional gas has undoubtedly has a role to play in meeting future energy needs. But the reality is that it is likely to remain a phenomenon largely restricted to the United States until at least 2020. And as you're aware the United States is the most advanced and exploiting shale gas and has rapidly developed the technology to recover this gas increasingly lower cost.</p>
          <p>Success in United States and exploiting unconventional gas reserves has not been easily replicated in other countries. The development has been inhibited by a range of factors including land access limitations, more complex or difficult geology that draws higher extraction costs and most importantly the lack of established pipeline or reticulation network to transport gas and this is a particular issue in Asia.</p>
          <p>So for the key industrialization urbanizing countries in Asia, thermal coal remains the lowest cost fuel source for power generation and this has fueled seaborne coal demand at growth at 8% per annum since the start of the last decade. Now, demand growth, of course, has been dominated by China, which is increasingly relying on imports to feed its incremental energy needs. Last year China consumed 3.3 billion tons of thermal coal and its demand has been growing by around 250 million tons of coal per annum.</p>
          <p>The ongoing process of urbanization will drive similar annual growth rates going forward. Now a lot of you are aware, China is in fact gifted with the world's large preserves of unconventional gas, estimated at something like 25 trillion cubic meters, and this could help feed the rapid economy and meet energy demand, obviously.</p>
          <p>But its recovery is not that easy. The gas is located in much deeper less permeable rocks, there is a lack of supporting infrastructure and most of the gas is located in dry areas without the vast volumes of water required for extraction.</p>
          <p>But that said they doesn't appear in history to be any challenge too big in China and I guess gas will eventually be exploited. But even assuming that aggressive development targets are met, this total new supply will equate to just 225 million tons of coal equivalent in 2025.</p>
          <p>So our shale gas will undoubtedly play an important role in meeting growing global demand for energy, unconventional gas suppliers represent less than 4% of global energy requirements and are projected in fact to remain below 6% in 2025.</p>
          <p>So to satisfy growing energy demands, coal along with nuclear and renewable energy will continue to provide an important source of energy in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Having done that, let me now return to how we responded to this unwelcome, but yes not unusual period of cyclical weakness. As you know, year-on-year delivery of real cost savings is a hall-mark of our approach to managing our operation and an important indictor of our operational abilities. It's our, our shop window, as it were. Our cost performance in the first half continues our unbroken record of real cost savings at every reporting period since our IPO in 2002.</p>
          <p>Now, in the early year eras, we cut costs primarily by turning underperforming, higher cost acquired assets, and turning them around. But over the last few years, operating teams have demonstrated an ability to reduce costs from a mature and more stable asset base, both in buoyant markets and in tough operating conditions.</p>
          <p>So just as in the previous years cyclical &#x2013; just as the previous cyclical downturn of the late 2008 and early 2009, we are once again taking preemptive action to ensure that our businesses remain competitive and defend margins. So as ever, our businesses have responded to the operating environment identifying substantial additional cost savings to offset cost pressures and lower prices.</p>
          <p>We now expect to reduce costs by around $970 million in total, comprising an additional $355 million of savings over the $650 million of savings provided in our original budget. Identified savings will more than offset our increased &#x2013; our expectations of increased unit costs of around $580 million for the full year excluding inflation, which arise from the inevitable cost impacts of ageing operations, which have reached the end of their lives, including from lower grades.</p>
          <p>The resultant net real cost saving for the year of around $390 million, this has to be viewed against what is a very complex operating environment in 2012, compounded by this transitioned phase of our growth strategy and the potential risk of distraction arising from the complex major discussions we've had with Glencore. But I'm very pleased with the outcome so far.</p>
          <p>Our approach to reducing costs is firmly rooted in this very core belief that our operational managers are best placed to determine how to run their sites more efficiently. We don't impose top down cost savings targets from the center. We never have. Instead, I ask every commodity business and every site manager to identify incremental improvements they can make in accordance with the specifics of their operation. And I really have to say I am constantly impressed by the commitment and drive of our people to find innovative ways to do things better tomorrow than they did today.</p>
          <p>Each of these commodity business units have identified a range of initiatives to reduce costs. And as this chart shows, the identified initiatives vary significantly between our businesses and typically comprise tens of small initiatives that together contribute a significant saving.</p>
          <p>But broadly the savings can be split into four categories, increased throughput and productivity gains, expected to contribute around about two-fifths of the savings, for example due to the accelerated ramp-up of lower costs operations or labor savings and a lot of that will come through in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Process and procurement savings from our commodity business jointly finding additional economies of scale to improve equipment availability on site will provide over a third of the total savings. So them acting together and their improving that availability is an important factor. Reducing or optimizing our use of consumables such as tyres, water and explosives will contribute a further 17% and the balance will come from energy efficiency savings.</p>
          <p>In terms of specific initiatives, our two most energy-intensive businesses, Xstrata Alloys and Xstrata Nickel, have identified efficiency improvements that will yield over $55 million in 2012, including the shift to 100% procured power at Falcondo and optimizing our ferrochrome furnace schedule to reduce the impact of higher winter power tariffs. Xstrata Copper's reorganization of its North Queensland division to a leaner organization to support its narrower focus on mine production will save around about $78 million.</p>
          <p>Improved productivity and corporate savings at Xstrata coal and an accelerated shift from third party service providers to in-house capabilities will realize over $200 million of savings.</p>
          <p>While Xstrata's Zinc continues to trim across its portfolio including around $100 million of savings from increased productivity as the new and expanded lower cost operations in Australia start-up ahead of schedule during the second half and further savings from the more efficient use of consumables.</p>
          <p>The cost savings initiatives we are implementing today are a pro-active response to current market conditions. But I guess even more importantly will yield a sustainable benefit, adding significant long-term value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now, over the first ten years, Xstrata strategy has evolved through these &#x2013; through three distinct phases. First, we pursued rapid growth through a series of well-timed and integrated acquisitions. We then transformed those assets through operation excellence and on ongoing focus on improving our sustainable performance. Our process there obviously continues today. And for the past five years, we've embarked on an ambitious organic growth strategy to effect the third phase of our transformation, which reaches it's peak this year in terms of spend.</p>
          <p>As I have already indicated this morning, this strategy has already delivered long-life, low-cost operations with embedded further growth potential. And <mark type="ph" /> clearly, Antamina (31:00) 10 major projects will reach commissioning by the end of 2012, across every business commodity. We commissioned 10 new projects this year.</p>
          <p>The impact on the quality of our businesses is striking. We will introduce seven new tier-one, world-class assets into our portfolio and expand another four. We realize significant reductions in our real unit costs in every commodity. And by way the example of 85% of our copper production in 2016 will be amongst the most competitive in the industry, in the bottom half of the industry cost curve, compared to 42% today.</p>
          <p>Average mine lives will be substantially extended, our projects will deliver robust returns on our investment throughout the commodity cycle and we will gain another raft of low capital cost, brownfield expansion options embedded within the world class assets which we are now developing.</p>
          <p>Now notwithstanding the impact of cost and other pressures on some of our projects, and you know these, it would simply would not be possible to acquire assets of this overall overarching quality and strategic fit without paying a substantially higher price than our existing capital investment. A pleasing result.</p>
          <p>Now, this slide clearly shows the transformation that our business is currently undergoing as we commission a large number of approved or going projects starting now. The Antapaccay project in Southern Peru has commenced commissioning and is on-track and within its original budget to start production this year and reach full production next year.</p>
          <p>And within a little less than the next five months, other major projects including Koniambo the greenfield nickel operation in New Caledonia, the Tswelopele pelletizing plant to improve our efficiency of the ferrochrome smelters, the Ravensworth North Stage 1 coal development in the George Fisher and Lady Loretta zinc-lead mines in Australia will also reach commissioning. These projects remain on schedule and in fact we have been able to accelerate the development of both George Fisher and Lady Loretta.</p>
          <p>A further 11 projects will commence production in the next two years and, by the end of 2014, our organic growth strategy will increase capacity by 50% in <mark type="ph" /> copper driven (33:03) terms over 2009 levels, a promise which you here are well aware of.</p>
          <p>By 2015, our major organic growth program will be substantially complete, generating increased cash flows, while our capital spending and return on capital will revert to more normalized levels and more comfortable levels following the keep in &#x2013; following the peak in CapEx this year.</p>
          <p>And following a review of our project spending, we have, as Trevor has highlighted, we've resequenced capital spending and deferred $1 billion of expenditure currently or originally planned for 2012. Consequently, our 2013 budgeted spending will increase by $400 million, with $600 million deferred well beyond that point.</p>
          <p>Now importantly, this resequencing will not affect the commissioning schedule of any of our approved projects, and no projects are therefore being cancelled. We now expect our expansionary capital expenditure in 2012 to reduce to $7.2 billion, $1 billion less than our previous guidance, smoothing the profile of capital spending across the next two years.</p>
          <p>I have to tell you the experience we have gained in successfully delivering 23 organic projects since 2002, has provided some pretty important and valuable insights. And during an ongoing review of unapproved projects, we have implemented an important lesson from previous major projects and increased the engineering work and the planning we do before approving capital projects and commencing construction. This will allow us to mitigate execution and technical risks and provide a greater level of certainty in capital cost estimates upon approval.</p>
          <p>We do continue to invest judiciously in prospective near to medium-term projects as such Agua Rica and El Pach&#xF3;n, Kabanga nickel and the Wandoan coal project to bring towards an appropriate decision on investment. The timing of approvals will be sequenced to maximize returns and account for anticipated conditions, as well as meet investor expectations, which are broadcast loud and clear on return requirements.</p>
          <p>We will maintain a flexible portfolio of future growth options to include the Cerrej&#xF3;n phase two and <mark type="ph" /> Compac (35:14) and Collahuasi phase three and four expansions, but we're going to minimize study costs while keeping those options alive.</p>
          <p>I think I want to hand over now to Santiago, who's going to talk to you a little bit about the project approved by Xstrata board, subject to final permitting approvals which we expect to come through, which is the Phase III of the McArthur River Mine in the Northern Territory. And Santiago and his team have doggedly sought to remove one obstacle after another over many years in the effort to realize the full potential of this vast resource base in the McArthur River Mine. And it's a striking example in the way in which we go about pursuing value creation within Xstrata at all levels. Santiago.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mick. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is with great satisfaction that I stand here today to present the next expansion of McArthur River Mine, the product of almost a decade of perseverance, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
          <p>From the time it was discovered in 1955, the reserve base at McArthur River was being recognized as being among the largest in the world. However, the nature of the ore and the fact that only well combined zinc and lead constitute could be produced in any volume, meant that this commercial viability of McArthur River remained in question for decades.</p>
          <p>With the advancement of the grinding technology and the emergence of the <mark type="ph" /> various smelters (36:54) in the 1990s which were able to treat bulk concentrate, McArthur River Mine finally started production of 1 million tons per annum of run-off-the-mine ore. However, the underground mine was able going to exploit two of the eight available ore bodies and encountered significant technical difficulties because of the nature of its ore. By 2002, with an estimated mine life of less than five years and rising costs the mine became uneconomic.</p>
          <p>In 2003, Xstrata acquired McArthur River as a part of the MIM acquisition. Immediately, we searched for a way to exploit the vast potential of the underlying ore body, despite the lack of technology to separate the zinc and lead and the ongoing closure of the Imperial smelters that were the key customers for bulk concentrates.</p>
          <p>First, we had to gain access to all eight ore bodies by converting the mine into an open cut operation. This is not as simple as it sounds and involved protecting the pit from the notorious seasonal rains in the area and finding an environmentally acceptable way to redirect a section of the McArthur River which ran on top of the main deposit. Our Japanese partners divested their 25% to us for $4 million in 2005, giving us a full ownership of the mine.</p>
          <p>We finally received environmental approval for the open pit in 2009 and construction was completed in 2010. We now have a mine with over 15 years life, mining 2.5 million tons of run-of-mine per annum, with around 200,000 tones of zinc concentrate but growth was still constrained by the availability of customers who could take bulk concentrates. So our first imperative was to find a technological solution to separate the zinc and lead and produce a mainstream concentrate, which would be acceptable to all the smelts.</p>
          <p>Although we had inherited MIM's Albion technology, its high CapEx and power requirements meant that even with Xstrata zinc process improvement it did not provide a compelling solution for this particular project. In parallel, we tested an advanced alternative leaching technology, which ultimately won the race. Through this proprietary low energy technology installed at the McArthur River Mine we are now able to separate the lead from the zinc, allowing us to produce widely marketable concentrate with 50% zinc rate and low lead content, suitable for use by standard electric zinc smelters including our own.</p>
          <p>With the final piece of the puzzle in place, some nine years later I am able to announce the expansion of McArthur River to 5.5 million tons run-of-mine plan, more than double current production. The full potential of the resource can finally be realized through a capital and energy efficient low operating cost, large scale and long-life open cut operation sitting on top of 50 years ore body.</p>
          <p>On 17 July, the Minister of Natural Resources, Environment and Heritage pronounced that the third phase expansion can commence, subject to the normal set of recommendations. We now await the relevant approvals from the Minister of Resources.</p>
          <p>The $360 million McArthur River third phase expansion has been approved by Xstrata Board and is expected to commission late in 2013. Producing an annualized average of 380,000 tons of zinc in concentrate per year by the end of 2014 with the proportion of conventional concentrate growing rapidly each year from the initial 200,000 tons. At the same time, costs will reduce by around 20%, reserves will increase by around 70 million tons to 115 million tons and the mine life will extend to 2038.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, this project will earn Xstrata's cost of capital at a zinc metal price of $1,340 per ton. Production will be introduced into the market at the time of projected supply-demand deficit we believe. This is a phenomenal transformation of a failing operation into one of the world's premier zinc mines, an accomplishment of which my team is rightly proud. It is a tribute to their entrepreneurship and dedication.</p>
          <p>As you already know, we are constructing two new mines and expanding another in parallel with McArthur River expansion, all of which are around halfway to commissioning. The Lady Loretta mine is due to produce first ore in November of this year. And due to a change in mine sequence, it's almost a year ahead of the original plan. We expect to produce 142,000 tons of zinc in concentrate at full capacity. The very high grade ore at Lady Loretta enables us to transport the ore 140 kilometers to be processed in the Mount Isa concentrator, avoiding the need to invest in a processing plant at the Lady Loretta mine.</p>
          <p>At George Fisher, the reclaim to the new ore block is progressing well and will enable an extra 1 million tons of ore to be produced some six months ahead of the original plan due to early lateral development. We are on track to deliver the 4.3 million tons of ore in 2013, increasing to 4.5 million tons or around 250,000 tons of zinc content from 2014. At the same time, we are in the process of commission a new crushing facility at George Fisher to accommodate the additional ore and further reduce costs.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Bracemac-McLeod project in Canada continues to be on time and within budget and is expected to commence production in the first quarter of 2013, with planned capacity of 90,000 tons of zinc in concentrate. Similarly to Lady Loretta, Bracemac is a very low capital project as it is able to make use of the existing Matagami concentrator four kilometers away.</p>
          <p>It is instructive to step back from details of each growth project and reflect on the overall impact on production and cost. The Australian expansions will increase production of zinc in Australia to over 800,000 tons by 2014 while reducing our cash cost of Mount Isa by over 50% and at McArthur River by around 20%.</p>
          <p>This will propel our Australian production into a leading competitive position on both volumes and costs. In both cases from operations, which less than a decade ago, were considered to be at the end of their lives. Overall, the growth projects I have touched on today will more than offset the production decline in end of life operations such as Brunswick and Perseverance. All are highly capital efficient. And I am pleased, with the progress made so far in constructing them.</p>
          <p>Beyond this, we have a series of other equally capital efficient projects in Australia, Canada and Ireland. Xstrata Zinc is well positioned to rise to the challenges of delivering higher return and capital efficient growth into a market, which is showing every sign of growing deficits with the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>So, I now hand over to Charlie to talk about our copper business. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Santiago. After several years of planning and development and shareholder patience, the second half of 2012 marks the inflection point for the strategic transformation of our copper business from predominately short life mines into one of the world's largest low cost copper producers, underpinned by long life assets.</p>
          <p>Following the startup of underground mining at our Ernest Henry operation late last year after open-pit mining was completed, and the successful commissioning of the major expansion by almost 40% of Antamina this March where throughput is already consistently running above the nameplate capacity, we will be commissioning a further three projects this year that lift our annualized production rates towards 1 million tons by the end of 2012. So these projects together with Las Bambas will bring our annualized copper production to 1.5 million tons by 2015.</p>
          <p>As I speak, we celebrate a very important milestone with the start of commissioning at the Antapaccay processing plant. First concentrate is expected within the next 10 weeks, but more on Antapaccay later.</p>
          <p>In Australia, I was very pleased to announce last week, the start of mining on time and within budget at our new Mount Margaret mine which is adjacent to our Ernest Henry operation in North Queensland. We were able to secure the Mount Margaret deposits and mining leases in 2011 for $175 million and have been able to rapidly advance the permitting and the development to provide additional feed to our existing concentrator at Ernest Henry.</p>
          <p>The Mount Margaret deposits will add around 30,000 tons of annual copper production to Ernest Henry over a five-year period, plus important gold and magnetite credits, strengthening the economics of the Ernest Henry complex and taking immediate advantage of the available installed capacity of the concentrator and, of course, the associated infrastructure.</p>
          <p>At Ernest Henry mining, we have successfully transitioned to an underground <mark type="ph" /> ground haulage (47:57) operation at a rate of around 2 million tons per annum that will progressively reached levels of 3 million tons per annum by the end of this year. We'll complete phase 2 of this growth project at the end of 2013 with the sinking of a hoisting shaft, which will increase the annual mining capacity to 6 million tons. Underground mining at Ernest Henry will sustain production for a further 12 years at an average of 50,000 tons of copper in concentrate per annum.</p>
          <p>In Chile commissioning of our Lomas Bayas 2 project will be completed in the fourth quarter sustaining Lomas Bayas production for further 16 years at 75,000 tons per annum. The project has involved the development of the new Fortuna de Cobre open pit mine to further supplement ore from the original Lomas Bayas pit together with additional crushing, conveying and leaching infrastructure to support the new mining operations.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased to report that we are delivering the 160,000 tons per annum Antapaccay project in Peru on time and in line with the original budget of $1.47 billion, which is a remarkable achievement for a project undertaken through a period of industry inflation and local socio-economic instability.</p>
          <p>Antapaccay is the culmination of a strategy that we initiated almost six years ago, immediately after we acquired the Tintaya operation for $750 million. In this short space of time, we have delivered $2.5 billion in EBITDA from Tintaya. We have confirmed a further 1.3 billion tons of near mine resources and we have completed concept studies, feasibility studies and now the construction of the Antapaccay project with important reinvestment in the region.</p>
          <p>Antapaccay is strategically a very important project for us. One that established a new large scale modern concentrator in the middle of a world-class mineral district, with a new mine exploiting a 1 billion ton copper mineral resource. Not only does it give us an operation with first quartile cash costs, but it does so at an industry leading capital efficiency of less than $10,000 per annual copper equivalent ton.</p>
          <p>The further potential of this mineral district is also pretty exciting. Since acquisition, we have increased the Antapaccay mineral resource base four times and we do so again today with a further 27% increase to over 1 billion tons of 0.49% copper and with gold credits.</p>
          <p>In addition to Antapaccay, we have also outlined a further mineral resource of 324 million tons grading 0.93% copper at the nearby Coroccohuayco deposit. Coroccohuayco has the potential to feed either the Antapaccay plant or the existing Tintaya mill, thereby delivering additional production for us.</p>
          <p>I am very proud to mention that Xstrata Copper has operated the Tintaya mine for the last six years and develop the Antapaccay project to the highest sustainable development standards, including an industry leading environmental performance and significant economic contributions to all levels of government. And of course, to the local communities.</p>
          <p>Our community programs in the area have benefited more than 70 separate communities in the Espinar province including a modern fully equipped hospital, a commercial dairy plant directly benefiting over 50,00 people and a major state-of-the-art educational and IT center.</p>
          <p>I am confident that despite the complex socio-political environment that resulted in violent protests during May in the province of Espinar near our Tintaya and Antapaccay operations, our genuine commitment to engage in transparent two-way dialogue and to contribute to the sustainable development of our local contribute &#x2013; communities will allow us to successfully operate in the area for many years to come.</p>
          <p>Here are some recent photos of the Antapaccay project showing progress to-date. After mine operation started in March, construction is now complete on the main equipment including the primary crusher, the stacker and the main grinding mills. Commissioning of the primary crusher has started and the commissioning of the concentrator will now progress in a series of sequential steps over the coming weeks, with first concentrate production scheduled for October of this year.</p>
          <p>Also in Peru, I am pleased to report that the major long life low cost Las Bambas project is now under full construction as Trevor mentioned, following receipt of the final site construction permit on 31 May. The workforce is now mobilized and there are in excess of 7,500 people on site. Early works and mass earthworks are underway, with the primary crusher and concentrator areas under construction along with the key project support infrastructure. All large long-lead order items have been received at our storage facilities in Southern Peru, including the two 40-foot SAG mills, the two 26-foot ball mills, the primary crusher and the four gearless motor drives.</p>
          <p>In keeping with our approach to project development aimed at reducing technical, executional and cost risks, we have elected to do more of the planning work upfront, which will smooth capital expenditure this year and next year and has allowed us to maintain a final commissioning date towards the end of 2014. To this end, we have now completed almost 90% of the engineering work and over 50% of the procurement.</p>
          <p>On this basis, we are now able to estimate the Las Bambas capital cost of $5.2 billion with more accuracy, which is a 7% increase on our previous estimate. This includes a $130 million increase resulting from permitting delays following the change in government in Peru and an additional amount related to community relocation and infrastructure costs and community agreements to mitigate the risk of further delays.</p>
          <p>Las Bambas really is a world-class tier-one project that will deliver 400,000 tons of copper per year for at least the first five years and has a life in excess of 20 years, with significant Brownfield expansion potential.</p>
          <p>Importantly, and like Antapaccay, it also has a low capital intensity of around $13,000 per annual ton of copper equivalent production and it will deliver us first quartile cash costs, further enhancing Xstrata Copper's competitive position. Las Bambas will earn Xstrata cost of capital at a copper price of $1.82 per pound.</p>
          <p>I would be remiss if I didn't touch on our joint venture operations at Collahuasi. As proud as I am of the spectacular progress of our organic growth pipeline and our operational performance, it's fair to say that recent safety and operational performance at Collahuasi does leave a lot to be desired. As you know, this is an incredible asset with a giant resource that now stands at in excess of 7.5 billion tons, grading 0.8% copper. We are determined to ensure that its full potential is realized. Along with the other major JV partner, Anglo American, we've now initiated management changes and have put in place a business improvement plan to achieve this goal.</p>
          <p>Xstrata and Anglo senior management have assumed direct leadership of Collahuasi for an initial period of three months, and all the partners are providing key staff to form taskforces in the key operational areas to assist with the transformation of the organization and to directly implement fundamental and sustainable improvement initiatives.</p>
          <p>In the first stage of the intervention, we have had 30 senior technical and management staff directly involved in the business. The initial areas of focus have been on safety management, availabilities and maintenance of key plant and equipment, mine and technical services planning and grinding and flotation optimization. It's still, of course, early days, but we have already seen improvements to the business planning, and July production operational performance is more in line with the targets that we were expecting.</p>
          <p>Following the weak first half production result, we do anticipate that the repairs to the ball mill will be completed by the end of August and, this, together with the improvement plan, will help lift performances at the operation during the second half. Production next year will be boosted by higher grades along with a commissioning of the second milling expansion from 150,000 tons to 160,000 tons per day.</p>
          <p>In summary, I'm very excited that we have reached this point in Xstrata Copper's business strategy. An enormous effort has gone into getting us here successfully by the whole team, from the optimization of our existing operations, which enabled us to mitigate fierce cost pressures and a number of mines moving towards the ends of their lives, to the parallel development of eight expansion and growth projects as a cornerstone of our business strategy. The fruits of our efforts are finally upon us.</p>
          <p>So, I'll now hand up to Ian to give you an update on the Koniambo project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm delighted to take this opportunity to update you on the good progress we're making on our Koniambo project. We are on track to deliver first ore to the furnace by the end of this year and we remain on target for approved capital expenditure. We are nearing first production. We have started to test critical systems and have already commissioned some key components of the plant and supporting mine infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the operations team is ramping up staffing and training as they prepare to take the reins and ensure smooth handover from the project team. We will begin to reap the benefits of Koniambo starting in 2013 as it ramps up to full production capacity of 60,000 tons of nickel and ferronickel within two years. It will significantly increase, of course, Xstrata Nickel's volumes, while providing a bottom second quartile cost structure for many years to come.</p>
          <p>This picture shows the current view of the smelter, power station and coal plant. The covered conveyor you see in foreground will transport pulverized coal from the coal plant to the power station. In April, we reached a major milestone when we successfully delivered first ore to the ore stockpile area. This entailed running the oil through the ore preparation plant on the mountain on which the mine is located and on to the 11 kilometer overland conveyor, to the wet ore stockpile area at the plant.</p>
          <p>The tests were completed smoothly, safely and on time. You can see the ore being unloaded into the ore preparation plant in the bottom left picture. And next to that, the ore was delivered at the end of the conveyor to the wet ore stockpile. It was a proud moment for everyone on site, of course.</p>
          <p>First metal will be produced from Line 1 in late 2012, while deliberately phased construction of Line 2 will be completed in the first half of 2013. While our efforts are currently focused on the readiness of Line 1, construction activity is ramping up on Line 2. And we expect to complete Line 2 more quickly, thanks the experience we've gained from Line 1.</p>
          <p>Today, there are 6,100 workers, around 300 less than at the peak and we continue to demobilize project teams as infrastructure is handed over to commissioning and the operations teams. This is important because it is opening up work fronts for Line 2 completion and supervision of a smaller footprint is improving productivity.</p>
          <p>The oil preparation plant pictured here is now completing commissioning. We have finished construction of the feed conveyer to the metallurgical plant, the diesel generators, the seawater intake and desalination and demineralization plants and the on-site communication control center. The next set of milestones include starting up power generation from the combined turbine generators, commencing installation of the furnace refractory which in fact began last week, completing the smelter and refinery and completing the boiler in Line 1 of the coal steam turbine generator.</p>
          <p>Pictured here is the progress made on the power plant and conveyor over the past year. As I have mentioned, the conveyor is already fully commissioned. We put together our operations management team early on so that they can work alongside the project team increasing their knowledge of the plant and the mine. We have assembled an experienced management team drawing on expertise from our Xstrata sites and within the mining industry in New Caledonia.</p>
          <p>To date, 728 operational staff have been mobilized in line with our plan. Another 140 will be in place for the commencement of production of Line 1. The extensive training program is for experienced recruits and those new to the industry, include Xstrata sustainable development requirements and expectations of workplace health, safety and management of the environment. And we are both training recruits before they arrive and once they are onsite to perform their jobs of course safely and effectively.</p>
          <p>During the commissioning phase, we are bringing in additional resources from other Xstrata sites on short-term and medium-term assignments to ensure as much as possible a smooth ramp up of the metallurgical plant and supporting facilities. We are receiving additional support from the vendors who supply key equipment and systems.</p>
          <p>From a design seeing back to 2004, through approval in 2007, the modulization of which took place in China, India and elsewhere, the shipping of the modules to New Caledonia and the on-site construction, to the mobilization of over 6,400 people of 42 nationalities on a remote island in the Pacific and finally the construction and commissioning of more than 400 systems, much progress has been made as we approached the production of first metal. We are confident in our ability to meet our goals and bring Koniambo into production.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Peter for an update on some of the coal projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thank you, Ian and good morning. Xstrata Coal is well underway with the transformation to new lower cost production through the consolidation of mines into tier-one, large scale complexes. Our track record of expanding existing mines and constructing new ones speaks for itself, including the commissioning in 2011 of the new ATCOM operation, the second of three major South African open-pit complexes that are being developed. And the commissioning of the Greenfield, Mangoola mine ahead of schedule and under budget, which achieved nameplate capacity in its first year of operation.</p>
          <p>These operations along with other recent key projects such as Glendell, Liddell and Goedgevonden have improved productivity and reduced costs across the business. The next six approved projects which commission between 2012 and 2015 will further consolidate our leading position in the industry.</p>
          <p>Of the major projects are under construction, the two most advanced are the Ravensworth North project, which produces first coal this year and Ulan West which is already producing development coal. The longwall at Ulan West will commence in 2014. Approved in December 2010, Ravensworth North is on schedule to produce first tons during the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Following the expansion of the coal handling and preparation plant facilities, Ravensworth complex will produce 8 million tons per annum of export thermal and semi-soft coking coal at full production from quarter four 2013.</p>
          <p>The project transforms the Ravensworth complex into a tier-one assets for the mine life of approximately 26 years and costs in the lower half of the cost curve. Like Ravensworth, the expansions at Ulan transform this complex into a tier-one asset with a mine life of around 18 years in second quartile cost.</p>
          <p>Ulan open cut produced first coal in April this year and is on track to produce 1 million tons of thermal coal by the end of 2012. This will be followed by the Ulan West project, which is progressing on schedule. Ulan West will establish the second underground longwall with commissioning, as I said, occurring in 2014. Ulan West is expected to produce around 6.7 million tons per annum of export thermal coal.</p>
          <p>Some years ago we set about converting what was then a disparate set of subscale coal operations in Australia and South Africa into a few large-scale and efficient complexes able to share infrastructure and equipment and benefit from the resulting economies of scale. It is indeed rewarding to now observe the strategy coming to fruition and delivering the promised benefits.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'll now hand you back to Mick</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thanks, Peter. And my god this really has been a quite long presentation. But as you can tell 2012, is really a landmark year for Xstrata and there is lot of information to share. The projects reaching commissioning this year provide a step change in the quality and average cost price throughout our business, which we have again, been speaking about for some time, and will establish the strong foundation, from which we continue to generate value for our shareholders, and for decades to come.</p>
          <p>And the completion of our current organic growth strategy will be as important in the life of Xstrata as the initial acquisition-led strategy of the first five years following our IPO, adding numerous new first tier operations to our portfolio. So we expect the volume growth we are bringing into fruition, will be well timed for a cyclical recovery.</p>
          <p>Our proactive response to the cyclical downturn will defend margins and ensure that our businesses emerge in a stronger competitive position to capture the benefits of the improved global economic growth. And in the medium term, rising demand for commodities from emerging economies, coupled I think with a ongoing industry underperformance from aging operations and increasingly complex operating conditions and deferred capital projects, will, I think continue to defer &#x2013; to continue to support commodity prices in excess of historical averages.</p>
          <p>So altogether we have a highly competitive platform from which to deliver value and a broad range of investment options to respond dynamically to market conditions and new opportunities. Following our peak CapEx this year, we expect returns to start normalizing as projects commission and deliver promised cash flows. So we will be in a strong position to weigh up growth, investment across a broad range of potential projects or value-adding acquisitions against capital returns, all the while mainlining our commitment to a robust and prudent balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now the shareholder meeting to propose the agreed merger with Glencore will now take place on 7 September. And subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter. And if completed this merger represents an opportunity to pursue the strategy I've outline here as part of an enlarged group, with enhanced growth options and a unique vertically integrated business model to capture value at each stage from mine to customer.</p>
          <p>So the next and much awaited stage of our transformation from the modest beginnings of 10 years ago, to one of the world's great mining companies, I think is in sight.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much for your attention. That brings us to end of the presentation. And as usual we will open ourselves to questions. There is a microphone. Put your hand up, the microphone will be brought to you, and then fire away.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jason Fairclough, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just, you've kind of touched on it already Mick but to what extent are your business heads planning for life as an independent company versus planning for the integration with Glencore and to what extent are those different propositions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but I think from our point of view one of the great values of this merger with Glencore is we take substantially two businesses, which join together quite easily in the sense that we have the bulk of production capability and assets sitting with Xstrata and the incredible marketing capability and trading capability of Glencore sitting with Glencore. And in fact the integration therefore at a businesses and asset level is much less complex than you would have in a normal merger type operation.</p>
          <p>The key thing here for us is to make sure that the executives who are in charge of the trading and marketing of the business and executives in charge of operating the assets, while pursuing their objectives with clear lines of accountability nevertheless mesh together to create for their commodity the most valuable proposition. And the integration process that we will be going through and have started is derived to achieve that end.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, it is really important for us that our teams at the operating assets were not deflected in any way from running of their businesses. And we see absolutely no problem in the sense that they have been continued with that focus. And in fact the value proposition of the combined Group, I think of bringing on businesses into that merger, where people are focusing on doing the best that they possibly can for those businesses, is clearly an important consideration that we had at that in mind &#x2013; that point in time, when we actually announced the merger.</p>
          <p>So I am quite pleased in fact that we've been able to keep the business focused on what they need to do, at the same time prepare the company for the merged entity and from an Xstrata point of view, clearly as we've said at the time, that this is a unique opportunity to create a business which has unique characteristics to it and an important proposition for our shareholders to have put before them. At the same time, Xstrata continues to deliver, I think great value and that value proposition is powerful under in any circumstances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just a follow-up, if that's okay, the -- so what are your thoughts on Xstrata as a standalone vehicle if this merger is voted down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the unfortunate circumstance that the merger doesn't go ahead for whatever reason. And clearly, Xstrata is well set to produce value for its shareholders. It's a great asset base, it's a great set of projects, I think it's got a very good management team and certainly good operators. So I think as a standalone entity, I have been asked this question incidentally a number of times by shareholders over the last couple of months. And I have said that I think the business model of the combined entity is a more powerful business model. That the inherent capacity of Xstrata to generate value as a standalone company remains very, very powerful indeed. And we have no concerns on that matter at all.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Liam Fitzpatrick from Credit Suisse. Just two questions just more on the business rather than the merger. Firstly on your debt levels, it increased about $3 billion in H1 and you're talking about sequencing CapEx. Do you have any specific credit thresholds that you look at that would make you sequence more aggressively in the future?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you've given a very bullish structural outlook on thermal coal, and I noticed on one of the charts you have thermal going over the 100 million tons by 2015, 2016, can you maybe comment around Wandoan and what your plans are there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the issue of balance sheet management, as I think Trevor has laid out to the market on many occasions, our primary driver is to keep Xstrata in a healthy investment grade position, and therefore metrics that guide that are clearly the gearing ratios, the cash flow ratios, et cetera. And those are the measures that we think about when we think about our balance sheet management. And quite honestly, given the way that we've structured our balance sheet over the last couple years, I don't foresee us having any issues along those particular lines.</p>
          <p>On the issue of coal, I mean, Wandoan I think remains a very, very important component of Xstrata's growth potential going forward, but it is not part of the current phase of expansion. And from our point of view it is important for us to keep that project viable and the optionality of that project strong and at the appropriate moment clearly to trigger the project in its phase. It is a fabulous resource, it's a resource which will deliver coal into the market at an appropriate time. And as we said, some time back when we look at the investments in the supporting infrastructure that it was important that we continue to ensure that that project is in a position that we can make the investment decisions at the appropriate time in the appropriate market conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Myles Allsop from UBS. Just a few quick questions, may be firstly on the coal side in terms of markets and realized prices in the second half, and how robust do you think they are. Are you seeing any of the contracts being reneged on at this point, obviously spot prices being considerably lower than the contract prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, we are fairly well sold at this point in time in terms of thermal coal and have only about 10% to go for the rest of the year. And we were able I think by seeing where the market was trending to position ourselves quite well. Certainly there are some spot cargos out there, where with traders that are seeing prices lower and are having difficulty in performing, but in general, our relationship with our customers is fairly good and we are working through those. We are not materially affected at all by this and are working through that situation.</p>
          <p>We are seeing recovery in the markets. I think the market probably bottomed about a month ago and there has been steady improvement over the last four or five weeks, where we have seen thermal prices increasing by $5 or $6 in the spot market and also looking into 2013. This is, I think being prompted by the fact that some of the US coal is out of the money now, which being helped along by the fact that we've seen an increase in oil prices, is being helped along by the fact that we are seeing a reduction of exports out of Colombia with some of the industrial issues that are happening there. So we are seeing firming and, looking a bit forward, we are positive going into Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just one quick question, it's rather around the management, retention bonuses and the changes that have happened so far since the scheme documents were released. Could you just give us a bit more color around that, where these incremental cost savings come from? Are there any more cost savings that you can envisage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can't actually give you more color but, as I said in the &#x2013; or when we announced the changes for the executive committee that the board supports very strongly the view that the retention arrangement should be there to provide a certain amount, a certain sum of money to retain people to do the job that needs to be done in a highly uncertain and complex environment. And we stand by that is an important principle.</p>
          <p>However, at the same time, it's been the view of Xstrata that having a constructive relationship with our shareholders is as important as any other factor. And given the investor unease in that, the executive committee joined me in a suggestion that we, in fact, subject our performance or our retention conditions to performance requirement, and that that performance requirement will be to find an additional $300 million worth of embedded savings, sustainable savings, over a two-year period, which would cover the full cost of any retention payments that would be in addition to anything that we have identified up to now.</p>
          <p>And now, the $500 million were the synergistic benefits mainly coming out of the marketing and trading business. And to find the additional $300 million as a result of the actual merger process, not $300 million in our existing asset base. And, to be frank with you, we didn't identify what those cost savings were, because we don't know where they are at the moment. And as we move into the merger and into the integration, we will try and determine those, as so we've gone on a considerable risk for that.</p>
          <p>But if we achieve that, we'll fund fully the retention payments and we will ensure embedded value of the company depending on what discount rate you want to use to present value the $300 million going forward, but of $1.5 billion perhaps to $1.75 billion worth of additional value. So we think it is a substantive commitment that the Executive Committee has made. But, unfortunately, we're going to have to &#x2013; you're going to have to give us some time to determine where that savings may come from and what they are, and as soon as we've got that, we will certainly tell the market about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Just on the $1 billion CapEx deferral, which projects are in there? What has changed or what's the process to make that decision on deferral? And how much of the deferral is an active decision versus being required to defer because of various exogenous impacts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trevor, do you want to pick that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A substantial portion of the deferral is Las Bambas, as Charlie indicated. Some of that was enforced on us due to the delay in the permitting. However, as Charlie said, we have used that opportunity to substantially increase our engineering and the tenure at the actual construction period when we'll be at our peak labor force. And so to the extent that we can compress that, that has a benefit and it de-risks the project.</p>
          <p>So I'd say that sort of half of it is in relation to deferral of expenditure on actual project. The rest comes in a deferral of early works on our unapproved projects. We have a number of unapproved projects which in our budget we were planning to spend significant amounts of money in early works in terms of access roads, in terms of early work, civil works before the approval of those projects. And those have been delayed, obviously, while still keeping those projects alive.</p>
          <p>So you will see $1 billion is deferred in this year, next year we're up by about $400 million. The $600 million is broadly related to the accelerated early works that we had on a number of unapproved projects. But in terms of our approved projects, we maintain our schedule and we basically maintain our capital over the period to 2014.</p>

          <p>Peter Davey from Standard Bank. Up the back, Mick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Seems Rob's jumped me on the CapEx, there. Collahuasi, what has gone so wrong there that 30 extra management have been parachuted in? Both yourselves and Anglo have been there for many years now. And outwardly it seems like everything is going okay until the mill failure. Now there's an implied far bigger problem. Can you just elaborate on that and how that's going to impact Collahuasi and the potential future plans for that mine going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I think Collahuasi is an example of a joint venture which hasn't worked too well, where say Antamina is example of joint venture with independent management that works very well. And I do think that we, as shareholders, the major shareholders, have perhaps stood back a little bit too long in terms of intervening at Collahuasi. And the mill failure is unfortunate, but there has been a series of issues of underperformance of Collahuasi over quite a long period of time, which we've reported on and which we've tried to address with the management teams in terms of changed structures and stuff like that.</p>
          <p>But I think there comes a time when you actually have to directly intervene. And the health and safety issues and the &#x2013; earlier this year, the concern about the sharpness of the plans to get every facet of that operation working effectively. And, as I said, I think both ourselves and Anglo recognizing that we had to do a short but sharp intervention and, as you say, putting some 30 odd people in place for a short period of time to really refocus and get that organization pointing in the right direction. It's such &#x2013; for me it's such a great pity that a resource with such great potential is actually not delivering on that potential. And that essentially is the thrust.</p>
          <p>So I think to some extent, we hold our hands up and say we should have done this earlier. There always are complexities in joint ventures, but there's no reason why a joint venture cannot actually act effectively. And basically Anglo and ourselves in collaboration with the other partner have decided let's get on with it and just do the right thing.</p>
          <p>Charlie, I don't know if you want to add anything to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Mick. Just a couple of points there. Peter, I think the one of the fundamental issues that we're looking to address now is to instill a management and leadership culture which is much more closely aligned with what we're accustomed to in our managed operations at all levels of the organization. And that was something that was quite difficult to do, as we'd tried over the last few years to instill through &#x2013; embedded in the organization without actually having the direct control.</p>
          <p>So that, I think, is going to be an important feature of what we're looking to see is that a leadership approach there which reflects the way we'd like to see things undertaken from a safety management systems and culture right through to, as Mick said, the planning aspects of the business and the way that we manage it through the processes and the systems.</p>
          <p>And also to insure that there is an understanding of what accountability means in setting and then delivering against budget and planning targets. And it's very important for us to get all of that correct and in place prior to taking any major investment decisions, we're talking about several billion dollars worth of potential investment decisions into the future of Collahuasi. We need to have confidence that it's an organization and a business that can deliver against its own budgets prior to making further very substantial capital investment decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it actually is a &#x2013; pays tribute to our partners, Anglo, in particular, that we have been very quickly able to reach common cause on what needs to be done and having a willingness to act on it decisively. And I'm sure we are going to see results in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to sort of put an end to that then, the potential to go to perhaps a million tons out of here is something that's a little bit longer dated now than it perhaps would have been? Get Collahuasi working properly first, then look at that whole expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We made it very clear, Peter, that we're not going to make any significant further commitments in relation to expansion projects which really means going into the major feasibility study, until such time as we've got confidence that we've got a stable, reliable organization and business. So it really depends on how quickly that can be progressed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Rene Kleyweg with Renaissance. Just a follow up on the copper questions. One, the focus on copper. If you look at the longer-term challenges in terms of optimizing the potential of those assets in Peru, the major issues going forward, you know, how much of it relates to environmental issues in terms of land availability, for <mark type="ph" /> tailing stands (1:25:17) or what capacity you already have there? How much it relates to water issues and getting communities on site, just to give us a timeframe, let's say, five, ten-year view on blue sky, how are you thinking about these things internally?</p>
          <p>And then the second question just on the additional $355 million of cost reductions that you've identified. On an annualized basis, what is that number? And if you then run an NPV on that, how is that value communicated from Xstrata board to Glencore in terms of the value that that implies on the transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure what your last question means, to be honest with you, but let me try and deal with it. We have a history of cost reductions in our business and so saving an additional $390 million this year in real cost terms is not unusual. And hopefully we will continue to do that. And our cost saving capability is well understood by the market and we continue to do that. And you can see that taking place, as we look at where our businesses sit on the cash cost curves.</p>
          <p>Now, clearly, all those things are taken into account in our valuation and no doubt the market actually values it. Glencore fully understand it, because they sit on our board. Beyond that, I have no further communication at the moment because I think it is well understood. To do with big issues in Peru, I'm not sure, again, what particular challenges you're talking about optimization. Maybe, Charlie, you can cover it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mick. Well, I think the way we see the strategic issues and challenges in Peru, the technical aspects of the business and the development of the resource base we see as relatively straightforward, in a relative sense. I guess because we've got very substantial resource bases in both the Tintaya and Antapaccay district and also Las Bambas. So with the infrastructure that's now going in there, both with Antapaccay and Las Bambas, that will set a very, very solid platform for further growth, as Mick mentioned in his presentation.</p>
          <p>The key is sustainability in a sustainable development sense and ensuring that the community and different levels of government really believe that the company is continuing to ensure that it has a good understanding of the expectations and requirements of the community. So the social expectations in Peru need to be well understood and we need to make sure that we are, to the extent that we can, delivering against the community vision for the future of those regions. And we have a very well-established management team and organization that's able I think to understand the various issues in that context and to work with the communities in delivering the vision that the communities have for future development of those resources.</p>

          <p>Peter Davey. Just &#x2013; Trevor, just give us an understanding the basis behind the write down of Lonmin, because it's not mark-to-market. So how do you arrive at $500 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've looked at is we've looked at the outlook for Lonmin on a standalone basis given their guidance in terms of their growth projects and their existing operations. And, clearly, when we initially looked at Lonmin and when we bought the initial stake, we had the perception that we were ultimately going to move to a control position and we could accelerate a number of those projects and the number &#x2013; and, indeed, the growth in operations themselves.</p>
          <p>In the period post, you see where our views have moderated on our ability or the attractiveness of our buying out the full stake. We've had to be guided by what Lonmin can do as a standalone company. And it's become very evident since in this last period that given the state of the platinum industry in South Africa and given the liquidity within Lonmin's balance sheet, that a number of those projects are going to be delayed and, indeed, the growth within the company is going to be delayed. So, we've net present valued the value of that asset.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Alison Turner from Panmure Gordon. What I wanted to ask about is you're not alone in the industry in expressing a commitment both to maintaining a stable balance sheet, but also to progressive dividends as well as some fairly punchy CapEx numbers barring some minor tweaking of those.</p>
          <p>If the short-term trough in commodity prices turns out to be longer-term, how sacrosanct are those different elements? How sacrosanct is the dividend, for example, and how do you think about that trade off vis-&#xE0;-vis deferring CapEx and, again, compared to the potential acquisition opportunities which might be out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think our major priority going into this period of extended and enhanced capital expenditure was to ensure we had a balance sheet that enabled us to complete that program without losing our investment grade. And I think we've done that.</p>
          <p>If we were to try and draw a halt on our approved capital program at the stage we're at now, that would be incredibly expensive and value destructive. So, clearly, my primary priority was to enter this period of accelerated capital spend with a balance sheet that could sustain very extreme headwinds in terms of pricing.</p>
          <p>Given our outlook for commodities, even if you run a downside case, we still think that we will be able to maintain a progressive dividend because we think that ultimately our shareholders do respect that and they do want that. I would hope that the yield will go down as our share price increases, but I think that it is a very affordable dividend policy in the current environment.</p>
          <p>What we did allude to earlier on is that we have a number of projects that follow on from our approved project pipeline, which, clearly, we can moderate according to economic conditions at that time. And to some extent, our decision to defer some of there early stage works reflects that, although it also reflects just the state that the projects are in.</p>
          <p>So, I would like to say there is very little flexibility in our approved capital program at the moment. It would be expensive to moderate that. Obviously, we could, but it would be expensive to do that and I think value destructive. But I think that we can not only do that, but we can maintain our dividend.</p>
