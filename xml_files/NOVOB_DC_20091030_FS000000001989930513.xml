          <p>Okay, so I think we'll &#x2013; we'll just get going now.  So on behalf of Credit Suisse, it's a real pleasure to have Novo Nordisk'senior management in London here with us today.  And from Novo I'm sure you all know the guys here pretty well.  We've got Jesper, Chief Financial Officer; Mads, Chief Scientific Officer; Lars, Senior Vice-President, Finance; along with the Investor Relations teams with Mads, Kasper and Hans.  Thanks to all you for coming today.  I know it's a busy results day again today.  So, with that I'll hand over to Jesper</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kevin.  We've tried to learn a little bit from the feedback we've had on our quarterly roadshows and then we've heard from some of you that you feel that some of the slides we are showing every quarter, so we may do this presentation slightly faster.  So, let's see whether we succeed with that today.  First of all, of course, I need to advise you that we will be making predictions about the future, especially making predictions about how 2010 is going to evolve, the regulatory process for Victoza and the U.S. healthcare reform is difficult to predict and of course even more significant uncertainties which you can read a lot of more about in this forward-looking statement slide.</p>
          <p>I'm going to cover today highlights of our quarterly release and I'm going to cover an update on sales, then I will request Mads to give you an update on our pipeline, and Lars Green, our Senior Vice President from Corporate Finance will cover financials and outlook, and then I'll be rounding up and we'll be doing a Q&amp;A session, which I will moderate from here.  And unfortunately we only have approximately something like 50 minutes to do this, so we have to do it rather fast.</p>
          <p>We first look at the highlights of the quarter another quater In fact the thirtieth quarter in row where Novo Nordisk delivered at least double-digit growth in our top line and we've had a lot of tailwind the first three quarters of this year.  Now, we have 4% so reported sales, 15%, but do bear in mind how it's developing over the year.  We started with six, 6.5%, now we're down to four and we are only predicting that for the full year it's going to be 1.5% and that is intrinsically having the effect that the final quarter of the year will have something like 6% negative currency impact.  So, the currencies have really come around significantly.  Our portfolio continued to be driven by the modern insulins growing 28% and of North America as our largest sales region growing by 29% reported terms.</p>
          <p>One of the key swing factors we have is of course the approval process for liraglutide.  It's in the final phases.  We should anticipate that we in the coming weeks we'll get a feedback, so we will have a formal feedback from the FDA before the end of this year.  We have started the Phase III clinical programs for our second-generation modern insulin SIAC and SIBA. We expect to enroll approximately 10,000 patients in these trials and I'm sure Mads will elaborate a bit more on those trials in his section.</p>
          <p>NovoRapid, the high mixes NovoRapid Mix and NovoRapid 50 and NovoRapid Mix 70 have now been proved in Japan and that was the final missing link in the first-generation of modern insulin and actually the high mixes are rather important in the Japanese markets.  Remember, mix constitute almost &#x2013; mix insulin constitute almost 50% of the Japanese insulin market and we expect to launch these products as soon as we have reimbursement fixed, so that would be in the first half of next year.</p>
          <p>Financials continue to show an expansion of our gross margin, 250 basis points improvement to 79.5%, 100 basis points help from currency, but still a 150 basis point underlying improvement.  Operating profit growth reported 30. Currency has helped approximately 10%, so we had just under 20% in local currency terms and then we had the benefit from last year of having closed down our pulmonary insulin.  So, if we adjust for that, the underlying growth is just around the 15% long-term target we have for growth in operating profit.  We still also &#x2013; we are also expecting around the 15% mark for the full year 2009.  We've also given some indication as to where 2010 is going to be.  And if we look &#x2013; take it first in local currency terms; we have three factors which are quite important for the development in Novo Nordisk turnover next year.</p>
          <p>If we take them one-by-one, I've already mentioned the first of them which is a uncertainty surrounding the approval of the liraglutide or Victoza in the U.S.  The second is the outcome of the U.S. healthcare reform process which could have a significant impact on our top line and of course also on the operating profit and we could &#x2013; we preliminary estimate that it could be an impact through the June of one to 2% of global sales.  Although it is very uncertain what is the precise outcome be and what is the specific timing of the individual element, when are they going to be effectual from.</p>
          <p>And then the final element is repaglinide Prandin in U.S., NovoNorm in Europe, our oral tablet for diabetes care treatment that has gone off patent in the U.S. and will go off patent in Europe.  In terms of the original patent, we have a combination patent that do protect us in the U.S. that is being &#x2013; being disputed by a generic manufacturer and that is currently involved in litigation in the U.S.  And we'll have to see how the courts will rule on that, and I think we'll have more clarity on that front within the next six months, but until then we have not yet seen generic competition in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The European patents are country-based patents and those will begin to expire at the turn of this year and then into 2010-11 and hence we should anticipate that some generic competition could emerge also in Europe, although in Europe we also have a combination patent covering the combination use of metformin and repaglinide, so the effect there is also uncertain.  And as a consequence of that we decided to go for a indication of our turnover goal as a range and not as a specific number.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating profit, we this basically wanted to give a floor and say if we are that bottom range of the top-line growth then we will at minimum deliver more than 5% growth in operating profit, and of course if we are at a more positive end of the scale it could be a much higher.  But of course then you have to look into what of the parameters I've just mentioned before was actually panning out to give the growth in top line and then from there estimate what the full-year number is going to be.</p>
          <p>We've also indicated that there will be a significant negative currency impact next year, top line approximately 3.5% negative and an operating profit currently looking at around 7% negative impact from currencies on operating profit, but do bear in mind that the hedging policies that we have leave us with a income on the same major currencies which we record underneath financials.  So, the affect will have on operating profit will be offset by similar positive effect we anticipate in the mid financials.</p>
          <p>And that was the comment I wanted to a give on 2010, which was quite elaborate.  Then I'd like to move on to just talk about number of patients with diabetes.  This is the key driver for Novo Nordisks' business.  And we've included this slide to illustrate to you that as we see updates from the International Diabetes Federation on the number of people with diabetes in the world, we each time seen increase in the estimate of how many people that actually have diabetes.  And so if you go back to &#x2013; to last year's -- last edition, they were estimating that there was the around of 245 million people with diabetes in 2007, and now that estimate has been altered to 285 million by 2010.  So, we see a significant increase every time they upgrade it and furthermore, we also continue to see a significant growth to the tune estimated of around 5% year-on-year in number of patients with diabetes.</p>
          <p>If we look at the current estimate of 285, that is currently excepted to grow to &#x2013; by 2030 to 400, almost 440 million people. Of course a very significant part of the growth going to come from what Novo Nordisk refer to as international operations, the developing countries and up here, of course China and India are the two most significant ones.  Also note that healthcare costs will increase, maybe not fully in line with the number of people with diabetes, as a significant number of these patients will be cared for in the developing countries at a lower average cost per patient.  But still if you look at the significance of diabetes healthcare cost, it is more than 10% of global healthcare cost.</p>
          <p>And then move on to the sales development for Novo Nordisk.  Diabetes care remains the key part of our business.  It covered 76% of the growth and we saw it grow in reported terms 15% and in local currency terms around 11% and you are seeing a continued switch from human insulins towards the modern insulins.  Our human insulin franchise is still growing in the international operation markets, but in the developed countries we are seeing a decline in the human insulin business at the expense of modern insulins.  Also like to highlight that we continue to show very solid growth for both our NovoSeven franchise and Norditropin programs, growing around 10%.</p>
          <p>In terms of the &#x2013; on a regional split, North America remains the bigger market in Novo Nordisk covering 36% of our sales on reported terms and it's covering half of the growth coming from North America.  So, when we also talk about Victoza and the importance of getting this product approved in the U.S., you can see from this distribution of growth why we do believe that U.S. is a critical market for us.</p>
          <p>International operations continue to grow quite significantly, though in local currency terms only growing 16%.  There you see a slight effect of the impact that the global recession have on the patients' abilities in these markets to actually pay for the medicine. So, we are below the trend growth which we believe in these market should be around 20%.  Still they cover almost 30% of the growth in Novo Nordisk business.</p>
          <p>If you look at what are the expectations for growth and you saw a modest level of growth in Europe, we believe that that really has to do with the development that we see on a regional basis in the insulin volume growth.  First, let me just give a comment on international operations.  Here &#x2013; here you actually see the slight decline in insulin volumes that we have seen following the economic recession and we believe that is linked to the lower ability by patients of handling their co-pays and hence we're seeing a slightly lower volume growth.  One should assume that if we have a more stable economic development, the regional growth in IO should probably move back again towards the 20% level.</p>
          <p>Also note that the world volume growth is rather stable and actually stays above the 5% volume growth year-by-year; that's really been driven by the number of people with &#x2013; people with diabetes as I just illustrated on one of the pervious slides.  If you look at the development in Europe, part of the reason why we are seeing a rather slow development in Europe is that we have a slightly below trend growth currently in Europe.  We believe that that will revert to the 5% level and then Europe should go back to growing in a level above 5% for Novo Nordisk.</p>
          <p>In terms of North America, here we are seeing a high growth level and it's actually one of the highest growth levels we've seen in the last decade.  So, there seem to be a good movement towards diagnosis in the American market and overall I think to the right you can also note that the developing markets now constitute 15% of the world market and this will continue to increase.</p>
          <p>Look at the second value driver on top of the more insulin volumes assumed at least 5% year-on-year, the other key swing factor for us is the value upgrade that we get when we convert patients from human insulin towards the modern insulin.  And as you can see from this slide, that process is going quite stably on.  All new patients seem to be started on modern insulin and hence we are seeing a conversation rate going on at five to 6% year-on-year.  But of course, developing markets like for example China did not come this far, they may be only currently at the 20% level.  And in terms of the market share, Novo Nordisk continues to expand our market share within the modern insulins.  We are the only player with a full portfolio of modern insulins on the market around the world.</p>
          <p>In terms of the individual three segments you can also see that we are seeing a steady and positive development for the each of the three brands.  Novo Nordisk was not first in the three segments, but we have steadily been able to increase our market share in all of the three segments and you also see that illustrated in quite handsome growth rates for each of the three products.  And I think when we get through the turn of the year, maybe early into next year Novo Nordisk will have a portfolio of three blockbuster insulins with our modern insulins.</p>
          <p>And then finally, I'd like to make a comment on Victoza.  We've rolled out Victoza in three countries now in Europe, following the approval at the mid this year.  The first market where we are significantly active is Germany, as we have reimbursement in Germany currently.  And there we are seeing that the launch of Victoza is enabling a significant expansion of the share of the diabetes market that GLP-1 takes.  You can see that not only are we catching in on Byetta but we are actually together expanding the market towards the 3% level of overall diabetes care.  There is high enthusiasm among both key opinion leaders and GPs in Germany for a drug which enables patient to only inject them self once a day given a significant HbA1c effect, getting a reduction in their blood &#x2013; sorry, in their weight, and also have a positive effect on blood pressure.  And all this they are doing in the absence of risk of hypoglycemia and hence the need to measure their blood sugar multiple times a day.</p>
          <p>We're seeing also a very positive development here in this country, United Kingdom.  Although it is much more a gradual process in U.K to get acceptance in terms of formulary access, we estimate that we currently probably have access to approximately 20% of insured lives.  And in Denmark, we've actually gotten full reimbursement and we have in a few weeks actually just gotten to 40% of the GLP-1 market.  We believe that we will continue or we'll continue to rollout our products throughout Europe and a number of Northern European countries will launch at the turn of this year.  The key issue for us is to ensure that we have reimbursement when we launch and then we will continue to bring it out in a European setting</p>
          <p>And with those comments, Mads, over to you to update.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I also try to be brief.  Very quickly two external events that I think of some relevance in this audience is on the one hand that we have seen around ten days ago publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of what is the longest randomized controlled trial within insulin therapy both initiation and intensification in type 2 diabetes using Novo Nordisk modern insulins, Levemir once daily, NovoMix twice daily or NovoRapid three times daily at meal times.  Interestingly the data were favorable both for the once-daily basal and for the premix approach towards initiation.  Now, moreover there has been release from the American Academy of Clinical Endocrinology and the American College of Endocrinology of some guidelines that stress how they believe that incretin used in particular GLP-1 agonists, but also insulin analogues should be a very important elements in future therapy driving glucose levels towards the target range with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.  So, clearly, there is a movement towards understanding how the ACCORD trial has influenced the way of thinking of glucose being driven down in a safe non-hypoglycemic way.</p>
          <p>Now, Jesper has mentioned most of the highlights from the diabetes pipeline, so I will actually not to say much more apart from the fact that we are awaiting as all of you are the Victoza outcome from the FDA this quarter and that SIBA and SIAC essentially are driving a very nice recruitment performance in Phase III.  We have initiated the second wave and the common theme here is that we seek to improve the treatment success rate i.e., show that these two products have the ability to bring glucose levels below seven in the absence of hypoglycemia to significant higher extent than the comparative products Lantus, NovoMix and others.</p>
          <p>If we look at hemophilia and homeostasis, a few phase shift have happened.  We have been able to initiate a Phase I subcutaneous study for a long-acting factor VIIa derivative, which could represent a paradigm shift in the management of hemophilia, if the buyer viability ends up justifying further commercial development.  Also we have announced the advent of a long acting, probably once-weekly factor IX derivative in Phase I and a phase shift from Phase I to II of the long-acting intravenous factor VIIa derivative for prevention of bleedings in inhibitor patients, known as NN7128.  The final update here is that the short-acting NovoSeven successor analogue, NN1731 will be a wee bit delayed in reporting of Phase II.  This is not due to recruitment issues but rather the fact that patients who have long been on board are bleeding with a lesser frequency than we originally had hoped for.  We now expect that the in line phase of the trial will complete during Q2 of next year.</p>
          <p>Finally, there is not much to say on the other biopharmaceuticals, other than we are very happy that we were able to inaugurate our latest research center, which is with Cytokine Biology on the U.S. West Coast.  We think there is a great momentum over there and the scientists we have on board, they do bode well for our future ability to enter products into the clinical pipeline within autoimmune disease.</p>
          <p>With that, over to you Lars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads.  Just a few comments on the financial results.  Jesper has covered the development in sales with a reported growth of 15%.  Gross margin improved and as Jesper said one percentage point or so came from better currencies, the 1.5% underlying improvement is the combination of still better yields in our production, both in the area of bulk and also secondary production, filling and packaging, and there it has also contributed to higher prices in the U.S. that is also adding part of the improvement in the gross margin in 2009.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales and distribution costs, we have increased our investments in this field growing reported terms at 20%, of course also sort of the boosted by the development in currencies.  This should be seen also in the light of the numbers on the bottom of this page, the number of full-time employees where more than half of the expansion in full-time employees from last year to this is related to increased sales forces in the U.S. and a number of European markets, in China and few other international markets.  So, therefore the increase here is very much related to our expansion of those sales forces to keep up with the competitive pressures and also in preparation for launch of Victoza.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D cost fairly limited the development, but if we do take out the once-off cost last year  which was the close of the pulmonary project, there is an underlying expansion in the R&amp;D activities of some 5% or so, but still lower than where we expect to end up for the full year, as we have now started the recruitment for significant Phase III programs for SIBA and SIAC.  So, therefore we do expect fourth quarter R&amp;D ratio to be higher than for the first nine months, and therefore the full year to be somewhat above the current levels.</p>
          <p>Admin costs growing 8%, somewhere just below 5% when we adjust for currencies.  So, still an improvement sort of in the efficiency of the overall administrative areas of the company relative to sales.</p>
          <p>So, operating profit growing 30, boosted by development in currencies and we have the opposite effect on our financial lines, where we last year had income from hedging this year, expenses.  So, profit before tax 14, development in tax rate slightly positive and therefore net profit 15% growth, and earnings per share even 18 with the ongoing share repurchase program.  And here you see the development of the currencies over the last couple of years.  And as you'll see, this is the third quarter was the last time where we would have tailwinds in terms of reported impact, so, fourth quarter we are looking at a steep headwind and therefore as Jesper alluded to, there'll be significant negative impact on reported numbers compared to the underlying development both on sales and on profit.</p>
          <p>Therefore we have updated our financial guidance for the rest of this year where with sort of an unchanged expectations for full-year sales development of 10% in local currencies, the reported terms is now a little bit lower at 1.5% higher.  In terms of operating profit, we have upgraded the underlying expectations from before 12 to 14% growth to now 15 in local currencies and then a slightly lower impact from currencies, 3% compared to previously four.  That negative impact from currencies is then spilling over into the financial items, where we now expect financial expenses to be around 750 million kroner.  The effective tax rate, still 23.  Our capital expenditure, we have reduced our expectations to 2.5 billion approximately, since we have slightly different phasing of our CapEx related to our filling facility that we are now constructing in China primarily and therefore we have also upgraded our cash flow expectations to now at least 11 billion.  And as Jesper alluded to some preliminary plans for 2010 and I think I'm not going to say more about that; you covered that already, Jesper.</p>
          <p>So, with those words, over to you, Jesper, for a conclusion there and the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Lars and Mads, if I can ask you to be all there then we get on mic.  This slide is now innovated.  We are in exactly the same leadership position as we've been throughout the last couple of years.  We have a growing insulin market, as illustrated.  We have a promising GLP-1 compound, we certainly also need to have it approved in the U.S., <mark type="inaudible" /> ambition for our hemophilia portfolio and also a very strong position in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Weathering the challenging environment is just illustrated here.  We've talked about the regulatory hurdles.  We have also mentioned the healthcare reform in the U.S., which is of significance.  And with those remarks and I will &#x2013; will hand it over to &#x2013; to Q&amp;A.  So, we'll take it from here and I think we'll spend approximately 20 minutes on Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Michael Leacock from RBS.  Hi, just a couple of questions.  Jesper, just looking long term at your free cash flow before R&amp;D and then how you're applying that cash flow in terms of either your R&amp;D investments, dividend, share buyback...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...Whatever, do you see the &#x2013; that ratio that split changing over the longer term?  Do you feel you're really spending enough in the R&amp;D side of things or too much for that matter?  And then secondly, just a question on Japan and Oceania, I think we've seen your market share seems to be moving downwards a little bit there...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I read the chart correctly in terms of volume growth that also seems to be going down.  Can you just tell us what is going in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Well, if you take &#x2013; if you take the cash flow usage, of course investment in R&amp;D has long-term been a significant element of our P&amp;L structure and I expect it continue to be so.  In fact, when we made the long-term financial targets of mentioning that we wanted to get to an operating margin of 30%, we actually also said that we were assuming that we would do that while we were gradually expanding our R&amp;D ratio to a level of around 18, and that would still be our hope.  I think what we're seeing, currently because of the delay in our ability to start the cardiovascular trials for Victoza and the challenges with moving on with the obesity trials for Victoza with almost double the doses compared to the insulin  -- no, sorry to the diabetes-care use, that is basically holding down the R&amp;D ratio.  And then of course also longer term also starting the Phase III trials for semaglutide, our once-weekly compound has also kind of been held up by the process with the FDA on Victoza.</p>
          <p>And as a consequence, we are seeing at 15% what I would refer to as an unusually low R&amp;D ratio.  There is no strategic ambition from our side in the expanding the operating margin at the expense R&amp;D &#x2013; I would almost say on the contrary.  So, there the 30% is certainly assuming that we'll get to 18%.  I think in terms of could we expand it even more?  It of course has to do with what are your pipeline opportunities currently.  I don't think there's a lot of things that you can buy in the area of diabetes care that would really be meaningful to us.  So, I think in the near term I think 18% is a meaningful guidance.  If we are really successful with the early-stage inflammation compounds, if we can take all insulin and all GLP-1 through the clinical pipeline, I'd love to get into challenges on that front, but that's certainly three to four years out.</p>
          <p>In terms of Japan and Oceania; it is right, we noted that we have seeing a slight drop in the insulin volume growth in Japan.  We're not reading any long-term pattern into that.  I think the diabetes care that we see in the Japanese population is slightly different from what you see in Caucasians, so they become quicker insulin dependent and we don't have any signs in the Japanese population that there is a trend diagnose &#x2013; trend changes in diagnosis.  In fact, on the contrary, we actually do believe that GLP-1 could be a unique product in a Japanese setting.  Do note that when you look at our Phase III trials for approval in Japan, which both had Japanese, Chinese and Koreans in those studies, there you we looking at HbA1c reductions from my recollection in the 1.7 to 2.0 in HbA1c points, which compares to the typical 1.3 to 1.5 which we've seen in Caucasians for the regulatory studies used in U.S. and Europe.  And so we believe that it's actually is going to be a very attractive and highly efficacious product.  And it's also interesting for the Japanese market that we're going to be the first with the GLP-1 there; we were the first to file for approval and if everything goes well there, Mads, I think we'll probably be somewhere in the first half of next year, may be first quarter.  Let's see how it plays out.  On approval, we already commented to that....</p>

          <p>So, I think in terms of diabetes care situation, we're stabilizing the situation.  We have seen a slight expansion of the basal share of the Japanese market now constituting more than 20% -- it came from a level of 20% of the Japanese market and now you've more in the 25% ballpark for basal insulin.  And of course, with two players there and Sanofi coming from scratch with <mark type="inaudible" /> we are losing a little bit of share in that segment, and I don't think near term there's any significant changes in that picture.  Yes, next question.  Yeah, there in the corner.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jack Scannell, Sanford Bernstein.  Just two questions, the first given what was the rapid uptake of liraglutide in Germany, do you know where those patients are coming from?  Are they people who tried Byetta, found it intolerable and been sitting around waiting for GLP-1 or they sort of &#x2013; are they de novo patients?  And possibly related to that, do you have any sense about real-world tolerability given the experience you have in your trials?  How the differences actually work in clinical practice?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is around international.  Now, the U.K.'s NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] has started exporting its expertise to countries like China and elsewhere; biotech manufacturing is getting a lot cheaper.  I just wonder whether we should think of international buying process.  For example, might tender markets be more at risk in future, given the fact biotech provided some of the manufacturing costs coming down and perhaps some of these countries are looking at healthy economic messages from the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if I just deal first with the uptick of Victoza in Germany and then maybe Mads you can comment a little bit on tolerability, and then I'll revert on how we see the process of NICE exporting their expertise around the world and then how &#x2013; what implications are.  If we take &#x2013; if take Germany first, I think our experience so far is that we are seeing some patients moving from exenatide to our product as they can get through a once-daily in a slightly higher effect.  You also see that from the chart I showed that there seems to be a slight decline in the uptick of Byetta and to some degree with recapturing some of those patients.  But on top of that we're certainly also getting more new patients coming in there; a significant proportion of them are oral &#x2013; patients failing on oral tablets and we have actually also in Germany seen a few coming from insulin.  I don't think it's a significant trend on the insulin, but so far those were the three sources.</p>
          <p>I think what is crucial for us is that we can continue to expand the GLP-1 market share of the total market and it's going be one of things which are interesting would be whether it will be replicated what we saw at the launch of Byetta in the U.S., where the first two years when Byetta was growing quite significantly, there was actually no impact on the insulin volume growth in the U.S.  And what we don't know yet in an European setting is what is going be the long-term indication.  Can the GLP-1s grow hand-in-hand with the insulins?  And also I think interesting, we actually currently doing a trail which is investigating the combination use of GLP-1 and insulin where there is a significant anecdotal experience on Byetta that seems that these two product actually can go very well hand-in-hand for type 2 diabetes patients.  Maybe a little bit on tolerability, Mads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then just a few comments.  I was talking to a number of German doctors at the EASD Meeting, I guess some of you have done the same actually.  But, business experts saying no doubt that the messaging surrounding the second-line possession i.e., at the advent of Metformin failure is going down well, so, we are really &#x2013; I think succeeding in positioning the drug where we originally set out to do so.  But Germany is a little bit special.  In that we have seen the basal insulin analogue particular Lantus take a hit there because of the Diabetologia papers.  It's harder in Germany than elsewhere and for that reason we actually have seen some shifting from Lantus to &#x2013; successfully, so that maybe you can say more than you would expecting in that situation.  Clearly, we wanted more upfront in the treatment cascade.</p>
          <p>In terms of tolerability, it is interesting to note that both on the efficacy side and on the safety side doctors' feedback to us and among themselves when they meet is actually that both look better than in the clinical trials, and there are some reasons for that.  Because in the clinical trials you got to have very stringent inclusion criteria that you simply must adhere to and henceforth that means that you get a kind of both the patients that were ideal for this treatment and also ones that just fulfill the criteria for being included.  Where as in a real-life sitting, people tend to select patients who are motivated, who want the drug and who are good candidates for the drug.  So, for instance the three kilograms weight loss we have seen in the chemical trials, it's very often reported at least in the physician's anecdote to be more in the ballpark of what they see like five kilos in the average patient.  And again, at least it's nice to see that in a real-life setting if anything is going in the right direction.</p>
          <p>With regards to tolerability, it is from the meta-analysis from the B program that one out of every seven patients experience transient, mostly mild somewhat with nausea as all of you recall, and in real life we're seeing no more than that.  Actually, I think the physicians have heard so much about nausea and vomiting for the GLP-1 class, and it is been seen quite a bit of it for Byetta because Byetta has this quick onset of action which tends to immobilize the stomach completely so that essentially they are also positively surprised in that regard.  So, at this point, I would say we haven't had any negative vibes surrounding the systemic tolerability or local tolerability of this product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of the question on Mads' exporting the expertise, I think it's been an ongoing process and it's not only towards the developing countries but also through the other countries in the European Union.  And I think it's becoming an ever more important part of our late-stage project phase to basically have ever stronger pharmacoeconomic documentation.  And I think the stress test what we're going to have on this is our ability to get reimbursement on Victoza throughout Europe.  So far it looks positive.</p>
          <p>We actually have a similar institute like NICE in Denmark and whereas we didn't manage to get straight approval or reimbursement approval in Denmark for Levemir, we've actually managed to get straight reimbursement for liraglutide.  So, it seems that the documentation that we are &#x2013; we are doing, early stage seems to be working,  the jury is still out.  It's a crucial part of our documentation.</p>
          <p>In terms of increased use of tenders, I don't anticipate that that will be the near-term effect in the Chinese setting, but we are certainly seeing tenders are being used in a number of developing markets.  A big one could be for example, Brazil.  And what we are also seeing is that these tenders are used as reference prices for a number of other markets of what level of prices will be allowed in those markets.  So, I think near-term the prime implication will be extra cost in terms of documenting the pharmacoeconomic proposition of our portfolio to regulatory authorities around the world.  Next question, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My name is &#x2013; my name is Jacob Thrane from Standard and Poor's.  Just a practical question on the plant delay in China, could give a little more color to what the sort of shift in phasing in in construction is about, what is really behind this?</p>
          <p>And secondly, now Mads mentioning the Diabetologia papers on Lantus and Levemir.  Although you mentioned the situation in Germany as being perhaps let's say nonstandard, would you expect any further sort of recruiting an increased risk for rejection on Lantus and then the creating an upside for Levemir tab?  And thirdly, on taspoglutide data, any requests from FDA?  Are you aware of anything the FDA's doing on that respect of the upcoming approval or at least feedback on liraglutide?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if I deal with plant in China and also I can give you the straight answer on taspoglutide, which will be this of course on information on taspoglutide you'd have to revert to the sponsor which is Roche and Ipsen and ask them. In terms of the plant in China, the &#x2013; what we are looking at here is the slight movement in our cash flow for payment of that plant and it may be a few months that it's going to be later.  And it's basically linked to that we are not pushing the timeline on the Chinese facility, as we have high levels of efficacy on our filling plants around the world.  And in fact the productivity level and the efficiency we're getting out of our large facility in Brazil is developing even faster than what we anticipated going into the year.  And hence, we don't have a bottleneck situation for a Chinese plant, so there is no significant change.  So, it's basically a shifting of a few hundred millions Danish kroner investment sum between 2009 and 2010.  We don't see any significance in that.  We still expecting it to be completed and ready for production somewhere around 2012, so no significant change there.  Mads, comments on the Diabetologia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think this obviously is a moving target.  We have two very different situations for Lantus and Levemir.  For Lantus, the situation is that the company has apparently committed to do three lines of research to further investigate the either lack of or presence of a correlation between Lantus treatment and the diagnoses of the cancer, in particular mammary cancer.</p>
          <p>And in that regard, they have committed to do further animal work, preclinical pharmacology experiments to investigate in certain animal models whether <mark type="inaudible" /> has such association.  They've also committed to do a coupling of certain Northern European cancer registers with diabetes registers aiming to see on a &#x2013; if the immunological observational study basis whether there is such correlation and likewise, I believe, a U.S.-based health insurance database &#x2013; claims database analysis.</p>
          <p>My feel is that this is probably something they are doing in dialogue you can say with the relevant agencies.  Novo Nordisk has not had any communication at all with neither the FDA nor the EMEA on this topic, neither as regards to Levemir, nor as regard to the SIBA and SIAC.  But you can also see our situation somewhat different in that we have in vitro not only published years ago, a series of cell lines, where we actually see lower mitogenic potential for Levemir than for human insulin, but we have also repeated those studies and expanded them in human cell lines either containing or not containing IGF-1 receptors on the surface.  And quite clearly, in contrast to for instance Lantus and the cosmogenic or tumorigenic X10 analogue.  We are on the other side of &#x2013; let's say the human insulin mark i.e. on the low side, whereas the others tend to increase cell proliferation.</p>
          <p>So, if we also look at the clinical situation our randomized controlled trial meta-analysis has revealed, actually a statistically significantly reduced potential for cancer diagnosis among the Levemir treated patients compared to human insulin treated patients.  Now, you can say is that absolute 100% proof that Levemir is safe.  Of course it's not 100%, but it's very close, I think it's pretty robust data.  Now, does that mean anything commercially?  Of course it means that some physicians will always think on balance, if they have a patient where there is a family history of cancer, they are little bit worried.  He will of course maybe opt for what they consider the safe option.  But I think what can really move the market dynamics is if any of these lines of research that Sanofi are pursuing now end up with less than fortunate data that of course will be kind of the one-two blow to that product, but as it stands right now, it's a relatively stable situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Kevin, we'll take final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Gavin MacGregor, Credit Suisse.  Jesper, one question for you, the EU market you've had a tough first half.  You said that you think that's stabilizing now, returns turn stabilizing sort of 5%.  Can you give a bit more color what's been going on there?  And then Jesper, sorry, Mads a question for you, Mannkind are awaiting a FDA decision on their inhaled insulin in January, thoughts on that and remind us around the problems that were faced with <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  The EU situation, we believe that there are two factors that actually have helped the growth down in Europe.  The first one is the development in Eastern Europe, where we have seen reimbursement challenges in a number of Eastern European countries like Bulgaria and Romania.  And in fact, we've had almost half a year, where we have not been importing the modern insulins to Romania.  I think there is now a solution to that situation and then we'll be re-importing.  So, you're basically seeing an emptying of our pipeline and you've also seen some challenges in some of the Baltic countries and that has left everything else probably taking a percentage point out of our growth in Europe.  The other point which is what we would refer to as a below trend growth of 3% in the volumes.  We don't see any long-term trend shiftss in diagnosis of diabetes in Europe and consequentially we would expect it to revert to the 5% level, which should add another percentage point.  The best explanation we can see when we go down to individual markets seems to be that the option of the DVB-4 inhibitors have been in certain European markets taking a bit of the insulin volume growth out.  We believe that there is a temporary and you'll see a return to a 5% volume growth in Europe over the next year or so.  Mads, on Mannkind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, clearly the FDA is looking at dossier here for the Apidra, the old sickness free concept from a man and his company.  I think our assessment has been that if you look into the 4-T study that was just published in New England Journal of Medicine, not only do guidelines, but also the clinical facts when you compare with different ways of initiating insulin.  They actually tend to favor that there be at least an element of basal insulin from the onset of patient treatment as we have witnessed by you can see a lower degree of both hyperglycemia and weight gain, and very good control in the 4-T study for the basal and actually also for the premix treatments with somewhat more side effects on the prandial initiation.</p>
          <p>So, I think prandial initiation of insulin as such, which would have to be very convenient and then the issue is how convenient is it to inhale insulin.  Obviously, an all insulin tablet, that's convenient.  That's something we do every day when we take our vitamins and what not.  But when it comes to the inhaled insulin convenient, we were so convinced when we started there, even though it was a kind of a defensive move.  We are still convinced that at least the convenience side would be perceived very highly by the patients.</p>
          <p>Fact of the matter is that our own analysis from the studies that have been closed down diligently and reported tend to show otherwise and importantly also we did some market research among physicians, nurses and patients who were among the 10 to 15,000 of those who actually did treat in a real life setting themselves with Exubera, before it was pulled from the market.  And our experience was actually that it was not perceived as being convenient, because quite often you had to take more than one puff to get that absolute correct dose you needed and that meant that very often we experienced that patients would not bring the Exubera devise with them to office.  So, they will take it at home in the morning and then in the evening, then they'd either skip their insulin at lunch or have to inject and once you have broken the injection barrier, doesn't really make much sense to combine the two and on the other hand it doesn't make sense to not comply with your treatment by skipping the lunch dose.</p>
          <p>So, these were some of the findings that &#x2013; that made us move out of &#x2013; of inhaled insulin at meal times, we then said, okay now we're going to do basal insulin.  We're going to do a basal or prandial insulin once a day, that's going to be convenient.  And we actually were pretty far progressive about Phase I, when suddenly Pfizer announced that they have now seven cases of primary lung cancer among those with Exubera and only one in the control groups. I to be quite frank on that day; we pulled the plug on all our inhaled research projects.</p>
          <p>So, I wish Mannkind the best of luck.  I would absolutely say, if and when they are to receive approval.  It's not really going to compete so much up against what I perceive as the injectable insulin platform, but maybe rather in earlier stage disease, because you have to bear in mind that there <mark type="inaudible" /> is very fast.  It actually only has efficacy for somewhere between two and three hours in most of the studies I have seen.  So, probably you would not go into a very late stage diabetes population, but if I were them, I'd also target somewhat earlier use of this.</p>

We will be back in London on the 2nd of February with our full year results.  We'll be in London one or two days later.  And I think hopefully, we'll also be able to narrow in the expectations for sales growth, et cetera, when we get to that, hopefully some of the uncertainty is out of the way.  We look forward to the back.  Thank you very much.</p>
