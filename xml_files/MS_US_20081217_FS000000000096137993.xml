      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review our results and highlight how we are positioning Morgan Stanley for this rapidly changing environment.</p>
          <p>The major equity indices all fell for three straight months, losing 30% for the quarter, amounting to a loss of 40% or more for the fiscal year. Financial stocks which led the way were down 40% for the quarter, 60% for the year. Emerging markets were similarly stressed.</p>
          <p>Capital market conditions were extremely weak. Volatility peaked across asset classes and deleveraging accelerated, adding to the already severe asset price declines. Hedging strategies became less effective as correlations broke down. In addition, the market reaction over the purpose of TARP and the uncertainty of its use caused a repricing of fixed income assets in November to distressed levels that materially impacted market liquidity and the valuation of a broad range of financial instruments.</p>
          <p>Despite these challenging conditions, we had strength across several of our industry-leading businesses including commodities, foreign exchange, equity sales and trading including derivatives, advisory, and Global Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>We took leverage down substantially to 11.4 times at a gross basis at the end of fourth quarter of '08 and significantly reduced our total assets by 33% sequentially to $658 billion, of which $128 billion is our liquidity pool at the end of the quarter, up again to 140 billion as of today.</p>
          <p>We further strengthened our strategic alliance along with the successful $9 billion capital raise for Mitsubishi UFJ.</p>
          <p>Along with eight of our peers, we received capital from the TARP. In our case, it was $10 billion.</p>
          <p>Within Institutional Securities, we are engaged in a deliberate and focused reduction of balance sheet intensive businesses including a resizing of prime brokerage, the ongoing exit of select proprietary trading strategies, the reduction of principal investments, and the closure of residential mortgage origination. However, as stated before, we are targeting capital on a risk adjusted basis to our industry leading businesses including flow trading, equity derivatives, foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodities.</p>
          <p>We are scaling back on risk and capacity but not capability. Therefore, we expect to generate attractive risk adjusted returns when markets return to conditions that are more normal and clients reengage.</p>
          <p>Global Wealth Management provides a stable earnings base, high ROE, and attractive risk-adjusted returns, although not immune to markets conditions.</p>
          <p>Our Asset Management business has been affected by poor performance this year. This business remains a top priority and we are positioning it for profitability.</p>
          <p>As announced, we are launching a retail banking group to grow deposits and banking products. We have already announced the hiring of industry veterans Cece Sutton and Jonathan Witter and are looking forward to their arrival in January. Under their direction, we will leverage our existing retail banking capabilities and financial holding company status.</p>
          <p>We are developing our strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ. We have established a steering committee composed of the four most senior executives of both firms. We identified and are pursuing more than 12 different initiatives, including corporate and investment banking, retail banking, and lending activities which we expect to be finalized no later than June 30, 2009.</p>
          <p>We are committed to cost reduction and have targeted $2 billion in cost savings for 2009. Of this, roughly 1.2 billion relates to lower compensation from our previously announced head count reductions. The remaining 800 million relates to a 10% reduction in our recurring non-compensation expenses.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our results. In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of 2.2 billion or $2.24 per share. Despite this loss this quarter, Morgan Stanley delivered three straight quarters of profitability and earned 1.8 billion from continuing operations for the full year. For the quarter, net revenues were 1.8 billion and total non-interest expenses were 5.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Full-year compensation expense was down 26% from 2007, driven primarily within Institutional Securities. The compensation ratio excluding severance was 46.5%, as we managed compensation to reflect the lower revenues and earning environment. For the quarter, non-compensation expenses were up 50% sequentially, including $725 million of noncash goodwill and intangibles impairment charge, primarily within Institutional Securities.</p>
          <p>We reduced our balance sheet with total assets down 33% sequentially to 658 billion, largely driven by a decline in Prime Brokerage and reductions in proprietary trading, interest rate, and credit products. Leverage was 11.4 times and our adjusted leverage was eight times at quarter end, both down substantially from peak levels in 2007 of 32.6 and 18.8 times respectively.</p>
          <p>Now we are expecting the absolute value of Level 3 assets to increase this quarter, and they represent approximately 13% of total assets. The increase in the value is primarily due to volatility seen in the derivatives market, especially given the widening of credit spreads. The dramatic reduction in our total assets this quarter exacerbated the ratio of Level 3 assets in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>As we have previously said, there are offsetting hedges to these positions in the other levels in the fair-value hierarchy. As you can see in our financial supplement on pages 16 through 18, we continue to systematically sell our Level 3 legacy assets whenever opportunities arise. Although there has been enormous mark-to-market volatility this quarter, Morgan Stanley operates and will continue to operate under fair-value accounting rules using conservative assumptions.</p>
          <p>Book value per share at November end was $30.24, relatively unchanged from last quarter and up 6% from a year ago, demonstrating our ability to preserve and grow book value in an extraordinarily difficult operating environment.</p>
          <p>Page four of the financial supplement highlights our current capital position. While we are still finalizing our calculations, we estimate that our Tier 1 ratio will be approximately 18.3% this quarter under the SEC's interpretation of Basel II guidelines. The increase over last quarter was primarily driven by our new Tier 1 eligible capital.</p>
          <p>Risk weighted assets declined sequentially to approximately 282 billion at November 30. This decrease reflects the combined reduction in our total assets offset by an increase in credit risk charges due to the present environment.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities given our strong capital position, broad set of funding tools, and lower leverage. We successfully issued $6.6 billion of FDIC guaranteed debt over the month. Given the market dynamic, we took the opportunity to repurchase $12.4 billion of firm issued debt, which resulted in gains of $2.3 billion this quarter. This was predominantly recorded in other revenues within Institutional Securities.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to specific businesses. Starting with Institutional Securities detailed on page five of the supplement, the business reported a pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion. Revenues of 844 million reflected the difficult trading environment and asset write-downs. Up to early November, our revenues in Institutional Securities were encouraging. A slate of news beginning with the redirection of TARP resulted in a step repricing of the market. Extreme levels of negative sentiment are priced broadly across the credit market spectrum including investment grade, loans, and the ABX subprime index. At their current market prices, CMBS AAAs imply unprecedented high default rates, with CMBS AAA index as a benchmark currently implies a cumulative default rate of greater than 60% over the duration of the underlying bonds, assuming 100% loss severity. Equity market volatility is reflected by the VIX more than double this quarter.</p>
          <p>Principal investments revenues were negative 1.8 billion, the majority of which relate to write-downs of real estate limited partnership interests and other principal investments.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses decreased 21% sequentially, largely reflecting lower compensation, which is partially offset by noncash goodwill and intangible impairment charges of 694 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to investment banking on page six, our leading investment banking franchise remained active notwithstanding the challenging market conditions. Revenues of 743 million were down 28% for the third quarter in an environment with volumes down dramatically across products. Completed M&amp;A was down nearly 25%. Global equity and debt reached down nearly 50%. And the IPO market was virtually shut down in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite these conditions, we advised on several important transactions, including Northwest's merger with Delta, the sale of HBOS to Lloyds, and the sale of a stake in Fortis Bank to the combined governments of Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Significant underwriting transactions included equity follow-on issues for Wells Fargo and General Electric and bond issues for IBM, Barrick Gold, and PepsiCo.</p>
          <p>We are currently advising Verizon on the largest indicated financing transaction in the US this quarter. On this transaction, Morgan Stanley has been instrumental in working with Mitsubishi UFJ, another example of our burgeoning partnership.</p>
          <p>Advisory revenues increased 32% sequentially on strength in Europe, even though activity slowed measurably in the quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were down 72% from the third quarter of '08 while global equity and IPO volumes were at anemic levels.</p>
          <p>Fixed income underwriting decreased 57% as issuances down across all product and credit markets remained severely strained in the quarter. Our pipelines are down given the secular downturn in global capital markets. Investment grade is one exception as there is considerable pent up demand. We continue to maintain high levels of strategic dialogue with corporates, financial sponsors, and sovereigns, and remain well positioned to take advantage of client activity when it returns to the market.</p>
          <p>Equity sales and trading revenues of 1.7 billion were down 35% sequentially. Trading in the quarter was at two extremes, with volatility and liquid trading producing strong revenues and credit and illiquid trading producing significant losses. The revenue decline was primarily driven by losses of $729 million in proprietary trading. The difficult market exacerbated losses on trades as the convertible bond asset class collapsed and spreads widened. Despite the losses this quarter, proprietary trading results were slightly positive for the full year as gains from quantitive strategies offset losses from several other strategies. We remain focused on quantitive strategies including program driven trading and statistical arbitrage where we believe we can outperform.</p>
          <p>Prime Brokerage revenues declined 50% from a record last quarter on lower client balances, which were down 37% on average from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Cash equity revenues were up 8% from last quarter on strong performance in portfolio trading despite lower commissions on lighter volumes in Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>Derivatives reported a strong quarter on continued volatility and increased customer activity and full-year revenues were a record, up 35% from 2007.</p>
          <p>Equity revenues also included 685 million on gains for the widening of credit spreads of firm issued structured notes.</p>
          <p>In fixed income sales and trading, we reported negative revenues of $1.2 billion, down significantly from the previous quarter, reflecting the difficult trading environment and further asset write-downs. An area of strength this quarter was commodities with revenues up 7% sequentially on strong customer flows across sectors, driving broad based strength. For the year, commodities reported record revenues that were 62% higher than 2007.</p>
          <p>Interest rate credit and currency trading revenues combined were down significantly from the third quarter of '08. Interest rate products were lower as new client trading was offset by unfavorable positioning in Europe as a result of the November repricing.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange reported a record quarter on higher volatility and increased customer flows. For the year, foreign exchange reported record revenues, 56% higher than 2007.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets recorded a loss, driven by credit widening in Eastern Europe; and credit trading generated a loss. In addition to significant deterioration in consumer credit and the related assets and further spread widening, our results included losses of $360 million from monolines. Aggregate net exposure &#x2013; net direct exposure to monolines increased to 4.3 billion. This net exposure includes $700 million of ABS wrap bonds held by our securities banks, 3.1 billion of insured municipal bond securities, and 500 million of net counterparty exposure, representing gross exposure of $8 billion net of hedges and cumulative credit valuation adjustments of 3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The significant increase in our gross counterparty exposure reflects the current credit environment impacting the monolines. We are managing this counterparty risk through a hedging program that utilizes both credit default swaps and transactions that effectively replace the potentially impaired component of underlying transactions as well as credit valuation adjustments.</p>
          <p>Fixed income revenues also included 2 billion in gains from the widening of credit spreads on firm issued structured notes. Detailed on pages 16, 17, and 18 of the financial supplement are our mortgage related gross and net exposures, which we further reduced this quarter.</p>
          <p>On page 16 within the ABS CDO subprime schedule, you can see our total net exposure was slightly net short. Of note on this schedule is the reduction of our super senior legacy mezzanine positions from 1.1 billion to zero, which was accomplished with minimal P&amp;L impact.</p>
          <p>On page 17 within non-subprime residential mortgage, we reduced our gross and net exposures by roughly 20%. These exposures include Alt-A, which declined 27%. Overall net write-downs were $900 million including $650 million in Alt-A.</p>
          <p>On page 18 within CMBS commercial home loans, we reduced our gross exposure to $17 billion, driven by a nearly 40% reduction in CMBS bonds. Net exposure declined over 60% to 2.9 billion. Overall here, we recorded a net gain of $200 million.</p>
          <p>Other sales and trading revenues of negative 1.1 billion were primarily driven by net losses of 1.7 billion in our lending businesses, which include leveraged acquisition finance and relationship lending. These net losses reflect negative market movements and write-downs of 4 billion, offset by effective hedges. The five-year cumulative implied probability of default in the cash and derivatives market for loans is now greater than 60%, much higher than the worst five-year cumulative historical default rate of approximately 25%.</p>
          <p>We continue to reduce our non-investment grade leveraged acquisition portfolio, which is now 5.6 billion, as you can see in the footnote on page seven of the financial supplement. During the quarter, we added $420 million of new commitments and had $3.4 billion of reductions.</p>
          <p>Also included in other sales and trading are losses of approximately $800 million from our subsidiary banks, driven by further deterioration of the investment portfolio, which is fair-valued. Offsetting these losses were derivative mark-to-market gains of approximately 1.1 billion following their de-designation as hedges of certain Morgan Stanley debt.</p>
          <p>Total average trading and non-trading VaR decreased to 119 million from 128 million last quarter, reflecting a decline in our non-trading VaR. This is primarily driven by a reduction in lending exposure. Average trading VaR remained near flat from last quarter at 98 million as higher spread and volatility levels were offset by a reduction in key trading risks.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we continue to reshape our Institutional Securities business. We have taken steps to exit select proprietary trading strategies and have deemphasized our principal investing business in Institutional Securities. We are exiting our remaining international mortgage origination businesses. Within the US, we are shifting origination activities to Global Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are reshaping other businesses. We remain committed to maintaining a premier prime brokerage franchise. While this business is smaller, it will benefit from the repricing of services.</p>
          <p>As stated before, we'll no longer be market share driven but rather a contiguous and strategic extension of our strategic client relationships.</p>
          <p>We have repositioned research in an effort to coordinate analysts better with the businesses and leverage the intellectual capital more broadly throughout the firm.</p>
          <p>We continue to develop and invest in our client driven and flow businesses where we see revenue upside. This includes investing in electronic delivery as markets move towards exchange-light structures. We are building out distressed credit trading and prioritizing risk analytics on the credit desks. We are focused on reducing our infrastructure costs and geographic footprint at the margin by closing or relocating offices.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 8 of the supplement and our Global Wealth Management business, this business continues to produce strong underlying results with stable recurring revenues despite volatile market conditions. Revenues of 1.4 billion decreased 9% from the third quarter, reflecting write-downs of $108 million in auction rate securities repurchased from clients, recorded in principal transactions. Revenues also included higher commissions on increased transaction volumes offset by the lack of new issues affecting investment banking revenues and lower fees on declining market levels.</p>
          <p>Overall revenues were offset by non-interest expenses that included an incremental provision of 256 million for the auction rate securities settlement as valuations have declined and repurchases are estimated to be higher than anticipated at the time of our initial announcement.</p>
          <p>Excluding the provisions from both quarters, non-interest expenses were down 7% from last quarter, driven by lower compensation.</p>
          <p>As a result of all this, PBT was a loss of $55 million.</p>
          <p>On page 9, you can see the productivity metrics. Total client assets decreased 23% as market levels declined sharply during the quarter. While client withdrawals driven by market volatility led to outflows of 3.9 billion, they were less than 1% of total client assets. Net new money for the full year was $34.5 billion, our second highest year and best in class.</p>
          <p>The number of FAs was slightly down for the quarter. For the full year, FAs was flat despite a reduction of 233 representatives from the sale of our Spanish Wealth Management business. We expect to continue to grow FAs and take advantage of market turmoil, particularly as the franchise has largely stabilized after a tumultuous September and October.</p>
          <p>While bank deposits including client sweeps and client holdings of Morgan Stanley issued certificates of deposit increased slightly over last quarter to 36.4 billion, as of today our total deposits are $44 billion. In 2008, we achieved double digit increases in the number of accounts using key banking services and there is a lot of room for future growth. In support of the firm's goal of achieving 50% of funding from stable sources including equity, long-term debt, and deposits, we will further build out our deposit base.</p>
          <p>Our Private Wealth Management group continued to grow its global footprint of investment representatives and expanded into significant new markets, opening offices in India and Saudi Arabia. Going forward, we are leveraging our high net worth franchise and focused on building a retail banking group, as I stated earlier, under the direction of Cece Sutton and Jonathan Witter.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to Asset Management on page 10 of the supplement. Asset Management recorded a pre-tax loss of 1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by principal investment losses and expenses related to Crescent.</p>
          <p>Core revenues, which included traditional funds, hedge funds, and fund-to-fund asset management, were down 87% sequentially and included a decline in management and administration fees resulting from lower average assets under management; losses of $261 million in alternatives in our core business; and losses of 187 million relating to marking securities issued by SIVs held on balance sheet. The carrying value of these assets is now down to $209 million at the end of the quarter. In addition, total SIV exposure in our money funds as of quarter end was down to $100 million. These are all bank sponsored and are maturing in January.</p>
          <p>Merchant banking revenues were negative 454 million and included principal investment losses of 532 million in real estate including 113 million on Crescent financial assets driven by the continued deterioration in global real estate markets and 100 million on private equity and infrastructure funds, particularly our Asia portfolio.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses decreased 3% for the third quarter, primarily driven by lower compensation expenses. This decrease was partially offset by higher costs relating to Crescent, which includes an impairment charge on real estate assets of 243 million. Approximately 90% of the Crescent portfolio is real estate assets primarily held at cost with quarterly depreciation. These assets are subject to quarterly impairment review.</p>
          <p>Our total real estate net exposure, which includes Crescent as well as our direct investments in real estate, private equity, and infrastructure funds, was $5.3 billion at the end of the quarter. This exposure does not include assets included in investments for the benefit of employee compensation or co-investment plans.</p>
          <p>Turning to pages 11, 12, and 13 of the supplement, you can see the assets under management and asset flow data. Total assets under management decreased 30% to 399 billion, largely due to the extreme drop in global financial markets during the quarter, which had a broad impact across the industry. We also recorded $77 billion in net asset outflows in the quarter, virtually all of it in our core business. The primarily driver here was money market outflows of $51 billion due to the dislocation of the industry. As we mentioned in our third quarter 10-Q, nearly all of these outflows occurred in September when credit and liquidity of markets were under severe stress.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we purchased approximately $25 billion of these securities to fund investor redemptions amidst illiquid markets. We have reduced these positions substantially to $600 million at the end of November with no losses incurred. The current balance is roughly 200 million.</p>
          <p>Improving our financial performance in Asset Management is a top priority. Asset Management faces significant headwinds in '09 from the decline in assets under management and a difficult environment for gathering assets. Within core Asset Management, we reduced net head count by nearly 20%. We are closing and consolidating non-performing subscale and overlapping products as well as enhancing the efficiency of our technology and operations.</p>
          <p>Despite the issues in Asset Management, this business remains a critical component of our strategy. The diversified earnings into a high ROE business takes advantage of our distribution power and provides a channel to monetize our intellectual capital. We are confident that we can drive this business to competitive advantage and profitability as markets improve.</p>
          <p>An additional note I wanted to make you aware of is that our Board of Directors have approved our change to a calendar year reporting cycle, which will commence January 1, 2009. In effecting this change, we will have a one-month transition period ending December 31, 2008 that will be reported along with our first quarter '09 results in April '09.</p>
          <p>Now in closing, I just have a few words on the outlook. 2008 was a very challenging year. Yet Morgan Stanley delivered three straight quarters of profitability and was profitable for the full year. Whilst we do not expect the events of the fourth quarter to repeat nor the dramatic falloff in client activity to persist, we do expect the near-term environment to be very challenging. This recession has turned global in a relatively short timeframe. Action is being taken to remediate the state of the markets in an unprecedented scale around the world. Such moves will likely promote market stability near term and economic recovery over long term. We are expecting 2009 to be a year of transition.</p>
          <p>There is no doubt that earnings power has been affected in the short term and there is potential for further negative marks despite our reduction of risk positions and leverage.</p>
          <p>Given the systemic reduction in leverage, we expect ROE to be lower but still a healthy 12 to 15% over the cycle. Clearly though, our ROE will improve over time as we expand Global Wealth Management, Asset Management, and Retail Banking to being a greater contributor to our business mix, as we have good opportunities to invest in these businesses.</p>
          <p>Overall, we do not expect the volatility in the markets to subside until the very least the mortgage market and ultimately the housing market stabilizes. However, we see opportunities amidst all the turbulence and market uncertainty. For example, recent corporate new issuance activity is an encouraging early step towards the normalization of conditions in debt capital markets.</p>
          <p>We are seeing investment grade credit deals being completed. In fact, November was the second busiest month for European investment grade non-financial new issuance since March '01. In the US, total issuances increased each month since the lows reached in September. Even within high yield, we're starting to see some activity such as the $500 million El Paso transaction which marked the reopening of the high yield market.</p>
          <p>While limited, there have been select opportunities for issuance within the equity markets. While we cannot control the difficult environment, we are committing to improving our operating performance by reducing non-compensation cost by 10%, continuing to reduce legacy assets as the markets allow us, allocating capital on a risk adjusted basis for the client driven and flow businesses in our market leading institutional franchise, returning Asset Management to profitability, and as I stated maximizing our relationship with Mitsubishi UFJ.</p>
          <p>Our leading client franchise and premium brand remains intact. Morgan Stanley has been and will continue to be a premier global financial services firm. We are confident that we will be well positioned to generate attractive returns when markets normalize and clients reengage in a more significant way. We have successfully evolved and adapted our business across numerous business cycles in the past and we are doing so again today.</p>
          <p>Thank you and apologies for the long intro, and now I'll take your questions.</p>

          <p>In listening to your commentary about risk positioning and appetite for principal investing going forward, how do you think about your approach to markets once they &#x2013; when we get to this eventual point where credit markets stabilize and we see increasing asset values again? Are you going to be taking advantage of that? You clearly have excess capital given your really highest, best-in-class Tier 1 ratio. How do we balance that versus the commentary on the call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it is clear that we are very negative on these markets at the moment and have been for some time, Roger, as you know, right? We are seeing client falloff. As I've stated on a number of occasions, where Morgan Stanley does well is when we have large client activity because that is the benefit of our franchise. When we see that pickup, we will be there to commit capital to the markets, and I think we are just ready to do that.</p>
          <p>A combination of two things are interesting is we did have obviously legacy assets which we reduced. But what's interesting is they hurt us in the fourth quarter, but not we have outlined to what degree. Really what's happening here was a broad based price destruction which is representative of what's going on in the markets. So I think we need to be prepared to commit capital as and when we see the market moving again.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with respect to the balance sheet decline this quarter, can you help us think about some of the buckets there because it was a more than $300 billion decline in the absolute level. Obviously a lot of markets were pretty illiquid, a lot of Treasuries and agencies were --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you can see our adjusted leverage has come down as well, so it was broad. Obviously it's easier to reduce your match book, which we did. But if you think about it in terms of where we are, it was pretty broad based. About half the reduction came from a reduction in Prime Brokerage balances and the rest was pretty much spread out. And what we've done is we've continued to reduce legacy assets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the proprietary debt that you actually purchased, can you give us a little more color around that? What did you &#x2013; what maturities did you buy? Was it shorter term, longer term? Do you still hold this? And also the hedging, the redesignation of hedges there, do you actually actively hedge your debt in addition to the natural hedge you have around FAS 137?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do. Look, we took the opportunity given market dynamics to repurchase some of our debt. It was a broad range of maturities; it was trading at very distressed levels. Those repurchases, as I said, resulted in direct gains of 2.3 billion. As you said and I just confirmed, we used swaps to hedge the interest rate risk.</p>
          <p>In making those repurchases, we were required to modify our hedging program. So accordingly, a good number of those swaps were de-designated from being hedges of our debt and became mark-to-market instruments, so that's the 1.1 billion gain. We noted associated with de-designation reflects the mark-to-market change for these swaps when they're no longer considered to be hedges. Now we will &#x2013; a full discussion of that hedge accounting is in more detail on page 14 of our August 31 Form 10-Q, if you want to have a look at it.</p>

          <p>Wondering if you could &#x2013; just to pick up on the clawbacks for a moment, wondering if you could give us a sense for whether that could result in lower expense recognition in year one of a bonus award since it's not actually paid until certain future hurdles are cleared, or would you go ahead and recognize all of it and therefore it really wouldn't initially result in lower comp cost?</p>

          <p>No, it would not; there is no game like that going on, Guy. It's going to be treated the same as equity. We've kept those components the same as well, right, so it will be amortized accordingly. From an accounting point of view, there is no arbitrage there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I know you weren't, but some people might think it was. What we're doing is we're just taking part of that deferred comp, which is now &#x2013; we will have the ability to claw back on. It's in the same proportion as normal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you give us a sense for what happened to the compensation ratio within the institutional division in the fourth quarter? Was there a meaningful comp &#x2013; further comp accrual there in the quarter? Or was there some &#x2013; was there either a very low accrual or indeed a reversal in institutional as Goldman Sachs had for the whole firm?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'll tell you is that in 2008, the comp to revenue accrual for the end of the year of institutional securities was 43.9%, ex-severance 39.9, and obviously that's formulated on much lower revenues.

          <p>Yes, we are. As you know, we are funding it through the facility, right? As of November 30, we repurchased 3.8 billion of eligible ARS that we hold in our inventory. We did take write-downs, which we described, of 108 million on that. That was reflected as a part of principal trading.</p>
          <p>Additionally during the fourth quarter because as you know we have the ability to purchase up to 6.4 billion under the terms of the settlement we took -- because of the price deterioration that took place in November, we took an incremental provision of 256 million, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, which again is a provision; and next quarter, if there's been further negative variation, there could be a further charge which would be the equivalent of the 108 this quarter. Is that the right way to think about it?</p>

          <p>Sorry, Guy, I hope I didn't mislead you. The 100 million maturing in January is what's actually held in the third-party funds, which we have not taken onto our book. That's just what's left in the various money market funds. They mature, they're bank guaranteed. What we have written down is just over $200 million of written down SIVs, which were approximately about 680 million or something like that when we originally put them on the book.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we did. I bought a small amount of stock back. Obviously, this was pre-TARP. It was a combination two aspects of the stock. One, we had some employee-related buybacks, which is the normal course of business. And then in addition to that, in those brief periods when our stock was trading down very low, I bought back &#x2013; let me give it to you. I think I put it in the earnings release actually.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>That's okay, I'll find it. As bigger question is -- was that &#x2013; how much of the reduction in the average liquidity pool during the quarter was this versus just say calls on your liquidity from the deleveraging?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all. Let's talk about the average reduction in the liquidity pool. I think you've got to understand that our contingency funding assumes certain drains on our liquidity, right? By the way, we repurchased 39 million shares only in our equity repurchase early on in the quarter. I think I had announced by the way, just to finish that question, Glenn, on the third quarter earnings call on the Tuesday night, I said I reserved the right to restart...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that any contribution to the reduction in the liquidity pool or was that more...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all. Let's talk about the liquidity pool. Today I've got liquidity of about $140 billion. I'm not sure it's as meaningful a number now that we're a bank holding company and we have a facility and we don't need &#x2013; have the operational friction we used to have. You've got to think about 140 billion in relation to my current balance sheet. At the time of the third quarter, the end of the third quarter when we felt the market was going to be very stressed, we had gotten that liquidity up, as you remember, to 179 billion. And that obviously &#x2013; there was significant drain on liquidity for a period of time in that stressed period. But that was not part of this. We've now rebuilt our liquidity through a number of actions. And actually if anything, we're probably in a more conservative place because the contingent drains in our liquidity are much less given the size of our balance sheet in certain aspects of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess when you look and you have 7 billion of unallocated capital and you have some really large Tier 1 ratio, how do you balance it because you bought back debt and it generated 3 billion of gains? It produces equity. It reduces your debt load. How do you draw the line between tapping into your precious liquidity, pissing off the regulators, and doing something economic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we were &#x2013; first of all, we were buying debt as part of a debt defense as well. Secondly, it was at incredibly distressed levels, which is in the interest of our shareholders. And thirdly, I think we are in a very strong liquidity position regardless. It basically comes out of our contingency funding plans. We look at what we need to issue, what we need to cover our liabilities. As we've reduced the balance sheet, we clearly have less requirement for that funding. And frankly I think it was a good trading decision in the interest of our shareholders to buy back debt which was at incredibly distressed levels. And frankly, if I had let it sit out there, it would have sent out a very bad signal.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think leverage is going to go down anymore. I think we've actually squeezed our balance sheet down to be prepared to take advantage of markets and dislocations. So I'm hoping we can take leverage back up. But to do that, Glenn, we need to see opportunities in the market. Frankly, I'm still reeling from what happened in November.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Me, too, and then maybe the last one. Implicit in your comments about maybe 12 to 15% ROE over the course of the cycle, does that assume, I'll just put it in quotes, "Some normal cost of debt in the unsecured debt markets," in other words, the funding pressures that are there today subside?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>No, I've made assumptions about why &#x2013; I don't want to get into details but I made some reasonable assumptions about where I think debt spreads are going to be, where I can refinance. But clearly within that, it does assume that we will have a normalized CDS spread than where we currently are because frankly, I don't think 460 over or 500 over or whatever is a sustainable financing spread.</p>

I think this business was based upon a revenue driven model. Frankly, I think a lot of these businesses on a risk adjusted return have been producing negative NPV. So we've made a decision to exit some of these businesses, and there is a cost associated with those. That cost is being exacerbated by incredibly stressed markets.</p>
          <p>Within that though, remember we're keeping our PDT business, our quan strategy business in equity because we believe it's a business that we have an alpha or an insight onto. We believe that where we have insight like commodities, we can position risk of a proprietary nature on the back of those client flows and so on. I think to look at some of these losses, and they are winding down losses, is perhaps misleading. What we're doing is we're reallocating businesses on a risk adjusted basis to where we think we can generate alpha. So these were not unexpected insofar as the market away from what the market did itself.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then one separate question. As it relates to equities being down, I think you said Prime Brokerage was down 50%. Is anything else going on in that category?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, it was the decline in contrast to one of your competitors yesterday, it just didn't do as well. I'm just wondering if there are any one-time factors there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's the prop trading you referred to a few minutes ago that covers the equity line item. I think if you were to normalize that, I don't think we'd be a million miles away. It was a very strong year for us in equities. Volumes were down in the fourth quarter, certainly. But I think that's probably the delta, Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we just talk a little bit about fixed income? I'm just trying to &#x2013; obviously it was a tough quarter for credit, but if I normalize for the mortgages related write-downs as well as the gains on debt, it looks like you had about a $2 billion loss on that line. Was that all credit or was there &#x2013; you mentioned you had interest rate positioning was difficult as well. I'm just trying to think through what maybe the major drivers were at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was a broad based loss. As I stated earlier, going into November we were looking pretty good in terms of our revenues and so on. But obviously there was a repricing of a lot of things. Credit clearly got hit hard by...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...just about any measure you want to look at. But you had curve changes as well and bond swap spreads changed dramatically. So in Europe, we certainly got hit on some European curve positions we had, but I think it was broad based. I think to try and look at what happened in November and extrapolate from that is very difficult because it was such a discrete event.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I hear you, fair enough. Maybe switching over to Asset Management, were most of the flows, outflows &#x2013; you had mentioned money market, was mostly in September &#x2013; October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you seen &#x2013; and maybe you can talk a little bit about in the equities and fixed income area and if some of those flows have stabilized of late.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I think that's fair. It was September &#x2013; October. Those flows have stabilized. Obviously, it goes without saying that the major indices are down and that is affecting size of assets under management. But certainly for us, it was primarily the money market flows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that has started to stabilize?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One last question, the investments in the Institutional Securities, I think you gave us a number for the Asset Management business down to five billion or so. Was that down meaningfully in the investment &#x2013; I mean in the institutional business? Can you give a number there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The private equity...</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...institutional business, not particularly. It's a relatively small portfolio. It's about $3 billion, which is being written down. Losses in there, I would say it's about 2.6 billion, something like that now, 2.5. It's something that we've kept a close eye on. That's it, really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a pretty substantial write-down. I guess you had 1.8 billion on...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Within that though, remember we have &#x2013; the LP interest in our commercial real estate fund is actually held in ISG, and that was a big part of that write-down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Right, fair enough. Okay, thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Your next question will come from the line of David Trone from Fox-Pitt, Kelton. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a couple of questions. If I heard you correctly when you talked about the Prime Brokerage balances, you mentioned a negative 37% delta. I assume that was average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you tell us the end of period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The end of period is about down 65%, but let me qualify that. We've had a lot of balances wanting to come back. What we're doing at the moment is we're looking at &#x2013; and also it's a function not only of balances that left. It is clearly a function of the downsizing of the hedge fund business at the moment as well. We have a number of balances that are wanting to come back. And we are at the moment engaging clients in a strategic dialogue to decide where we are and what we want to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And through the period...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just confirm one thing though, David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, of the accounts that were closed, we only had 7% of accounts that were closed; so you would expect a high rate of return because it was in a particularly stressed environment when a lot of those balances left.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So at what point during the quarter did that stabilize and what does December look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it stabilized probably post the closing of the Mitsubishi UFG deal, but I would have to confirm that. By then, you had other dynamics in place. And so far, I mean, we are in the midst. It is no longer about Morgan Stanley and Prime Brokerage or anybody else in prime brokerage. It's about the hedge funds themselves at the moment. What we're certainly seeing is hedge funds wanting to move balances back towards the notes market. I think we feel pretty encouraged about it. What we're not too encouraged about is the overall state of the hedge fund industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Right, okay, and second question; on the bank deposit side, in the context of bricks and mortar, obviously an acquisition, A) what is too small to matter or should I say what is the right number where you start to have an interest in a property that might come up? And B) how do the regulators feel about you doing that type of an acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean first of all, let us explain that what we're saying about garnering bank deposits is that they have to fit into our existing strategy, our retail and high net worth strategy. So in that sense, there is no such thing as too small to matter. It has got to fit in to what we've got to do. I think the regulators, and we are in very close contact with the regulators, are very comfortable with our strategy, hopefully. And that's some of the feedback I get.</p>
          <p>What we are not talking about, at least today &#x2013; you never say never, is large strategic transactions. We're talking about garnering deposits that fit into a well defined retail strategy, and that's why we've hired Cece Sutton and Jonathan Witter, who have been very successful in pursuing these sort of strategies at large money center banks. I think this will evolve as they join us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. That's it, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your last question will come from the line of Jeff Harte from Sandler O'Neill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talked about the size of the net real estate exposure within Asset Management. I believe you said it was 5.3 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but remember there is some secured financing in that against Crescent, so you have to net that out as well. So if you look at it, you've got &#x2013; Crescent is 3 billion of that 5.31 billion. And the written, the residual net of secured financing is just under 600 million, so you would knock off 2.5 billion from those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given how difficult hedging relationships and cash versus derivatives have been &#x2013; that's a net number. Can you give us a gross exposure number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a gross exposure number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I thought you were saying the net, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I gave you the gross originally, which is the 5 billion number, and I said there is secured financing against Crescent, which is secured financing, so you would take that out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And looking at the debt repurchase gains this quarter and seeing debt actually a transaction I guess would be realized, I'm looking at the amount of structured note gains that you guys have been recording it seems quarter in and quarter out. Is there the opportunity or have you actually been &#x2013; can you actually lock in or realize some of those structured note gains or have you yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can. I mean DVA &#x2013; I look at DVA debt as what we call DVA, the structured note gains, slightly differently. I think the trading of debt is real P&amp;L. It's a one-time gain. We did it in stressed markets. One hopes that would never repeat itself. Obviously DVA, the own credit spread, the 159, moves around. You can to some extent lock it in by retiring debt that it's associated with.</p>
          <p>But the way I look at it is say look, we are a fair value shop. We're mark-to-market. We're very conservative in the way we mark things. So the same way as we are being penalized for taking things at mark-to-market, and let me give you the example of where we are. CMBS bonds in the third quarter of '08, we had them in the low 70s. We now have them in the high 40s. Senior commercial loans in high 80s to low 90s are now &#x2013; they've been marked down as well to high 80s; mezz, mid-70s to low 60s, mezz commercial loans; Alt-A, mid-30s to high 20s. We've actually taken some very significant marks here. So my view on own credit spread is &#x2013; you've got to look at that in the round if that makes sense. So if you're trying to get a sense of what our core operating are, I think you would knock out own credit certainly as revenue that is maybe not the highest quality. But against that you would have to offset the legacy charges against it to get a sense of what the underlying is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you mentioned in ROE maybe a target of 12 to 15% over the cycle. You are talking, that's your thought as to what the average would be over the cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, so I'm assuming '09 is going to be a tricky year, and we'll come out of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given everything that has gone on from becoming a bank holding company and everything else, where would you historically have pegged that number? I'm trying to get a feel for how much you think some of the changes we've seen come into effect this year maybe impact what you think long-term ROE is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I've addressed this before. We've always been pretty consistent that we're in a world of reduced leverage, and reduced leverage does mean lower ROEs. I know there is some debate over that. We think that haircut is 3 to 5%, but we can mitigate that a lot by more efficient use of balance sheet. And it was not that long ago that institutions had very nice ROEs at lower balance sheets. We've got to get back to that world.</p>
