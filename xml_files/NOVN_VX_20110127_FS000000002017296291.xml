          <p>Thank Susanne. Okay, starting on slide number four, you can see that 2010 was really an outstanding year for Novartis. Our sales were up 14% in constant currencies and this was driven by above market growth in all of our divisions. We delivered great leverage with core operating income growing 22% and this led to net income up 18% and EPS growth was 16% for the year. I think though that the most important achievements for the year were around innovation. We had multiple key approvals including Gilenya in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Last week we received the positive opinion from the CHMP on Gilenya in the EU, and also approval in Switzerland and Australia. In the EU also in the fourth quarter we filed our Meningitis B vaccine, Bexsero, which will build our meningitis portfolio into a blockbuster franchise. And then finally the Board proposed a dividend of CHF 2.2 for 2010.</p>
          <p>So slide five you can see a summary of the financial results. We crossed $50 billion for the first time in our history, and John's going to go into more detail regarding both the full-year and the financials for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>But on slide six you can see that our divisions grew at above market rates and it was all divisions. This is what we feel the best about for 2010. Looking just at Sandoz, up 15%, and Vaccines and Diagnostics growing at 25% behind the strong flu sales, but also the meningitis launch.</p>
          <p>Our above market performance on the next slide was driven, I believe, by the focus that we have on our three strategic priorities, and that's extending our lead in innovation, accelerating growth and driving productivity.</p>
          <p>So just starting with innovation on slide eight. We had a very strong year in innovation. You will hear from David around the Gilenya launch in a minute, but oncology also had a tremendous year with Tasigna first-line approval and Afinitor approval to treat benign brain tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis.</p>
          <p>Sandoz also with the launch of Generic Lovenox further generated leadership in differentiated generics and Vaccine and Diagnostics submitted the important infant indication for Menveo in the U.S. and our meningitis vaccine, Bexsero, in Europe.</p>
          <p>So with the 2010 numbers in on slide nine, you see that once again we outpaced the industry with new molecules in both U.S. and Europe in terms of total approvals since 2007.</p>
          <p>Now our second priority is on slide 10, and that's accelerating growth. We've shown this slide before but it keeps increasing. Our new products have contributed 21% of our sales which is up 16% -- up from 16% last year. This is going to be critical as we face the beginning of the Diovan patent expiration.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we were also able to leverage our synergies across our four growth platforms to deliver incremental sales last year. One example was that we built a cross-divisional field force in Venezuela to capture synergies on our pediatric line.</p>
          <p>So that's across Pharma, Sandoz and OTC, we were able to build one field force going up against physicians selling all products. We also rolled out key account management with some of our key customers around the world.</p>
          <p>In 2010, on slide number 12, you can see that we also expanded significantly in emerging markets. So in December, we announced a $500 million commitment in Russia to build a Greenfield manufacturing site in St. Petersburg, and also to collaborate with some of the local regions in Russia around health awareness. We built a strategic partnership in Brazil to put improve public health. So now all children under the age of two in Brazil are vaccinated by our Meningitis C vaccine.</p>
          <p>Also in the area of growth, each of our businesses is focusing on driving their emerging market's growth and we grew 12% as a total company. This is &#x2013; in our top six markets we delivered close to $5 billion in sales. So this is not a small piece of business. We continue to drive and I expect that that growth rate in those emerging markets will increase in 2011.</p>
          <p>Around productivity on slide 14, we were able to grow our core operating income margin 190 basis points. All parts of the businesses have extensive productivity programs that are driving this result. For example, we are creating manufacturing centers of excellence. We drove significant procurement savings this year.</p>
          <p>We're now up to pushing about 40% of our addressable spend through eSourcing and this drove $1 billion of savings in 2010. We also realigned our field force and Sandoz, Germany as an organization and took a charge in the fourth quarter to improve the cost structure of these businesses going forward.</p>
          <p>So on slide 15, our above market performance reflects the focus that we have on these five platforms. David will talk Pharma and then I will come back and just give a brief summary about the other four. But before we do that, I would like Jon to review in detail the fourth quarter and the full-year financial performance. Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe and good morning or good afternoon everyone. As usual there is quite a lot to get through. I'll spend some time on the full year first before turning to the quarter. I think the full year gives a much clearer picture of what we are trying to achieve although, there are some important elements in the fourth quarter that are important in their own right, but also relevant for 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 provides the overview for the year. It's characterized by strong double-digit growth across all performance metrics. I am particularly pleased with the operating leverage between the topline and operating income. There are obviously a lot of moving parts within this, perhaps more than you and I would wish for. But these results give a clear statement of where our aspiration lies.</p>
          <p>One figure that is free from any distortion is cash. And I believe here that we have really outperformed with a 31% growth over 2009 to 12.3 billion, including a very strong finish to the year.</p>
          <p>Finally the one figure that is in single-digits is the dividend, which increases by 5% to CHF 2.2. We've increased the payout ratio slightly to around 55%. But you can see here, how the strength of the Swiss franc really bites as this represents a dividend increase for U.S. dollar shareholders of 20%.</p>
          <p>So slide 18 shows how I would scorecard the results for 2010 using the performance model Joe and I used in November. I think this shows the consistency of performance we are seeking from all of our divisions: outgrow our respective markets, grow profits faster, and leverage cash flow. It is a simple and effective model that over time must be highly correlated to the creation of shareholder value.</p>
          <p>I have to say for Jeff's benefit and for Sandoz, the Sandoz cash flow is actually pretty good, even if he did have a red cross. And he is paying the price for a very strong deliver in 2009. But if you look at his cash flow performance metrics, they're in a different league from all of his competitors. Nevertheless, a scorecard is a scorecard.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned at the beginning, there have been many moving parts in 2010 and slide 19 shows you the impact of the one-offs for the full year and in the quarter. I know these make life very difficult for you as by definition they're very difficult to model. I won't go through them in any detail as I think the press release gives you all the details you need. I can't promise 2011 will be any simpler, although Alcon will be.</p>
          <p>I'll quickly go over the next two slides on 2010 top line performance. Firstly on slide 20, you can see how we get to the top line growth of 14%, underpinned by 10% volume growth. Increasingly over the next few years as we face generic competition and a challenging pricing environment the underlying volume growth is going to be a key indicator of where our business strength lies. Eventually patent expiries will work through and pricing will stabilize and volume growth will become visible to the top line.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 addresses this same point, but in a different way. Our volume is being driven by the recently launched products that are having an increasing impact on our total business performance. Excluding Alcon, they account for the majority of our sales growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 shows the full year core margin improvement at a divisional level. The 190 basis points is an excellent achievement given the size of the business of which we all know the story is much more complicated than is seen here.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 gives a better picture of our progress on improving underlying margin. Of the margin improvement of 190 basis points, 90 basis points came from an increase in H1N1 revenues over 2009, and from the impact of consolidating Alcon, which has a higher core margin than the other divisions.</p>
          <p>Don't forget that for 2011 we lose all of the margin benefits of H1N1, 1.7 percentage points, not the 50 basis points that you see here. Alcon will also contribute more, but if you take the two together, we will start 2011 at least 50 basis points behind, which we aim to more than makeup for.</p>
          <p>So returning to 2010, the underlying progression of 100 basis points is the result of continuing productivity efforts and resource allocation, typified by the falling sales and marketing costs. This is driven by Pharma, where sales and marketing fell by 80 basis points to 28.5% of sale despite continuing to launch new products.</p>
          <p>We estimate that all of the productivity initiatives in 2010 were equivalent to approximately 400 basis points, enabling us to absorb the impact of pricing decreases on gross margins, continue to invest for future growth, and improve profitability.</p>
          <p>So if that's the picture for the full year, slide 24 gives you the profile of quarter four which shows quite a different shape, although don't miss the cash flow at the bottom of the page which was very strong in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll come to sales and core operating margin in a moment, but before doing so, I want to explain the bottom half of the P&amp;L, especially for the core results where 2% growth in core operating income became zero at net income and a 6% decline in core EPS.</p>
          <p>Let me go through the main pieces. The 2% decline to net income stems from lower associated company income. Alcon no longer contributes here. In addition there were higher interest costs from the Alcon acquisition, as well as a finance adjustment relating to the Venezuelan devaluation. This was offset by a lower tax charge.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter tax charge was exceptionally low at 6%, benefiting equally from a revision to the underlying Novartis rate for the year to 16.3%, and the consequence of incorporating Alcon, which carries a lower tax charge. And some of these effects flowed through into the core tax charge.</p>
          <p>On a more steady state, we would expect the reported a tax charge to be in the range of 15% to 16% going forward. The 6 percentage point between net decline &#x2013; between net income and EPS is mostly attributable to the removal of the 23% minority interest in Alcon.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows the topline movements in quarter four, demonstrating the impact of last year's H1N1 sales, and the consolidation of Alcon. If you strip away these two items, you see the high single digit volume growth is steady at 8%, although the impact of price has crept up to 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>The Pharma price impact stands at 3 percentage points, taking into account the impact of the price reforms in Europe and a Lucentis accounting adjustment.</p>
          <p>Before looking at divisional operating performance, I want to make sure that you understand the movements at group level first.</p>
          <p>Slide 26 gives you the margin reconciliation to quarter four 2009, and at the bottom you can see the two main distorting elements: the contribution of Alcon; and the benefit of H1N1 sales in quarter four 2009. Excluding these two items, quarter four margin improved by 10 basis points. But for currency the underlying improvement in margin would have been more. As you know in December particularly, there was a very strong movement, especially in the Swiss franc. In December alone it strengthened against the dollar by 7% and the euro by 4%, the worst combination for us given the dollar moved very little against the euro. Given that over one-third of our R&amp;D is denominated in Swiss francs more than half of the 110 basis point deterioration in R&amp;D you see here is attributable to currency. For the quarter as a whole we estimate currency reduced the margin by about 50 basis points, taking the underlying constant currency growth in margin to 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>There is also some seasonality in our spending, hence why the quarter four margin was lower than quarter three. There are three things to factor in here. Firstly, while there is no seasonality to R&amp;D per se, every pharma company has a higher quarter four spend than the other quarters. In our case, quarter four spend represented around 28% of the total. The second factor is that M&amp;S tends to be high in the fourth quarter. This is particularly true for consumer health, where nearly 30% of the spending is in quarter four directed towards the cough and cold season, which is a very important part of our OTC business.</p>
          <p>Pharma marketing and sales spend was at nearly 28% of the total this year, partly due to the investment in the launch of Gilenya. So taking all these factors together, the constant currency increase in the underlying margin of 60 basis points in the quarter I think is pretty good.</p>
          <p>So with that as a background, the divisional margin on slide 27 should be easier to interpret. As you can see from Pharma and Consumer Health at the top, both had an operating income growth ahead of sales, but both reported a negative margin movement.</p>
          <p>In the case of both Pharma and Consumer Health, currency reduced the margin by about 100 basis points. That is: on a constant currency basis both increased their underlying core margin.</p>
          <p>Sandoz had a great year and in the fourth quarter revenue growth was very stronger at 14%. However, there were three factors affecting profits. Firstly, mix: as the press release says, higher low margin sales in the U.S. and lower higher margins sales in Germany. Germany is a big contributor to Sandoz and we saw in the fourth quarter the impact of health reforms.</p>
          <p>And while we outperformed the market, it was still overall negative. And the impact of this will work itself through the next few quarters. Thirdly, while our Biosimilar business has been doing superbly well, delivering sales for the year of 185 million, we're entering a period of investment as our development portfolio advances to later and more expensive stages of development.</p>
          <p>The same is true of our Respiratory portfolio, and this will hold back margin improvement in 2011, but for good reason.</p>
          <p>Finally, Vaccines and Diagnostics, I recognize that it's very difficult to forecast given the volatility of the flu business. We continue to make excellent progress with meningitis and our early portfolio, and both of these will absorb incremental investments in 2011.</p>
          <p>Finally, cash flow, and I will let the next two slides do the talking. Firstly on slide 28 you can see the full year and quarter four numbers, growth of 31% for the full year to 12.3 billion including Alcon of course. Fourth quarter working capital management, particularly, was excellent from all divisions.</p>
          <p>This cash flow, as you see on slide 29, has enabled us to reduce our debt from 27.4 billion in August to 23 billion at the end of the year. You should be aware that cash figure includes over 3 billion of Alcon cash that will not be available to us until we complete the merger.</p>
          <p>Finally, on slide 30, currency. I've mentioned this a few times already, so the picture ought to be clear, especially why the impact on profits was greater than the impact on sales in the fourth quarter. At the time of our third quarter results, I thought that if rates remained where they were then, the effect would be broadly neutral to operating profits. Over the sharpness of the movements right at the end of the year turned the overall impact on operating profits negative.</p>
          <p>As you see at the bottom, if current rates persist throughout 2011, which of course they won't, then currency would be slightly positive on sales and slightly negative on profits compare to 2010.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will hand you over to David.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks Jon. It is my pleasure today to share a 2010 Pharma performance that we believe is among the best of the multinational companies, net sales growth of 6% in constant currency.</p>
          <p>Perhaps even more important than the absolute level growth is the fact that our product portfolio rejuvenation is ahead of plan with now 23% of our sales in Q4 from products that have launched since 2007. We took out over $1 billion in costs in Pharma as we focused on driving productivity and cash flow.</p>
          <p>And Trevor Mundel, the head of our global development function, has done a really terrific job in advancing the new product portfolio, the very portfolio that will help us to grow through the upcoming patent expirations of Femara and Diovan.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the next page, I'd just focus you on three numbers: 6% net sales growth, 10% core operating income; and cash flow growth of 16% as we've continued to lever the P&amp;L and take cash out of the business, which can then be reinvested.</p>
          <p>If you look across our different franchises you see strong growth across all franchises, in particular double-digit growth in Oncology, Neuroscience, Ophthalmics and Integrated Hospital Care. Of note, in the respiratory franchise we're starting to see the Onbrez sales coming through and this is a franchise to watch for the future as we will have multiple new launches, and we believe this will be another strong growth driver for the Novartis business.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 35 you'll see that our new product portfolio actually grew 41%, full year 2009 to full 2010, and that's what drove our confidence in the future and the quality of our sales.</p>
          <p>What I want to do now is talk to you about a few of our products and then our pipeline, starting with Gilenya, which we very recently launched in the U.S. As a reminder, Gilenya is a multiple sclerosis product which shows a 52% reduction in relapse versus standard of care, the interferons. And this is a product that is available in a once a day oral formulation. We've gotten very good feedback from patients, physicians and payers.</p>
          <p>Turning now to page 35, you see the IMS data, which shows encouraging prescription trends. I will remind you of a few things. In particular, the IMS is understating the actual numbers of patients on drug because we have a fairly liberal program to get patients on therapy with basically free medicine while they're working their way through the reimbursement process. And we estimate now that there are over 2,000 patients on drugs.</p>
          <p>We've done well with managed care payers, over 1,000 physicians have prescribed this product in the U.S., with global sales of 15 million, 13 million of which have come from the U.S. market. And as you know, we have just received the EU CHMP opinion, which has result in an EU commission approval in the coming months and have launched in Europe this year.</p>
          <p>Page 38, we want to share with you where the business is coming from. Now mind you this is a relatively small data set, so there could be some fluctuations in the numbers in the coming months. But it would appear that about half the patients have not been on therapy for the past 12 months. So these are patients that are either newly diagnosed or patients that had discontinued previous therapy because they couldn't tolerate for example the side effects associated with the interferons.</p>
          <p>Of the 50% of patients who had been recently treated, what you see is about half of the new business is coming from interferons. We are strongly taking business also from Copaxone and then to a much lesser extent, Tysabri, which is largely in line with what we would have anticipated. So what we see here is a market that's expanding and market share that's coming in the places that we thought.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Tasigna, Tasigna is an important new medicine where we recently gained and launched in the U.S. for de novo CML. During the course of the year we also received approval in Europe and in Japan, which I believe is one of the first times in our industry where a product has received approval in each of three major markets all within the same year, which speaks to our strategy to design our clinical programs to achieve rapid access all around the world. You can see from this chart that since we have launched in the de novo CML setting our market share for Tasigna has grown mightily. The overall franchise is now standing at $5 billion. It grew roughly 10% and we seem to be growing certainly faster than the other second-generation product. In the most weekly data, we have now passed Sprycel among the second-generation products in terms of market share, so our plan is delivering in line or slightly ahead of expectations.</p>
          <p>Now to spend a moment on Ilaris, a product which I feel is still somewhat misunderstood. This is a product that was originally launched for CAPS, a relatively rare disease. We achieved about $20 million in business and sales potential is going to be in the range of $100 million. What's really exciting are the new indications. We have positive data in Gouty arthritis, the file has gone in the European Union. We would expect to file during the first quarter in the U.S. and we would hope for an expedited review. Just as importantly, based upon our understanding of the biology in gout, we have started a program to prevent secondary MI in patients who have high inflammatory burden.</p>
          <p>This is a market which is quite large, measured in the millions of patients, that Phase III program will start mid year and we believe this is a sizable opportunity that if the product will work, it will be worth billions of dollars.</p>
          <p>Lucentis is another example of this approach where we build indication upon indication based upon where the science takes us. First approval in wet age-related macular degeneration now have the European approval for diabetic macular edema, which we're very excited about.</p>
          <p>And we would anticipate a CHMP decision in the second quarter for Retinal vein occlusion, that's earlier than original plan. These new patient populations should allow us to continue the strong growth of Lucentis.</p>
          <p>Now taking a look at productivity, I mentioned earlier that we took about $1 billion in costs out that resulted in 0.6 points in improvement in core return on sales. Stripping out FX effects that would actually have been roughly a full point improvement. And I'm optimistic that going forward there are still much more productivity that can <mark type="inaudible" /> in our Pharma business, which we can realize to offset the pricing pressures and to continue to invest in the launch as well as dropping some of it to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow reached a historic high now at 35% as a percent of sales. And I just want to close with one slide, which I really think sums up our business and differentiates us from many of our competitors: we have very strong news flow based upon a very well thought out, well designed clinical trial program, which is exactly in line with the strategy we spoke about, which is growth innovation as well as productivity. The only change on this slide is we now have the EU regulatory CHMP approval, so we are well &#x2013; CHMP decision, so we are well on our way to delivering on the first item on the chart.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to turn it back to Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. I am just going to touch on the other businesses, starting with Alcon on slide 48. We remain on track to close this transaction in the first half of the year. So once we close the deal, Alcon will become the second largest growth platform for Novartis at about 17% of our sales when we include CIBA Vision.</p>
          <p>We are planning two integrations, one is CIBA Vision and Pharma into Ophtha; and the other is &#x2013; sorry Pharma/Ophtha into Alcon, and the other is Alcon into Novartis. So since the announcement, we have been able to form teams on both the Alcon side and on the Novartis side. Those teams have met. We have got a governance process in place, and the integration planning is well underway. Our intention is to have the planning completed by the time that we close the transaction, so we will be able to execute on day one and get the new division up and running within three months of post-close.</p>
          <p>The third platform on the next slide, Sandoz achieved as you saw 15% sales growth. This was driven by significant volume expansion by the new product launches. So, I think the focus on differentiated and difficult to make generics is paying off and really generating significant growth for Sandoz.</p>
          <p>It's also important to note, I think, that Biosimilars was up 63% versus a year ago and further strengthened our number one global position. Sandoz also had great performance as shown on 51 in emerging markets: double-digit growth in Central and Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, Turkey and Africa.</p>
          <p>Now growth platform number four, the Consumer Health unit grew 6% in 2010 and I am quite pleased that all of the business units, OTC, CIBA Vision and Animal Health delivered growth that was ahead of their respective markets. OTC was supported by double-digit performance on some of the key brands as you see on slide 53. Prevacid 24HR became one of the fastest growing brands in our OTC business and also in the category.</p>
          <p>CIBA Vision also continued to deliver strong growth. Their AIR OPTIX brand was up 32% versus year ago driven by new product launches. And the multifocal Silicone Hydrogel Lens became the number one multifocal lens within 12 months of launch. Animal Health, we also strengthened our leadership position in specialty areas of Companion Animal and Farm Animal categories.</p>
          <p>On slide 54 you see Vaccines and Diagnostics continuing impressive growth of up 23%. But even when you take out H1N1, the base business grew 16% versus year-ago. This is due to a strong flu season and also the Menveo launch in 38 countries in 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 55, with the submission of the infant and toddler indications for Menveo, we became the only meningococcal vaccine with data that supports all age groups. We successfully launched Menveo in 2010 and we expect to build this meningitis franchise with the MenB vaccine.</p>
          <p>And then finally on slide 56, because of the breadth of the portfolio, I wanted to point out the fact that we were able to protect or treat 1 billion &#x2013; almost 1 billion patients in 2010, so over 900 million patients around the world, whether it was in innovative pharma &#x2013; pharmaceutical or a vaccine or some kind of a self medication.</p>
          <p>This speaks to the breadth of this portfolio and the importance of all of the touch points that a business of this scale has with patients and with customers around the world.</p>
          <p>So now, let me close with our outlook. On slide 58 you can see that Novartis has delivered strong double-digit top and bottom line growth over the past six years. And this has resulted from our strategy of focusing on our high growth segments of healthcare as well delivering on the innovation premium that we've been able to prove we can deliver.</p>
          <p>And based on this, the Board has proposed our 14th consecutive dividend increase and this will be voted upon at our Annual General Meeting in February 2011, it's on February 22nd.</p>
          <p>So for 2011, on slide 60, we expect to continue this growth story. Everybody knows that we're facing some expected headwinds like the beginning of the Diovan patent expiration. But we have many positives in 2011, specifically the growth of recently launched products will continue to ramp up. That includes now Gilenya, which will start to get some good traction.</p>
          <p>I believe that our emerging markets growth will accelerate and we will also have the integration of Alcon. So we're going to stay focused on the same three strategic priorities that we have kept this year, which is extending our lead in innovation, accelerating growth and driving productivity. And for 2011, on slide 62, we expect constant currency sales growth around the double-digit mark, that includes pharma sales in the low to mid single digit range including offsetting the patent expirations as well as cost containment.</p>
          <p>For Sandoz, we expect to grow mid single digits and with our continued focus on productivity we aim to grow core operating income margin, while absorbing price cuts, generic competition and the anticipated loss of the H1N1 pandemic sales.</p>
          <p>So we're bullish on 2011. And with that, I'd like to close and open up the call for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, thank you. I'd just like to ask on Gilenya, 2000 patients treated thus far. How many of those have actually rolled over from clinical trials and how much actually is a true number of new patients since the approval of the drug?</p>
          <p>And then, just secondly perhaps on QMF. I see that in the U.S. you're not developing any further for COPD. Just how much of that is due to the LABA issues or is this reflecting greater confidence in the QVA combination? Perhaps you could just shed a little bit of light on that please.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, regarding Gilenya, most of these are patients who were not involved in clinical trials. Of the 2000 patients, about 35% of these patients are on commercial drug, the rest are on free starter packs. Trevor, do you want to address the QVA/QMF question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, indeed. So just to remind people that the QVA, which is the combination of the antimuscarinic and beta-agonist, is really the center point of our Q strategy. So that's what we're really focused on. And we are going to submit that at the end of next year both in the U.S. and in Europe. So indeed, you are right about the LABA issue in the U.S., which means that for a drug like QMF even if we developed that for COPD we would need a very large safety study, which would really be prohibitive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Just on guidance for margins for 2011, you're targeting an increase in Group margins, <mark type="inaudible" /> receives a boost from having a full year of Alcon. So I am just wondering if you can give an indication of directionally where you see the other divisional core operating margins trending: flat, up or down? Second, just wondering if you quantify the impacts of U.S. and EU healthcare reforms incrementally in 2011 versus 2010 on your sales and EBIT margin for Pharma?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly on Sandoz, I was just wondering if you could give us your view on pricing and margin outlook for enoxaparin generic if Teva's product is approved this year. And clarify whether your guidance actually does assume the Teva approval and also whether it assumes any approval of your generic Advair product in Europe this year.</p>
          <p>And then final question for Jon on dividend, just wondering if you could update us what payout ratio you are now intending to maintain and whether this is calculated as of core or GAAP EPS when you're thinking about this now? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start on margin and I'll probably disappoint you a little bit by not going to the same divisional tour that you would like. But one of the &#x2013; just to reemphasize, one of the points that I made as I went through, as you translate 2010 into 2011, you are quite right in saying that we get an incremental boost to our margin from Alcon. It's a bit over &#x2013; it's a bit over 1%, because there was already 0.4% in the 2010 margin.</p>
          <p>But we also lose the full effect of H1N1, which is 1.7% in aggregate. And so that means that actually to aim to improve underlying core or improve core margin, we have got a half a point or more to make up before we get there. And that's why we continue to believe that we are still on track in terms of turning productivity into margin improvement. And so that's, I think that's why we are still confident that this business is capable of generating more. But you've got to take those two big moving pieces into account before thinking about what's really happening at the macro level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The payout ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The payout ratio, I think, we've always said that that the ceiling for the payout ratio was 60%. And right now we are at a 55% payout ratio. We don't really need to adjust the base metric for the dividend, because we still have a little bit of headroom in there. But right now we're at 55% and I think that's a pretty decent payout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably, the best way to speak about the reforms is to really just take you through pricing at a high level and then you can model from there. In the Pharma division, the full-year pricing impact was a rounded minus 2%. It was slightly higher in Q4. For next year, we will see the full impact of U.S. healthcare reform as well as the full impact of European measures that were taking this year. So pricing will be slightly worse than in 2010 and we would say it's probably in the minus 2% to minus 3% worldwide. I think that probably gives you enough to make an estimate.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Graham with respect to enox, obviously I can't really comment on when Teva could enter the market. I think what is significant before I come to your question on price and margins is that Sandoz was the first to market and we've been the sole generic for over six months now. Our market share estimates Dave, the range is quite significant even based on IMS data. We believe we're around or slightly over 40% market share and we're continuing to work to increase our supply beyond that.</p>
          <p>From a pricing and margin perspective for competitive reasons wouldn't really be appropriate for me to show guidance on that. I would say from a timing perspective &#x2013; I will say that if we stay as the sole generic beyond the first half of the year that we could see our topline move upwards from mid single-digits to high single-digits. But of course, that's speculative at this point.</p>
          <p>With respect to generic Advair, again, apologies, but for competitive reasons, there is nothing more that I really want to say on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have three questions, please. First one is, one of your major competitors has decided to delink sales rep bonuses in the U.S. from target physicians script trends. I wonder on your current practice and whether unless you are forced to you have any intention of following suit?</p>
          <p>Secondly, question for David, on QVA, could you just outline for us the implications if the FDA again declines to recommend and then approve QAB for COPD, what are the implications in terms of QVA? Does it mean you'd have to initiate a new set of clinical trials, how much of a delay would that mean in terms of potential U.S. registration? And then the final question is, Jon you alluded to the census provision that's described as a one-time item in the press release. Could you give us a little bit more detail to help us understand the potential implications? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I will start on the U.S field force. We -- the way that we compensate our field force today is obviously different than the way that one of our competitors moved. But we have a system where we not only compensate them based on the results that they get in market, but also the behaviors that they exhibited to deliver those results. And because of that we believe that we have a good compensation system that gets at some of the issues that our competitor wanted to get at, so already designed within our current compensation system for the sales force. So we don't anticipate any changes to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You don't feel the need to go to the extreme of actually delinking an absolute.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, we don't. We absolutely don't. We also executed a clawback in every sales person's incentive that if it were discovered that there was any non-compliance from a marketing or sales standpoint, we would go after any compensation that was earned based on that.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Andrew, as you know, we have filed at the moment in the U.S. for doses of the 75 and 150 micrograms of the QAB. And we have the advisory coming up in early March.</p>
          <p>I think we are very confident about that data package. We generated 2000 additional patient data as requested by the FDA. There is the issue &#x2013; open issue of the doses for the global program versus the U.S. program. And we'll have to see what happens at the advisory. We think there's a good chance that we have doses which are compatible. But we have planned for the eventuality that there would be a mismatch in doses and we have the additional trials in our pocket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Lucentis, I think, your question is why was Q4 growth a low trend. Basically what happened is we have a risk share agreement in one country, where we needed to make an accounting adjustment and that artificially brought down the underlying growth rates. If you subtract that out, actually Lucentis grew at a roughly 19% in the fourth quarter, which I think is reflective of what you would anticipate for this kind of round.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Matthew Weston, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I've got a number, if I can. Firstly, Jon, regarding Pharma guidance, you've said that you're going to change the consolidation and move Ophthalmic Pharma out and put it in Alcon, can you clarify whether the low to mid single-digits includes that adjustment or whether that's on a like-for-like basis?</p>
          <p>And then secondly I think just a more general question, you were perceived to be really quite upbeat around margins when you presented to us in November. You now seem to be somewhat more cautious or certainly that's the market's perception today. I'd just ask what's changed in that time, is it anything? Or long-term do you still see the margin potential at the company, albeit do you see it in 2011 as well?</p>
          <p>And just a couple of quick financial questions, Jeff on enoxaparin, you reported 292 million in the third quarter. I calculate that means it's 170 million in 4Q. Obviously, there was going to be some pipeline filling, but what's actually representative of a quarter of enox sales given your market share? Is it somewhere in between the two?</p>
          <p>And then finally on Vaccines, taking your comments that pandemic contributed 1.7 percentage points of margin that basically suggested $850, $900 million of operating income for the V&amp;D division. That basically suggests the underlying performance of the division is abysmal and significantly below what it was before pandemic flu kicked in. What should we expect for 2011, should we be aiming for single-digit underlying or can it do better than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start. On Pharma, the guidance has been on a like-for-like. So it doesn't take account of any transfers out into Alcon. And at the point that we complete and that the new division is formed we will provide you with new pro formas on that.</p>
          <p>I think your question on margin &#x2013; I don't think anything has changed in my view. I think what you are seeing in 2011 is the fact that we are facing generic competition and we will over the next year or two. But the fundamental investment thesis that lies behind the productivity drive remains absolutely intact. And that's why to the earlier question I pointed out that actually you take away H1N1 and Alcon, we are still driving the underlying margin forward and investing at the same time. And one of the things that I should have made to the earlier question was actually we are investing in vaccines and we are investing in Biologicals and we are still moving it forward.</p>
          <p>And so, David talked about more productivity to go for, the purchasing benefits that Joe referred to were over a $1 billion. In aggregate it was four percentage points. So I think we're absolutely in line with what we said in November, but the difference now is that you're seeing the impact of generic competition, but the underlying is moving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I also think if you look &#x2013; what we said in November and you think about the next five years, the underlying margin potential in the company is significant. All you have to do is look at our marketing and sales ratios relative to other companies and look at where we're going to get procurement savings and the manufacturing footprint projects that we've taken. We also though said it wasn't going to be linear. So, if people were expecting kind of a nice smooth curve, it's just not going to look like that. But I think we are &#x2013; we said that we aim to improve core operating income margin. Some of the charges that we took in the fourth quarter will improve our cost structure like the U.S. field force restructuring, the manufacturing restructuring that we took in vaccines in the fourth quarter and the German Sandoz restructuring that we took in the fourth quarter, all of this is going to help to improve the cost structure and we are going to keep plugging away of it. Jeff, Enox.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mathew, on your question on Enox, the monthly run rate that you saw in the fourth quarter of $56, $57 million a month is roughly in line with what we would expect for a 40 share, I'd say maybe slightly more than that if we continue to stay alone. Obviously it's higher than if Teva enters or if Teva and an AGX enter.</p>
          <p>On margins, I will just mention that Sandoz's Core ROS was at an all-time high of 19.8% in 2010 and we are working hard to continue delivering very strong underlying profitability going forward. On the productivity side, one last comment I would make. We drove well over $450 million of productivity savings. In-year savings in 2010 that is on top of close to 400 in 2009, so about 850 million of cost savings in that two-year period to drive that kind of margin improvement.</p>

          <p>Andrin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just like to first comment on your calculation. And I think, first of all, I do not believe that one can assume without the H1N1 pandemic we would have had the numbers that you described to just taking the pandemic sales out. And it is a volatile business and opportunities come from different sides. And I also would like in that context to highlight that if you compare the figures before the pandemic also in 2007, we had significant sales from at that point in time avian pandemic stockpile supplies to certain governments. So I think that has to be taken into account as well and we will see next year what are the opportunities that will come along.</p>
          <p>Second point I wanted to make is that if you look at the core operating income for this year, it was above $1 billion. I think that for me is a pretty good performance given that we are significantly investing in growing this business and we have some catch-up to do versus the leading competitors. And I think as Jon has said, we definitely will keep on investing. We have I think one of the leading pipeline, if not the leading pipeline in the vaccines industry that will absorb money as well as the launch of our meningitis franchise and I think that definitely will have an impact that you will see on our P&amp;L in the quarters to come.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Two question. First for Trevor just follow-on really on the &#x2013; your comment on the SABA/LABA safety study, can you explain why in COPD you would need a different sized safety study for QMS than you would for QVA?</p>
          <p>And secondly, for Jeff just on Enoxaparin, could you broadly run through the scenario where a second entrant comes in and concern that if that is the case, the economics to you in terms of operating contribution could actually improve rather than deteriorate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the QVA versus QMS, so the antimuscarinics are not currently widely used in asthma. So I think there's not the same expectation that there would be potential crossover usage from COPD to asthma as there is with the inhaled corticosteroid, so QMF product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Kevin, with respect to scenarios for how things will evolve if there's an Enox second entrant. I read your note on the <mark type="inaudible" /> generics economics where we would shift from a 45% profit share to a high single-digit to low double-digit royalty to Momenta. The conclusion you reached in your report on the economics is largely right. Some of the assumptions were a bit off in terms of how you got to the actual ROS, I think you may want to look at your pricing assumption in terms specifically what percent of brand WAC you are assuming, which will give you better guidance on the contribution margin. But I think you actually ended up coming out to largely a correct number.</p>

          <p>Thank you, a couple of questions. On Gilenya, of the 50% that have not been on therapy for the last 12 months, what's the split between first line versus treatment failures?</p>
          <p>And then second question is on Alcon, there seems to be deceleration in growth in the surgical and consumer product lines. In fourth quarter it was 3% for surgical, 1% for consumer and I think surgical was also weak in the third quarter. And sales growth across all three divisions was 5%. I am wondering why we are seeing certain divisions slow recently. And I am wondering if that 2011 guidance for Alcon sales of high single-digits percent might end up being a stretch.</p>

          <p>So regarding Gilenya the database is still fairly thin and volatile. We do not have the breakdown at any level of confidence, how many of the patients are de novo versus treatment failure. I think in time we will have better datasets to share with you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Tim, regarding the Alcon question, as you look at some of the surgical procedures and what's happening with the economy, there is a high level of discretion around delaying surgery that seems to be impacting that business. They have seen this phenomenon occur before. And it comes back, eventually and so we are still quite bullish on the original guidance that was given by Alcon when you look at it across the board.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one on Gilenya, what is &#x2013; how many patients do you expect to convert to be reimbursed out of the 2000 in the first quarter? And could you give us a sense of how many patients do you add per week or per month, whichever metrics you're looking at?</p>
          <p>Then on Ilaris, do you expect any significant off label use with the drug given that you've achieved the important pain score in the studies, you're going to present it EULAR.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, on Lucentis, I'm trying to understand the dynamics behind the sales in Europe because my understanding is that you have forged package deals with certain governments around different countries to determine ceilings. Now how does this work as you get new indications in? Does the average &#x2013; can you actually &#x2013; do you get to a higher threshold in terms of the sales level per country, or is the only thing that happens that the average price per patient goes down? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Lots of questions, I'll start with the last one first. Lucentis in the EU, the new indication, in most cases a new indication drives a rediscussion of the price and any type of reimbursement or rebate program. So everything would largely be -- would be reset. You should anticipate some modest price erosion when you go back and expand the indications for our product.</p>
          <p>Regarding Ilaris and whether or not it would be used in Gouty arthritis. We don't promote off label. I would not anticipate much in the short run. And then regarding the patients who are on free drug for Gilenya. It seems like the typical period to get reimbursement is anywhere from one to three months. So that we would then anticipate the vast majority of the patients who are currently getting free drug would be on reimbursed drug in the next quarter, but of course new patients will be coming on on free drug and it will be a dynamic process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add on the Lucentis answer was that with the new indication in diabetic macular edema there are as many patients as there are in wet AMD outside the U.S. And so even if there were, let's say, when you're going back for an additional indication and renegotiation on the price, the potential incremental volume is significant. And that incremental volume will not fall under the same caps that we originally negotiated unless we were unsuccessful in opening up those discussions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First of all coming back to the margin guidance, you highlighted productivity improvements in Q4 of about 400 basis points. Now, I suppose the COGS increase was driven also by higher raw materials. Do you expect a further rise in COGS for the year or have you fixed &#x2013; largely fixed the annual contracts? And secondly, can you or to what extent are you incentivizing your reps to switch from Diovan to Tekturna combos? We had the accelerated study recently, what initiatives do you have underway here? And then a couple of smaller ones, when will you roughly start your buyback and when do you expect the F4 approval, roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, margin guidance and F4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. On productivity, you're right. The total value of productivity was 4% in the quarter, across all programs. And in relation to rising raw material prices, for the majority of inputs, we have contracts that take us through 2011. So where we're seeing increases on packaging for example, they're being debated in relation to 2012 contracts. On the buyback, we are free following this call to commence buybacks if we wish. But, you won't expect me to tell you when we are and when we are not going to be buying back. But, as from now, it's open. There is really nothing to say on the details and mechanics for the F4. We've always said that the principle governing &#x2013; the governing factor to timing is the F4 and as Joe said earlier we are on track for first half completion, so you can read into that that there is no change in the guidance from December.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so the question with regarding moving patients from Diovan to Tekturna, I wouldn't think of it that way, rather I would think about the Tekturna strategy which is to focus on patients with hypertension which have renal complications where we think the drug is particularly well-suited. And we are about to introduce now into the U.S. market the combination of Tekturna and Amlodipine called Tekamlo, where there is roughly a 50 point drop in blood pressure, which is efficacy positioning for the brand. And just for additional clarity, in Europe we have virtually no promotion on Diovan at this time.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mrs. Alexandra Hauber, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Several questions please. Firstly, you &#x2013; in Vaccines you mentioned some rationalization of the manufacturing facilities, can you just elaborate a bit here because I was never under the impression that you had too many plans in Vaccines, that this was rather an area of future CapEx spend. And if there is rationalization will that affect anyway your flu capacity going forward?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the DME approval came in January as in 2011. So since you have to go through new reimbursement discussion, I was wondering whether in Germany, this is now covered by the new AMNOG procedure that you have to submit data to justify your price and then by beginning 2012 we will all know whether you get the price or whether you have to take a significant haircut. So just some color on that procedure in Germany, how this is changing I would appreciate. The third question is on QMF, the insight that you would need prohibitively large safety database for approval. Is that &#x2013; does that insight come from end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA on QMF or is it a read across you're making from your QAB program?</p>
          <p>And the final question is just on a comment from Jon on Sandoz R&amp;D becoming more expensive because of investment for Biosimilars and the respiratory pipeline. I recall that about a year ago you said that Biosimilars is breaking even. So was it a step-up in investment for Biosimilars? Is it no longer breaking even or was your breakeven comment meant on the pre-R&amp;D basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Andrin, do you want to start with Vaccines.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The restructuring has two major elements. The first one is on <mark type="inaudible" /> manufacturing. It has a very small old facility in Germany that produced <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. I don't hear you very well. Can you repeat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, is it better now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, that we had a very small flu facility an egg-based facility in Germany that produced a product called <mark type="inaudible" />, it was very low volumes and not cost effective.</p>
          <p>And second one is in Liverpool, we are, as you may know building a new site that started to operate last year. But due to the pandemic we also kept the old site open until the end of the pandemic and we now closed down the old site that we were planning to replace with that new one that is now operating.</p>
          <p>The second major driver of profitability is streamlining of secondary manufacturing which is filling and packaging we still had due to the &#x2013; for historic reasons three almost independent operations in Liverpool, in Marburg in Germany and in Siena in Italy, and we just optimized these processes to have a better capacity utilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So going forward only one big egg-based facility, that's Liverpool and the same quantity as before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as egg-based is concerned we will have one large modern facility in Liverpool and we will remain also a smaller facility that we have in Siena that produces an egg-based vaccine. The overall quantity is expected to increase compared to the past.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra, I'm trying to give you a mixed answer. I don't know with 100% certainty whether Lucentis in DME falls under those pricing rules or not. I'll double check, but the reality is most of the Lucentis pricing is negotiated with the individual health insurers in Germany anyway. They're already getting their product at a discount. So I doubt that the timing of the approval of DME will have any kind of major consequential impact on German pricing. But I'll double check your specific question and we'll get back to you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Alexandra on the QMF question, so you are correct that this is an inference from our discussions around QAB, but also around Foradil and the LABA safety issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra, with respect to your question on the ramp up in investments for Biosimilars in respiratory, Jon was alluding to the significant increase in R&amp;D spending in Q4 for Sandoz. And we'll see that in Q1 and Q2 as we move forward. As key MAb programs in Biosimilars move into clinical trials, same thing for respiratory. And while this is a short-term impact on the P&amp;L, this is a very good mid-term item for us as we look to retain and strengthen our number one position in biosimilars globally with just around half of the world's market in the regulated markets in Europe and North America.</p>
          <p>I'd mention, broadly speaking on Biosimilars that the business grew 63% to just under $200 million with over 200% growth in Eastern Europe, over 100% growth in Western Europe. Our, filgrastim our newest biosimilar grew 245%. With respect to profitability, I would say the steady state profitability of Biosimilars is very attractive.</p>
          <p>What takes out of profitability in the short term is the significant investments we are making into our future to continue to position ourselves to be a very significant business looking out five years when we have a number of patents and what will be probably over 50, 60 billion of biologics products that are coming off patent in the next five to six years. So it's a great opportunity for us and we're investing behind that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think -- the only thing I would add is that because biosimilars rest within Sandoz. Sandoz &#x2013; Jeff's got a margin top target that he needs to beat. And he can move around spending within his group also that looks at those greatest new product opportunities, new innovation opportunities and choose to invest in there without having to say, okay, I want the profitability of biosimilars to be X this year as long as he is taking cost out at other areas of the enterprise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I'd point out Alexandra is just more broadly on the injectables business, Sandoz has over $1.5 billion business, now we've moved to number two globally ahead of both Teva and Fresenius. We were number four two years ago and this is a business with oncology injectables that's highly profitable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, upwards of 1.5 billion, I'd say probably a good bit bigger than that. I don't want to give too much more guidance on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look at the IMS data, you'll see even a bigger number than that if you take the Enox run rates, but keep in mind, products come and go. Oxaliplatin was 40 million in Optic in Q1 last year and we don't have that in Q1 this year.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very mush. Just a few financial questions please. First on the European Diovan patent, where are you at in terms of getting a six-month extension in the various countries, i.e. should we expect the bulk of the European Diovan generics in the first or the second half?</p>
          <p>The second question, can you give the 2010 Diovan sales, specifically for Spain and for the rest of Europe just for our own modeling? And a technical question on the guidance: am I right in assuming that any core operating margin improvement this year would automatically translate into constant currency core EPS growth versus last year despite the non-recurrence of Alcon associate income?</p>
          <p>And I know you don't want to go into lot of detail on the divisions, but are there actually any divisions where we will definitely not see a margin improvement this year? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Marietta, I don't really want to go back through all the comments I've made before, but I think if you do go through the transcript that you'll see that there is quite a lot of indications on a division by division basis. And the reason for holding to a constant currency target at this point is because we've seen quite a big shift in the last month and we don't really know what the currency situation is going to be going forward. So we felt that it was wise not to add a currency exposure to the target. But, of course, as we go through each quarter, we will update you on the currency assumptions as they develop during the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wasn't actually wondering about the currency, I was just wondering how to correlate operating margin improvement with EPS improvement. So I just wanted to make sure that what is currently implied in your guidance is a constant currency EPS growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no. Look, I think you've got to take each of the lines below constant currency operating profit and factor in the assumptions for where interest is going. The fact that there is no Alcon in associated companies, I've given you the tax rate and that's I think more easier piece of puzzle to solve then for Group operating income.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. First, a question for Jeff. Is there any read across for <mark type="inaudible" /> in the U.S. following the decision on QMF? And have you changed your plan regarding the development of <mark type="inaudible" /> in the U.S.? My second question is on Gilenya. You're gaining market share against all the products in the U.S. Do you believe that will be the same in Europe as you have a slightly different label? And the last one on the M&amp;A, maybe could you give us the rationale of the Genoptix acquisition for the oncology division? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Florent, as I said earlier, I am hesitant to give any guidance on specific products within our respiratory pipeline. But as I said in London at Investor Day, when asked a similar question, I would just reiterate that we at Novartis and at Sandoz believe in the potential for full substitutability of combination asthma and COPD products. So, the potential to leverage the 505(j) pathway as opposed to necessarily having to go through a 505(b)2 route. One correction to a comment I made earlier to Alexandra, the ejectables number globally percent, it was closer to 1.8 billion, I just reference check, so not 1.5.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding expectations for Gilenya in Europe. First of all, we are excited about the launch. I think there is quite a good demand for the drug based upon the phone calls and emails we are getting. There is no reason to believe that there would be substantially different source of business at least in terms of the products the patients would be migrating from in Europe.</p>
          <p>Regarding Genoptix, I think you know that our strategy is to increasingly, on the development side and the commercial side match the right drug to the right patient. In order to do that we need to develop molecular diagnostic tests, and we thought Genoptix was a company that has a very good reputation in the marketplace among hematologists and oncologists in terms of servicing their need and thought that would be a good vehicle to make sure that our tests were readily available as we launch our new pharmaceuticals.</p>

          <p>Great, yeah, thanks for taking my question. It's just a quick ones on Gilenya, again, and I apologize for this David, it's probably pushing your market intelligence data too far. But, if we look at the patients you're picking up from Tysabri in the US, my guess now, half of patients on Tysabri are involved in the STRATIFY studies therefore they know their JC virus status. Is there a risk that in fact the patients you're picking up are patients who are enriched, if you like, for JC-V positivity and therefore perhaps is there a risk profile attached to those patients you're picking up and how do you think about managing that? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Regarding Gilenya, the main focus is in the areas where we have head-to-head data for example, versus interferons, that's where our commercial efforts are targeted. But it is clear that Tysabri patients want to come off the drug and are looking for alternatives. We really can't control what those patients have been exposed to, how long they've been on the drug, but that's not where we're going.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Few questions. Firstly, emerging markets, it seems like the growth rate in the top six markets is reducing from 19% to 9% this year. Just a comment on whether you think that will continue.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on whether the margin &#x2013; the change in margins is being driven by a geographic mix changes?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on your dividend policy, are you looking for year-on-year growth in dividends or just a control of the cash flow, specifically? So if you could help on those, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with emerging markets, our total emerging markets business this year on the top six were 4.6 billion and it grew 12%. While I think that is a good performance, it's not a great performance. And so we would expect to see that increase back probably closer to the 19%, 20% range or hopefully more than that. We had a couple of slowdowns particularly in China when we moved from a very centralized structure to a regional structure. It was the right thing to do but we did &#x2013; it caused some level of disruption. That is now on back on track and believe that 2011 will be a better number. Also, Turkey took significant reductions due to the price hit that we took in 2011 &#x2013; 2010 which should not repeat itself in 2011. So in total we expect improved performance in emerging markets. Around the margin -</p>

          <p>On &#x2013; I don't think there are any major &#x2013; I don't think there are many major geographical shifts in Oncology and I think we are such a big pool that it's not really detectable in the trends that we see. And then finally on dividends, I mean I think the way Joe proudly presented 14 years of consecutive increases in dividends I think is a record that we would aim to continue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions on Sandoz. On the back of very strong sales in Q4. Of enoxaparin, the benefits from your other U.S. exclusivities seem to be passing or fading throughout 2011. So should we expect to see any other major first-to-file opportunities in Sandoz in 2011 to make up for these losses? If not, is there any reason to believe why that wouldn't on its own lead to negative margin impact in 2011 versus 2010?</p>
          <p>And then also on the ex-U.S. businesses, maybe some more general comments on whether you see the German market landscape stabilizing with multisource tenders and other impacts?</p>
          <p>And then maybe some other color on the scale of the other major price impacts you expect across Europe, and whether any cost savings can fully offset these? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Great. So David, to answer your question and kind of go around the world on that is, quickly. In the U.S. business, we've got great momentum. We grew 46% last year. We overtook Mylan as the number two player in the market.</p>
          <p>We are seeing loss &#x2013; new competitors on some of our key products like tacro, lansoprazole, losartan, some of the others. But we have a strong position, over half of the market of gemcitabine. We are launching a number of oral contraceptives. We have a couple of small firsts to file that are key.</p>
          <p>I think also Germany, we've talked about, specifically there the market while it's declining &#x2013; it declined 12% to 15% last year, we only declined 6%. So, we continue to strengthen our number one position in the market. And it's critical to look at net sales not gross sales. The gross market may show low single digits. Net sales will show in 2011 double-digit decline.</p>
          <p>However, Western Europe we grew 10% in 2010. And I'd mentioned the key markets that are in Southern Europe that have low penetration in generics. We grew 44% in Italy. There are other untapped markets like Japan that have significant potential; we grew 30% there.</p>
          <p>And finally I'd wrap it up by commenting on the emerging markets that three of our four regions grew at two to four times the market growth rates. And we continue to see tremendous potential in Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe and even Latin America where our business was softer in 2010.</p>
