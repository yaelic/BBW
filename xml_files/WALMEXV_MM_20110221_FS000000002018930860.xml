          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the Walmart de M&#xE9;xico y Centroam&#xE9;rica Earnings Call for the fourth quarter of the year 2010. Scot Rank, President and CEO for Walmart de M&#xE9;xico y Centroam&#xE9;rica will talk about the numbers for the fourth quarter of the year 2010, and then I will comment on the highlights for the full year.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Rafael and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. I will start by looking at Mexico results. Fourth quarter was an excellent quarter for Mexico. It is encouraging to see that a business like Mexico can still grow operating income and EBITDA at more than twice the rate of growth of sales.</p>
          <p>Total sales were up 8.9% and 2.9% at comparable stores. Gross margin for the fourth quarter 2010 was 22.7% this year versus 22.1% last year, up 62 basis points. We had gross margin improvement across all of our business formats. We did a good job of planning for the season with improved suppliers' turns.</p>
          <p>Expense control continues to be a major focus throughout the organization. Expenses in Mexico grew only 6.9%, and expenses as a percentage of sales were 24 basis points lower than last year.</p>
          <p>Operating margin was 10.0% versus 9.1% last year, and EBITDA margin was 11.5% versus 10.6% last year, an improvement of 86 and 92 basis points, respectively. Sales for the quarter were driven by increases in average ticket. Ticket growth was stronger than traffic growth across all of our business formats. We had a good performance from general merchandise and also, a very good performance of Suburbia.</p>
          <p>We continue to outperform the industry. Same-store sales for Walmex self-service stores increased 2.5%, compared to 1.3% increase for ANTAD, excluding Walmex.</p>
          <p>Now let's move from Mexico in to Central America. Central America clearly had a disappointing fourth quarter despite an excellent sales performance. There is a fair amount of noise in our results both this year and last year that drove EBITDA down sharply. Total sales were up 9.0%, with very solid growth in same-store sales of 6.9%. Gross margin decreased 32 basis points from last year as a result of an adjustment of inventories versus last year.</p>
          <p>Expenses increased 16.4%, which very negatively compares with 9.0% increase of total income. The main reason for this increase had to do with the comparison base, as last year, a cancellation of a bonus provision drove expenses down sharply. As a result of the decrease in gross margin, and increase in general expenses, EBITDA for general &#x2013; for Central America decreased 11.8%. Without the two effects I just mentioned, EBITDA would have been 5.3%.</p>
          <p>Same-store sales had a very strong 6.9% growth on a constant currency basis driven by 4.3% increase in average ticket, and 2.4% increase in traffic.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look into the consolidated fourth quarter results for Mexico and Central America. Total income reached $100 billion pesos, 87.4 billion for Mexico, and 12.9 billion for Central America. Gross margin was 22.6%, general expenses were 13.5%, operating income reached 9.1%, and EBITDA was 10.9% combining Mexico and Central America.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we had a total income growth of 25%. Consolidated gross profit grew 28%, and gross margin went from 22.1% last year to 22.6% this year. The toughest effect of consolidation was reflected in general expenses as a percentage of total income that when we consolidate both regions, increases 53 basis points. Consolidated EBITDA increased 28%, and net earnings increased 14%.</p>
          <p>Now, before I turn it to Rafael to summarize the result for the year 2010, I would just like to say that I'm proud of the performance of our team, and the very solid results Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico y Centroam&#xE9;rica delivered.</p>
          <p>We increased our leadership position in Mexico. We integrated Central America's operation into Walmex. We closed the year with the strongest team ever and we improved our commitment to be a socially responsible company. We are ready to take advantage of the multiple profitable growth opportunities ahead of us in 2011. Rafael?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Scot. I will start with the year 2010 results for Mexico. Despite a challenging environment, Mexico had a very strong performance in the year 2010. Total income was up 9.7% to $297 billion pesos, $26 billion pesos more than last year. Comparable store sales were up 3.2%. Gross margin was 22% versus 21.7% of last year. And we were able to grow gross profit by 12%.</p>
          <p>Expenses were the greatest challenge in the year 2010. We have done a good job in maintaining our discipline in expenses, but our costs have been impacted by increases in electricity tariffs and depreciation, expenses without depreciation grew less than sales. Operating income and EBITDA grew at a faster rate than sales. Operating margin was 8.6% versus 8.2% of last year, and EBITDA margin was 10.4% versus 10% of last year.</p>
          <p>In 2010, our sales continued to outperform the industry despite much tougher comparison base in our case. Walmex same-store sales for the self-service format in Mexico grew 2.8%, more than double the rate of growth of the industry as measured by ANTAD, which increased 1.3%, excluding Walmex. And in terms of total sales, our self-service format in Mexico grew 9.6%, which very positively compares with the 6.2% growth of ANTAD, excluding Walmex.</p>
          <p>Expenses increased 9.9%, slightly more than sales. Expenses were impacted by the increase of electricity costs that drove our utility expense 20.8% up, and by a 37.1% increase in remodel expenses. The rest of the expenses increased 8.8% on a sales growth of 9.7%. Banco Walmart reached 910,000 customers by the end of the year 2010. Deposit balances reached $1.3 billion pesos while trade portfolio accounted to $965 million pesos.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to a discussion of our operations in Central America. We will talk about Central America numbers for the year 2010, though we started consolidated in March. Total sales for the year 2010 were up 6.9% while same-store sales grew a strong 5.2%. Gross margin for the year 2010 was 22.2% versus a 22.1% for the prior year despite strong price investment to drive sales. Expenses were the greatest challenge, as they increased 7.4%, compared to the 6.9% increase in sales. Both operating income and EBITDA increased more than sales, 7.2% and 7.5%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Last year was our first year of international expansion, and I'm pleased with our startup operations. We did five and started working on investing on driving synergies in Central America. During coming years, we will strengthen our effectiveness in leveraging our size and expertise in the region, so as to drive continuous profitable growth.</p>
          <p>The main driver of sales and growth in Central America is currently comparable sales growth that as I said before, increased a strong 5.2% for the year 2010. We strongly invested in prices that resulted in a 3.7% increase in traffic, and a 1.3% increase in ticket at comparable stores.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move into the consolidated results for Mexico and Central America. As I said before, we are consolidating Central America since March. Total income reached $335.9 billion pesos, 296.7 billion for Mexico, and 39.2 billion for Central America. Gross margin is 14 basis points higher in Central America than in Mexico. Expenses as a percentage of sales are 394 basis points higher in Central America.</p>
          <p>Operating margin and EBITDA are higher in the Mexican operations than in Central America, 380 and 389 basis points, respectively. Operating margin is 8.6% for Mexico, 4.8% for Central America, and 8.1% for Walmex. EBITDA is 10.4% for Mexico, 6.5% for Central America and 9.9% for Walmex.</p>
          <p>Consolidation of Central America had a clear positive effect in growth rates. During the year, we had a total income growth of 24%. Consolidated gross profit grew 26%, and gross margin went from 21.7% last year to 22.1%. The toughest effect of consolidation is reflected in general expenses as a percentage to total income, that, as we consolidate both regions increased 56 basis points, compared to last year's level that only includes Mexico. Consolidated EBITDA amounted to $33.3 billion pesos, and increased 24% versus last year. Net earnings amounted to $19.6 billion pesos, a 16% increase versus last year.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share for the year 2010 amounted to $1.105 pesos an 11% increase over the last year and 108% increase in the last five years.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains strong. Our free cash flow performance continues to be very strong, and we closed the year with $24.7 billion pesos in cash, 5.2 billion more than the last year and an increase of 27%. Our strong balance sheet allows us to spend capital and return income to our shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares. Our total CapEx spent in Mexico and Central America in the year was $13.1 billion pesos. We paid a dividend of $5.7 billion pesos, and in addition, the company repurchased 112 million shares for an amount of $3.5 billion pesos.</p>

          <p>Rafael, before we finish, I will briefly comment on our three strategic priorities. First, continuous profitable growth, last year, we added close to 10 million square feet of selling space to our operations, 51% from organic growth as we opened 297 stores in Mexico, and 49% from the acquisition of Wal-Mart Central America. We opened 267 stores and restaurants in Mexico of all of our different formats and 30 stores in Central America. With these store openings, we increased our installed capacity in Mexico by 11.4% and 12.1% for self-service formats in Mexico, and by 3.7% in Central America. We closed the year 2010 with 2279 stores and restaurants in Mexico and Central America. And as of today, we have 2294 stores and restaurants. We will be disclosing our 2011 expansion program next Thursday, February 24th, at our Analyst Meeting.</p>
          <p>The second point is talent, since we have closed out my first year leading Walmex I have to say that I'm proud of the quality of our team, and their commitment to exceeding customer expectations, from senior leadership to the more than 219,000 associates who serve more than 1.4 million customers a day in our 2,279 stores in six countries. In 2010, 20,058 associates were promoted, and 11 million man-hours were invested in training.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, our corporate social responsibility. In addition to financial operating results, 2010 was a record-breaking year on the subject of corporate social responsibility. In line with our commitment to make a difference in communities in Mexico and Central America, we reached a historical figure of 86,000 associate volunteers who helped their community. We allocated more than $491 million pesos to 449 social institutions in the region benefiting more than 2.7 million people.</p>
          <p>We also took a leadership role in sustainability, investing $248 million pesos in environmental protection projects. We're now supplying 348 stores with clean energy from our Wind Farm in Oaxaca, reducing CO2 emissions by 137,000 tons per year. We also organized our first sustainability forum, Together for a Better Planet, with suppliers, with over of 1,000 participants.</p>
