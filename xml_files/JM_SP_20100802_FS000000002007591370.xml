          <p>Welcome to our Interim Results Presentation for 2010. For those of you who don't know, my name is James Riley and I am the Group Finance Director.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I would just remind you of the structure of Jardine Matheson; although I am sure most of you are familiar with it. On the slide, you can see the first four companies. Jardine Pacific, Jardine Motors, Jardine Lloyd Thompson and Jardine Strategic are held directly by Jardine Matheson.</p>
          <p>And then next, we have Jardine Strategic's interests in Hongkong Land, Dairy Farm, Mandarin Oriental, Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage through which we have our 50% stake in Astra and finally Rothschild. The ownership column indicates the direct attributable interest on an accounting basis in the respective companies held by the immediate holding company.</p>
          <p>And in addition to these holdings, Jardine Strategic also holds a 54% interest in its parent, Jardine Matheson, which is at a similar level to last year. The column on the right shows the profit contributions these companies made in the first half of 2010 to Jardine Matheson's underlying profit.</p>
          <p>And I should also note at the outset that all of the dollar figures I'll mention will be in U.S. dollars. When we met in this forum in March, Anthony Nightingale talked about how the economic downturn had affected a number of the group's businesses in 2009 and that whilst its intensity varied, most of our operations performed much better than we had expected, especially in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to say that the positive trend has continued through the first half of 2010. The group's underlying profit was up 70% from the first half of 2009 at $664 million with underlying earnings per share also up 68% at $1.85. All major units made increased contributions, most notably Hongkong Land and Astra.</p>
          <p>The group's revenue, including 100% of associates and joint ventures, was $22.8 billion, an increase of 45%. The excellent results achieved so far this year have benefited from a number of factors. Our concentration in greater China and Southeast Asia where our businesses have been driven in particular by good growth in Indonesia and mainland China, the financial strength of our businesses, which are at the forefront of their industries and the professional expertise of our people.</p>
          <p>However, I would also note that the level of the group's profit growth for the period is flatter by comparison with the results from the first difficult six months of 2009 rather than the stronger second half. There was also a net gain in the investment property values during the period, which created the non-trading profit for the period of $388 million. Reflecting these excellent results for the first half of 2010 and then the expected satisfactory overall performance for the full year, the Board has declared an interim dividend of $0.30 per share, an increase of 20%.</p>
          <p>Now, before I look at the interim results in more detail, I would like to highlight some of the developments within the group during the period. Hongkong Land completed the construction of two presold residential developments in Singapore. One new residential site was acquired in the first half and good progress was made in the development of other projects, including completing the construction of the first of the three office towers in Marina Bay and commencing work on construction of a new office tower in Jakarta.</p>
          <p>Jardine Pacific made a couple of acquisitions during the period. In February, its restaurant division, Jardine Restaurant Group, acquired the KFC franchise in Taiwan with 120 outlets across the island and in May, Jardine Pacific increased its interest in HACTL by 17% to 42% making it now the largest shareholder.</p>
          <p>Jardine Motors benefited from the robust motor markets in southern China. Its dealership network is being grown steadily with the focus on building its network outside Guangdong Province in Sichuan, Chongqing, Hunan, Yunnan and Guangxi. Jardine Lloyd Thompson has been growing its business through a combination of organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>In Europe, it has recently announced a tie-in with three major European insurance brokers, which will extend its network across most of Central and Eastern Europe. It has also been progressively building its outsourcing operations in India.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm is expanding its network of stores across our region with the prime focuses for growth being in Malaysia and Indonesia and the Mainland of China. Maxim's is also growing its presence in China, including a restaurant at the World Expo in Shanghai.</p>
          <p>At Mandarin Oriental, the main focus has been on restoring the levels of occupancy and room rates that it experienced in the first half of 2008. The expansion of the network continues and two new management contracts in Abu Dhabi and Doha, the Group's first in the Middle East, were announced in the first half.</p>
          <p>In June, Astra agreed, subject to regulatory approval, to purchase the 47% it does not already own in Astra Sedaya Finance, which is its main four wheeler financing operation. And then in addition to these developments within individual group businesses, we've continued with our program of buying shares in various group companies, including Hongkong Land, Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage and Mandarin Oriental.</p>
          <p>Now to look at the financial results, starting with revenue, which increased by 45%. The analysis you see includes associates on a 100% basis. The largest contributors to the group's revenue were Dairy Farm and Astra, both of which saw their revenues grow roughly in line with earnings. Hongkong Land's revenues also increased materially due to the residential projects that were completed in Singapore during the period.</p>
          <p>Turning to underlying profit, the contributions from the main business units have increased strongly across the board. Jardine Pacific's businesses have benefited from better trading environments, together with the two acquisitions that I've highlighted. Riding on the robust motor vehicle market in southern China in the first half of the year, and some one-off property gains in the UK, Jardine Motors' profit exceeded its total contribution for 2009.</p>
          <p>In Hongkong Land's results, they were underpinned by positive rental reversions in its central portfolio, coupled with the recognition of the residential property profits on Marina Bay residences and Waterfall Gardens.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm's profit growth came from most banners, but was particularly healthy in South and East Asia. Astra's profit growth came largely from its motor vehicle and motorcycle businesses and the financial services companies that support these operations.</p>
          <p>The corporate and other interest line includes the central overhead of Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic and Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage. It also includes any financing costs in the three companies and income from the Group's other investments. The decrease in the net costs encapsulated in this line was due to a profit contribution from Rothschild during the first half against the loss it made in the comparative period.</p>
          <p>Non-trading items for the half year totaled a profit of $388 million. The major component of this arose from an upward revaluation of Hongkong Land's investment property portfolio, which, net of a notional deferred tax charge, resulted in a $376 million gain. There was also a $9 million gain arising from changes in the fair value of other investment properties held under Jardine Pacific.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to the individual operating businesses before coming back to the balance sheet and the outlook for the second half. Firstly, the businesses we group as Jardine Pacific. The contribution of HACTL, the largest of Jardine Pacific's interests, increased by 116% as the operation experienced 38% growth in cargo throughput. Jardine Pacific also increased its shareholding from 25 to 42% at the end of May. Jardine Schindler's higher profits were attributable to steady new installation business, which makes a positive contribution to earnings these days and its growing maintenance portfolio around the region.</p>
          <p>Jardine Restaurants Pizza Hut operation in Hong Kong began to improve after a difficult period of trading; whilst the business in Taiwan continued to build its profitability. In addition, the newly acquired KFC franchise in Taiwan, which was purchased in February, performed more strongly than we had anticipated. It had been expected to make a small loss in the initial months of ownership.</p>
          <p>Gammon's earnings were down slightly during the six months despite the company's record order book, which now stands at $3.1 billion. This reflected the need for provisioning against certain projects and the time lag between winning business and being able to recognize profit on work done.</p>
          <p>The outlook for the profitability of this business is good though. The order book at JEC also strengthened during the period as its various businesses took advantage of improved market conditions. Increased contributions from the Trane Thailand joint ventures and its distribution business in the Philippines played an important part in the 39% increase in its underlying profit.</p>
          <p>For JOS, the trading environment remained subdued, but sales were 8% up on last year and the underlying profit grew by even more. Jardine Shipping Services had a better six months with freight rates and volume showing good recovery. The outlook for activity in the region is good and the shortage of containers is continuing to support freight rates. While there has been a growth in passenger flights at Hong Kong International Airport, the operating environment for Jardine Aviation &amp; Services continues to be tough and an increase in cross-strait flights is likely to put the business under continuing pressure.</p>
          <p>Overall, Jardine Pacific's underlying profits increased by 52% to 65 million, much the strongest performance produced by Jardine Pacific for a number of years. Moving now to Jardine Motors, the group experienced improved trading conditions for all of its businesses with the underlying profit up 220% to 57 million. In Hong Kong and Macau, Zung Fu benefited from improving consumer sentiment by increasing unit sales of Mercedes-Benz passenger cars at higher margins.</p>
          <p>Market conditions were even more robust in southern China. Sales in the group's Mercedes-Benz dealerships there grew by 74% to some 6,200 cars, which enabled them to produce a profit of $29 million. Our total number of Mercedes-Benz dealerships in Southern China now stands at 18 and the team is working hard to expand the network further. There was some improvement in the performance of the group's motor interests in the United Kingdom during the period with an increase in new car sales. The results also benefited from the sale of two properties, which contributed $6 million to the underlying result.</p>
          <p>You may recall that we've always treated gains in the motor dealer business in the U.K. as underlying on the basis that they form part of the fundamental rationale for being in this business.</p>
          <p>Despite competitive insurance markets and low interest rates, Jardine Lloyd Thompson announced an increase in its profit after tax of 25% to &#xA3;51 million, reflecting good organic growth and the benefit from recent bolt-on acquisitions. The underlying profit contribution to Jardine Matheson, however, increased by 53% to $30 million. The main reason for this rather higher rate of growth is the inclusion of a tax credit of &#xA3;11 million in underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>This represented the write-back of a number of tax provisions that are no longer required. These had been provided in previous years through underlying earnings and for this reason, we've written them back through underlying earnings in accordance with our accounting policy.</p>
          <p>Jardine Lloyd Thompson have chosen to treat these as exceptional because of that quantum. The exchange rate applicable to the translation of JLT's profit was little changed from the first half of 2009. And notwithstanding the economic uncertainty in some of its markets, Jardine Lloyd Thompson continues to make progress in growing strength and depth of its businesses.</p>
          <p>That completes my review of the businesses held directly under Jardine Matheson. I will now turn to Jardine Strategic, which achieved underlying profits of $698 million, an increase of 66%, slightly below the rate reported by Jardine Matheson. The interim dividend of $0.06 per share will remain at the same level as last year.</p>
          <p>The net asset value per share we show for Jardine Strategic is calculated by reference to the market value of the underlying investments held by Jardine Strategic. At June 30, this was $35.98, up 10% from the 31st of December 2009, reflecting the stronger equity markets of recent months.</p>
          <p>Hongkong Land reported a strong set of results with underlying profit up 70% to $477 million. The principal driver of this growth was residential profits. In the first half of 2010, the results included underlying earnings of $245 million after-tax from completed residential developments, up from $47 million in the same period of 2009.</p>
          <p>The two big projects on which profits were recognized during the period were Marina Bay residences and Waterfall Gardens. The results also included $39 million from the reversal of a provision made in 2008 in respect of MCL Land's the Estuary project in Singapore, which was launched and all 608 units have been presold earlier this year.</p>
          <p>On commercial property, average rental levels stabilized and in Hong Kong, reversions remain flat or mildly positive. Occupancy remains excellent through most of the portfolio. In Hong Kong central, commercial occupancy stood at 96% and retail occupancy at 100%. In Singapore, the completed buildings and tower two of Marina Bay Financial Centre were all fully let. And tower three is over 55% committed despite targeted completion not being until 2012.</p>
          <p>In the second half, we would hope to see the commercial and retail property markets remain firm. Residential profits are likely to be recognized in projects in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Mainland China. But the contribution is expected to be substantially less than in the first half or indeed than in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Third-party evaluations of Hongkong Land's investments property showed a 5% like-for-like uplift in the value of the underlying properties both in Hong Kong and Singapore, which was the main driver behind the 9% increase in the company's net asset value. Net debt at the end of the period was $2.1 billion, down from the year end due to proceeds from the sale of residential properties received during the period.</p>
          <p>Included within this was 1.5 billion of cash and the company also had 1.7 billion of undrawn facilities, providing it with an extremely strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In U.S. dollar terms Dairy Farm sales including associates increased by 13%, while underlying net profit was 17% higher at $182 million. At constant rates of exchange, however, the increases were 8% and 12% respectively. In Hong Kong, Mannings Health and Beauty stores and IKEA produced strong profit growth. Wellcome supermarket showed a reasonable result, while 7-11 was affected by more challenging conditions in its market segment.</p>
          <p>In Southern China, 7-11 continued to be adversely affected by the restrictions on the sale of tobacco products, but Mannings produced further like-for-like sales growth and the network had reached 139 stores by the end of June.</p>
          <p>Good increases in sales and profits were also achieved in its markets in Southeast Asia, which contributed the major part of Dairy Farms earnings growth for the first half. The results also benefited from favorable currency movements. All formats in Malaysia and Indonesia performed well. Similarly in Singapore, most banners experienced good profit growth despite the effects on our supermarket operations and the shift back to more eating out in restaurants as the economy improved.</p>
          <p>Maxim's saw a 55% increase in profit, reflecting a much improved consumer sentiment in Hong Kong and the consequent back &#x2013; move back to dining out here as well.</p>
          <p>Turning to Mandarin Oriental, increased demand experienced in the first half of 2010 has led to higher hotel occupancy particularly in Hong Kong. Occupancy levels have however not yet reached those achieved in 2008. This has limited the group's capacity to raise its average run rates. Mandarin reported underlying profit of $13 million, up from $1 million in the very difficult first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Last year, the Group responded to the downturn by introducing strict cost control measures while still maintaining the quality of its legendary service. The measures taken have helped enhance earnings while the Group's hotels have also maintained or improved their relative market positions.</p>
          <p>Today, Mandarin operates 26 hotels having opened the new Mandarin Oriental Macau in One Central a month ago. It has a further 16 under development and while the economic downturn has affected some of its development partners leading to delays, the group is continuing to review opportunities in key city center and resort destinations around the world.</p>
          <p>Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage reported underlying earnings up 71% at $353 million, reflecting the higher contribution from Astra and the strengthening motor market across Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's other motor interests, with the exception of Singapore, where its operations faced difficult trading conditions as the government reduced the size of the market by some 35%, by reducing the number of certificates of entitlement that it has made available.</p>
          <p>You may recall we report Astra under a separate line and include in Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's corporate costs under the group's corporate line. Hence, it is only the non-Astra motor segment that gets included under our JC&amp;C disclosure line.</p>
          <p>This showed earnings up by 33% to $28 million despite the contraction in the Singapore motor market. There was an increase in sales of the new Mercedes-Benz E-class from Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang in Malaysia and a fine performance from Tunas Ridean in Indonesia with the favorable trading environment.</p>
          <p>Truong Hai Auto Corporation in Vietnam also made a significantly higher profit contribution as sales rose. Astra's reported net profit was up 52% in rupiah terms, translating to a 74% increase in its profit contribution to JC&amp;C in U.S. dollar terms of $349 million.</p>
          <p>Astra's automotive business produced much higher earnings as the Indonesian wholesale four-wheeler market grew by an impressive 76% and the motorcycle market by 41% during the first half. Against the backdrop of this growth, Astra saw its share of the four wheeler market fall by two percentage points to a still impressive 56%; whilst its share of the motorcycle market was maintained at 46%. Astra Otoparts also benefited from the stronger motor markets with a much higher net profit.</p>
          <p>Astra's consumer finance businesses fared well as their profit contribution rose following the growth in their loan books and improved net interest margins. Astra's 45% owned associate, Bank Permata, produced an improved performance.</p>
          <p>Although there was a slight rise in palm oil prices during the period, Astra Agro Lestari saw a 17% decline in profit following a 3% reduction in sales and higher operating costs. Profits at United tractors were at a similar level to the previous year.</p>
          <p>Komatsu heavy equipment sales showed a sharp increase with strong demand from the mining and plantation sectors, but profit growth was limited by a shift in the sales mix towards lower margin units. Mining contracting subsidiary, Pama, extracted 37.5 million tons of coal, a 24% increase, but unfortunately, its profit contribution fell due to higher production costs and the impact of the stronger rupiah.</p>
          <p>Lastly then, there are the other investments held by Jardine Strategic. Of these, only our 20% stake in Rothschild's Continuation is equity accounted. This continued to be affected by subdued M&amp;A activity, but benefited from a reasonable volume of reconstruction advice. It's been developing its operations in Asia, helped by some good wins in mainland China and its wealth management activities have also made steady progress. Of the other investments, income is only recognized when dividends are received. Asia Commercial Bank and Acleda paid dividends during the period. Tarsa's dividend has been declared, but is paid in the second half.</p>
          <p>Now to the balance sheet and cash position of the group. The group's total equity has increased by 9% to just under $25 billion. Shareholders' funds also increased by 9% to $10.6 billion. In the past, I have noted on a number of occasions that, in our view, international standards understate the real shareholders' funds of the group regarding the requirements to provide deferred tax on the revaluation of investment properties in Hong Kong where no such tax is payable. We are now genuinely hopeful that an exposure draft facilitating the revision of this requirement will be issued later this year and possibly adopted in time for the group to be able to restate its deferred tax accounting in its 2010 financial statements.</p>
          <p>For the time being though, the adjustment on deferred tax is still required. If it had been included in the accounts, the shareholders' funds of Jardine Matheson would have been $11.7 billion, 9% higher than the reported figure, giving an adjusted book net asset value per share of 32.4.</p>
          <p>At the 30th of June, the group's net debt, excluding financial services companies, was $1.7 billion. This is down from the reported net debt of $2.2 billion at the end of December. The main drivers for this reduction were operating cash inflows of $1.2 billion offset by ongoing capital expenditure programs and dividends. The principal contributors to operating cash inflows were $605 million in Hongkong Land, $383 million in Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage of which the majority was from Astra together with a $255 million inflow from Dairy Farm.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure for the period was approximately $550 million, including equipment CapEx in United Tractors of 156 million, store CapEx in Dairy Farm of 96 million and the purchases of states in Acleda Bank and additional shares in Tunas Ridean and the Bank of Butterfield.</p>
          <p>At the Jardine Matheson holding company level, we had net cash of $128 million at 30th of June, down from 246 million at the end of December, with the dividends paid exceeding those received in the first half. Jardine Strategic generated a strong net dividend inflow for the period, creating a net cash position at the end of June of $266 million, up from 110 million as at the end of December. Both companies it should be remembered continue to take their dividends from each other in script.</p>
          <p>Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's corporate net debt was $169 million compared to a net cash position of $1 million as at 31st of December. This is mainly a timing issue. Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage paid its final dividend in June, whilst it will receive the Astra 2009 final and 2010 interim dividend in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>As we move into the second half of the year, achieving growth over the same period of last year will be more challenging. This is because the second half of 2009 was much stronger for many of our businesses, not least for Hongkong Land as its residential profits last year came predominantly in the second half while this year, as I have explained, they are concentrated more in the first half.</p>
          <p>There is also some uncertainty over the immediate economic outlook. While the conditions in most East Asian economies are still strong, there may well be some effect from weakening demand in Europe and from the less buoyant stock markets and residential property markets in certain countries. Having said this, the group remains well financed with a sound balance sheet and is in a strong position to continue to make good headway even in challenging markets.</p>
          <p>That concludes the formal part of this presentation.</p>
