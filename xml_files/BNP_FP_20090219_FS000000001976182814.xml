          <p>Okay. Good afternoon, we are about to start the presentation of the 2008 Annual Results. If you could please turn off your cellphone, we'll start by presentation and then question and answers from the room. And once we are done with the questions from the room, we'll take the questions from the conference call.</p>
          <p>And I'm now asking Mr. Baudouin Prot, CEO to start the presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good afternoon everybody. Certainly the 2008 year was a tough one. I will make a sort of group summary before giving the floor to Georges who will comment on CIB and AMS and then Jean Bonnaf&#xE9; will comment on retail and I will get to the conclusion.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; well the 2008 Group figure is certainly the result as you would expect, no different from the estimated results published two weeks ago. So, the Group &#x2013; the net income group share is at 3 billion, exactly &#x20AC;3,021 million. Compared to last year, it's down 61.4%. The revenues for the year at &#x20AC;27.4 billion are down, well close to 12% cost, down 2% and therefore gross operating income at close to &#x20AC;9 billion is down 27%. The cost of risk it had a stiff increase, going from &#x20AC;1.7 billion to &#x20AC;5.7 billion this year. So, an increase of &#x20AC;4 billion, which is certainly a very high increase, we will see what the breakdown is of different parts of the Group. The &#x2013; so the return on equity after tax is 6.6%. Well the Board decided to propose to the shareholder meeting a dividend of &#x20AC;1 that could be paid either in cash or in shares.</p>
          <p>I think that in this &#x2013; despite the unprecedented deepening of the financial crisis, especially after the Lehman demise in September that is, well, it is a significant level of profitability which will put BNP Paribas in the top ten most profitable banks in this very challenging year.</p>
          <p>As you will expect, our Retail Banking revenues continued to increase close to 7%, exactly 6.9% from 16.4 to &#x20AC;17.5 billion. Asset Management and Services revenues stood up very well. They decreased only 6.3% to &#x20AC;4.9 billion. This is a very strong performance against most of our peers, who have had very often strong double-digit decrease in their revenues.</p>
          <p>Certainly the Corporate and Investment Banking got, well, was the most affected, it was most impacted and their revenues were off 39% from &#x20AC;8.2 billion to close to &#x20AC;5 billion this year. So, certainly Retail Banking and AMS held up very well, CIB was clearly affected throughout the year.</p>
          <p>As I assume you would expect from BNP Paribas I think the cost control was there. Overall for the full year, costs were down 2%, 1.9% and, as you see in the last quarter, which was certainly the most challenging, costs were down 8.4%. So I think we had cost adjustment measures in all divisions and certainly sharp reduction in bonuses.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk, as I said, we've had a sharp rise in the cost of risk, which was mostly related to market counter parties. The big &#x2013; several big one-off items, of which Lehman, for close to &#x20AC;600 million, Icelandic banks &#x20AC;400 million, Madoff &#x20AC;345 million and monoline insurance for another &#x20AC;500 million made altogether &#x20AC;2.2 billion. And if you see that the overall increase was &#x20AC;4 billion in the cost of risk, these major market counter parties were a very big factor in the increase of the cost of risk.</p>
          <p>On top of that we had certainly the economic downturn in the U.S., BancWest. We'll do that in more detail in a minute. Spain, there is only Personal Finance, and then also Ukraine in the last quarter of the last year. Quality and granularity of our corporate loans for the whole Group remained good, with no material deterioration in 2008 and our 10 biggest exposures are less than 4% of our commitment.</p>
          <p>I think very important to notice is the fact that our two big domestic &#x2013; our two biggest domestic markets, namely France and Italy, stand at the, really the two markets in Europe where the household indebtedness ratio is really lower than anywhere else. It's &#x2013; Italy is at 69% of disposable income household debt, France is 99%, even Germany is 105, and Japan 130, United States 142, and, I'm afraid, United Kingdom 186. So, certainly if there is one market in which you want to retail in 2008 and 2009, it's France. It will improve, it has proven in 2008 and it will prove again 2009 to be the best market for retail by far in Europe.</p>
          <p>Revenue-wise, risk-wise, profit-wise we'll see the figures in a minute of our French Retail Banking and not only that, but certainly the French market, we have been also very well performing. So, Italy is a bit &#x2013; in my view is a bit more &#x2013; well, a bit less resilient than the French market, but still much more resilient than many other European countries.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk in our major &#x2013; in our core divisions, French Retail, the cost of risk was 20 basis points last year, a slight increase to 17 basis point of 2007. And I think that the <mark type="inaudible" /> of our loan portfolio in France, both Retail and Corporate, is certainly better than peers and once again much better than in other retail markets in Europe.</p>
          <p>BNL bc, you see the cost of risk at Italian banks is higher than in France certainly. The 73 basis point of cost of risk for &#x2013; in relation to risk-weighted asset in 2008 is a bit higher than the 65 basis point of 2007, but not a big increase. Certainly, Emerging Markets, we had in the last quarter of last year, Jean will get back to that later. We were hit in Ukraine with a sudden and violent crisis, economic crisis in the country and that is the main reason why the cost of risk in our Emerging Markets Retail Banking activity has gone to 157 basis points for the year 2008.</p>
          <p>BancWest. BancWest, the cost of risk on the loan portfolio is 119 basis points. On top of that we have had to make further provisions on the investment portfolio of 48 basis points. Altogether, as we will see, BancWest has remained fairly profitable and certainly doing much better than its peer in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Personal Finance, the cost of risk in Personal Finance is a matter of attention, certainly at 222 basis points against &#x2013; for 2008 against 156 for 2007. It has significantly increased primarily due to Spain, as already mentioned, and we already spoke about the Spanish situation already a year ago. And so we have been active there, but still it's not getting better. And then Italy and also Emerging Markets, even if 92% of the Personal Finance outstandings are in Western Europe, so Emerging Markets not a big part of our activity in Personal Finance.</p>
          <p>And CIB, as you see on the slide CIB &#x2013; CIB what I think is clear is that the cost of risk on the loan portfolio at 17 basis point for 2008 was still quite limited, the bulk of the cost of risk that is 99 basis point are due &#x2013; Are related to capital markets, which I already commented, these are the big counter-parties risks we've encountered throughout the year in the capital markets securities of BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax income. I think it's a pretty contrasted picture. Retail Banking resisted very well. The pre-tax profit went from &#x20AC;4.4 billion to &#x20AC;4 billion. So, we had a decrease of 10%, which, well, it was quite resilient and a pre-tax ROE of 24.6%. Asset Management and Services was also quite resilient, especially compared to other players, it remained fairly profitable. Pre-tax profits went from 1.9 billion in 2007 to 1.3 billion, but the pre-tax ROE stayed high at 28.2%. And certainly the CIB had a quite, well, quite a reverse situation going from a profit of &#x20AC;3.5 billion in 2007 to a loss for the full year of &#x20AC;1.2 billion in 2008. So, Retail Banking and AMS remained fairly profitable despite the downturn environment, and CIB was much more impacted.</p>
          <p>The four quarter figures. Well, again they are very much in line with the estimated results. The loss &#x2013; the net income group share is a loss of &#x20AC;1,366 million, the revenues are down 30% to &#x20AC;4.8 billion, operating expenses down 8% at &#x20AC;4.3 billion, cost of risk at &#x20AC;2.5 billion is 3.4 times higher than the fourth quarter of 2007. And so we certainly see here the results very significantly impacted by the complete market dislocation and the accelerated downturn in the economy that characterized the post Lehman fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The collapse of Lehman on the 15 September was, well an event of &#x2013; with enormous indications for the markets. And still after that in the third quarter &#x2013; in the fourth quarter, a rapid acceleration in the decline of equity markets after 30% decrease in the first nine months and there was another 20%, 19% decrease for the Eurostoxx 50 between, in the fourth quarter, which drove the drop for the full year to be the highest drop in stock markets since the '30s.</p>
          <p>So, this very rapid drop in the stock market impacted the Group's revenues with impairment charges, apart from the capital markets, on which George will come in a minute. On two issues: one is equity holdings. We had &#x20AC;440 million of impairments, primarily in the Corporate Center. And secondly, in our insurance activities, we had &#x20AC;142 million impairment charge in the general fund. So, altogether this is a &#x20AC;600 million, close to &#x20AC;600 million impairment charge for the Group in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Again, after the Lehman collapse, the market went into unprecedented dislocation. The liquidity literally vanished. There was sudden and massive plummeting of all markets. We got repeated shocks on a scale never seen before. We got an extremely sharp rise in volatility and correlations both among equities and among indices. We got dislocations of hedge relations observed, I would say, historically up until then for years. And that impacted very negatively our revenues and capital markets to a negative revenue of &#x20AC;1.1 billion against a positive revenue for the capital markets of &#x20AC;1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2008. So, an unprecedented accumulation of event of great violence on all markets.</p>
          <p>You see here on the graph those, the volatility on the Eurostoxx and also the euro bond basis, spread between the CDS and the bond, which has gone, in both instances these parameters have gone to unknown territories in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>After the collapse of Lehman in the fourth quarter, we had a sharp rise in the cost of risk. The cost of risk was &#x20AC;750 million in the fourth quarter of last year, of 2007 sorry, and it went to &#x20AC;2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. So, an increase of &#x20AC;1.8 billion. What's the breakdown of that increase? Well, two thirds of that increase, that means &#x20AC;1.2 billion came from the CIB division, and &#x20AC;500 million came from the International Retail, and only a bit less than &#x20AC;100 million came from our two core domestic markets of France and Italy. So, as I said, France and Italy didn't really impact very much the cost of risk from the first to the last quarter of last year. On the contrary, CIB was the main contributor with International Retail.</p>
          <p>Now, coming back to CIB, out of the &#x20AC;1.2 billion of increase, then again the financing businesses, that means the provisioning of the corporate loan portfolio, only contributed to &#x20AC;168 million. So, from the 1.2 billion, less than 200 million that comes from the financing businesses, all of the rest relates to capital markets. The downturn in the situation of monocline insurance contributed, well, close to &#x20AC;400 million, exactly &#x20AC;383 million increase, the Madoff with &#x20AC;345 million of major fraud and other market counter parties were contributing to an increase of &#x20AC;300 million. So, we see here that capital markets counter parties were really were the main reason for that strong increase in the cost of risk in the last quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Just to say that looking at the CIB platform of BNP Paribas, and the results since the beginning of the crisis, that means since the second quarter of 2007, that is the six consecutive quarters, two of 2007 and the four quarters of last year of 2008, you see that the cumulative pre-tax income excluding owned debt gains, we see that Goldman Sachs comes, well, top of the class, if I may say, with a positive &#x20AC;4.2 billion. Then comes BNP Paribas with, well, minus 0.1, which means sort of break-even over the period. And then you have JPMorgan, minus 4 billion, and SocGen minus 6.7, and you end up with Merrill Lynch, minus &#x20AC;47.3 billion. So, CIB, the CIB BNP Paribas held up very well despite the strongly impacted and negatively impacted results of the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>And now, I hand it over to Georges.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Baudouin. Good afternoon. As Baudouin mentioned, we had experienced in Q4 a succession of some of the storms which repeatedly hit all capital market activity. You see in revenues that we have, let's say, very contrasted results. First of all, equity derivatives suffered a lot, with negative revenues of 1 billion &#x2013; sorry, &#x20AC;2 billion. But on contrast, fixed income performed well, with &#x2013; mainly due to the fact that we benefited a lot of hedging coming from clients. We benefited also of a lot of flight to quality due to the fact that the name of BNP Paribas is very good, a strong company. And naturally, financing business posted record revenues for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So in this context, naturally, we reduced immediately our expenses especially naturally during the first quarter for bonuses. And in terms of cost of risk, I will not comment a lot globally because as Baudouin mentioned, we had to face a lot of counter market &#x2013; counterparty risks, specially monolines and naturally fraud which is Madoff.</p>
          <p>So at the end, despite a very positive contribution of financing business, nearly 500 million, we posted a big &#x2013; huge loss of &#x20AC;2 billion at the level of CIB.</p>
          <p>We will move to different businesses just to look at what has happened. So I begin with equity derivative. So first some comments. First of all, there were no unauthorized positions. We have naturally, as we always mention due to our derivative activities, risk, but &#x2013; essentially coming from client business at a level which was supposed to be acceptable, let's say in normal market conditions.</p>
          <p>But and also we have the value at risk for the year which was stable during the first nine months of the year, which means that we have begun to reduce our position because as you know, the volatility climbed and also market parameters during the first &#x2013; the previous quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>So in fact, we faced, <mark type="inaudible" />, we faced &#x2013; three very difficult factors at the level of equity derivatives. First of all, volatility. Baudouin mentioned it. But I have to repeat that the volatility was absolutely unprecedented. And on top of that, the volatility of the volatility was also unprecedented.</p>
          <p>Second, we had a huge change in the anticipation of dividend. You see that on the chart, the dividend swaps on the Eurostoxx for 2009, 2011 and 2012, to 2017, you see a huge change after Lehman. And it has continued all the quarter for December '11 and December '13.</p>
          <p>Then on top of that, we have to face huge correlations among equities, between the equities and between all the index, and which normally we profit of some discussions. So it was not possible to benefit of discussions during the first quarter. So, we have, as we have never seen, very sudden and very huge variations in all the parameters we work with in terms of the derivatives.</p>
          <p>So, naturally, we quickly decided to change our positions. And so first of all, we experienced what we call the stress test. Formerly, when we spoke of stress test, it was normally not completely expected.</p>
          <p>In fact we had to face continuous pressure during all of the quarter, mainly in October and in November. So with a lot of illiquidity, as Baudouin mentioned, it was very difficult to hedge what we call our Greeks, delta, gamma, and omega. So it was very difficult. And we've experienced lots of stress situations in this fiscal. So we have repeated daily losses.</p>
          <p>So what have we done? First of all, we have quickly reacted to reduce exposures. As you know, when we reduce exposure, when we reinforce hedge, it's naturally costly. So we have preferred to pay and to reduce position. And also just to see position by position what was illiquid or what would become illiquid, and so we have decided also to begin to reduce those positions despite also the high costs of that.</p>
          <p>Then naturally, we have decided to redefine our policy for 2009 and for 2010 and after. First of all, we have worked to maintain and then to reduce at the end of the year the value at risk despite very high volatility and also correlation factors and the domestic volumes were very high.</p>
          <p>So that means that we are aggressively reducing the position. And naturally, we have also seen all the illiquid risk just to reduce risk by risk. So we have taken strong measures to reduce market risk in term of equity derivative.</p>
          <p>In fixed income, the story is a little bit different &#x2013; absolutely different. First of all, we have benefited of a large client contribution &#x2013; large client revenues, especially interested in Forex and commodity derivative and the then sort of in debt capital market.</p>
          <p>It is a constant flow business due, as I mentioned, to the fact that BNP Paribas is a good concept in terms of risk and that's due to the fact that we benefited from flight to quality in that respect. So, on one side, very, very good client business. But on the other side, as Baudouin mentioned, still some negative impact on our booked valuations.</p>
          <p>First of all, naturally &#x2013; so, basis risks, we are very familiar to the basis risks. We mentioned that earlier, but you see with the Lehman collapse and I repeat what Baudouin mentioned, it's clearly a huge change. So we suffered because of the basis risk.</p>
          <p>And, second, we have an increase in term of credit adjustment in our derivative counterparty. So we suffered on that. On top of that, as Baudouin mentioned, we have experienced very high cost of risk in term of counterparty risk, naturally monocline, but also a lot of let's say order losses concerning a lot of counterparty risk in fixed income activity.</p>
          <p>So at the end, we have delivered I think good level of revenues based on challenging markets and despite the fact that naturally we will also suffer a little of provisions in fixed income.</p>
          <p>In financing business, I will not elaborate a lot. Let's say naturally we experienced a weaker quarter. Naturally we continue to adjust our margins because we have to take into account the new capital context. And naturally, it's a new liquidity environment, which is much more costly for banks.</p>
          <p>Naturally, we &#x2013; as you know, we have always said we have, let's say, corporate and investment banking and I think it's very good to be in the financing business now, first of all, because naturally the finance of real economy, but also because as we were leader in energy and commodity and acquisitions finance naturally we benefited of a large inflow with very interesting conditions now.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk is still low because naturally in Q4 '07 the cost was very low, but with &#x20AC;230 million at the end, it's really reasonable. So the pre-tax income is very, very good with nearly &#x20AC;500 million, which shows that we are in financing business, a very stable revenue base.</p>
          <p>So what's the action plan for 2009? First of all, we'll continue to have proactive actions let's say to first to continue to reduce market risk. Naturally, we will continue to reduce average value at risk because average value at risk was very high in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>But, naturally, we will look at all the illiquid structural risk just to look carefully at what could be all &#x2013; the possible stress test because naturally a stress test could be possible in 2009. And naturally we will continue to work reducing basis risk. This is our first goal.</p>
          <p>The second goal is naturally to constantly continue and it is a huge change at the level of CIB to reduce risk-weighted assets. I remember you that in 2007 and 2008 the risk-weighted assets of CIB were growing a lot. In market risk naturally as we will reduce sharply the market risk naturally we will reduce by the same naturally the risk-weighted assets for market risk.</p>
          <p>In credit risk, we will see that we are in the situation to stabilize the capital allocated to credit risk, which is proactive, because we have to face naturally the procyclical effects of Basel II. So we will manage that. That means that it will be very <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Naturally, we will continue to look at credit risk and counterparty risk because we know that in 2009 that 2009 will be probably a challenging year. So clearly, it will be a change in the CIB activity because CIB, and Baudouin will come back on that, will take the majority back, as a reduction of the risk-weighted assets of the group level.</p>
          <p>Second, naturally concerning the business, we will adapt our product first of all to the clients' needs and second, just to be able to manage with lower risk appetite our books. So naturally, we will continue to develop a flow business in equity derivative and fixed income. We have a strong demand, flight to quality. So we really beat that.</p>
          <p>Second, naturally, a lot of clients continue to have needs concerning tailor made hedging solutions. So, naturally, we will continue to do so. But on the opposite we'll continue to reduce substantially the business in the most complex structured products, clearly.</p>
          <p>Naturally, we will have to control cost. So we will streamline the organization, taking into account that naturally first, we have to maintain our franchise in Europe. So we will focus on our leadership in Europe and we will adapt the other platforms. I mean, naturally U.S. and all the emerging countries. And our target is to reduce our cost base excluding variable compensation by 5% on a full year effect basis. So we will naturally be very active concerning our organization.</p>
          <p>So, in the beginning of 2009, what is CIB? CIB has a strong ambition naturally on a long-term. We will continue to be client-driven business model because we have a lot of clients that work with us and we will naturally continue.</p>
          <p>We have always have a balanced business mix model. We are a financing bank and an investment bank. So we'll continue at a time to our, let's say, to be in the financing business is very good for cross-selling because we can ask lots of our clients when we finance them. Naturally, we will continue to use our strategy in derivative and globally we'll continue to develop our franchise.</p>
          <p>So we're seeing that in a very, very difficult environment. We will be more and more competitive in this new landscape and naturally a key actor.</p>
          <p>And so I will just be focusing into asset management and services to tell you that naturally, a swallow does not make a spring, but I can confirm you that in January 2009 we have naturally continued to post very strong client business activity and very good results. And so, you can see, October we mentioned that it was negative revenues, November, negative revenues, slightly, and December, positive revenues. Today, we speak of very good results.</p>
          <p>So, now, I come to asset management and services and I will be short on that because Baudouin first of all mentioned that we have a very strong relative performance in asset management and services.</p>
          <p>Our revenue are still over &#x20AC;1 billion, which is minus 20% if we look at the figures. But if we exclude the fair value adjustment for the insurance equity portfolio that Baudouin mentioned in original presentation it is only minus 9% and globally we have still assets under management which are higher than &#x20AC;500 billion. And so, naturally, we continue I think to over-perform in this part of the business of BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>Naturally, we have adjusted our operating expenses. We are minus 5% compared to first quarter and I'd like to mention that our pre-tax return on equity on the business is nearly 30%, exactly 28%.</p>
          <p>So we have maintained our profitability despite the fact that the crisis was huge also in those business.</p>
          <p>So I've come to what I explain at each presentation. I think what is important is the net asset inflow. We have delivered very strong net asset inflow of 10 billion for 2008. Naturally, so net asset inflow was slightly negative in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>You know probably that there is a small seasonal effect because a lot of clients, especially corporate or institutional, they want their money back in December and they come back to us in January.</p>
          <p>So globally, we have performed very well. And so, naturally, we have to face as everybody a very bad performance effect. So despite the 10 billion, we suffer a performance effect of minus &#x20AC;90 billion, which is huge. But, globally, our franchise is very strong vis-&#xE0;-vis our clients.</p>
          <p>So our action plan is as simple at the level of asset management and services. We don't change globally our strategy, which is very client-oriented, very strong in Europe, very retailers-oriented. And naturally we want to continue to be absolutely more and more integrated inside this business.</p>
          <p>But naturally, we will adjust our organization streamlining naturally our organization and we think we will continue to develop and to over-perform pursuing an integrated strategy.</p>
          <p>So now, I leave the floor to Jean-Laurent just to speak of the retail</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. So to start with the French Retail. So revenues held up well in the fourth quarter with 1.3 growth over the fourth quarter of 2007 despite the drop in financial fees. Net interest income was up 6.9%. Thanks to good intermediation business. Financial fees were down by 24% in a very unfavorable environment for financial savings, and in the end banking fees were up by 6%.</p>
          <p>Operating costs remained flat and we still enjoy a quite moderate cost of risk at 38 British pounds. All in all, pre-tax income was of &#x20AC;314 million and for the full year 2008 it was of &#x20AC;1,641 million, which represents close to 5% growth over the full year 2007.</p>
          <p>For Business Trends, well the French network enjoyed a continued growth both in lending plus 11% and deposits plus 10%. Customer acquisition remained strong with 50,000 net new customers in the last quarter and close to 200,000 for the full year of 2008, with market share gains in financial savings and with one million Livret savings accounts opened.</p>
          <p>For Corporates, BNP Paribas gained market shares in deposits, mutual funds and cash management, and continued the previous cross-selling trends. Strong customer acquisition and sustained commercial business were the two key elements for the last quarter and for the entire year 2008.</p>
          <p>Of course, 2009 is going to be a challenging year. We have four priorities: liquidity, with ambition to continue to outperform in deposit and savings inflows; capital, getting better returns on risk-weighted assets and developing banking fees and insurance products; risk, maintaining our advantage in risk management; and stabilize the cost base.</p>
          <p>On top of this, obviously we are committed to grow by 4% on loans outstanding to support both corporate clients and households. In the end, we are yet again committed to improve our personal efficiency and stick to our target our medium long-term target to maintain one point positive jaws effect.</p>
          <p>As we go through the economic downturn, it will appear that the French Retail Banking market is one of the most resilient ones in Europe and that BNP Paribas is outperforming this market in a nice manner. France is a key area of expertise for BNP Paribas that is exporting most of their ability to Italy.</p>
          <p>So, for Italy, BNL enjoyed a continued expansion in a less favorable environment to 10,000 net new customers for the last quarter and close to 50,000 for the entire 2008 to be compared to minus 86,000 in 2006, the year we bought the Bank.</p>
          <p>Revenues were up by 5%, and costs were flat, allowing an improvement of more than 3 points of the cost income ratio.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk was up to &#x20AC;147 million, slightly above 100 basis points compared to 73 basis point for the last quarter of 2007. As a result, at &#x20AC;100 million, pre-tax income was down by 14% compared to the last quarter of 2007. For the full year 2008, with &#x20AC;628 million, pre-tax income was at 10% compared to 2007. In the end over the full year, BNL reached its main target, achieving a positive jaws effect above five points.</p>
          <p>Business Trends. Well, trends were strong both for private, individuals, and corporates. For individuals with deposits up by 5%, mortgage is by more than 7%, and savings evolved better than market average.</p>
          <p>For Corporates, deposits were up 7%, loans by 16%, and revenues from cash management and trade finance were 11%.</p>
          <p>For 2008, our Italian platform fully demonstrated a powerful sales and marketing drive, which gave us full confidence for the years to come.</p>
          <p>As already said, we plan to pursue for 2009, the sales and marketing drive. In particular, we will again open 50 branches and full priority is given to cash management solutions and cross-selling with all businesses of BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>In addition, we plan to stabilize the cost base at the level of 2008 launching new initiatives. As in 2008, we continue to bolster risk management with more stringent criteria for loan origination and new initiatives at the level of the commercial network. Based on all these, BNL will maintain a positive five points jaws effect in 2008 and '09.</p>
          <p>I believe we have demonstrated our distribution strategy in Italy, we have applied to BNL the recipes of our success in France and have repeatedly delivered our targeted synergies. Both French Retail Banking and BNL will be solely contributors to the Group's operating performance going forward with operating in lower risk markets.</p>
          <p>For BancWest, well for this last quarter of 2008, revenues were strong, up 12% with an interest margin up by 16 basis points due to the steepening the yield curve and rising terms. Loans were up 11% and deposit by 1.5%.</p>
          <p>Added to a good control of operating expenses, these good evolutions allowed gross operating income to grow by more than 20%.</p>
          <p>Worsening cost of risk erased most of these positive results also with further depreciation of the investment portfolio, and worsening of all lending segments as a natural result of the economic recession.</p>
          <p>With a pre-tax income of 17 million compared to 15 million for the last quarter of 2007, BancWest posted for the full year a pre-tax income of &#x20AC;333 million proving to be one of the very few retail U.S. banks to be largely profitable in 2008.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we will continue to optimize distribution channels, renovate ATMs, branches and websites to follow distribution channel trends; continue rolling out the product offering throughout the entire network; adapt the Group's private banking model within BancWest. We will maintain obviously a strong cost management discipline and we will also maintain loan portfolio quality, maintaining discipline loan origination criteria and stabilizing outstandings. In a nutshell, 2009 will be dedicated to adjust our platform to the new U.S. environment.</p>
          <p>As for Emerging Markets, we enjoyed good sales and marketing performances for the fourth quarter of 2008 with more than 250,000 net new customers and the opening of 65 new branches.</p>
          <p>Revenues were up by more than 50% at &#x20AC;558 million and gross operating income was up by more than &#x20AC;276 million. These results were unfortunately more than offset by a very sharp rise in the cost of risk with &#x20AC;272 million versus 32 last year. This rise is entirely concentrated in Ukraine and includes 170 provisioning on the portfolio basis, due to the economic downturn and the downgrade of the country risk.</p>
          <p>In other regions, risk remained very moderate. To this extent, well pre-tax income became negative by 40 million and for the whole year pre-tax income showed a growth of 11% at &#x20AC;435 million. All in all for BNP Paribas, emerging markets held up well despite the severity of the economic crisis in Ukraine.</p>
          <p>For 2009, first as we have already started to, we will continue to adapt rapidly to the new environment in Ukraine. We have stopped production of new loans, restructured retail and corporate portfolios, and reinforced collection. On top of this, we will heavily act on cost, optimizing the network with more than 100 closures and downsizing the workforce.</p>
          <p>For other emerging markets, we will pursue our development to a more selective customer acquisition policy together with a renewed and improved operating efficiency. Thus, as for BancWest, 2009 will be dedicated to adjust the pace of growth to the new risk and liquidity environment.</p>
          <p>Personal Finance. Well, revenues were strong, up by 11% for the last quarter of 2008, with outstandings growing at 13%. The jaws effect of five points, the gross operating income was up by 17% at &#x20AC;405 million. Cost of risks continued to grow reaching 266 basis point versus 236 for the third quarter of 2008, especially in Southern and Central Europe. Due to the disposal of the equity investment in Cofidis for &#x20AC;122 million, pre-tax income at 159 was only down by 3% compared to the last quarter of 2007. In 2008 and for 2009, Personal Finance is concentrating on improving margins and controlling costs in a deteriorating risk environment.</p>
          <p>Obviously for 2009, we will fight to maintain and improve margins on new loans, despite higher liquidity costs; continue to develop B to B to C internet banking services; expand the cost-cutting program; and continue actions to mitigate the impact of the risk crisis, shift new lending, adjust loan origination policy, and adapt and bolster loan collection; and of course, strengthen synergies between banking networks and Personal Finance entities. For 2009, Personal Finance is committed to a positive two points jaws effect.</p>
          <p>Just a final word about the new Retail Banking organization. As announced in last July, we have deployed a new organization that includes all of BNP Paribas' Retail Banking businesses. We have new resources with six new corporate missions, will manage transversal businesses or projects: Marketing and Distribution, Development, Brand, U.S., Private Banking and Human Resources, creation of the Retail Banking Information Systems, and Emerging Markets converted into an integrated operating entity.</p>
          <p>This new organization has four objectives; lead the Group's development initiatives, pool expertise, promote industrialization and share large-scale investments, and in the end expand cross-selling between all businesses of the Group including AMS and CIB, in a word, accelerate the development and the overall coherence of Retail Banking businesses.</p>
          <p>That's it. And now I'll hand it over to Bordenave for concluding remarks. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Laurent. Regarding 2009, I think that we have a very clear view of BNP Paribas Group Management of the very challenging environment we are in. In this very challenging environment, on one side we certainly will rely on the several structural strengths of the Group. But, on the other side, we are making and we are actively making the adjustments that are needed to adopt the Group positioning to this environment and make sure that BNP Paribas is really well-positioned to perform better than peers in this very challenging 2009 environment.</p>
          <p>As to the Group's structural strengths, well five of them, I think are worth mentioning. The first one certainly we have diversified business mix rooted in retail banking; that makes 60% of our revenues that also having a strong asset management services and a significant set of new platforms well integrated with retail banking. This is our business mix model. This is the one we are committed to the market and as soon as we created BNP Paribas seven or eight years ago and I think it has served us well through different part of the cycles and it will continue to serve us well in this challenging part of the cycle.</p>
          <p>The second characteristic which certainly we have reinforced by acquiring BNL two and a half years ago is the geographic mix of revenues very much centered in Western Europe, BNP Paribas makes 75% of its revenues in Europe of which close to 60% &#x2013; 59% exactly in France and Italy. I think during today's world you better make the extent of our revenues in those market than in other market. We have got a brand and the overall attractiveness of the Group increasing and we are seeing in the different key divisions that we are gaining new customers, we are gaining market share and certainly we've got better and reinforce positioning.</p>
          <p>The fourth is cost control and reactive cost management, which I think is ingrained in the BNP Paribas culture, corporate culture.</p>
          <p>And the last one is attention paid to the risk/return ratio across the cycle. That doesn't mean that we haven't been hit in this very challenging part of the cycle, but we've certainly as Group management continued to well, spend quite a bit of our time and pay a lot of attention personally to how we manage our risk and to the risk return and the risk reward ratio.</p>
          <p>Now, this is what we have and what we are going to keep, but we want to make significant adjustment to the new environment which are significant adjustment and significant changes &#x2013; let's not underestimate it &#x2013; to what we have done in the last few years of closures. These changes are well underway and they will be actively implemented by, well, everyone identified by in 2009.</p>
          <p>The first one is we are committed to reduce risk-weighted assets, in particular in CIB.</p>
          <p>The second is we have very much reinforced our capital base but we will continue to do so by combining the generation of earnings and the French economic stimulus plan.</p>
          <p>The third is we certainly take full account of the higher cost of liquidity in how we manage the Group.</p>
          <p>And the fourth is, we will actively address costs to more volatile revenues. So I think that combining the structural strength and this active adjustment, BNP Paribas will definitely be well-positioned in the 2009 environment.</p>
          <p>Regarding our risk-weighted assets under Basel 2, our risk-weighted assets increased 11.5% for the full-year of 2008. In the last quarter &#x2013; in the fourth quarter, the rise of the Basel II, including the floor, from 527 billion euro as of the end of September to &#x20AC;535 billion as of the end of last year was 1.6%. So a limited increase, and certainly a clear sign of the slowing down of the increase in risk-weighted asset before we get to a negative growth which will be a reduction in Q2 '09. The rise if &#x2013; of risk-weighted assets excluding floor from 504 billion euro to 528 billion euro, which is an increase of &#x20AC;25 billion equivalent to 4.6%, I think it's very interesting to see which were the main components of that increase of 25 billion euro. Well three factors of increase have been well have been are worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>The first one and the bigger one is the effect on market risk of much high volatility also as we said our position has been reducing also the culture but you can measure this &#x20AC;15 billion of risk-weighted asset are all the consequence of the very unprecedented volatility on market risk. And this is a big figure, but that's the biggest component of the 24 billion euro increase.</p>
          <p>The second is the effect of the transfer of trading assets to the banking book, it's only 2 billion euro, I think we &#x2013; it's worth mentioning that BNP Paribas made a very moderate use of the ability to transfer from trading books to banking books and well this is not a big figure.</p>
          <p>The third effect which is very significant is the effect of falling equity markets on the investment portfolio that is a 10 billion increase, because how we &#x2013; the French regulator under Basel II, we have to put equity to &#x2013; on our equity portfolio from which we deduct the capital gains we have on this equity portfolio. As the capital gains, evaporated totally throughout the year, the &#x2013; well the net impact on the risk-weighted asset equivalent for our equity portfolio should by &#x20AC;10 billion. So 10 billion euro for equity mark portfolio &#x2013; equity market, 15 billion euro of VaR very much increased volatility, that's &#x20AC;25 billion and to compensate for that we had already in the last quarter of last year a decline in the outstandings of the CIB financing businesses and at the aid of &#x20AC;9 billion.</p>
          <p>So going into 2009, our target is to have at the end of this year, we expect our risk-weighted asset at constant scope and exchange rate to be &#x20AC;20 billion below the beginning of the year figure, below the &#x20AC;535 billion, I just mentioned. We will get there by having sharp decline of risk-weighted assets for CIB. We are going to stabilize risk-weighted assets emerging countries with a reduction in Ukraine and to stabilize them at BancWest and we are going to continue to pursue growth in France in line with the commitment we have taken with the French authorities and the 4% increase of loan outstandings end of 2009, compared to end of 2008, and also we are going to continue to purse some growth in Italy. So 2009, we'll see BNP Paribas implement an active risk-weighted assets reduction program.</p>
          <p>Getting to our &#x2013; moving to our equity position, our Tier 1 capital as of the end of last year stood at 41.8 billion euro higher by 5.3 billion euro, compared to the end of 2007, where they stood at 36.5 billion euro. The contribution from the first and second tranche of the French economic stimulus plan will reach 5.1 billion euro. And I remind you that on the 11th of December, we issued &#x20AC;2.5 billion of non-innovative hybrids and well in the next few weeks, we are going to have the shareholders decide to vote to issue 5.1 billion in preferred shares, redeeming the first tranche of hybrids and so then &#x2013; by then in a few weeks our Tier 1 ratios are canceled- Tier 1 capital will stand at &#x20AC;44.3 billion. So, certainly, we have been reinforcing very much our equity related.</p>
          <p>As of the end of last year, in terms of solvency, the Tier 1 ratio of BNP Paribas stood at 7.8%. Again, 7.3% as at the end of 2007, the effect of the lowering of the floor well is 0.1%, as of the 1st of January of this year which puts then the Tier 1 ratio at 7.9% and the impact of the second tranche second stage of the French economic stimulus plan will be another 50 basis points which pro forma puts our Tier 1 ratio at 8.4%.</p>
          <p>In terms of our 2009 targets, regarding capital management, the reduce &#x2013; the reduction of risk-weighted assets for &#x20AC;20 billion is equivalent to 30 basis point increase of our Tier 1 ratio and on top of that we will have an increase in equity by generating earnings and I think you should take into account the payout ratio. We have taken for the dividend of this year, to see where &#x2013; how much within earnings we would have hopefully significantly quarter after quarter into our capital management.</p>
          <p>So, we will &#x2013; so we are certainly managing our capital in a way very much adapted to the environment. And I expect this to, I would say, clear the sky definitely on the fact that BNP Paribas is not to going to issue any ordinary share, and that's it.</p>
          <p>In the medium to long-term, we are committed to maintain a Tier 1 ratio of about 7.5%, even if we recognize that in the present market circumstances a significantly higher Tier 1 ratio I would say is, well, acceptable or desirable or whatever. And that's it for capital management.</p>
          <p>Turning to liquidity. Liquidity, we see that we still enjoy the lowest CDS among the industry and the peer group. We still have one of the best &#x2013; we still have one of the six best weighted banks by Standard &amp; Poor's. Well, also as a fact, BNP Paribas was the first, well, let's say, European headquartered bank to reopen the senior debt market in December, coming to markets with &#x20AC;1.5 billion five-year maturity, which I think got fairly strong reception, and we also came back to the market with the first covered bond issue well a few days ago in January of this year, for &#x20AC;1.5 billion, also with a five-year maturity.</p>
          <p>Our long term &#x2013; our medium to long term issue program for this year stands at &#x20AC;30 billion, of which &#x20AC;9 billion are already completed or under way, which I think that considering that we are somewhere around mid February is good for the year.</p>
          <p>We certainly are conscious that the increased cost of liquidity on the market make it necessary for us to adapt the terms and the product offering of the Group. And we make sure that it's done everywhere in the Group. We are financing this audit, and new loans are originated, and I think that we are also pleased to see that our loan to deposit ratio has significantly improved from 129% as of the end of 2007 to119% as of the end of this year.</p>
          <p>So, I will say regarding liquidity that even if we are in a very strong competitive position from a pricing and from a funding perspective, we take a very serious and proactive approach to certainly well make sure that our funding is not only competitively achieved in terms of pricing, but also very much secure in this environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of goodwill, well, maybe here I would say that we are very happy of all the acquisitions we haven't made in the last two, three years where a lot of Europe and central banks were missed opportunities for BNP Paribas, and therefore we now miss the goodwill on our books. And we miss it, but we don't regret it.</p>
          <p>You see that of all the goodwill we have, of &#x20AC;11.3 billion, risky regions account for &#x20AC;764 million normally, of which Ukraine is &#x20AC;119 million which is what it is, and not a big figure for the Group, and the rest, 76% of our goodwill is retail, and the bulk of it is either BancWest for acquisitions made prior to the end of 2005, or BNL bc and CIB has very little goodwill, only &#x20AC;630 million, that's very much in line with our strategy, for the bulk of it comes from the BNL part of &#x2013; the BNL contribution to CIB, and I think that it's very &#x2013; I'm very satisfied that BNP Paribas goodwill is limited in amount and concentrated on retail banking in OECD developed countries.</p>
          <p>Regarding cost management, we want to adapt the cost base to the 2009 environment. This is the reason why we were committed to stabilize the cost at Group level in 2009 compared to 2008, excluding variable compensation. That means for CIB, we are actively reducing cost. We are going to reduce the cost base, excluding variable compensation, by 5% on a full year basis. For AMS, we will remain very selective &#x2013; well, very selective in terms of our investments and also very selective on acquisition. I don't think 2009 will be a great year for acquisition at BNP Paribas. I think we will put most of our energy in managing the Group as it is. We are going to optimize international network for AMS.</p>
          <p>For French Retail and for BNL, we are going to maintain cost at their 2008 level, and for International Retail the growth, the organic growth will be very selective. At BancWest, we want to improve the cost/income ratio, personal finance we want to improve the drills effect by 2%, and UkrSibbank we've already said we want to downsize the branch network by closing 100 branches and streamline the organization. So, that's regarding cost management.</p>
          <p>In terms of dividends, well we will &#x2013; the Board will propose to the shareholders meeting a dividend of &#x20AC;1, which is a payout ratio of 33% and the dividend will be paid either in cash or in share. This is what we'll propose to the shareholder meet. I think it is &#x2013; it was to me obvious and necessary to reward our shareholders certainly with reduced dividends, but since I am very confident that the BNP Paribas will maintain its earnings generating capacity, I see no reason why shareholders should not get their dividend, especially when regarding the share price they have suffered, certainly a bit less than for the old &#x2013; for the average or general bank index, but still, certainly the share price hasn't been doing what I would hope or I would have liked for our shareholders in the last few quarters. So, I think that the dividend policy has to be solid, has to be responsible, and has to be, well, implemented.</p>
          <p>So, as a conclusion, I think that 2009 was a tough year for the banking industry, was a very tough year throughout the year, and then ending in, after the Lehman collapse, in an incredible and unprecedented crisis in the fourth quarter. Coming out with &#x20AC;3 billion of net profit for the Group to me confirms the solidity of our business model and solidity of our global positioning.</p>
          <p>Regarding 2009, 2009 will be another tough year. This is the reason why we've put a number of clear actions to adapt to the Group to the new environment which is very well under implementation, and I think that in this respect BNP Paribas remains well positioned for 2009 to remain profitable and hopefully to continue to perform well, if not better, than most of its peers.</p>
          <p>And, we are now with George, with Jean-Laurent, and with Philippe, and certainly ready to answer your questions. Please.</p>

          <p>Good evening, it's Alexandro Cat from <mark type="inaudible" />. Three questions for you. The first one is on the cost of risk in France, 20 basis points for 2008, we've seen 40 basis points in the last quarter, I'm just wondering whether you're comfortable with the 40 basis points for 2009. Also Soc-Gen has given us a worst case scenario of 70 basis points in France and they said basically it's very unlikely to be reached. I was just wondering whether you can comment on this.</p>
          <p>Second point is on the cost of risk in CE, where we've seen 160 basis points in 2008. I'm just wondering whether you've done any sensitivity analysis and what is the range of loan loss charges you are expecting in the region?</p>
          <p>And finally the last question is on the risk-weighted asset growth, you're targeting...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is on France, second question is on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Central and Eastern Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Across the region, what is the range of cost of risk you are expecting, and if you've done any sensitivity analysis. The third and final question is actually on the risk-weighted assets where you are decreasing &#x2013; where you are targeting decrease of 20 billions which is roughly a 4% decrease. Now, if you look at the growth in France, you're targeting 4 % growth, in Italy probably something around that figure. There is a <mark type="inaudible" /> which should increase risk-weighted assets by 3, 4%. That's what we have been told by the other banks, and then there is the removal of the flow which is roughly 1%. So if I sum up, I get an increase of between 6 and 8% of risk-weighted assets excluding CIB. So, I'm just wondering what the level of decrease of risk-weighted assets you are going to target for CIB division in 2009, thanks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that regarding the cost of risk in France, starting from the 20 basis points for 2008 we would have something like around 30 basis points as our basic assumption for next year. And I expect that we're going to continue to do better than peers in France.</p>
          <p>Regarding Central and Eastern Europe, I think the first comment which is fair to say is that Central Europe is small at BNP Paribas. We were told so much in the last few years that we missed Central Europe, that as I said we missed it. We missed it in the boom times and we missed it in the bad times. So, if you don't have it, you don't have it. Ukraine is, we have spoken a lot about Ukraine, because BNP Paribas, we are specializing in early disclosure of problems in very clear terms that shouldn't &#x2013; it's not a reason to outweigh the importance of Ukraine to BNP Paribas. For the rest, for Personal Finance, Central Europe is I don't know, 4, 5%; is really small and for the rest, the &#x2013; well, the rest is nothing. So, that's a very simple summary.</p>
          <p>And, certainly, compared to most of the large European competitors who have been much more successful than us in acquiring banks in all of this part of the world in the last few years when they have made it sometimes a central part of their strategy, they are there. We are not. So, for us, Ukraine is the exception and the rule is, apart Ukraine, BNP Paribas is not in Central Europe. I think that <mark type="inaudible" /> yes, yes. I think that regarding risk-weighted assets, the &#x2013; yes, I think your counting is basically right, maybe we &#x2013; yeah...</p>

          <p>Because you have to add not only retail banking in France and retail banking in Italy, but we put some effort in, so it's naturally on the other retail part of the world. I mean, BancWest, I mean also Ukraine, and so on. And, then, Baudouin mentioned that we will make some effort naturally. We have suffered of the equity part of our portfolio. So, naturally, we would work on it too. So, at the end, it's not so simple for you to know exactly the part of CIB, but I can tell you that it's a majority of the effort when we speak of 20 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;20 billion, globally there is a balancing on the odds between the plus of retail banking in France and plus of retail banking in Italy. It's minus everywhere in the world except CIB, so minus <mark type="inaudible" />. So globally, when I say that CIB will make for large majority of effort, you have to account for that.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. I have two questions. The first one relates to your effort to reduce risk-weighted assets. I hear your comment about flight to quality and high demand for hedging products and all of the good business opportunities out there and at the same time I'm trying to square this up versus your ambition to shrink with these risk-weighted assets. What I'm trying to understand is how much room for maneuver you have with regard to capital management and the flexibility that you have there or in other words how voluntary or constrained the shrinkage of risk-weighted assets is?</p>
          <p>And, my second question more specifically on financing businesses, could you elaborate potentially on the effect of the sharp LIBOR drop in the fourth quarter on some potential temporary new interest margin there and whether there was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have not understood the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In financing businesses, I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Globally or at the level of CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In CIB, sorry. Financing businesses in CIB, I see sharp drop in LIBOR this quarter and other banks have reported that this was a big boost to their net interest margin there. I was wondering whether that was part of BNP as well.</p>
          <p>And, the second question was just about any potential CDS gain as part of this 900 million in revenue there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First of all, we are in let's say less weighted assets at the level of CIB. We have clearly market risk and counter-party risk in term of risk-weighted assets in terms of financing business. So, we will work very hard on market risk and on counter-party risk. I think it's of interest to move to page 65, I don't know if it is possible to project the slide 65. You see the average value at risk of Q4 which is higher than the value at risk of end of September and higher also than the value at risk of end of December. So, we are &#x2013; it is clear that you will see quarter after quarter that average value at risk will reduce. So, this is for pure market risk.</p>
          <p>Then, we have counter-party risk and we will work naturally to reduce also the counter-party risk. So, globally, yes, it's really large change in conducting the capital market activities. But, to mention, what I'm &#x2013; to confirm what I expressed in flow business and in simple business in fact it's not so consume &#x2013; not the consumption, market risk and in counter-party risk because a lot of our counter-party we have a CSA with them in derivatives business globally. Yes, we can have very large activity and we see that in December, in January decreasing the capital market risk in term of risk-weighted asset.</p>
          <p>Concerning financing business, yes, we naturally &#x2013; it's very good business. But we have to concentrate in high margin activities without lot of risk. So, it's much easier now to choose and to target very good counter-party with large margin and with a lot of cost saving activities. So back to basics.</p>
          <p>And, so, globally &#x2013; and on top of that I have to mention you that we have not, let's say, CDS gain in our financing business. In financing business &#x2013; so, reserves, let's say there is a few parts of it but it's not significant. Globally, we have seen that, I don't remember the name but some competitors has report got a lot of gain on that. We are not at all in that field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is a big difference because as I view it, a very large CDS gain have the value of a big one-off because I don't think you can repeat them. What we say here is that in our financing revenues the bulk of it &#x2013; the more than the vast majority is financing, is prided on &#x2013; I mean, is due to the loan portfolio and is not due to one-off gains on CDS which we subscribe &#x2013; yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And fees for let's say with a fee insurance, that is business as usual. Let' say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then, regarding your first question on capital management, I think that at group level the discipline of reducing risk-weighted asset by 4% is a good discipline and will make the group I would say concentrate...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20 billion? &#x20AC;20 billion where will make &#x2013; yes, around 4%, not 20 billion I'm sorry, will make the group concentrate on doing the right business and the best business and also charging adequately in relation to an environment where the cost of liquidity on one side and the pricing of risk on the other side has to be very adequately done. We are absolutely ready to do business and we're open for business, but open for business where we consciously and at every transaction we want to make sure then the funding cost is well replicated &#x2013; adequately replicated and also the cost of risk is applicated and I absolutely want group-wise that in 2009 we put quality of business adequate pricing regarding funding and adequate pricing regarding risk before volume and that will be a &#x2013; this is what we are going to do. And, I think that this is a very sound behavior and a very good pattern in the 2009 environment as we see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, let's say we have a very good benchmark because during all the first quarter we had the price where we had no new issue of bonds, for corporate, we have nothing, we have just the CDS. But, now, we see what is a price. So it's much easier, I don't say it's easy, but it's much easier to discuss with clients world-wide just to say, 'okay, the margins despite the fact that you are a very good customer, okay let's look at the price to issue new bonds and okay life is life.' So, let's say we &#x2013; so new business is at absolutely different scale in term of margins of what was the former business basically. And so the financing business will continue to be a very good source of revenue.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Kimon Kalamboussis from Citi. I have two questions. If I may, first on your balance sheet, your assets grew by around 20% in 2008 to about &#x20AC;2 trillion and if the Fortis transaction goes ahead you could almost reach &#x20AC;3 trillion. So, I wonder by how much you intend to reduce your assets this year please?</p>
          <p>And, the second question is on Ukraine. You provided 152 bps, but actually so the system NPLs right now in the Ukraine are around 20 to 30%. So, assuming a coverage ratio of 50%, this implies a cost of risk of about 5 to 8% over two years. So, I wonder what your NPL ratios are please, maybe the percentage of loans, in FX and the capital you had to inject in the Ukraine please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Philippe who will answer your question on the balance sheet and Jean will answer your question on Ukraine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the balance sheet &#x2013; I mean, we &#x2013; our aim in 2009 is to de-risk the bank rather than the leverage because we think it's more important. In fact, we want to reduce the market risk. We want to have a hedging policy which is more adapted to a time where all the usual correlations are off and so we intend to reduce the risk we are taking in the market, we intend to have a very close eye on the credit risk of course which will be one of the very important item of the year. And we think that this is, by de-risking the bank. I mean, we are going to gain risk-weighted assets and I'm answering to sort of particular question which has been raised already and by reducing the risk-weighted assets, we are going to improve the Tier 1 ratio which is the measure &#x2013; which is followed by our regulator and which is at the end really reflecting and translating the best way, translating the actual leverage of the bank. So, this is &#x2013; this is what I would like to answer to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So for Ukraine, our reception today for the increase in capital, capital deduction is about 150 &#x2013; US$200 million for this year considering the fact that we own 51% of the bank, basically we have to inject half of it. In terms of NPS, it's quite difficult to answer today in terms of absolute numbers &#x2013; absolute numbers. We believe that the global provisioning for 2009 would be in the range of plus 30, plus 50% as compared to 2008, basically this is the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> execution. Just three quick questions. The first one is on risk-weighted assets again. I just wondered your 15 billion increase in market risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter, what's the absolute number of market risk-weighted assets? And when you talk about the 20 billion reduction in risk-weighted assets and the investment bank is basically a large part of it, it's coming from the market risk-weighted assets? And then secondly on CIB fixed income revenues, if we default or adjust for...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the second question &#x2013; sorry, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question's started. CIB fixed income piece, if we adjust for the one-offs the underlying revenues were relatively strong, I just wonder what the drivers have been?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, it would be great if you can give us a bit more comfort on some of your monoline exposures, clearly your competitors have given us a bit more detail on &#x2013; in terms of attachment points and the underlying loss assumptions on EDOs and PLOs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer for the second question. For the second question, we have to be very humble because one-offs today is you see, we had expressed that during the first quarter one-offs and one-offs at the end are a loss of an expected situation. Because with the right -- in fact I can tell you that excluding one-offs in fixed income so the first quarter was very, very good, but in fact there were a lot of one-offs but nobody knows what about 2009 making a presentation excluding one-off &#x2013; negative one-off. The term one-off is difficult to explain. Let's say that globally we think that at the level of BNP Paribas, there were lots of one-offs, let's say, Madoff, our equity derivative and BP2 and equity derivative. Naturally, it was a third quarterly mandatory as a one-off. But globally, if I could add some color on that, we see at the level of CIB probably higher provisions in terms of credit, in term of loan portfolio and so on, but lower provisions, much lower provisions in term of counter party risk because after having seen Madoff, Lehman, all sorts of characters and a lot of let's say unexpected risk in term of other counter parties. Now, we continue to implement, let's say more and more strict policy in term of add-on and so and so forth for all our counter parties. So I anticipate, if I can add color, less, lower level in term of counter party risk and higher level in term of credit risk globally, but to say it is one-off, for me it is too difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then the first question was on? I think on the first question you said, the increased market risk was &#x20AC;16 billion in the fourth quarter and how much of the reduction will be in the capital market securities? We don't give the breakdown in risk-weighted assets between capital markets and finance committee, but certainly a significant part of the reduction in CIB, the <mark type="inaudible" /> the majority of the reduction will come from capital market. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you willing to give us the absolute number of market risk-weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because that would be give &#x2013; that would give you,  that's exactly that &#x2013; the breakdown between, I would say, market risk and financing risk and risk-weighted assets, I don't think we want to give it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's say we don't disclose the global "market risk activity", but you have naturally our value added &#x2013; we have our VAT &#x2013; so to be very specific, we have started on slate outside 65 and you see that we have seen let's say the kind of bubble at the end of the third quarter and at the end of the fourth quarter let's what we say that we'll come back to "normality" in term of a real risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to point out, staying in qualitative description. I would like to add just two things. One is that, in the CIB market activity on top of the risk &#x2013; value at risk multiplied by a certain factor, you have the counterparty risk which is also consuming a lot of capital and in fact as much as the market risk itself and even sometimes more. And the second thing is that, beyond that you have the capital which is consumed by the portfolio, the investment portfolio which is not in CIB but in the corporate center and which is also markets related and which also, the wait in capital increased due to the reduction in the prices. And so all those markets-related factors, in fact the portfolio, the counterparty risk and the market risk have led to significant &#x2013; a huge increase in fact, well in relative terms, and significant increase in the total risk-weighted assets of the Group. And clearly we have the kind of mass of something to work on in order to reduce that in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To come back to that, I was not clear. No, no to come back page 21. Clearly, we expressed that because credit risk we will stabilize, despite the core cycle equal effect. So that means that the big, big majority of the effort will be on market risk, on global market risk; I mean market risk and counterparty risk, and in credit risk we have reduced, we have stabilized now this type of core cycle effect which is a strong effort, I can tell you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>There was another question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a third question, yes, which was monoline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question I think is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you have to ask, the great thing is explaining is this thing. We will elaborate on it. I think it's under my eyes. So, it's on page 99 &#x2013; slide 99, yeah. So what happened this quarter is that, on the one hand we have commuted amback and CID partially, our exposures were partially commuted, which reduced the price of the exposure on the one hand. And also I would say, burned some credit value adjustments, they were used in front of all these commutations. But on the other hand, as you have seen in the previous chart, the spreads widened quite a lot. And so for the remaining exposure the present value increased and so you have both effects in fact which led to a present value which is declining only by 400 million from 3.8 billion to 3.4 billion for the current, let's say gross counterparty exposure on the monoline is &#x20AC;3.4 billion. And the net exposure is down as a result of the commutations and also additional credit adjustment. We added quite a significant amount. If you add the charge on the revenues, 200 million and charge &#x2013; they do charge on the cost of risk for the doubtful monoline, the total is going up to 650 or something like a &#x20AC;1 million, so which explain that you know the net counterparty exposure is down. Okay, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question, it's going to sound a little confrontational, it's not designed to be, but reading through the Basel Committee report and what they are writing, they seem to be going down a leverage ratio path and the political will seems to be there for that. And when I look at you guys, you look like one of the guys...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't understand. I don't understand, yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try again. When you read what the Basel Committee is writing today about leverage ratios, they seem to be looking like they're going to go down the path of implementing some sort of leverage ratio. And you are one of the banks that seems very focused on risk-weighted assets, which I would agree is sensible, but on a leverage ratio you look a little bit stretched. How would you react if they did it &#x2013; is there businesses that you would exit? Are there things you can do into in terms of tightening up your derivatives exposure, can you just walk us through? I am sure you are reading the same stuff all of us are reading, so you're aware of the argument there? And then the last, the second question I had is related to your category 3, your level 3 assets. Can you just give us some buckets? Where that 26 billion is broadly being in the presentation you presented?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the leverage ratio, of course we are watching with the &#x2013; we are watching the, well, the regulators mind evolution with care and well , we try also to give some input to those reflections. But and what you've said is something that's really right is that, even the most proponents of the leverage ratio among the regulators are looking at some kind of intelligent leverage ratio because everybody agrees that the plain leverage ratio equity divide of &#x2013; total balance sheet divided by equity as it was used in the past is &#x2013; and as it is used today by the U.S. but is something which is a little bit not very helpful. And by the way, in the U.S. we have seen that it was not really helpful because it was enforced and it has not prevented all the U.S. banks to be completely over-hedged by bad assets and a lot of bad risk, well beyond what the equity could afford.</p>
          <p>One of the main reasons being that by definition in the current leverage ratio, you don't take into account off-balance sheet commitments, which is a big flow and we have seen all the, the seeds and other commitments on &#x2013; with a lot of off balance sheet commitments and so you have to find an intelligent leverage ratio. And if you start thinking at that, very rapidly you come to the conclusion that you have to put weight on the off-balance, you see and then so &#x2013; and at the end, you come to Basel II. And I would like to stress that the people have said, and it's right to a certain extent, that maybe part of the crisis was linked to the fact that Basal I was not good enough. But nobody can say that this crisis is due to Basal II because Basal II was not enforced at all.</p>
          <p>And clearly, we think, a lot of regulators think and including the French regulator, that Basel II is a big improvement, is a significant improvement and that when something &#x2013; when there is a problem, the solution in general is consistent, becoming more intelligent, more sophisticated rather than coming back to the good old basic recipes which are a little bit outdated for the current situation which is more complex.</p>
          <p>So, this is what we can say. And I'm not going to elaborate further but clearly as far as credit is concerned, plain financing activity is clearly, if not the same, is to lend money to a subprime customer or if you lend money to a municipality or a state. And, so you have to persuade otherwise it doesn't make sense and you have to take into account of balance sheet commitment. And if you look at market-related items in the balance sheet, it's even more so because if, for example, I enter into an interest rate swap with you today, that's a huge one. I am going to increase the risk a lot but the balance is not going to move at all. And if tomorrow interest rates are moving up or down by the way, my balance sheet is going to go up and the risk will not change but the balance sheet...</p>
          <p>So, the size of the balance sheet is not related as far as markets are concerned, not really related and this is why they invented the VaR. Now, there are a lot of shortcomings to the VaR and clearly one of the tracks which are followed by the regulators consist in improving the VaR and putting other weight on the VaR and taking better into account the fact that a certain number of assets are illiquid in the trading books which should imply that some higher weight in the VaR. But the principles of VaR remain, I think, the only one which makes sense for market activity. And I would add on top of all that, as Deutsche Bank said, I would like to add that accounting conventions are also changing the size of the balance sheet quite a lot, and if you are under U.S. GAAP, your balance sheet is almost divided by two. So, for all those reasons, I mean I think it's interesting to think about that but, well, it remains an open question for some time.</p>

          <p>No, a little bit less. But 50% is of the figure for Deutsche Bank, as I said, for their balance sheet. For us, it's less because the proportion of maybe of market activity is less in our balance sheet than with Deutsche Bank but it could reduce by more than one-fourth I think.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly this year, we had no &#x2013; well, we had some capital gains but small and no exit from capital gains like we enjoyed the previous years and clearly, it makes a difference already in 2008 compared with 2007, as I said. In 2009, given the level of stock exchanges and overall the level of the activity in that field, I think you shouldn't expect too much capital gains in 2009 from BNP Paribas Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back first to your third question. Have we learned about the fourth quarter? Naturally, we have learned a lot. Let's say, as I mentioned in my presentation, naturally, we were not only looking at the value at risk because value at risk does not capture all the type of risks and we had a lot of stress test, where we were probably not very good is that to anticipate that a lot of stress tests we look because it was not so simple because we had to face total illiquidity of market, and on top of that, second was stress test was what we call collapse of hedge fund. In fact, a lot of hedge fund, they didn't collapse but they disappear off the market. There were no more counter parties of a lot of, basically, you know those very well, of very well known hedge funds which were very active in, let's say, some specific derivative business, and so they were no more there.</p>
          <p>So, it was not possible to continue to hedge correctly all our positions. So, what's now we constantly look at stress test thinking that it is possible to have stress test on that magnitude. So, what are we doing? We are reducing all that kind of peak risk. How to reduce that? First, managing and buying back, let's say, those position which was costly in the fourth quarter, and second, naturally, to change the type of products we sell to the clients and, hopefully, the clients, they don't ask now for a very sophisticated product. For example, you are very aware of that. A lot of banks and we were on those banks, have sold to a lot of clients, what we call best of, worst of, and the worst of, best case of index, worst of best case of things, so.</p>
          <p>Now, we will not sell that type of business because of products first because of clients. They don't ask for that. And second because in illiquid market, it is a completely illiquid market without any counter-parties, it is not possible to sell that.</p>
          <p>Third we will readdress, let's say, the costs of trading positions because you know that. Every time you ask me, what is your client contribution, what are your client contribution, I will try not to answer clearly to that because the client contribution was not so simple to define because we have the cost of managing the position month after month. And the cost of managing the position has increased a lot. So that means we have to take that into account when we price some products. For example, I mentioned that we had, let's say, some adverse situation concerning the future dividend. So when we offer to client, warrantied products and upside on your stock, so we had to anticipate the future dividends. Formerly, we anticipate naturally that the further dividends will be up year after year. So now, we have to see that to manage that type of products, we have to ask some question for that. So naturally that means that the type of product will be probably a little bit more costly for the client than it was, but it's exactly the same story for loans.</p>
          <p>At the end, we come to a better price for the originator. I mean naturally we have learned that type of lesson. So we will and we are now naturally assess what is real cost of managing positions in an illiquid market. We have to take that into account. So clearly, we are &#x2013; we have learned a lot of lesson during the first quarter. So that's the reason why I expect that we continue the business model with naturally flow business but also tailor-made operations. But assessing the price in adverse condition, which was, let's say, not completely the case in 2007 and 2009, not only in the equity derivative part.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, commodity business, we mentioned in the investor day that let's say we were very strong probably a leader in commodity business. Let's say, this is a good business because first of all it is paid, so letter of credit and so let's say this is a good business and it continues to work. And let's say naturally in the beginning of 2008, the price of a lot of commodities were very high, but for us it was difficult to answer to all the demand of the client. Today the price of the commodity is low and let's say it meets our target on core weighted assets, so globally all in all, probably the demand is lower, the margins are higher globally. I think it's very stable in terms of revenue.</p>
          <p>Then we have also our commodity derivative business and so we have to &#x2013; it's very interesting to see that because a lot of clients have hedge their position and so let's say the value at risk of their position was very high, but now, and so let's say we have experienced here some counter-party risk because the hedge of the position was very high, now as the market is back and so now for the clients it's a very good situation. So globally, all in all, we continue to be very active in trade, in commodity derivatives and let's say so the business is still very basic, very good and we enjoy to continue with &#x2013; we're in a good situation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jean-Pierre Lambert from KBW. I would like to come back to the negative revenues in equities in the fourth quarter. Could you give an indication of the concentration in time or the concentration in instruments? For example, you mentioned the best of, worst of, is there anyway to classify buckets, because it's a large amount. Secondly, if we look at the future, do we have to assume that the running rates in equity revenues would be lower because you are taking less risk, how should we look at that? That's the question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we don't disclose that, but you have to come back to the slide, I mention you see the dividend swap, for example, it was a shock, really a shock because we were in the all the market we're in the process of the fact that the dividend will be higher and higher each year and then we have a shock because we see that not only the 2009 dividend in the market I don't what will the be the future but also 2010, 2011 and after will be sharply down and so I don't know the answer but in our mark-to-market position today it's much lower, so we can anticipate it will not reproduce in our &#x2013; this was a large shock. I will not quantify but I will qualify.</p>
          <p>Then we have faced a huge, huge volatility in the market. We have mentioned euro stock but if you see the same situation in weeks, the S&amp;P 50 you see it was primer especially in October and in November. I think it's unsustainable to see such volatility. I should note the situation is very difficult to manage the delta, which is simple in an illiquid market with such a volatility. We don't anticipate that the weeks will stay a long time at 80%, so the weeks was at 80%, now it's back to I don't know, 50% coming from 25. So today we are not in the situation of anticipating 80% on the long time. But perhaps we will stay at 40% or 50%.</p>
          <p>Globally, we had a shock also in what we call the volatility of the volatility, and we call that vulgar. And so this was really a big shock, we don't anticipate lots of new shock of that, but naturally we look at them. So, globally, the volatility, the volatility of volatility and that the real change is the anticipation of dividend, what was the main driver, were the main drivers and naturally on top of that the totally illiquidity of the market with the fact that there were no more hedge funds. And now we know the situation and so that we don't sell any more 'worst of' and 'best of' and a lot of things like that.</p>
          <p>I will not quantify exactly but you see the illiquidity of the market is very interesting, we have experienced the same globally and not especially us, as a market. It means the illiquidity of the market since the beginning of December, if you remember, between the 10 years, I am thinking of interest rates, the curve, the yield term between on the 10 years and the 30 years it was, there were commented move with a lot of the illiquidity. So, we have to look at that, okay, we were not especially concerned by that but there are a lot of liquidity in the market. So we work with thinking of totally illiquidity in the market in all the underlying global entities.</p>
          <p>Yes, I come back to that question. I think that 2007, 2006 and 2007 were very good productivity and equity during that period. And so we don't anticipate for 2009 and for 2010 is too long the same level of activities not necessarily due to us but also due to a lot of our clients because some of our clients, either of the clients globally of the market, either have disappeared, some of them disappeared.</p>
          <p>And others have let's say are less ambitious in terms of type of product. So globally yes we don't anticipate &#x2013; we anticipate probably to be at a lower level in equity derivative than we were in 2007 probably. But on the other hand a lot of actors have disappeared and we see that there is a confrontation with actors who have good signature because the clients are looking also to the counter party risk of the counter party. We are AA, as Baudouin probably mentioned 6 bank which are AA or more, not a lot of them are working in derivatives. So we see clearly in fixed income a huge change in equity, today it's too early for me to answer to that question because a lot of clients they do nothing now they do really nothing but anticipate and we see the first move, that they will comeback because you see today they have nothing in short-term interest rates. So they look at bonds. And then, probability we will come back somewhere into '09 in equity I don't know when.</p>
          <p>So for me it's difficult to fix a level. We have anticipated lower level of revenues. We are acting to decrease the cost basis clearly and then we will see together what will the asset manager will ask him, but today it's a little too early to answer that question.</p>

          <p>Robin Down from HSBC. Apologies to come back to the Ukraine, I appreciate it's not a huge part of your business, but as analysts we want to fill all the numbers in the spreadsheet. Two quick questions on the Ukraine, last time I looked at the exit bank accounts, it looked like you had about two-thirds of your lending and foreign exchange lending. Can you confirm whether or not that's you only lending to customers who have got foreign exchange earnings or are in fact lending to customers on a sort of under-hedged basis.</p>
          <p>The second peculiarity with exit bank, is that it seems to get a majority of its funding from an inter bank line from BNP. So I was just wondering if you could tell us what the current inter bank exposure there is to exit bank.</p>
          <p>And then just finally on a completely unrelated issue, the new preference shares to be issued by the government. There's huge confusion in the market and I would include myself in that group of confused people about the loss absorption characteristic of these preference shares. And I thought perhaps the easiest way to sort of get clarity on this would be to look back and say well if those preference shares have been issued on the 1st of October 2008 with your short 1.4 billion of losses and say 10% of your capital base then would be in preference shares. Would a 140 million of your losses in effect have been written down against the preference shares with the other 90% against your equity or not?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's there....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so it's an....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Instrument.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an instrument, which has been, created by law in France, so it's relatively new law. So it's a new instrument and you'll have to, you all need to understand that, it's not an hybrid product, it's really equity. And in terms of loss absorption, there is no difference between such a pref share and an ordinary share, it's exactly the same, meaning that they are going to be issued at let's say, I don't know 25, well the average of the 30 days, exactly the same price than the ordinary share, with the same nominal value, &#x20AC;2, the same premium, so the difference between the 25 and 2, let's say 23 which is given to the reserves. And then it's exactly the same than ordinary shares. So, if the bank &#x2013; I hope it will not be the case but if we are losing money and losing and losing, the loss absorption is going to be exactly the same as if we had increased the capital reserve in ordinary share, exactly the same.</p>
          <p>So, there is no difference to that respect. The difference comes from the fact that there is no voting right and clearly there is no subscription right, no intervention. I mean, so they are non-voting shares and there is a preferential dividend to the extent that the dividend is slightly higher than the ordinary dividend. So, it's a formula, 105% at the beginning and then, progressively with time it goes up to 135%. Plus in terms of yield, there is a floor and a cap on the yield.</p>
          <p>And so, it means that there may be no dividend at all, of course, if there is no dividend they don't get any dividend either. If there is a dividend, for example, this year &#x20AC;1, while if we had already those shares we would have to pay a minimum, which is something like 8% times 25, which is something like &#x20AC;2, to those shares instead of one. There is a dilution effect because they are shares, at the end. There is some kind of dilution and especially in bad times, I would say there is some dilution. In good times, the dilution is capped by the fact and in the end it's much less because there is no upside, after a certain point, there is no upside. If we pay and if we come back to paying dividends above 5 or &#x20AC;6, then it will be capped at around &#x20AC;4 for those shares. So there is a cap, there is a floor in the share no-voting rights and that's all. And there is loss absorption exactly like a normal share.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is I think &#x2013; what is very important is &#x2013; this is the reason why the French regulator takes it fully as core equity because it is core equity and I think it's very important to understand that my understanding is this is very different from a lot of preference shares in the U.S.. So it's the same name and it's not the same product and this is &#x2013; this new class &#x2013; this new product which by the way it was voted by parliament in France not in relation to the government</p>
          <p>program it is &#x2013; it actually has existed now for a year...</p>

          <p>So for the Ukrainian bank when we are talking of corporate turns most often they have revenues derivative on equity in odd currencies. So that the risk situation derives more from the downturn in the economic situation and when we are talking of private individuals like the ones who directly or indirectly have revenues in odd currencies they are just two-thirds of revenues in local currency. And these customers are hit by the &#x2013; and have to support the full effect of the FX change rate. This is basically the situation in Ukraine.

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. I have four questions. First, regarding the preferred shares you mentioned that for the time being the yield is below the cost of capital. But, with a ceiling at 16 it would be much &#x2013; much above the cost of capital. So, what could be the &#x2013; consider exit of those preferred shares once they have played their &#x2013; I would say interim role in the capital. Have you an idea of how you could replace that with core capital? And my second question is about the tax rate, it seems that Q4 losses has been extremely tax efficient if I may say. Could you guide us about the sort of tax level we should consider for &#x2013; for '09? And the last point, I would appreciate it if we could have a breakdown of the crisis impact on the three different business line of the CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, concerning the exit of one of the preferred share, I think it's a little early because we have not given, yet issued those shares so, I think it's a little bit early to think of redeeming them. And nevertheless you are right to the extent that yes, the ceiling is relatively well; it's really well, not very high, but relatively high. And we, well if there is an exit mechanism, which is the right to redeem those shares like by the way you have the right to redeem any ordinary share as well on the market. The only difference being that there is also the mechanism of flow and ceiling on the buyback price, because they are not going to be listed, so there is a mechanism which is explaining the same side. So, you have a way at any time if you want to and if you are allowed by the regulator to redeem those shares. But I think it's a little early to speak of that kind of thing. It's just the flexibility which does exist and that's it.</p>
          <p>And in terms of tax rate, yes, we &#x2013; what happened, I mean we were faced in the fourth quarter with something which is extremely rare and I hope and unpleasant and I think remained one-time and which is &#x2013; we were in losses. So, yes, the tax aspects of that are very different from situations where you are making money everywhere, which used to be the case in the recent past. And what happened in fact is that we incurred the main losses in countries where the tax rate is high, namely the U.S., the U.K. and Japan and to contrary we had what decent result and profit in countries where the tax rate is very low like the Gulf countries, Luxembourg and a few other countries like that.</p>
          <p>And so, we &#x2013; the result is that we got more for &#x2013; we got more if you take the whole year in fact, for all those countries above from France and Italy where we had no more results and we had no more tax rate. But all the countries above France and Italy, the non-domestic countries, the net result is very low, the net gain before tax is very low. And it's a mix of losses with high tax deferred &#x2013; deferred tax asset and profit with low taxes. And the result is the kind of negative level of tax for those countries, which I agree is very unusual and &#x2013; but this is the point of question we feel which explains a very lower tax rate.</p>
          <p>In terms of guidance, we in normal years, I mean in years where we make money normally, you can keep the formal guidance which is that the tax rate in the region of 27% as the kind of land of the countries where we are operating. But the gain this year is exceptional.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your other question concerning cost of crisis, first of all we don't disclose business plan by business plan, but I would like to come back on my previous answer. The cost of crisis is the difference between the fact that the level of CIB as Baudouin mentioned we had a positive net income of &#x20AC;1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2007 and in the first quarter of 2008, it was a minus 1.5 or minus the same magnitude. Because for me it's impossible to say, okay we have just one off &#x2013; outside this one off it is very exciting, because we see as I mentioned that there are clearly some one off than we will never see I think made of some counter-party risk which has materialized.</p>
          <p>Monolines, you asked a question of monolines, I think, we &#x2013; this I am surely is now over, but we will see probably more risk &#x2013; credit risk and it is probably cost of crisis also. So, I think we don't know this gross specific cost of risk, because it's very difficult to assess that.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have three questions if I may. One is a clarification about the situation with the pref shares, and then I'll start with that one. My understanding was that the pref share will only see losses after you deplete all your retained earning. So, in that case they are not at the same level of shareholders equity. So, if you can please clarify that. The second question is about Ukraine. Is there a level at which you'll be ready to walk away from your investment in UkrSibbank, because you've invested about 200 million or there about, we don't know the exact number because you didn't disclose it. But if the losses start to mount and because you have &#x2013; you are also funding the portfolio, would you &#x2013; would there be a point where you just say, enough is enough, let's just cut the losses and move on?</p>
          <p>And the third question is about CIB. You've had massive losses with regards to high volatility and heightened volatility in your equity diversified portfolio. Now assuming that things stabilize the way they are currently. Where would those &#x2013; those losses be for the next couple of quarters? I know that you probably will be winding down some of the positions and therefore you might see further losses, but we don't have a sense as to what they could be going forward assuming everything is to remain stable? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, yes, I mean when you issue ordinary shares, what happens? It happens that the ordinary shares are issued with a premium and the nominal value is &#x20AC;2 at BNP Paribas, and you issue the shares according to the market price, let's say 25, and so you issue shares at 25, and you have 23 of premium, okay and two of nominal value. And now once you have done that, if you suffer losses, yes, the losses are first denting the retained earning and only at the end they are denting the nominal value of the shares, but the first reserves including the retained earnings are first dented. And to a certain extent we can say that by paying the premium, the new shareholders have kind of both shares in the retained earnings, that's the way it works. As far as the preferred shares, it's exactly the same. There is no difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on Ukraine, what &#x2013; it's a very long-term investment. It's a key bank in Ukraine. It's a very nice operation. They are doing a really nice job. Obviously this country is badly hit by the crisis, but obviously there will be a life after the crisis. So we do not even imagine &#x2013; think to walk out of this market. So a very long-term investment and most probably in the end we will have more of this bank than less of this bank, it is the story for Ukraine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning equity derivative, first of all, I don't know what is exactly stabilized conditions, because I am sure it will not be completely stabilized because we have not only volatility, we have a lot of parameters to look. What is clear is that we have reduced in large magnitude our let's say type of primary position. I mentioned specifically let's say the dividend exposure, the dividend exposure has been reduced a lot and will continue naturally to be reduced by let's say duration because the 209 dividend will be completely known at the end of next week. So, globally not completely, but mainly.</p>
          <p>So globally, we are in the process to see that shock in our revenues, in equity derivative, will not occur anymore. Then, what will be the level of the revenues in equity derivatives? It's difficult because we have to not only to see the volatility today, today volatility we have to see what will be the anticipated volatility. For example, at the end of March then at the end of June because we have to mark-to-market naturally all our positions. But all in all, when we are expecting that CIB has posted good results in January, that seems &#x2013; as we see that the <mark type="inaudible" /> in itself is over, and we see in February and March and I don't want to anticipate anything for March, because for me I'm not stupid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine, but I mean, assuming that <mark type="inaudible" /> for example remains at the level of where it is right now, 46% or 45, would you be seeing losses from unwinding your positions in the equity derivatives portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As of today, as I mentioned, between the first quarter and today, which is January and mid February, we have paid now to close, it's also what we call toxical position, so globally perhaps there will be another huge illiquidity in the market I don't know, but if not we are now in good shape.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Our last question comes from Guillaume Tiberghien with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Actually I've got two questions, if I may. The first one relates to the cost base in the corporate and investment banking, and I understand that a) you haven't paid a lot of bonuses, but you have also deferred quite a lot of the compensation into following quarters and next year. So, I would like to understand whether even those deferred costs have been accrued already in your P&amp;L or not or whether we will see them maybe in Q1 or in Q2?</p>
          <p>And the second questions relate to the Corporate Center, where you had obviously 400 million impairment in your equity portfolio, which is in line with the reported revenues of the Corporate Center, but you also had about 300 million of gain on your own debt, which obviously, we don't see here, so does it mean that your funding cost has gone up by 300 million per quarter or is that a wrong way to look at it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first question, we are naturally past of deferred compensation, but first of all it's deferred on the long period <mark type="inaudible" />. And second, the large part of it is conditional, so for at least profit sharing, so in fact I don't know exactly how it will be treated by the Basel accounting. But globally, naturally, we will see something not specifically in Q1, but in Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, but I don't know how we will be treated, the conditional impact of that aspect. So, globally it will not impact a lot, lets say, the situation of CIB, but I don't know exactly it's a good time to execute it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Again, yes, that part of my &#x2013; some kind of benefits have been given on the conditional basis of several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Three years and so there are vesting conditions, which has to be met before they are actually paid. And as such, I mean, the cost is going to be spread out over the period, which and of course we'll take into account the achievement or not of the condition. So, and the total amount, the total maximum possible amount is not that huge, it is, so in terms of burden that was paid for the next two quarters is not going to be a significant investment.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the Corporate Center, yes, the &#x2013; while your calculation is a little bit rough, but it's clear that the cost of liquidity has increased quite hugely. In fact, in the fourth quarter mainly due to the fact that while all our subordinated and senior debt is swapped, again, you have about three months and so we suffered a lot from the widening of the &#x2013; three month is a spread &#x2013; it's three months bar spreads and especially in euro and especially <mark type="inaudible" /> euro dollar spread and which widened a lot in the fourth quarter, so it's probably not 300 million, it will be less than that, but that is &#x2013; it's a big amount, probably in the region of 200.</p>
