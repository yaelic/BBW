        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for coming this morning to this presentation of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Results for the Year Ended 30 June, 2011. Today's presentation, we'll follow the normal format. So, Ralph, who is obviously doing his last presentation for a while, which I am sure he's very sorry about, will present the result, followed by David Craig who will then run you through results. After that, we'll then provide an opportunity for questions. So, Ralph, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Warwick, and welcome to you all this morning. We have today reported another good result in what remains obviously a somewhat challenging environment and I think we only have to look at what's transpired over the last 24 hours or so to see that. I think this result is a testimony to the consistent, disciplined and effective execution of our strategic agenda, which is delivering real benefits for our shareholders. And once again, it demonstrates how a strong, sustainable business model has enabled us to lend to our customers through difficult times, provide ongoing support for our staff and the communities they live in and continue to reinvest to strengthen our franchise and create opportunity for growth in the future.</p>
          <p>With strong capital, funding and provisioning, we are well positioned to continue to support our customers as we enter what will be, without doubt, another challenging year.</p>
          <p>For 2011 financial year cash net profit, after-tax was up 12% to $6.84 billion. Statutory profit was up by a similar amount to $6.4 billion. David Craig in his presentation will provide you with an analysis of the main differences between cash and statutory profit.</p>
          <p>Return on equity increased by 80 basis points to 19.5%. Cash earnings per share was up 11% to $4.39 and we declared a final dividend of $1.88 per share, also up 11% on last year's final dividend. With a cash payout ratio of 73%, total dividends for the year were up 10% on last year.</p>
          <p>I don't think it will come as a surprise that with system credit growth subdued revenue was obviously constrained. However, we have maintained our record of good cost discipline, with cost growth again held to around CPI during the period, notwithstanding continued high levels of strategic investment.</p>
          <p>Once again, this result was underpinned by the disciplined execution of our five strategic priorities, which we put in place and have refined over the last five years. The group's journey to being number one in customer satisfaction remains on track and our progress was again recognized with the award of Money Magazine's 2011 Bank of Year for the second year in a row, with a significant component of the judging based on customer service. Everyone in the organization is determined to achieve this goal.</p>
          <p>We've come a long way since we launched the strategy in early 2006 and have seen a significant narrowing of the gap between ourselves and the top ranked peer. And I'm confident that the group under the leadership of Ian Narev, will continue to strive for and ultimately achieve our goal of being number one in customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>In an environment of constrained credit growth and tighter margins, improving the service we provide to our customers and earning more business from them will be one of the key drivers of future growth. So it's pleasing that over the same period, the average number of products held by each of our customers has grown by over 20%. We now have the highest number of financial products per customer of any major bank in Australia at 2.64 products per customer. Also pleasing is the fact that we have the lowest customer attrition rate of the majors.</p>
          <p>We've again delivered on our strategy of reinvigorating our Business Banking franchise. The strong profit growth we delivered this year in Business Banking should come as no surprise. Over the last five years, it's been a priority and we have systematically rebuilt the business and invested behind a range of customer-focused initiatives.</p>
          <p>The development of our market leading online offering CommBiz, our decision to put business bankers back into branches and the extension of our Business Banking footprint are just a few of the initiatives which have laid the foundations for significant improvements in customer satisfaction and strong profitable growth. This business is well positioned to continue on a strong growth trajectory and offer ongoing support to our customers.</p>
          <p>Our commitment to our strategy is evidenced by the fact that we have consistently invested in the long-term future of the business, notwithstanding the short-term challenges we inevitably face. This year has been no different. We've again invested over $1 billion in key strategic initiatives. From a technology perspective, we have delivered many important initiatives including CommSee, NetBank, CommBiz, CommSec and the FirstChoice platform and these projects have significantly enhanced our competitive offering, improved customer experience and driven meaningful productivity benefits.</p>
          <p>More recently, in response to rapid changes which are happening in mobile technology, we have been leveraging our leadership position by developing a range of applications which we believe will provide us with additional opportunities to grow our business and better meet the evolving needs of our customers. And there will be some very exciting announcements in that regard later on this year as we bring to bear some of the best global mobile capability anywhere in the world.</p>
          <p>Core banking, our largest and most ambitious initiative has now well past the halfway stage and I remain confident that it will provide the group's Australian banking businesses with a significant long-term competitive advantage. The program is already delivering real tangible benefits to our retail deposit and transaction customers and we look forward to similar success as we continue to roll the platform out across other areas of our business through the remainder of 2011 and into 2012.</p>
          <p>One area of investment which doesn't get a lot of exposure is that of Asia, where we have been pursuing a considered, prudent and focus growth strategy over many years. Clearly, the financial contribution from our Asian Banking and Life Insurances businesses remains modest in the context of the group overall, and this reflects both its current scale and our decision to reinvest in these businesses to drive organic growth. However, once we include our other Asian businesses, cash net profit from Asia was $231 million for the period.</p>
          <p>We have stakes in a number of excellent businesses particularly in Indonesia, China and more recently Vietnam and I remain confident that in the fullness of time the contribution to the group will grow to be much more meaningful. Looking forward, we will continue our prudent, targeted approach to selective expansion in key markets throughout Asia.</p>
          <p>Looking at our achievements over the last five years, you can see that we have made real progress on key business metrics and while we didn't get to number one in customer satisfaction within the Retail Bank, I have no doubt that Ross and his team have the passion and the momentum to achieve this inspirational goal. What is particularly pleasing focus is that our focus on customer satisfaction has driven significant improvements in our market share numbers right across the business and, more importantly, the growth has been profitable growth. Over the last five years, we've not chased growth for growth's sake.</p>
          <p>Clearly, none of our strategic initiatives have been achievable without the passion and commitment of our people and more than any other factor, the energy and drive of the people I meet everyday gives me the utmost confidence in the future of this organization.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the outlook. The 2011 financial year has obviously been a challenging one for the group and many of its customers. While the resources sector has performed well, other parts of the economy have been subjected to headwinds including fragile consumer and corporate confidence, political and regulatory uncertainty, a strong currency and natural disasters.</p>
          <p>Ongoing offshore instability, often a consequence of the global financial crisis, continues to impact the domestic economy and has the potential to place further upward pressure on wholesale funding costs for domestic banks.</p>
          <p>The 2011 financial year has been characterized by subdued system credit growth and intense competition. At this stage, there's nothing to suggest that the 2012 financial year will see any material improvement on this front. Nor is it clear what the catalyst will be for a meaningful revival in consumer and corporate confidence, which obviously is a prerequisite to stronger demand for credit.</p>
          <p>Against this backdrop, the group will continue to operate in a disciplined and prudent manner, with a focus on driving productivity initiatives, which will deliver sustainable improvements in business performance. The group's priority is to maintain a robust and stable financial and operating platform, which will enable us to support our customers and provide superior returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I'd like to talk about a few broader issues. In this period of regulatory and economic uncertainty, we've elected to retain our prudent business settings. At the same time, we've also been mindful of the needs of our key stakeholders, many of whom are feeling the effects of a slower economy.</p>
          <p>With strong organic capital growth, our Tier 1 capital ratio has risen to 10.01%. At the same time, our customers' increased propensity to save has made us less reliant on wholesale funding this year and we've again funded all of our lending growth from customer deposits. Our provisioning remains prudent and while improvements in credit quality have translated into a small decrease of overall collective provisioning, we have elected to increase our economic overlay.</p>
          <p>Our shareholders have again benefited from our solid performance with total payments for the 2011 interim and final dividend of $5 billion, over 80% of which is paid directly or indirectly to Australian residents. With around 52,000 employees, some 46,000 FTEs, the group supports many families and communities in which they live, with almost $5 billion in wages and salaries every year. In addition, we spent around $4 billion last year on goods and services providing support for a wide range of Australian businesses. And we are one of Australia's largest taxpayers, with a tax bill last year of $3 billion.</p>
          <p>Our financial strength has also enabled us to continue supporting our customers. So in a challenging environment, the group has been there for its customers advancing almost $200 billion in new loans over the last two financial years. The group also has a strong tradition of supporting the community through a wide range of charitable donations, sponsorships and other activities. One that's been particularly pleasing this year, is that in addition to our regular commitments, we have been able to provide support for communities in Queensland, Victoria and Christchurch who have had the misfortune of being impacted by unforeseen natural disasters. It's in times like this that financially strong organizations are able to come to the aid of communities in real need.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to acknowledge, what an honor and privilege it has been to lead this organization. The last six years have been a challenging period for global banking and for the group. Personally, while it has at times been personally testing, I've found it immensely satisfying. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia does occupy a unique position in Australian business in the wider community, which in itself adds additional layers of complexity to the role of Chief Executive of this organization.</p>
          <p>I have certainly done my best to discharge my responsibilities as best I have been able to, and I believe I am able to leave this organization in a very strong position with a vibrant and talented management team. And I know that Ian Narev will be an outstanding Chief Executive and lead this organization very well.</p>
          <p>While I won't miss these particular results presentations, I have enjoyed the many meetings I've had with analysts and investors. And I'd like to thank you all for the support, advice and encouragement that you've provided me over the past six years and certainly, this being at times no shortage of advice.</p>
          <p>So on that note, it's my pleasure to pass over to David Craig, who will obviously cover off the financial results in a bit more detail. David, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you very much, and good morning, everybody. It's great to be here. I'm still enjoying being here. So as Ralph has said, our cash net profit after tax was up 12% to $6.835 billion and that's on operating income rising 4% and expenses up 3%. So we were able to maintain positive jaws for the year leading to operating performance up 4% and, of course, in these hopefully improving economic times, our impairment expense down significantly.</p>
          <p>If we just look at the reconciliation between the statutory profit, which was up 13% and cash profit up 12%, you'll see it's unusual items, the noncash items that we classify on a consistent basis between years. In the case of the Bankwest noncash items, that's the amortization of intangibles and the final tranche of integration costs on Bankwest. So those integration costs have been completed. They've come in under budget and all is proceeding well.</p>
          <p>The hedging and IFRS volatility has swung around this year. That's purely a reflection of the strengthening Australian dollar on hedges that relate to future periods, hedging our long term debt and again, consistent with prior years.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at our operating income, which for the full year was up 4%, you can see that at a headline level, net interest income was up 7%. That's on the back of volume up 4%, margin up 1% and then we have, as I'm afraid most banks will have at this time, quite a lot of IFRS volatility on hedging and this is again because of the strengthening Australian dollar. So what this represents is hedges that don't count, hedges of interest that don't count as interest hedging because they fall out of favor with the IFRS standards and have to be reclassified into other banking income. So it distorts other banking income. As you can see, that led other banking income to drop and net interest income to rise. So if you look at the underlying numbers probably net interest income was up 6% and other banking income is broadly flat.</p>
          <p>Funds and insurance, of course, we saw FUA balance is up 5% and insurance claims experience was down and so that led to a net 2% increase in funds and insurance income.</p>
          <p>If we turn to net interest income, for the full year on an underlying basis, NIM is up 2 basis points. Now that's comprised of 5 basis points for increasing margins and change in mix on assets, 2 basis points down for the deposit competition that we've experienced, 4 basis points down in treasury which is largely holding extra liquid assets in treasury and then 3 basis points up in New Zealand and that's that phenomenon that I described at the half-year of the shift that's going on with our customers who are shifting from fixed rate loans to variable rate loans which tend to have a slightly higher margin. And then if you look there you can see the 4 basis points of IFRS volatility. That's that same amount that we saw on the previous slide which distorts the overall net interest margin. So 2 basis points underlying and 4 basis points of hedging volatility. Looked at on a six-month basis, the underlying interest has grown by 11 basis points.</p>
          <p>This has been a period of continued cost discipline. Total costs are up 3%. That's made up of 2% for underlying costs and as you can see in particular, salaries have grown significantly, up in fact 4% to 5%, but all other costs we've stamped on and, in fact, reduced all other costs other than our staff costs. We continue to invest in this business and this year we've invested nearly $1.2 billion and that's led to an increase in the P&amp;L on that investment spend, which relates to the other 1% increase in costs.</p>
          <p>If we turn now to credit quality, and again you see a consistent story here of improving credit quality, which sees an underlying loan impairment expense dropping down to just 22 basis points in the six months to June. Just as the loan impairment expense drops and the quality of our portfolio improves, so as you'd expect to see, our total collected provisions are coming down. And you also see that in line with that, the overlay is coming down. And I think it's worth looking at the detail of that because actually this economic &#x2013; this total overlay is more conservative than it was six months ago and that's because we've actually added $50 million to the economic overlay because of the uncertainty that we're experiencing at the moment.</p>
          <p>But the reasons for the other declines are firstly, just the modeling, the lower credit &#x2013; improved credit quality that you're seeing in those blue bars means that the overlay for that has also reduced in line with that, and that's $36 million of it. There's the continuing amortization of the Bankwest fair value acquisition, that provision that was put in there. And finally, there are utilized provisions to do with floods and so on. And where have those gone? Well, they've either gone into the blue bars so there's further collective provisions because clients have gone further into arrears increasing collective provisions, or they've gone into specific provisions, if we know exactly what a particular client has a problem with, or of course we've actually spent the money and lost it. So all in all, what you're seeing there in aggregate is a more conservative management overlay.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to the business unit operating performance and very pleasingly, all but one of our business units has grown significantly at the operating performance line. Now operating performance is revenue less expenses. Obviously, cash net profit after tax of these businesses tends to drop a bit more because of loan impairment expense reducing.</p>
          <p>I'm going to comment separately on the Australian operating businesses, but first I just want to comment here on New Zealand where you can see income is up 15% and this is really on the back of that very strong margin performance in New Zealand as they shift from fixed to variable home loans, and that's driven cash net profit after tax up some 28% in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>And Bankwest has continued to perform in a fantastic way; income up 5%, costs down another 1%, so cost to income ratio continuing to decline steadily in Bankwest, and this year a cash net profit after tax of $463 million, which is the highest profit Bankwest has ever made.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the Retail Banking business. As you can see, our income on home loans is up some 20%. Now a third of that is volume increase and about two-thirds of it is margin. At the same time, you can see that the intensifying competition in the retail deposit market has seen our income from retail deposits decline some 7%. But Ross McEwan and his team have managed to drive up income in total by 7%, while keeping costs very much under control, up just 4%.</p>
          <p>Now that chart on the bottom left-hand side of the screen that you can see, I want to make three clear points about this. The first one is if you look at the gray bars, which represents system growth in home loans, you can see that system growth has declined steadily over the years since 2007 where it was 13%, down to just 6% in the current year. And there's no sign, as Ralph said, of that bouncing back anytime soon.</p>
          <p>The second point to make is that as you can see in 2008, 2009 and 2010, we gained very substantial market share in the home loan book, very substantial indeed.</p>
          <p>Now we're in a very low credit growth environment and in a very low credit growth environment, there's very little market share to be gained. So the story is about profitable growth and what we are focused on is making sure that we have long-term sustainable profitable relationships with our customers and that's where the focus has been this time. So you can see that in the top right-hand corner, margins have increased, although nowhere near to the level that they were pre-GFC for the Retail Bank.</p>
          <p>And I think the important thing to look at in terms of those customer relationships is the bottom right-hand corner. Now this is a survey that's conducted every month of main financial institution, so it's customers, Australian customers nominating who is their main financial institution. And over the year, CBA has actually grown the number of main financial institutions to a new record of 33.2% for the group, up 0.2%. Interestingly from that chart, you'll see that, in fact, it's the small banks that are suffering, losing a 0.5% of market share over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the state of credit in the Retail Bank, you can see that the loan impairment expenses ticked up a bit to 23 basis points. Now that's on the back of the arrears across our book increasing over the six months period, and you can see that they closed somewhat higher than they were six months ago. However, pleasingly the arrears are down in the last couple of months and I'm pleased to say that for the month of July they're down a little bit further.</p>
          <p>I want to just comment specifically on home loans, because this is an area that lots of people get very excited talking about housing bubbles and home loan losses and so on. Across the group, we have $330 billion of home loans and guess how much we lost of the $330 billion of home loans in the last 12 months, actuators, $67 million, 2 basis points. Now, admittedly that is one basis point higher than the long-term average, but $67 million is the smallest loss we have on any part of our book. This is absolutely the safest part of our book. The worst loss ever incurred on home loans in the last 25 years was five basis points. So this is a very safe portfolio and I can tell you that we are continuing to lend in exactly the same prudent way that we always have done.</p>
          <p>The top right-hand corner shows the cost to income ratio and you know from prior presentations that Ross McEwan and his teams have a target, an aspirational target, of getting that cost to income ratio down to 35% and you can see that enormous progress is continuing to be made on that score.</p>
          <p>So this business is all about a good strategy and clear execution. As I've explained to you, profitable growth is what this business is about and it's absolutely delivering on that and it's looking to capitalize on the benefits of core banking by continuing to increase efficiency, by introducing innovative products through core banking such as the new Gold Saver account which pleasingly has already picked up $2.5 billion of new deposits and by improving that cross sell across products per customer that Ralph was talking about earlier.</p>
          <p>Let's now talk about the corporate banking businesses in Australia and firstly, business in Private Bank. You can see it all of the business in Private Bank banking businesses grew strongly during this year but, of course, not surprisingly with the decline in equities markets, the income from CommSec and from margin lending declined in this period, although pleasingly we've maintained our market share. So again, you can see income up significantly higher than expenses as expenses in that business were really kept under control, delivering a further 8% growth in cash net profit after tax &#x2013; sorry, in operating performance in the higher growth in terms of cash net profit after tax.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Institutional Banking &amp; Markets business, you can see that institutional lending income was down some 2% and that's because of this continuing, although it may not continue much longer in these markets, strengthening in the debt capital markets. We see some of their customers switching back into their more traditional debt capital markets areas. And, of course, like other investment banks and global banks, Markets income has been down as there has, up until recently, been less volatility. Ian Saines and his team have managed to keep costs well truly really under control, with no growth in costs at all this year, which has limited the impact of all of those things.</p>
          <p>Now the top right-hand corner attempts to cast some light on what is always a little bit of murky area and that is what's happening with business lending, because there is just one statistic for business lending across the entire market from very large to very small customers. And as you can see, system growth in that market was 2.1% for the year. However, when we look at what our own performance is, you can see that Business and Private Bank grew its market share more than double system. Institutional Banking &amp; Markets, of course we, have that deleveraging from the debt capital markets.</p>
          <p>And then if we look at Bankwest, interestingly, the Bankwest business book is made up of two pieces. There's the legacy book that we purchased, that is a type of lending that we don't particularly like. And you can see that during the course of this year, we actually dropped 21.8% of that, so we were able to either refinance it with other banks or deal with it in other ways and significantly reduce our exposure to that area, while at the same time, since acquiring the business we've been introducing the CBA credit quality to Business Banking and Bankwest, and pleasingly, that business has grown by 8%. So it's a fantastic turnaround for Bankwest.</p>
          <p>And then finally, on the bottom right-hand corner, you can see that net interest margin in our corporate books has continued to ease up.</p>
          <p>Turning to credit quality in this book, and it's the story of a continuing and steady decline in poor credit, we're down to 39 basis points. You'll recall at this time last year, I highlighted to you that, that nine basis points was really an aberration as we were able to unsell three significant credit set at a profit and that led to over-recoveries which artificially dropped that trend.</p>
          <p>If we look at the risk-weighted portfolio and the average downgrades to upgrades, we're returning now towards a more normal situation where you'd expect upgrades and downgrades to be roughly equal, but pleasingly, upgrades still outnumbered downgrades in the riskier end of the book. Again, in Business and Private Banking, it's about reducing the cost to income and great progress has been made there.</p>
          <p>In terms of strategy and execution for these businesses, again, they're very focused on profitable growth. They're going to continue, as Ralph has highlighted in discussing the Business Banking growth strategy, to focus on the SME sector. Now that core banking is being done for the Business Bank, this is the year that we start to convert across to deposits in Business Banking and so we'll be seeking to leverage the power of that new system for the Business Banking end of the business and Ian Saines and his team are continuing to concentrate on delivering total capital solutions to our customers.</p>
          <p>In the Wealth Management business, our Colonial First State Global Asset Management has had a very strong growth in income and that's on the back of a couple of things; firstly our growing international presence. 54% of our income in CFSGAM now comes from offshore. And, of course, one of the reasons that we're able to attract both high quality inbound funds and good fees in that business is because 83% of all of our funds are performing at above benchmark and that really underlines a great performance.</p>
          <p>Colonial First State grew 6% in its income and that's broadly in line with the growth in funds under management in that business. And CommInsure dropped 6% and that was on the back of &#x2013; or 5% I should say and that was on the back of increased claims experience both in life and general insurance. The 7% growth in costs there just underlines our faith in this business as we're continuing to invest there. You can see that FirstChoice continues to grow steadily, with strong inflows to that business.</p>
          <p>From a strategy and execution approach, Colonial First State Global Asset Management is going to continue to capitalize on its global growth and I think we will continue to see very strong growth offshore there and enhance its domestic business. Colonial First State, of course, is facing lots of re-regulation and so they're concentrating on profitable growth and efficiency and CommInsure is very much focused on improving customer service and streamlining its processes.</p>
          <p>Turning now to funding and as we pointed out as the half-year and it's continued, we've funded all of the growth this year from growth in deposits, with $26 billion coming in, in deposits. Now we're still focusing here on valuable deposits, not on the hot money that doesn't count for stable funding, and so we have grown deposits slightly lower than market, that's because, as I said, we're interested in the profitable deposits and the stable ones. But we've been able to use that deposit inflow to repay $8 billion of long term debt during this period and our deposit funding now represents 61% of total funding, up from 58% this time last year.</p>
          <p>As you'd expect, we've continued to grow our liquid assets, up to $101 billion at June and significantly higher, I'm pleased to say since June in the face of the current volatility.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital and this is another strong story. Capital has grown from 9.15% this time last year to 10.01% on the back of very strong organic growth over the period. That 10.01% is equivalent to 13.7% under the U.K. FSA approach. We're well placed for the Basel III rules as they come out and then did a &#x2013; I'm expecting APRA to release more details on capital needs on the 19 of August and we'll see what happens then. But certainly, under a fully harmonized basis, our common equity under Basel III sits at 9.6%, which is comfortably above the 7% target.</p>
          <p>So, let me just summarize for you. This has been a period of profitable growth. Our cash net profit after tax at %6.835 billion is up 12%. We've been able to maintain positive jaws with income up 4% and underlying expenses up just 2%. Margins are recovering, although certainly not to the area where they were pre-GFC. Impairment expenses are reducing steadily. We have a very strong capital position of 10.01% and very strong funding at 61% deposit funded.</p>
          <p>So we are in a very strong position to both handle the current turbulent times and assist our customers going forward.</p>
          <p>So I'll ask Warwick Bryan to handle the Q&amp;A for us from here.</p>

          <p>A &#x2013; [05FLY1-E Warwick Bryan]&gt;: Thank you, David. Sort of normal rules apply today. Please identify yourself and can you please wait for a microphone. Two questions at a time maximum to start with. And I understand there will some media on the line, if they could just hold their questions for this afternoon. I'll start with questions from the room and then we'll go to the phone. So, Jon Mott?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Jon Mott from UBS. A question on the cost to income and Project 35 that you've been working on for some time, bringing that cost to income down to 35%. Since that target was put out there, the revenue environment has obviously become a lot more difficult which puts a lot more challenge on getting the cost down in those businesses. So are you still comfortable that you'll be able to get to that 35% cost to income ratio? And very conscious that you'll probably won't to here to see it, so maybe you could with a hostile path to people coming after you, but can you get there? And if that does involve taking group costs down, is that something that you'd be prepared to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jonathan, you're absolutely right, the question is one that I don't have to be here to answer for in the future. But certainly, aspirationally, we're still very much focused on the 35% and you are right to point out that obviously when we made that announcement, that's what we were focusing on and what we were going to try and achieve. That did have a certain degree of reasonable growth in revenue and so revenue has slowed somewhat. But certainly, there's been no reappraisal of that number. We're still very much focused on that. And as you can see over the last 12 months, there's been a continuing reduction in that area, a reduction in the cost to income ratio of the Retail Bank and that is continuing into this half. And likewise, we're seeing obviously a significant improvement in the cost to income ratio within Business and Private Banking, substantial improvement over the last two years and likewise, we're seeing a significant improvement in Bankwest.</p>
          <p>So overall, I'm confident that the organization is still very much on a trajectory of a lower cost to income ratio and certainly, we haven't run up the white flag as far as 35, Project 35 is concerned, still very much our focus.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. David, I just wanted to get a little bit more detail around the margin, if I could, particularly, actually on the deposit side of the equation. Given we're in an environment where deposits are exceeding lending at quite a rapid rate, just sort of what the pressures are there that are causing that to be declining impact on the NIM? And if in the second half particular, I'd just be interested in a bit of a split as to how the deposit part contributed to the margin, whether that's turning positive or whether that's been negative. I know in the full year, it's a negative, but I'd just be interested in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I think there's a chart in the back that gives you a breakup in that pack of NIM in the second half, which is on Page 67 of the pack, where deposits and indeed funding, net funding in the second half was broadly flat. In other words, slightly improving margins in retail deposits offset the continuing increasing costs of wholesale funding for the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean, we're seeing some other banks start to reduce too their rights, just sort of your view on where you think clearly rates have moved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we can't possibly price signal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good point. So perhaps looking at it a slightly different way, is the spot margin at the moment, how different is that relative to the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, it's moving around all over the shop and obviously in the last few days, we're seeing even more volatility and even more uncertainty in things. I mean, if this volatility continues, then you're going to expect that even more retail deposits will come in. There tends to be a flight to strength in these times and so, if that continues, then we'll actually get more deposits in, which will mean less reliance on wholesale funding. But nonetheless, our wholesale funding is still &#x2013; we're still rolling off the remaining parts of that old cheap pre-GFC long-term debt with more expensive debt. That's costing us about half a basis point a month now. We're expecting that to finish or peak and turn the curve as it were in and around January next year. So we've got another seven or eight months to go and that'll, as I said, continue to add to the cost but then we'll just have to see what happens on the retail deposit side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin, Credit Suisse. Let me first by start saying as it painful it is for an Aussie to complement a Kiwi, especially in the year of the World Cup. Congratulations on a sensational tenure as CEO of CBA, Ralph. Can I just go to Slide 15, the core bank transformation? My understanding was that the deposit products were meant to have completed and move over to the core bank system by the end of &#x2013; well 31 of December 2010 and then 2011 was for the lending products to go over. This looks as if it's moving out six, potentially 12 months, whether there's been a slowdown or a change in what's happened in terms of moving products over to the new system and whether that impacts your ability to start to turn off systems and get some of the productivity benefits out of the new system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod, I mean certainly the intention was always to move the Business Banking deposit products across this year and that's been the case for some principal period of time and we completed the conversion of all of the retail deposits, transaction accounts, savings accounts, term deposits last year. And certainly, we're now opening all of the new Business Banking accounts on the new system. But we do have the portfolio of existing accounts to transfer over the next month or two.</p>
          <p>When we announced, obviously, that we were increasing the cost of the program, that was due to the fact that obviously we were including more functionality into the system and that obviously meant that the timeframe was going to go out into the latter part of 2012. Originally, the plan was for completion to be in the area of March/April of 2012. That's now going to move out towards the end of 2012. But that's the reason why we made the announcement last year around the increase in costs and that was a timeframe impact as much as an increase in functionality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that impact cost benefits from the system and especially in light of your outlook for FY '12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think some of the benefits that are coming to an account now are quite strong. So obviously, the new Gold Saver account et cetera is achieving additional benefits over and above what we anticipated. And certainly, the announcements that we made in the next few months in regard to the new product initiatives around mobile banking, which weren't included in the benefits that we put in place originally will, I think, significantly enhance the business case because you need a real-time system to do what we're going to announce later on the year.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Craig Williams from Citi here. You talked about not putting up the white flag on Project 35. I note the message seems to have changed on home loan market share from six months ago where you talked with determination about growing a system again. Now you're citing a low growth environment, so not willing to chase share. So other than your economists' forecasts having come down, what's sort of change that the mindset or thinking around that? And given that you do have the lowest mortgage processing costs in the system and probably the lowest Retail Bank cost to income ratio, your thoughts about flexing your muscle more in that respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Craig, we made some pretty aggressive announcements yesterday in regard to the fixed rate loans across the range of durations on fixed rate loans. Also, if you look at the last quarter, I think it's fair to say that we increased our share of mortgages, not quite to system but not very far off system. So we are seeing a momentum in regard to the growth of our share of the mortgage market. And that certainly comes about because there's no doubt that brokers in particular understand the value of our processing system, the speed with which we can obviously provide approvals and the speed in which we can execute. So we've had to step in for a number of our competitors who have had issues or problems with their own systems where they've not been able to meet settlement time frames. And certainly, we've got a number of instances where that's happened in the last three to six months in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just noting recent volatility in markets, can you comment on how your books are supposed to been positioned for the volatile movements in FX market, interest rate markets, et cetera in the last couple of weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Craig, some time ago we took a decision that we wanted to make sure that we had a very strong balance sheet and that we had high levels of liquidity. We are carrying significant buffers in liquidity to make sure that we could handle any closing of markets for periods of three to six months. And certainly, we took the view that the global financial crisis, as it's been termed, has not yet been completed and that while we may have come over the biggest hump, there are going to be a lot of lumps and bumps on the way. And as a result of that, we've taken a very conservative position in regard to our balance sheet and our liquidity, to make sure that we're not going to have any surprises. So I feel very confident that we are in a situation where we've got the appropriate buffers and flexibility to be able to handle what it is effectively thrown at us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So no trading income volatility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's no doubt that trading income has been down in the last 12 months and as David obviously demonstrated in the presentation, that we've seen a drop of around 11% on trading income. Obviously, in times of volatility, then there's usually a situation where trading income does pick up as people, organizations endeavor to put in place swaps and hedges. And so certainly I think we'll probably see a slight improvement in trading income on the back of that. But I wouldn't make that a forecast at this point on the basis of a few days volatility.</p>

          <p>Ben, we'll take one question here. Then we'll go to the phones and then we'll come to the room. So, Ben Koo, from Goldman Sachs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to echo Jarrod's earlier comments about congratulations on a great tenure. Just taking a step back, going back to Slide 36 where we have a look at the troublesome exposures. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more into that and have a look at &#x2013; I just noticed that that's declined over the half, yet you also flagged that the net upgrades, the downgrades are relatively neutral over the half. So could you just give us a little bit more color behind is there any particular industry segments that are performing better or worse that's driving that improvement in troublesome exposures? Then perhaps looking to the growth perspective in terms of the business lending growth that you're seeing despite the Bankwest run off, if there's any particular industry segments there that are showing signs of growth as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just make a comment before I pass on to David. As far as the upgrades and downgrades are concerned, they're based around the number of customers. They don't equate exactly to dollar volumes. So dollar volumes have been less, relatively speaking, from the point of view of downgrades, but you've got a situation where we put that chart in there based around customers. So that's why you see the difference in the overall impairment number. David might like to add a bit of color to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the troublesome exposures reflect really what I was saying before which is that the overall credit quality of the book continues to improve, and so that in troublesome, they've either stopped being troublesome or they've moved into impaired. That final bucket in the bottom right-hand corner chart on Page 36 shows you that our impaired assets are pretty flat for the period, at the end of the period. Now that's because in that last bucket, it takes a long while for them to move out. So they sort of migrate through the process or improve, but when they get into the last bucket, then it takes that longer period just to shift them through.</p>
          <p>In terms of particularly the exchange rate, we're seeing some signs of stress in the sorts of areas you would expect to be seen that are affected by the Australian dollar, so some manufacturing, obviously some small retail, transport, logistics and sort of Southeast Queensland but not Brisbane property. We have very low exposure to that area other than some residual stuff in Bankwest, so that's fine. So from our point of view, net-net the book's performing well.</p>
          <p>In terms of where it's growing and we might throw across to Ian, but broadly, as far as the book's concerned, it's been sort of across the board steady growth. What we're finding is if you go and talk to your customers and actually build a relationship with them, then over time you get confidence and you get business from them over time and it's more of an across the board growth as I said, and Ian's nodding vigorously, so I think that probably covers that question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good day, guys. Well done, Ralph, just to you and your team. Just a couple of questions. Do you think the rating agencies have too much power? And what are the consequences if they actually downgrade the major banks in Australia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, rating agencies haven't really covered themselves in glory over the last decade or so with what's actually led to the global financial crisis and they seem to be always a bit late to the party in my view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And what would be the consequence if they do downgrade the major banks by a notch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you have to look at it from the point of view, T.S., as to what it does to banks globally. I mean this is not a situation where Standard &amp; Poor's is looking at Australian banks alone. They're looking at their whole rating model, which would have an impact across financial institutions internationally. So it comes down to what would be the ratings as far as their comparability with other like financial institutions. So I suspect that when you look at banks like the Australian majors, they've very clearly demonstrated their ability to withstand what has been the biggest shock in financial markets since the last depression. And I don't think that any change by the rating agencies is really going to change the way that the banks are able to carry out the business and react to markets in general. So I think, to a large extent, the change is somewhat meaningless, but it depends on whether or not Australian banks end up being disproportionately rated compared to the market as a whole, but I would suspect that that would not be the case.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Ralph, you've obviously seen a period of very strong ROEs on average, around 20%. And I guess I'm just interested in your outlook statement today is fairly subdued. The credit growth forecast from your economists have come down rapidly. So I was just interested whether you think it's realistic to assume that the cost efficiency initiatives ahead can preserve those sort of 20% ROEs or whether the group needs to look elsewhere to either find growth of return going forward or investors need to accept lower ROEs going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this whole issue around ROEs is obviously a vexed one. Certainly, we're looking at other means by which we can obviously grow our business going forward and so that obviously means businesses that we are currently in, making sure that we can grow those in order to make sure that we're able to continue to provide good or superior returns to our shareholders. There's no doubt that there are a number of headwinds when you look forward with regulatory changes, Basel III changes, et cetera, which all will have some impact on obviously returns. So therefore, for an organization such as ourselves, it's very important that we are focused very much on productivity. And the things that we're doing inside our business process simplification, new contemporary systems are all going to obviously provide us with productivity advantages going forward.</p>
          <p>And obviously over time, we're going to transition to a lower cost operating environment and that's going to provide some degree of hedge against the deterioration in margin. But there's no doubt that running ROEs in the high teens is going to be challenging, but certainly, that's just another part of the mix. And certainly, that's why we're obviously very focused on making sure that we are going to get our cost to income ratios down to levels which will be very much at the global leading edge and I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to that, but there's no doubt but it's a challenge.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Ralph, I just want to echo everyone's congratulations and I also particularly want to draw your attention to the fact of what an amazing transformation we've seen under your tenure at CommBank. I had two questions for David, if I may, which are very kind of regulatory driven. Looking at Slide 51, which is the deposit funding. The liquidity assets stood at $101 billion. David, could you just give us your initial feel on how much of that $101 billion will count as liquidity under the new liquidity coverage ratio? What might be the shortfall we should see in 1 January 2015 and what the impact would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, of course, we're waiting for the final rules and in particular what we know is that there will be some form of facility being offered by the Reserve Bank, given that we can't hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets. There aren't sufficient high-quality liquid assets in Australia, so that we will be, in a sense, offering up I suspect some of that RMBS at a fee to the Reserve Bank. We don't know the margin yet. So, that's the sort of open question.</p>
          <p>In term of total liquids, I think we've said and would continue to say that we expect that the total liquid assets required will be roughly double what the current regulatory minimum liquid assets are and that still seems to be the situation. So in terms then of cost, the cost we don't know, Brian, because we don't know what the Reserve Bank's going to charge for that extra amount. And of course, then the question is needing to pass that on in the marketplace.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well again, that depends on exactly what's defined as qualifying or not. We might just pass over to Lyn to give you a little bit more color on that, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Brian. Look at this stage, our expectation is that all of the gray and all of the green we will be part of the qualifying liquid assets. It's just that we will have to pay a fee for that part of it that's the green section. What we don't know yet is how much of the blue section, which is already internal RMBS, we may be able to count as liquid assets as well and therefore, how we might reshape that. But as David said, we'll know better in September when the new liquidity rules come out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second one, David, is on the next slide, if you have to look at Slide 53, where you're talking about your Basel core equity Tier 1, if we take out the Basel III requirements before the international harmonization that everyone loves to talk about, it's sitting at 7.1%. Yesterday, Mark Joiner at NAB suggested that ratio should be 7.5%. He thought it'd be around the 7.5% to 8% level. And I know obviously this will be caveated because the guidance hasn't been issued yet. But can you give us a feeling, A, has your expectation of that target ultimately drifted up? And could you share with us just where you think it may well be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mark's obviously much better informed than I am. We know that there's an APRA paper coming out on the 19 of August, which I'm anxiously awaiting but I don't know anything more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, David, has your expectation on that requirement drifted up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well again, you're asking the same question in a different way. I think, Brian, we don't know what's exactly in APRA's mind, we'll wait and see. I mean it's fair to say though that we would always be holding something above the regulatory minimum anyway. So it really just becomes &#x2013; and that's why we're sitting obviously where we are now. So it just becomes a question of what the final rules are and how much we think is prudent to hold the above those limits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Brian, the issue here is that obviously we've had in the APRA model previously a situation where they've discounted a number of instruments from the capital composition and it's going to be interesting to see under the new Basel III arrangement whether or not they continue down that path, as far as some of those deductions that have been made previously. I think there's no doubt that the amount is going to be above 7%. I think it's also important to note that we've obviously been generating very good internal capital and see that we would continue to do that over the period ahead before the Basel III requirements become mandatory.</p>
          <p>So, I think at the moment we're probably reasonably relaxed, but I think you're probably right, that we are going to see that number drift up a bit.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Brian. I'll take one from the web from Rajeev Patel at Soros. I think this is for you, David. Can you explain why you released overlay reserves despite the weakening macroeconomic data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I explained earlier, it's not a question of releasing overlays. I mean these are all audited numbers that where we have a specific overlay for a specific thing such as you acquire Bankwest and you're required to amortize a provision that you hold over the life of the loans, they just automatically come down. We've actually increased &#x2013; to the extent that we have any discretionary power, we've actually increased our overlay by $50 million for economic circumstances.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was speaking on the phone as you were talking. Well if I could just go back to David's point, I mean, obviously credit environment in terms of growth is not as strong as it has been in the past and it's difficult for a player of your size to gain market share and at the same time as a Group, you're generating a lot of surplus capital. Your thoughts about inorganic strategies and I see this slide on the CBA position in Asia is drifting its way towards the beginning of the presentation. So maybe if you can just share some thoughts about potential opportunities in Asia and if there is anything of interest and if Ian's view as &#x2013; I think if there's any difference to yours, it'd be interesting to hear his views too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's fair to say that we've obviously identified the fact that Asia, which is no surprise to anybody, is obviously going to have a stronger growth profile going forward than any other geographic region. One of the advantages for Australia is that we do sit on the edge of Asia. We're not confronted with the tyranny of distance that we have had in the 20th Century where most of the active markets were U.S. and European. So this time, we are obviously in a situation where we can take advantage of that. And certainly, we have been investing in Asia. We've been improving our capability up through Asia and certainly, I see that, that is an area of the business that will continue to grow.</p>
          <p>The other point as David made was if you look at our CFSGAM business now, 54% of the revenue from that business now comes from offshore and certainly, we see opportunities in Wealth Management outside of Australia. And we're obviously looking at opportunities as and when they arise, but there's nothing at the moment that I could specifically point to. Obviously, if there was, we'd be making some announcements to the exchange in that regard. But certainly I think you'll find that the organization will be making sure that it's not just going to rely on its exiting revenue streams; it'll be looking for other revenue streams. But I think we all have to be careful that when we hear the words transformational or strategic preceding the word acquisition, that usually means that an organization's going to spend too much.</p>
          <p>My view is that the best sorts of acquisitions are the ones that are undertaken opportunistically and I think that Bankwest is a classic example of that. And if we continue to see the sort of volatility that we've seen recent weeks, that does tend to present opportunities that for well capitalized large organizations, they have the opportunity to move. So we do a lot of work inside this organization in looking at a large range of organizations and businesses and so we're always well prepared if something is to shake loose to be able to move because we generally will have found that we've actually done the work on it. So I see that Ian will approach it in not a dissimilar manner going forward and I see him nodding.</p>

          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. I was just interested in Slide 93 on the home loan arrears chart, the top left-hand side, the emergence of the little red line, the low deposit premium. Could you explain how much of the originations of that over 80% LVR portfolio are effectively self-insured and whether that's something that you're looking to do increasingly going forward to try and capture a bit more margin? And also, what's the corresponding differential capital treatment if it's not mortgage insured with that over 80% LVR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the percentage that we do there is relatively low, but yes, because we've got pretty accurate credit score cards where we have a prime customer who we know well and who generally they've been a customer for a long while, we know well, we have a very good understanding of their income and so forth, then sometimes we will charge them the higher premium that would otherwise be paid to the mortgage insurer and we take that additional premium ourselves. And as you can see, the arrears rates on those accounts are substantially below our normal uninsured risks, let alone the LMI insured risk. In other words, that just validates that those scorecards are very accurate and it enables us to add a little bit more margin to the gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally, as David said, those customers are long-term customers of the bank and certainly we find that long-term customers of the bank have six times less propensity to default on loans and so we know that history. And generally, you'll find that these people are professionals. So you have people like doctors and the like who are young, qualified as an example as a group, and are a good credit risk was going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't got the number, but I think it's around 3%. Yes, it's a pretty low number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just remember, we only take on board ourselves, those we categorize one through to five, one being a very, very good risk that would persist. We're only taking on board self-insuring ones and twos and only up to an LVR, I think it is of 90% to 95% for those. So they're the best risk we're holding for ourselves.</p>

          <p>Mike Wiblin from Macquarie. Just on investment spend, I wonder whether you can maybe just give us an indication of the outlook for that particular piece. You highlight here that it's kind of 1 percentage point of your cost growth. Is that going to be a natural tailwind? I guess as the benefits from core banking come through and I'm assuming the costs roll off and then also how much regulatory pickup on the investment side are you expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you go back to where we were five or six years ago, we were spending around $400 million a year and today, we spend around $1 billion and I think it's fair to say that we've spent a lot of money over the recent years in refurbishing the network. We've obviously refurbished our accommodation footprint as well. And, at the same time, we've undertaken significant investments across a range of technology platforms.</p>
          <p>It's fair to say that we're probably going to see a situation where we're flat into the future once we get past core banking. And so certainly, I think that while there is still some pent up demand in some areas for upgrades of systems, which we've obviously taken a view that we want to make sure that we complete the core banking system, I would suspect that we will see that start to ease off as a percentage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mike, I think I've picked a few battles in my time. I don't know whether I want to pick a few more today. But certainly, I think as far as the Reserve Bank is concerned, I think we are very well served as a country by the quality of our Reserve Bank and so I have every confidence in the Reserve Bank making the right calls going forward. I think obviously, we do have some issues around political uncertainty at this stage, but that seems to be an issue that's confronting countries around the world, whether it be in Europe, U.S. and this part of the world. I mean, it's always difficult for governments when they're in a minority situation, where they have to balance the requirements of their coalition partners and their own policies, so never an easy situation and one that I'm glad I'm not in.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Andrew Lyons from RBS. Just perhaps a question for Lyn. Lyn, can you just make some comments just on what you've seen in funding markets given volatility that we've seen over the last week or two? And then also, just looking at Slide 50, the funding tenor of your new issuance has been falling over the last few halves. Are you comfortable with that in light of the new regulatory environment? Just any comment on that as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well let me take the first point. The volatility over the last few weeks is &#x2013; and I think David and Ralph both mentioned, does tend to increase some of the potential costs in term funding, particularly in the offshore markets. Fortunately, we haven't been in those markets. We very successfully raised a large quantity of funds in the Australian market a few weeks ago before all this started. So we're very, very well funded and in fact, actually what we're finding is a flight to quality in the short end. The USCP, ECP, we're getting very, very large amounts away at exactly the levels that we were doing prior to this crisis. So we're in extremely strong funded position.</p>
          <p>I think in relation to the weighted average maturity you're talking about, we have done this term funding for obvious reasons this year, as deposits have ended up funding most of our asset growth. Over time, as we continue to repay our maturities, you'll see those maturities, the weighted average maturity stretch out and so it's really just a timing issue as much as anything. We haven't needed the term funding, so we haven't been stretching out the maturities. But clearly, directionally with the changes in the regulatory rules, we will be heading towards that direction over time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brett Le Mesurier from BBY. A question on the different strategies you've adopted. In the Retail Bank, you've gone for price rather than volume as the margins have gone up, but your growth has been below system. But in the Business and Private Bank, the reverse has been the case; volume's been going up ahead of system and margins have been falling. Can you comment on the reasons you've taken different strategies for those two businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's fair to say that we've obviously done well in Business. I wouldn't say that that's been on a cost cutting basis, margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the margins have actually increased. I'm not sure where the margins have been falling comes from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it comes from Slide 74, where net interest income has gone down from $851 million to $836 million, while volumes have gone up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's because of bills of exchange. So customers in Business Banking largely use bills of exchange which &#x2013; and the line fees on bills of exchange comes through other banking income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Total banking income has gone from $1,513 million to $1,539 million, so that's up a couple of percent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Three fewer days in the &#x2013; you're looking at halves? Three fewer days in the second half to the first half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We still get to the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first question was about whether that's about 2%, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We still get to the same point that your income hasn't increased in the Business and Private Bank, but it has in the Retail Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But, of course, in other bank, sorry, in other banking income, don't forget that in the second half, we've got the reduced commissions on CommSec. So you're looking at &#x2013; I understand the confusion but you're looking at five separate businesses all aggregated into two lines. So CommSec's commissions and income are down but the banking businesses are up strongly both on margin and obviously particularly on volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's been about a 12% drop in the performance of CommSec and its income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's only a small proportion of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it still comes to 1% or 2%. So when we're talking about the sort of numbers that we're talking, all of those three factors together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're saying the strategy is the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Same.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're saying the outcome's the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's profitable growth. I mean look, at the end of the day what we said &#x2013; I think we should come back to six months ago where we said our target over the medium term is to maintain market share in home loans for example. Several days later, one of our competitors announced a price war in the home loan sector. We're interested in profitable growth. We're not necessarily going to go absolutely head to head and slash our margins and slash our profits just for the sake of a competitor. But similarly, there's been no price war at all in Business Banking and in that area, customer satisfaction and great service have counted fantastically and that's why we've grown at double system in that space over that period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, there's been one bank that's been pretty easy pickings on that regard, concentrating in one area but not concentrating too much on the other. But as far as the Retail business is concerned over the last quarter, we're seeing the closing in the gap between what we were doing previously and what we're doing now. So we're not very far off system in that regard. Correct, Ross?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you'll see that come through over the next six months in particular and as I've said, the moves that we took yesterday will have an impact and are already having an impact. Do you want? Well Ross will make a comment on that if you like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you have a look at the two years that we grew the most were the largest margin years that we've had for a long period of time. You have a look at the year that we have grown the least is the least margin in new business that you've ever seen for a long period of time. So to me, you're smarter, well I think you're smarter growing at a time when the margins are thicker and then holding on to those customers when the margins are thinner. So I've been happy to run just under system and hold onto our margin over the last 12 months, but we have been building back up. We're about 2 basis points off system in the last month, but our margins have been maintained. So for me, that's probably a good outcome.</p>
          <p>And let's see what now happens on the fixed rate parts of the book, where we've been happy to bring the rates down to look after the customers going forward in that part of the book and happy to compete. Good margin.</p>

          <p>I had a question I suspect, Ross will be chiming in on this. Could I just refer everyone across to Slide 93? Just these low deposit premium products you've been writing. Ross, my understanding was that you actually booked that premium, you recognize that income over the first two years, whereas if you speak to any of the lenders mortgage insurance groups, they'll tell you they don't really season; a bad loan doesn't come out on a housing loans until years three, four and five. Can you confirm that the profit recognition of that premium is over the first two years as opposed to from years three four and five?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Brian, it's over the &#x2013; we spread it over the life of the loan, which at the moment is about four and a bit years, I think it is. So we don't take the premium and just in the first two years. We do spread that premium.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second one, Ross, is there's been a lot of talk about how first homebuyers, some banks say that they're no worse quality than the other banks. But I'm look at those charts on Page 93 and when you think about the peak of the first homebuyers was actually done in '09, which is probably yet to season, what's your thoughts? Are the first homebuyers as good a qualify as the rest of the portfolio, because I'd suggest that your charts on Page 93 when you think that the peak &#x2013; the borrowing at the interest rate lows and the subsidized highs, they haven't seasoned yet, I would have thought that it's kind of indicating perhaps the asset quality is a little bit worse?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Look, a good question, Brian. What we're seeing year-on-year and like-for-like, they're exactly the same. That graph on bottom left-hand on Page 93 sort of shows that we do watch that book, the first homebuyers, thinking exactly what you are thinking. But it's performing exactly the same as the same groups that are seasoning through that period of time. So we haven't seen the first homebuyer grouping perform any differently at this point in time and now you'd expect if you're seeing it coming through your book over the last six months, because if it was put on in 2008 into 2009 the bulk of it.</p>

          <p>The probability of default stress factor that you said goes from one time to six times, what is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's six times probability to default, so that's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's six times a really, really low number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. No, no, no that's &#x2013; so I think unemployment is at is it 11%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 10% or 11%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unemployment, 10% or 11%, 30% drop in property values.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm more interested in what the PD stress factor is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the six time factor from today would be equivalent to unemployment going up to between 10% and 11% and at the same time property prices dropping further, so that would give a six times higher PD and that would give you the $576 million loss.</p>
