          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Nordea International Telephone Conference Call. My name is Liz, and I'll be your coordinator for today's call. Through the duration of the call you will be on listen-only, however, at the end of the call, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now hand you over to the Head of Investor Relations, Johan Ekwall, to begin today's call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome everyone to the Nordea's telephone conference following our Q2 numbers of this morning. I have here in the room our CEO, Christian Clausen; Chief Financial Officer, Fredrik Rystedt; and our Chief Risk Officer, Carl-Johan Granvik. We will run through the presentation and then we will open up for question-and-answers, and we have scheduled approximately one hour for this call.</p>
          <p>Christian, Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Welcome to this conference. I have a few opening remarks and a few slides which you can see. The main headline today is 'Strong Performance Continues.' We continue to deliver on our strategies and I'd like to say that most of our- most of the areas are developing according to our expectations and according to our plans.</p>
          <p>So the net snapshot is that income is up 4% in the quarter, expenses up two. Actually, we have since last year had a solid gap between cost and income of between 13 and 14%; loan losses developing according to expectations, around just broadly in line with the 50 basis points; risk-adjusted profit is up and capital is well within our targets.</p>
          <p>And on the next page I have a few comments on our total operating income. It's a new record level. It's up 4% and is up 18% on last year. It's very much in accordance with our plans and we have continued very strong momentum in all our customer areas.</p>
          <p>And the next slide shows that this income growth is actually going on for quite some time and it is very satisfying to see that organic growth strategy launched back in 2006 have delivered actually above our expectations with an annual growth rate of approximately 10%. And it also shows that the big percent in Nordea customer base exists and where we are penetrating that.</p>
          <p>We keep progress in cost management, we are at the middle-of-the-road strategy. We are increasing our efficiency programs and speeding them up, and we expect to reduce our number of employees by 2% this year. So, the underlying cost growth comes down to around 6% in local currencies. The actual number is up 2%, compared to previous quarter and cost/income ratio is down to 47.</p>
          <p>Profit before loan losses is up 5% in the quarter and up 35% on last year. Again, a new record level and just shows that we have a very strong income generation that actually can absorb the loan losses we have by very strong margin. But it also shows that in &#x2013; and all the stress tests we have done and all the stress tests which have been performed under the &#x2013; both from authorities and local level and European level shows that Nordea can actually absorb loan losses even in a very stressed scenario.</p>
          <p>Net loan losses is 425 million and excluding this one-off provision on a legal claim, which we have contested then it's 57 basis points, which is broadly in line with the outlook we have given for the year. 50 basis points in Denmark &#x2013; excluding the Danish guarantee scheme, of which 17 basis points are collective provisions, which is up. Still there is no warning flags; loan losses stem from a large number of smaller and medium sized exposures broadly based between countries and between sectors and it's worth noting that only a smaller part of these reservations are actually lost, where 90% is reserved for expected losses.</p>
          <p>And we have slightly changed the outlook. We now expect that risk-adjusted profit will be higher in 2008 &#x2013; than in 2008, which is a slight change. And cost growth is unchanged despite lower than last year. And then we are saying that there is a risk and that risk has increased that we will have somewhat higher loan losses for the full year and the reason for that is not that we have a very dim outlook on the economy. Actually, we are happy to see that we see some improving signs for the economy, but this downturn of historic levels we have seen in GDP in the first half year is now rolling through the economy and through our lending book and exactly how that materialize quarter-by-quarter is very difficult to forecast.</p>
          <p>We think unemployment will continue up for the rest of the year and a number of SME, small and medium sized companies, will have some issues to adjust to the new situation, and therefore, we are warning that this risk exists even though the economy has bottomed out. We still fail to see a substantial evidence that a clear growth path has been established. And we also say that the effective tax rate is expected to be 25, which is unchanged.</p>
          <p>So this was my opening remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would continue with the financial presentation, as you can see from slide 12. Our total income increased by 4% to a new record high level of 2,359. For all comparison periods, as you can see, income has increased significantly more than costs. Profit before loan losses also reached a high level and risk-adjusted profit increased by 4% for the quarter in comparison to Q1 and 40% in comparison to quarter two of last year.</p>
          <p>If you recall, from the last quarter, the currency fluctuations was a factor that influenced our numbers quite a lot. From the next slide, you can see that the influence of the impact from currency changes are actually quite small in the quarter. However, as you can also see in comparison figures for last year, of course, the currency is still an important factor, and of course, operating income in underlying and local currencies grew much more than reported numbers.</p>
          <p>On a comparison, Q2 versus Q2 of last year, you can see that the growth in lending is still 7%, and deposits is somewhat more than that. But you can also see versus the first quarter of this year, we have seen a slightly lower or flat growth rates in lending, and a slight decline in the deposit side. On the lending side, it's primarily on the corporate lending where we see a slight decline, and I'll come back to that in a minute.</p>
          <p>In looking at the different markets, all markets, with the exception of Finland, has shown good growth in the first half year in comparison to last and that also goes for deposit. Finland is slightly slower in both of these two areas.</p>
          <p>I'll go through the details of our income statement. Net interest income is stable and holding up well and of course, that is despite the very significant pressure we have from deposit margins. In comparison to Q1, it's down by 4%, but it's up by 6% in comparison to last year.</p>
          <p>The main impact is of course, on the deposit margin, and we have a further decline versus Q1 of 60 million. That is of course, tapering off; the difference between Q1 and Q4 was 180 million. Of course, the deposit income decline is mitigated by continued improvement in corporate margins. We saw another five basis points improvement, and the repricing is still going and that goes particularly for Finland and Sweden.</p>
          <p>We are maintaining, or in many cases, also improving the market shares on both households and the corporate side. If you look at the Nordic market comparison for the first half year on slide 17, you can actually see the very, very significant impact the deposit margin decline has had. Almost 25% of the profit has disappeared through that margin decline. And you can also see that we have compensated that through lending, lending margins, and lending volumes.</p>
          <p>We also have roughly 190 million in other effects, which is predominantly FX. So, that brings the total net interest income down by 2%. So, a very significant impact from FX in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, you will see similar numbers, but you can also see that that the impact between quarter one and quarter two, as I talked about, is limited in terms of volume growth, but still significant in terms of margin decline. Having said all of this, it seems fairly reasonable to believe that deposit margins will not decline so much more going forward, given the current very low interest rate level.</p>
          <p>I talked about the decline in corporate lending, and if you look at slide 19, you can see that we are declining corporate lending slightly. So, from the end of year it's fairly flat. However, having said that we are also increasing our activities with debt capital markets, so we are assisting our customers with much more bond issues now in the first half than we did in the last year.</p>
          <p>The increase is six billion and if we include these &#x2013; we have helped our customers with financing activities roughly to an extent 5% more than we did last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of net fees and commissions, a trend we are quite pleased with, the number we are quite pleased with, up 8%, and thereby breaking a negative trend that we've seen in many quarters.</p>
          <p>Good development generally in the savings related commissions, which is up 7%, assets under management is part of that, we see inflows and of course, an increase in the equity markets. We also see strong performance in the payment and card commission and partly that has to do with the fact that we have taken good or made good inroads with the customers on cash management transactions, which triggers payment commission. State program commissions are similar to that of the Q1.</p>
          <p>If I just show you a little bit, which is a very interesting slide on 21, you can see that for the first quarter in quite some time we have now inflows of 2.8 million total for all the categories of our customers, so a very, very strong inflow for Nordic Private banking institutional customers and as we also had in Q1 from the retail customers.</p>
          <p>One strong contributor this quarter as it also was in the first quarter is net gains and losses. And we have &#x2013; a continued very strong demand from our customer side. Of course, also favorable market as in Q1 very much dominated by, I should say, ordinary risk deals in FX and fixed income and to some extent also in equity. We also have a good performance in Group Treasury.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 is a little summary of the first half year in terms of income. You can see that the customer areas in the Group has increased, improved in these very turbulent times by 5%, a development we are pleased with despite the profit margins, et cetera. You can also see the strong performance in both markets in Treasury, and of course, also the negative impact we had from the FX impact.</p>
          <p>So turning quickly to expense growth, we are continuing with the execution of our efficiency programs. Expenses are up with 2% in comparison to the previous quarters. And the underlying cost growth is approximately 6% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>If we skip the next slide and go directly to slide 26, you will see that we are executing on the target we have set for this year of a reduction of 2% of the employees. We are now 1.5% and we have, therefore, approximately reduced the number of people with 500 since the yearend.</p>
          <p>Despite the tough economic environment, of course, and thereby the higher net loan losses, the operating profit is down by only 2%. Profit before loan losses is as high as it's ever been, of course, on the back of the strong capital markets and net fees and commission business and also, strong operational efficiency. And the operating profit is very close to where it was in Q1.</p>
          <p>Profitability remains high at 12%, and of course, the right issue that was executed at the early part of this &#x2013; or finalized at the early part of this quarter has had an influence. And without that, return on equity would have been largely unchanged. RaRoCar is somewhat better than we saw in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>I will end this by talking or saying a few words about our funding and the capital situation. We have remained very strong in our funding activities. A stable rating of course, at AA minus is a sound rating, is contributing of course, and CDS-spread is on very, very competitive levels.</p>
          <p>Liquidity buffer is 48 billion which will in the survival measured &#x2013; basically we have a survival period of more than one year as a consequence of this. We have continued to do long-term funding at higher pace than we did both in 2008 and 2007 mostly on the covered bond markets, but we've also made some relatively very attractive senior unsecured financing during the quarter. We have a very competitive pricing. Although, having said that, of course, prices typically are higher than it was before the crisis.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital, we remain one of the strongest banks in Europe as you can see on slide 30 and we are considerably above our capital targets as defined in our capital policy. We have improved with approximately 30 basis points in the full Basel II measures and transit &#x2013; while the &#x2013; including transition rules, we are somewhat better on Core Tier 1 and unchanged in Tier 1.</p>
          <p>Risk weighted assets are on are on a similar level despite a slight migration in Q2 and the risk weights are similar to what they were also in Q1 with a slight increase for the corporate lending.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I turn over to Carl-Johan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. I will walk you through the slides from 34 forward. Actually the composition of the loan portfolio is basically unchanged, so I don't think I need to comment on that.</p>
          <p>Next slide is the development in impaired loans. Obviously, with the severe recession that we saw around the year-end, it has also impacted the quality of our customer payments. We saw impaired loans up 19%, still the majority 55% of impaired loans are performing indicating an early recognition of potential problems.</p>
          <p>It was a wide spread, but some concentration to consumer durables, shipping, offshore, and some real estate-related services. Allowances increased by 20%, meaning that we actually improved our overall provision ratio somewhat to 49% and we have a high proportion 27% being collective provision also indicated that specific problems are not increasing that much, but we need to be cautious going forward.</p>
          <p>Increased loan losses to 57 basis points, but that is broadly in line with our outlook, so there are surprises there. We still see Denmark being &#x2013; contribute the highest level of provisions, also, including the fact that we have a charge of EUR48 million in the quarter for Danish Guarantee scheme, which is in other words, not really our loan book that is deteriorating, but the economy at large.</p>
          <p>We try on page 37 to highlight the composition of our loan portfolio in a way to give you the possibility of assessing the risks, because it's not so that every sector is badly affected. We feel that close to 50% of the portfolio is still, what we call, low risk areas, including mortgage lending book, residential real estate, and some of the financial institutions, telecoms and also, everything to do with public and health sector.</p>
          <p>The proportion one-third being, what we call, medium risk, basically the basic industries in the Nordic countries. And then we have high-caution special attention areas, 19%, including commercial real estate, which I would say has still not really shown any severe problems. But then construction-related industry in &#x2013; within shipping, dry bulk, and containers, private equity disposal companies, Baltic countries, and Russia have been highlighted. And I will comment a little bit on these going forward.</p>
          <p>If we start with the shipping and offshore, it's roughly 4% of our total loan portfolio, very well diversified portfolio with the big chunk actually in the offshore and oil service sector, which is still doing very well. We have seen problems primarily in the bulk sector which has actually now improved somewhat and particularly in the container sector, which is very, very small for us, we only have some 2% of our portfolio there, whereas the market in &#x2013; at large is represented by almost 20% in the container business.</p>
          <p>We've seen some weakening in the tanker market on the other side, but the strength of our customers is basically big operations &#x2013; operators &#x2013; industrial shipping with a fair amount of contracted records, which means that we have not seen any particular problem so far.</p>
          <p>Private-equity fund owned companies, some 3% of our portfolio. We have shown here the industrial distribution indicating a good diversification, big amount in the human health and other service area, which is very stable, also communication and IT; food and beverages, while there are certain other areas where we have seen some problems. Only 1% of the portfolio is mezzanine in a diversity of basically senior lenders.</p>
          <p>There has, of course, been restructurings going on in this sector because the leverage is high, meaning that when cash flow is reducing, covenants are breached and we have seen some 10 cases being renegotiated during this first half of the year with I will say satisfactory outcome in that we have reached agreements with the sponsors for them to put in some more money for us maybe to convert some of our senior loans into equity, but at limited charges to the P&amp;L in terms of provisions for that part, which we have to convert.</p>
          <p>New European markets, it's an area now where we have a low activity, lending is actually reducing. We also there are prepared for the tough times that we see particularly in the Baltic countries. We have established workout units and are now working with all the major cases in a proactive way.</p>
          <p>And we feel that we still have a better-than-average portfolio in this market shown in the lower past due credits that we show and also, by the fact that we show on page 41 that we have a large proportion of lending to the Nordic and international market and to the large segment, including infrastructure projects and all that leading, or &#x2013; so, to half of the portfolio to more exposed small and middle sized industries, which you can also see on the next slide where we have actually show that 3.2 million of the Nordic portfolio, 7.6 still have the same level of impaired loans as we have on the domestic market i.e., in average around 1% while then we have in certain parts the mortgages, the small local corporates and mid-sized higher impaired loans.</p>
          <p>If we move on to look at the real estate portfolio overall, which is our biggest industry exposure, but it's well diversified between the countries and also, including the fact that 45% of that portfolio is towards the low risk residential counterparts meaning state, municipality, and company and tenant-owned associations or social housing where we see very few problems, if any, and then some deterioration in the part of the residential &#x2013; sorry, commercial real estate where we have an increased impaired loans development as in the portfolio at large.</p>
          <p>Then on the next slide, you can see the fact &#x2013; the division between countries but also the fact that 90% of our exposure is still in the specification of investment grade where we find most of our big clients with diversified portfolios.</p>
          <p>Finally, credit rating migrations is the way that we follow up our portfolio on an accumulated level. We have seen more down rated customers in the first &#x2013; sorry, in the second quarter than, compared to the first quarter. The effect on the risk-adjusted or risk-weighted assets for the first half year is 3.8% increase in risk-weighted assets, and that is well within the guideline that we have given for the full year.</p>
          <p>With that, I leave the concluding remarks to Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carl-Johan. And I only have a few remarks with the record performance and total income and profit before loan losses and risk-adjusted profit in the second quarter our key financial targets is met and we're actually even above in this quarter. We see clear strengthening of our customer relations, more Gold customers and more corporate customers and we move closer to the customers and we penetrate better with the higher share of wallet.</p>
          <p>Operational efficiency is high. We have a wide gap between income and cost growth. Credit situation is stable and the loan losses was broadly in line with the outlook from the beginning of the year in Q2 and risk-adjusted profit is up 40% when, compared to last year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">

          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then operator, we are ready for questions.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Chintan Joshi from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Chintan Joshi from Nomura here. I've got two questions. The first question is on your credit loss outlook. It says that you expect credit losses to be somewhat more. It would be very helpful if you can kind of quantify somewhat in a range if not a number, like are you talking about five to 10 or something like 20 to 25? And also, in that outlook, if you can give a geographical color to that outlook statement as in where do you think would be more problems? And again, in the same context, if you could bare you comments up with what a local &#x2013; your competitor in Denmark said that they expect the development in the second half to be better and have lower impairments if it ties in with what you're seeing?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the Baltics. If you look at the recent results of your competitors in Baltics, they have been shrinking their lending book and also, the level of losses seemed to be a lot higher. I am just looking at Nordea's number there, the lending book is flat. I just want to get some idea if Nordea is still lending out in the region and how it sees its strategy in the Baltics in view of what's happening to your competitors.</p>
          <p>And also, on the credit losses, are we seeing a lag effect for Nordea, I mean, there is lot of late cycle lending for Nordea, compared to other banks is it because of that, or if you can just throw some color on that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I should start on the outlook statement. I would like to clarify that we say, we do not say we expect higher loan losses, we say we expect &#x2013; we &#x2013; that the risk has increased that we might see somewhat higher loan losses. And the reason is as I said, that &#x2013; that the historic downturn in GDP in the first half year is now rolling through the economy, we will see higher unemployment and large number of corporates will we still have to adjust to the new situation. And it's also being said that our credit policy and our credit risk models holds what we still believe that we will follow through the side of this 25 basis points of expected losses as we see right now from the models.</p>
          <p>So that's really nothing new except from the fact that this thing of predicting credit losses quarter-by-quarter is more or less impossible and we are saying that it's not impossible that we will see quarters with somewhat higher loan loss and we don't want to quantify but just say that their own credit quality and our expectations has not really changed, but quarter-by-quarter this is very difficult as the downturn in the economy filter through the economy. Then I think Carl-Johan can answer the rest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I take the Baltic side. I mean, our lending is also flat. Obviously, there is limited repayment capacity among most customers meaning that it's difficult to shrink the lending book rapidly, but clearly we have a very, very conservative approach to any new projects or &#x2013; but obviously customers that we see have a long-term viability, exactly as in the home markets we are prepared to support with working capital if needed in the short time.</p>
          <p>I don't think we have a particular time lag in our credit loss. I think simply &#x2013; think that we might have a slightly different loan book from some of our competitors and thereby also sustainable lower losses, but obviously one of the reasons for &#x2013; likely for the risk is that the Baltic problem isn't yet over, it's going to continue, but we don't see it in anyway getting out of hand and anyway its influence on the total Nordea numbers is limited because of its overall size.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Denmark...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Denmark on &#x2013; in the second quarter. We are not, as Christian already said -- specify any particular market, but it goes for all the markets. Denmark was first into the crisis maybe it was the first out. It's very possible, but it's too early to say. And &#x2013; and we believe that we anyway have, also in Denmark a very strong portfolio in comparative matters, but obviously some sectors have been suffering heavily and we're with them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and if I can just follow-up on the credit losses, actually more on the impaired loans. Can you tell me if the impaired loans that have been restructured and made good again, is a material part of &#x2013; as a percentage of total impaired loans and if so, if you can give an idea of what that amount could be? And in particular, refer to Baltics there? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Baltics is very small amount that has been sort of been restructures and thereby taking out of the impaired loans. That is the case though for some of the Nordic restructured cases where we have seen new capital flowing in, debt restructures taking place. And thereby the companies put back into the performing sector, because they have all the possibilities in serving their debt going forward. But overall it's not a major part of the movements in that amount. But say, obviously, that is the purpose in restructuring that you structure the debt in a way that debt service is possible going forward.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Per L&#xF6;fgren from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Per L&#xF6;fgren from Morgan Stanley in London. I have a couple of questions. Number one, I would like to go back to the Baltics again, and as you say in one of your slides, the provision ratio it comes down from 62 to 48 in the quarter. I hear what you say that you are more confident of your own asset quality than possibly what is seen out there in the markets. But still I would like to ask you, is this really the right time to have this coverage ratio slipping? So I just wanted to have your view on that.</p>
          <p>Number two, I also wanted to ask you a question about margins. Clearly, you state that you reprice your corporate books. And there is also &#x2013; I can clearly see that development in the numbers for your customer areas. But I wanted to ask you on the household mortgage lending. Ignoring Norway for a little bit, where you have said that you have this lag effect but it looks like the margins are stabilizing in some areas or even coming down, is all the repricing behind us or is it even so that you see an opportunity here to go out there in the market and take market share of what is happening?</p>
          <p>And number three, I would like to ask you a very detailed question and that goes to the trading line. If I understood correctly when I look through the different areas of your consolidation sheets, it looks like you had a big negative effect in elimination of about 80 million in the previous quarter hampering the trading line. Now, that one has turned slightly positive. I would imagine since the &#x2013; let's say magnitude of earnings that you do in this line this quarter that you would also have eliminations of similar magnitude to follow, but the question is what is that's in here that have caused this swing? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with the Baltic situation, I mean, we don't have a target for coverage ratio because we make individual adjustments according to how we see the portfolio developing. 48%, almost half, indicates that we would still lose half of those in bad loans, which we consider to be a &#x2013; yes, a plausible proposal, actually rather conservative proposal. The fact that we started in much higher coverage ratio was also very much related to the fact that we made this big collective provision early on in the cycle while &#x2013; and we have actually been added to the collective provisions. Out of the provisions of more than 200 million that we have in the Baltics some 120 are actually of a collective nature, which means that we still have buffers to cover the specific provisions when they are needed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Margins &#x2013; I think on the corporate margins, we have stated a new margin level already last year, at the end of last year, and we are doing new lending at that level in all markets. And then it's a question of how fast we reprice in each market, and that's due to the decision &#x2013; documentation in that market. And we highlight that Sweden has been and is still &#x2013; has some place to go, maybe somewhat in Denmark and Finland and Norway as well, but that has been much faster. The mortgage folk &#x2013; we had the lag effect in Norway as you point to, but then it seems that the margins have moved up to a new level which needs be stable on the mortgage side. We are certainly not pushing it down. We are still trying to push it up somewhat, so we are not growing the market share here. But I think the new higher level is one that has been &#x2013; could sustain for a while, maybe slightly higher, but I think the real margin possibility is with the corporate book. Fredrik -</p>

          <p>Now, the final question you had was relating to the other line, and it basically contains two things. First of all, it's Treasury net gains and it also contains Group eliminations. And the Treasury was similar in Q2 versus Q1. We have basically three things that affected you can say. First of all, a slight result in Q1 relating to FX hedges in the Group, which was more than half of that amount, elimination differences of the majority of the rest. The results are &#x2013; slight light result in there that is affecting that line, but it's mainly the FX hedge results that was in Q1, so underlying it comparable.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jan Wolter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, afternoon. Two questions. First, going back to the trading line, I think you'll remember that last quarter you said that trading was driven by FX and interest rate products and that's the same thing this quarter. And you also said, I believe, that you didn't gain many new mandates then driving the trading. And looking at the account, we can see that also this quarter you've put most of the gains in other customer operations. Could you talk a little bit about what we should think about the future here? Have we reached a new level on trading or is this just something more of a temporary nature? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one is, if you have utilized the full risk mandate in Q2? I can see mortgage risk is up, but are you closer to the full risk mandate now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can try and answer that question. First of all, I'd like to say that this is very much in line with our strategy. We have over a number of years built a very good position in this area and a very good operation. So, in a way this is very much in line with the strategy. I think it's fair to say that the underlying, of course, demand continue to be very strong predominantly in the areas that you mentioned, both in FX and in fixed income. Whether it's temporary or not, I think this is, as I said, something we have been built out over sometime. Of course, the markets have been favorable in both of these quarters. In that sense that has, of course, helped us, but it is within our strategy to build this operation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the risk mandate I may just add that no, we have not used the full mandate. I think we have still a very conservative approach to taking market risk. It is actual the slow business that brings us the profits rather than sitting on big positions. If you look at the one &#x2013; numbers, they were up maybe 10 million from the beginning of the year and that was basically utilizing the view that we had on certain markets, and that proved to be right. But this is not a gambling casino, it is really the customer-driven business that drives profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that maybe is worth and I think you referred to that discussion as well in your question. All of this is customer-trading activities. The reason why we have a market backbone, if you like, we're outside the customer areas such in large part is that, we &#x2013; in our internal pricing model, we keep a fixed margin, of course, when the inter-bank trading is moving in this down. To avoid volatility, we keep part, of course, of the result outside of the customer areas. otherwise they would be too volatile. But in all fairness, all of these results combined relates to trading activities and not position taking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. One final question, if I may. I think you had guided for costs up just below the '08 level, that implies a 7% cost growth this year. Any plans to cut costs next year, or is it more reasonable to see costs growing given your own view that you have the chance to take market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that our cost line is very much according to our strategy. It is &#x2013; we have the strategy that we continuously and that we have done for several years, execute efficiency programs in the overall magnitude of 1 to 2% for year. We have done that also this year at 2%. We're doing it so we should look at the cost line in light of underlying inflationary cost, and then we take out this efficiency, and then we add in our growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>Now, the growth initiatives are at low level right now. They were much higher last year. So, we're taking it down. On the other hand, we have a number of cost initiatives, the cost programs, which is more normal. So, you can say, going forward, I expect it to continue, and whether we will increase costs or not next year in new investments in growth programs and initiatives, that we will come back to later this year to discuss that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken Capital Markets here. Three short questions, if I may. First of all, regarding the trading liabilities, I've understood that Nordea uses fair value accounting to part of the trading liabilities. What impact did this have on &#x2013; or what mark-to-market impact that this have in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>Second is regarding the mortgage margin discussion that was in couple of questions ago. I'm as well a bit puzzled, because I've understood that especially in Finland you've been quite aggressive in repricing mortgages at much higher levels, and still, the margin seems to be coming down. Is this a funding impact or why is the mortgage margin down, Finland in particular?</p>
          <p>And the third question is regarding the funding. How did the average funding profile develop during the second quarter? What are your plans going forward? Are you going to keep the funding profile as it is, or are you going to issue more long-term debt? And what kind of impact should we expect this to have on the net interest income? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe I can start with the first question, and also, potentially the third question in the mortgage margin. The first question was the trading. I think it was the fair market value change, if I understood the question correct, and that was marginally positive as could be expected during the quarter.</p>
          <p>And the third question relating to the funding, how that developed during the quarter, was positive. So, we could see that, generally the long &#x2013; and may I just &#x2013; highlight the fact that we as I said is my presentation, we have continued to issue long-term funding throughout the quarter and throughout this year in a sense more than we did last year. Generally speaking, the credit spreads for our own funding has been very attractive throughout this year, and clearly, contrasted towards the &#x2013; actually throughout the second quarter. So, again, I think we are lowering the increase, so to speak, as we go along, and that goes for the long-term funding, both on covered bonds and senior unsecured funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a clarification on the fair value accounting, so that there was a positive mark-to-market impact on Nordea-issued bonds in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But it was very marginal. It was practically flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then the mortgage margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you can say that the mortgage margin was a difficult gross number to look at than number of segments and things. But in general, we are the price leader in Finland, and that has a certain price to it. We have increased mortgage margins to a new higher level, and we stay at that higher level. There is a way we fix the price through various instruments, make this vary over time and also, the funding cost impact.</p>
          <p>But the general observation is we have moved mortgage margins to a new higher level, and we intend to stay at that level, that it's also clear that not all competitors do that, so we have some pressure on these margins. I still believe that we will stay at this level, because obviously, funding costs have gone up and capital stock &#x2013; there is a number of reasons for that of course, but whether we can increase further for that &#x2013; at this level is more uncertain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when would you expect this to have a more kind of meaningful impact on the reported margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That has not really had a meaningful impact and in Finland, but it's gone up. If you go back to '07, it was probably in the range of 40, 45 basis points average. So, it's actually doubled to the present level that due to &#x2013; I think that is a meaningful impact, but to expect that to go much higher, I think is difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Aaron Ibbotson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi there. And I'm afraid I've got three or possibly even four questions as well. I'll try to be quick. First of all, how much of your non-performing loans, and if possible, impairments come from the 19% special attention loans? I think it would be highly interesting to hear if you have a rough number on that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on the previous question on funding cost, if you could give some numbers, it would greatly appreciated just for instance, on size and pricing of recent covered bonds and senior unsecured and bond issuance.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, is there any reason do we believe that you would change your dividend policy of above 40% of net profit for this year, because of crisis-related, or should we work under the assumption that it will be there?</p>
          <p>And then fourth and finally, just what exactly are you measuring your mortgage margins for instance, against when you say that they have expanded by from 40 to 90? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with the first question, I don't really have an exact figure on that, but I would say, out of the high attention areas, one area, which is still and not very well monitored is actually the real estate. It's clear that we have &#x2013; with the low interest rates that portfolio is still in very good shape. When it then comes to the other areas, you &#x2013; we saw an increase in the shipping impaired loans in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But probably &#x2013; Carl-Johan, I was just thinking, if I take your 400 million, is it fair to say that's &#x2013; three quarters of that relates to this area or half or 90% or what was your rough feeling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say 400 million then you talk credit losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly or NPLs, it's depending on what you want to use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay, sorry, it was slight misunderstanding of the meaning of impaired. But I &#x2013; no, I mean, let's say, if we have the specification where they come from, the majority comes from Nordic Banking, and that's fairly widespread.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in addition to that, we saw that roughly 40-plus came from the Baltics, roughly 25 came from shipping. Russia, very low indeed, at three million, and the rest really is coming from Nordic Banking and that is very widespread, including some private equity-related structures where we took charges following restructurings and possible conversion into equity. But, it's not so that they would represent more than 50% of the charges. I mean, the bulk still comes from the overall deterioration in the economy and that's the way we it see going forward. But obviously, the relative weight of the charges from this sector is higher than its absolute size.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe I can answer the question on the funding side if &#x2013; just to give you a comparison numbers, five years covered bond is roughly 40 to 50, if you take senior unsecured, yes, we haven't done any since the last month or so, but I guess would be roughly 120 to 130, and that's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you done any large covered bond issuance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, several. As you've seen, we've issued 13 billion, so it's &#x2013; which was a lot. So, yes, we are continuously &#x2013; we are actually doing that every week. So, covered bonds, yes. If we look at &#x2013; so that gives you a little bit of a feeling for where the market is, and that is of course, a very considerable contraction and comparison to just for instance, April or May.</p>
          <p>Then we look at the debt and dividend policy. If I should comment on that, that's of course, something for the owners and the annual AGM, so it's difficult to comment. But of course, we've also as part of the right issue, we've phased the reduction for 2008 year dividend to down to 20% or 19%. It was a temporary measure, and the dividend policy of Nordea of 40% remains intact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is a clear decision for the Board and the AGM to take, so there we have no new information on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what you're measuring mortgage margins against or NEA margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's measured typically against the STIBOR, LIBOR, or SIBOR, whichever reference rate that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you then factor in the fact that your covered bonds, which is your cheapest form of funding, has gone up by 45 basis points, your margins hasn't moved at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact, that we are, as a reference on the margins side, we are using as I said, LIBOR, SIBOR, et cetera. However, the covered bonds and the senior unsecured is part of our fund, and we also have short-term funding. So, yes, the average funding cost has moved up to some extent. In the way we measure margin, we measure it against the reference rate, and that I think holds true for most of the banks. But again, it may differ between the banks how to measure margins, but we have considered to be most transparent, and easy to compare when measuring against reference rates.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We have two further questions remaining. The first of those is from Fiona Swaffield from Execution. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's kind of two linked questions. The first was, whether you can kind of explain what's going on risk-weighted assets, because you mentioned a flattish to slightly down under Basel II, yet the loan book is growing, I think around 2%, and you had some slight credit risk migration. So, if you could kind of tie those moving parts?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in terms of your strategy on lending, particularly corporate lending, I mean, looking at market shares, there seems to be some market share movement on the corporate loan book. But could you talk about the outlook for lending growth versus market share, and what your strategy is whether you're &#x2013; when you are repricing, are you letting volumes go or are you finding &#x2013; you are taking market share and repricing at the same time? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe I should start with the risk-weighted assets. We see a slight growth from, as you say, in lending. The short version is that, yes, we have migration, but we also see a slight decline in the corporate lending book, and that has higher risk weights than the corresponding growth we see in the household side, typically on mortgage with very, very low risk weights. So, those are the two impacts and they balance out, so to speak. So, the decline in corporate lending is mitigating the migration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on lending, I think we have a firm repricing going on. I don't think we are letting volumes go, but of course, it is a tough development. And the reason why volumes do not go is probably that it's not that easy to change banks right now for a lot of these corporates, but in another area where, which is pretty important to take in what Fredrik also said that over the large corporates, we have actually helped them quite a bit on lending during the deficit capital market while managing risk, and the reason for that is that some of these companies have made huge issues, benchmark issues, which have been priced at levels which where we would not think of <mark type="inaudible" />. And therefore, it has actually been a strategy to help some of these large corporates to our longer-term and providing on the debt capital market. So, I would not say we'll let &#x2013; let volumes go, but we are pretty strict on our new margin levels, so we're not really compromising that, but we try to find all the possibilities to help the customers anyway. So, I don't think we're loosing market share on the contrary but it is a tough margin game right now.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Operator, I think we have one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly. The final question comes from the line of Pete Tester of One Investments. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I had two questions, please. One is just generally on loan margins. You have two trends going, you are repricing in the positive direction and mix between commercial and housing in the opposite direction. I was wondering if you could give a view going forward, how you think the net to those will workout for overall interest margins, positive or negative.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just when you are setting your NPL coverage ratio on impaired loans to what extent are you adjusting the collateral value on commercial real estate or housing in the current environment in different geographies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe I can start with the margins. As I think Christian has alluded to of course, the part of the contraction in the household side has to do with the lag effect in Norway. And our ambition is not to deteriorate the margins on the household and mortgage side, in particular. So, we, of course, we are &#x2013; have the ambition to maintain and even increase, but that's our ambition. And of course, we also see that the corporate margin still has some room and particularly in Finland and in Sweden. So, we still see some upside on the margin side. Of course, the main negative factor has rather been on deposit margin side and that's a fact we are expected &#x2013; not to be there in Q3 and Q4 at any great extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, my question was slightly different. You have repricing ongoing and as you made the comments on housing. On the other hand, you are shrinking your commercial loan book and increasing your consumer housing related loan book. So, that's the negative on mix between the two different streams. And I was wondering it's essentially at a rate at which one is compensating for the other going forward, in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In terms of lending growth you mean or in margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, its margin from repricing and the lending growth mix deteriorating the mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But maybe to &#x2013; just to highlight or repeat that, we don't expect household margins to decline. We do expect corporate margins to continue to improve to some extent, and it's not necessarily so that we expect the corporate lending to decline at any great extent. We saw that trend in Q2 partially because of significant issues of bonds, for instance, but we don't expect corporate lending to decline at a quick pace that is compensated by household lending increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally, on the coverage ratio, I mean, every quarter when we do the provisioning we look, of course, at the securities value when we arrive at the loss given default. And yes, I mean, because of falling previous state values before all, we have had to increase the existing provision on certain companies because of the value of collateral not being there. But this is something that we assess on an individual basis each quarter and that's how it actually should be done. So, it is a very specific procedure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But are there any notable conclusions you can draw on your views on collateral values that you are taking when making this assessment of different geographies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, it follows the way values develop, and I will say so far in Finland and Sweden, for instance, property values have kept up pretty well, while we saw them coming down in Denmark already some time ago. And in the Baltics, I think, you can say that there is a total lack of liquidity, which makes the assessment either more difficult than in the Nordic markets, and thereby you have to exercise some judgment, which is not based on executed deals, but they are done in a prudent way.</p>
