          <p>Good morning and welcome to the Second Quarter Results for UBS. The agenda for today's meeting, Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel will make some introductory comments and then we'll have a run through of the key financials by John Cryan.</p>
          <p>As usual, the presentation contains some statements that constitute forward-looking statements, so please take a note of the important disclaimer.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to see you again, and welcome to our second quarter results presentation. Now our recorded second quarter loss of 1.4 billion is clearly unsatisfactory and believe me, I rather would show you that we have a profit, but I think it, nevertheless, shows significant progress towards returning to profitability and restoring client trust.</p>
          <p>A few months ago, if you can remember, I told you that our immediate goals are capital protection, risk reduction, cost reduction and restoring profitability. Now I am pleased to say that we have made good progress on all these goals.</p>
          <p>We considerably increased our financial stability through a capital increase of CHF3.8 billion and we will report a strong Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.7% pro forma for the completion of the sale of Pactual, which should take place soon.</p>
          <p>Our core Tier 1 capital ratio on that basis is 10.7%, which is very high in comparison and our leverage ratio stands at 3.5%, well above the minimum which is set by FINMA.</p>
          <p>We also have substantially reduced our risk in the second quarter and also on into July. In the quarter we reduced our risk-weighted assets by CHF30 billion. We have reduced legacy risk assets; in particular, we have materially reduced our overall exposure to monoline insurers.</p>
          <p>The overall size of our balance sheet came down by over CHF250 billion in the quarter. We also have continued to reduce fixed costs and we are on track to reach the target we announced.</p>
          <p>To restore the group to a satisfactory level of profitability will require further hard work, to which we are fully committed. At the bottom line, attributable loss of CHF1.4 billion is significantly influenced by three components: we took a charge of over CHF1.2 billion in the quarter in relation to the tightening of our credit spreads; we wrote off a further 0.5 billion of goodwill on Pactual as a consequence of foreign exchange movements; and we took nearly CHF600 million of restructuring charges. If we would exclude these items, then we would show an operating profit before tax of nearly CHF1 billion. And I believe it would be the first one or is the first one in eight quarters.</p>
          <p>Our Investment Banking is still in rebuild mode; on track, but it will take time to regain momentum. Revenues in Investment Banking are clearly unsatisfactory. We missed the huge rally in the credit business and we also lost some market share in some key markets. We know its reasons: we lost key people and the rebuild of our business, particularly our fixed income business, is not yet completed. Combined with last quarter's focus on risk reduction in the fixed income prevented us from capturing market opportunities.</p>
          <p>Towards the end of Q2, however, staff morale started to improve as we made some significant hires. Building a client driven business is not like a play. We are on the right track, but regaining momentum will take time and cannot be achieved within a quarter.</p>
          <p>The net new money development is tied to reputation and client advisor attrition. Unfortunately, we report another quarter of asset outflows in our Wealth Management business. But overall, it gives a mixed picture. Swiss clients' assets are very stable, but outflows in the international business increased slightly, particularly in Europe. But in Asia-Pacific, for example, we reported net inflows.</p>
          <p>With delivery of proof of our financial strengths, client uncertainty will eventually start to ease, but this does not yet constitute a reversal of the trend. Net new money development is driven equally by reputation, client advisory attrition and industry environment. Protection of our reputation is a cornerstone of future strategic direction and it includes a deep and irrevocable commitment to strict legal compliance everywhere we operate.</p>
          <p>We are determined not to tolerate any deviation from the principle, even if it will mean losing business opportunities by credible, or with creditable client advisors. The recessionary environment will slow as it grows for the industry as a whole. We therefore expect net new money flows to lag our financial turnover.</p>
          <p>We have made our financial results much more stable, delivered first cost cutting results and the next steps are the resolution of the U.S. fourth quarter matter and the Swiss government's sale of its stake in UBS. Both issues will play out in due course. The John Doe Summons is being negotiated in the Swiss and the U.S. governments and we are committed to supporting this process. The Swiss government has explicitly expressed its wish to divest its UBS stake as soon as possible. But ladies and gentlemen, we will not allow these issues to distract us from the far more important task of turning UBS around and work on building reliable client driven earning streams. We need to bring traditional strengths back to life based on lessons learned from the past and in anticipation of the changing industry landscape.</p>
          <p>Our new strategy is not a revolution, but a change in how we conduct our business based on three principles; reputation, execution and integration. Reputation is to be placed above everything. We can win back the trust of our clients and shareholders only if we have and are able to retain the right people, who with their actions; client focus and integrity represent a trustworthy and credible UBS.</p>
          <p>We will compete on flawless, efficient execution of orders, transactions and services towards both clients and within the bank itself, making this a trademark of UBS. Therefore, we need to enhance integration.</p>
          <p>Now in client facing activities, we must improve our clients' access to expertise across UBS's capabilities, making a noticeable difference in how we address clients' needs. At the back end, integration should determine how we manage our internal process, allocate resources to ensure quality and control, and increased cost efficiency throughout the firm.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, one brand is not equivalent with integration. We must ensure that all businesses work together to pursue the same interests: those of our clients and our bank. Structural changes and clear accountability will enable improvements in execution and forceful integration.</p>
          <p>We are on track with the first phase of the turnaround program, the integration of previously divisonalized control and shared services functions into the Corporate Center. So first functions were completed on 1st of August and the new structure will be completed by October. This will result in effective allocation and management of risk capital funding, staffing levels, infrastructure, and the use of development of technology.</p>
          <p>Immediate cost savings have a considerable lower cost base in the future and a strong, consistent backbone for our bank, which can support the future growth of our client business. To realize the full development potential of our individual businesses, we will sharpen the focus on the factors that create a clear competitive advantage. Wealth Management and Swiss Banking will differentiate through execution and integration, improved execution across all client segments to serve clients better and more efficiently, use Investment Banking and Asset Management expertise to differentiate from competitors, and be full compliant in all markets. This will allow us to stabilize our franchise and drive profitable, sustainable growth in attractive markets.</p>
          <p>In Investment Banking, we build on client focus. Transform Investment Banking business from risk taking, product driven silos to an integrated provider of solutions for clients based on seamless, efficient execution, competent advice, access to capital markets and liquidity.</p>
          <p>Client coverage and sales, structuring and trading execution capabilities will be better integrated between Equities, Fixed Income and Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>Asset Management has performance as trademark, which means continued focus on improving investment performance, build strengthening, reduce the fusion platform for better leverage to a diverse range of capabilities. And Wealth Management Americas will focus on profitability and value creation.</p>
          <p>Based on these cornerstones, we are now in the process of detailing the group's strategy and the strategic initiatives of our different business. We will present them at our 17th November Investor Day. We will continue to see progress in our operating results, but temporary accounting effects might have an effect on our reporting results.</p>
          <p>We know exactly what we need to do to achieve our long-term goal: return to sustainable risk adjusted returns across the cycle, based on reliable client driven earnings streams, deployment of capital to create shareholder value and recovery of our reputation. There are no shortcuts, but we have some undisputable strengths we can count on: solid client franchises in Switzerland, in the U.S. not just firm, not just non-U.S. Wealth Management firm, strong Investment Banking market share in Europe and Asia-Pacific, particularly in Equity Capital Markets, a combination of capabilities in Wealth Management, Investment Banking and Asset Management under one roof and the skills, dedication and professionalism of our staff.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention and I now give over to John, our CFO, to go into details of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ossie, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This first slide simply records the highlights that Ossie Gr&#xFC;bel just took you through and I think there's little point in me repeating what he said, so I think we can slip to the next slide. This slide details the performance of our divisions, showing the reported and our adjusted results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We recorded gross revenues of almost CHF7.4 billion. Revenues in our Wealth and Asset Management divisions held up in the quarter. In Wealth Management and Swiss Bank, revenues from client transactions increased, counter-balancing slightly weaker recurrent fee levels, largely caused by a reduction in the volume of discretionary mandates.</p>
          <p>In the Investment Bank, we saw revenues recover strongly, mainly as a result of a significant reduction in write-downs and the losses on risk positions in our FICC unit.</p>
          <p>Credit loss expense fell by two-thirds in the first quarter, sorry, on the first quarter number. In Wealth Management and Swiss Bank, we benefited from the release of approximately CHF50 million of allowances that were taken in prior quarters against collateral from defaulted Lombard loans. Nevertheless, the overall credit situation in Switzerland has so far remained relatively robust, given the general recessionary environment.</p>
          <p>In the Investment Bank, CHF208 million of the net credit loss expense was incurred on former trading positions that were reclassified to loans and receivables in the fourth quarter of last year. The balance of the credit loss of 161 million related to loans originated across a broad range of industrial sectors.</p>
          <p>You'll recall from my previous presentations that we report changes in the overall fair value of certain of our financial liabilities as economic owned credit. The tightening of our senior debt spreads led to a net increase in the fair values of these liabilities in the second quarter. This resulted in a charge to income for the period of over CHF1.2 billion. The remaining cumulative life-to-date economic own credit balance at the quarter end was approximately CHF2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Now given the recent movement in our credit spreads, I'd not be surprised if there were a charge of proportional magnitude to our third quarter results. I should report that losses incurred from our own credit effects do not impact our regulatory capital.</p>
          <p>Overall expenses were just over CHF7 billion, but this total includes over a billion of charges for restructuring and goodwill impairment. We show a net income tax credit for the quarter of CHF208 million. This includes a deferred tax benefit of 371 million from the release of valuation allowances given the improved prospects for our operating performance in future periods.</p>
          <p>The bottom half of the slide shows the adjusted pre-tax profit for the quarter for each of our divisions. We add back three charges for own credit, restructuring and goodwill impairment. Adjusting for these items, the firm made an underlying profit before tax of just under CHF1 billion, its first such profit for eight quarters.</p>
          <p>I should probably explain the goodwill impairment charge. It relates to Pactual and is in addition to the gross charge of 631 million that we took in first quarter. The charge arose as a result of the appreciation of the Brazilian real and the depreciation of U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc. It was incurred primarily by the divisions in the same proportion as the charge reported in the Q1 numbers, but in keeping with our policy of charging foreign exchange translation effects to Group treasury, these amounts were recharged to the Corporate Center by the services to and from line in the divisional accounts.</p>
          <p>Upon the closing of the sale of Pactual, we expect to realize an additional charge of the order of magnitude of around CHF300 million, predominantly again attributable to foreign exchange translation effects. This amount will depend on the exchange rate, the actual exchange rate at completion. And the amount is accumulated in equity over the holding period of Pactual, and its release will therefore have no impact at all on our regulatory capital.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the quarter-on-quarter change in the revenues by business activities. The most stable sources of revenue, fee and commission income and interest margin, improved slightly to a total of about CHF5.8 billion. The most encouraging development came in the net income from trading businesses line, which improved by over 2.5 &#x2013; CHF2.25 billion, largely because of a significant reduction in write-downs and losses from the FICC trading books.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we communicated 8,000 job cuts to affected staff across the bank. The chart at the top of the slide shows the change in the number of staff on a full time equivalent basis employed with the bank over the quarter. A significant proportion of the job losses did not affect monthly personnel costs and were not reflected in our head count disclosures in the second quarter. They will begin to affect our results in the coming quarters. In Switzerland, for example, we are running a program we call COACH in which redeployment opportunities are sought for staff who have lost their jobs as a result of our business restructuring.</p>
          <p>The chart at the bottom of the slide therefore shows our broad expectations for the development of the head count by division. The actual number will inevitably vary for a whole range of factors, including voluntary departures and our selective hiring program. We do expect, though, that the overall group head count target of 67,000 full-time equivalents will be met in 2010, and this takes into account the sale of Pactual.</p>
          <p>The Group's operating expenses grew in the quarter. We show you on this slide the effects of adjusting for goodwill impairment and restructuring charges in both Q1 and Q2. Even on an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew by 6%, reflecting an increase in underlying personnel expenses of almost CHF0.5 billion. The main factor was an increase in the rate of bonus accrual quarter-on-quarter by around 80%. This recognizes in part competitive pressure in the market for talent in most of our business segments.</p>
          <p>Non-personnel expenses fell by 173 million quarter-on-quarter reflecting the impact of our ongoing focus on cost discipline. We're confident that we're on track to bring our fixed cost base down to the announced annual run rate target level of less than CHF20 billion by 2010. In fact in Q2, our run rate was only slightly above that level.</p>
          <p>Net new money flows in the quarter were negative in our three wealth and asset management divisions. In Wealth Management and Swiss Bank, we saw a shift in the pattern of outflows, which slowed overall. The situation with Swiss clients was much more stable. Almost all of the net outflows came from international clients, although even here it varies by segment or region. For example, in Asia, as you heard, we've seen net inflows in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Most of the outflows have been seen in European locations. In the international client segment in the first half of the year, we lost 850 client advisors, many of these as a consequence of our redundancy programs. This will remain a factor for the coming quarters, as many of the staff affected by redundancy have not yet left the bank.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management Americas we saw a similar picture. Here we saw the financial advisor population decrease by 821 during the second quarter, of which 632 were involuntary leavers. The pace of FA recruitment slowed markedly in Q2. In Q3 we expect the financial advisor population to be affected by two announced disposals: the branch sale to Stifel Nicolaus, which will involve the transfer of approximately 320 advisors, and the sale of Pactual which affects around 40 advisors. The division was also affected by the usual seasonal impact of withdrawals in April for clients to meet their local tax payment obligations.</p>
          <p>In Global Asset Management, net money outflows were CHF17.1 billion compared with 7.7 in Q1. But excluding money market flows, the situation improved with net new money outflows slowing to 7.8 billion from 17.9 in the first quarter. Net outflows relating to the Wealth Management channels were CHF13 billion.</p>
          <p>To put client flows into perspective, the chart shows the movement in client invested asset balances from quarter end to quarter end. And these balances, remember, are an important driver of our recurring fee income.</p>
          <p>Invested assets were up 3% across the board, primarily driven by strong investment performance. The appreciation of the Swiss franc, particularly against the U.S. dollar, had a dampening effect on the increase.</p>
          <p>Turning to risk exposure, as we've already said, we made significant progress in reducing our risk positions and the volatility of our revenues in the second quarter. During the quarter and into July, we commuted insurance contracts in the form of credit default swaps with three monoline insurers into cash receipts. In each case, the contract referenced collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, that in turn referenced mortgage-backed securities. We now have unfettered access to these CDOs and are currently in the process of liquidating them.</p>
          <p>The net exposure we have today to these RMBS CDOs wrapped by monolines is less than $400 million. The remainder of our exposure to the monoline sector is largely under negative basis trades, where for the most part we protected long positions in collateralized loan obligations by credit default swaps. Our overall net exposure to the monoline sector as a whole is now reduced to $3.2 billion. Our exposure to leveraged loans is now cut down by &#x2013; down to $2.6 billion and is no longer considered a risk concentration of concerned management.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that in the first quarter of 2008, we reclassified certain of our positions in the trading account to loans and receivables. In Q2, the fair value of these positions increased by CHF1.3 billion. This increase is only reflected in our P&amp;L over time as an increase in the effective interest rate earned on those assets.</p>
          <p>In the Investment Bank, we reduced our gross lending portfolio last quarter by 18% to CHF144 billion. Of that, our banking products exposure, net of provisions and the application of credit hedges, fell to around CHF47 billion, 31 billion of which is investment grade.</p>
          <p>In Switzerland, our unsecured loan balances fell to 17.9 billion at the end of June, and over half of this exposure is of investment grade. We've provided detailed information on our credit books in the risk management section in our quarterly report.</p>
          <p>Turning to risk-weighted assets; risk-weighted assets came down in the quarter by CHF30 billion, this was despite a headwind from adverse credit rating migration that actually added nearly 10 billion for the total in the quarter. So the gross reduction of 40 billion is therefore a more accurate measure of our de-risking efforts. And this involved such things as selling down credit exposures, commuting our monoline exposures and further improving the recognition of CDAs as risk mitigants.</p>
          <p>Now in July, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published its proposed enhancements to the Basel II market risk framework. And as I flagged at the last quarterly presentation, the changes are likely to lead to at least a doubling of the risk-weighted assets that represent our market risks.</p>
          <p>I still stand by the figure of approximately 60 billion as the number I gave you that you might expect to see in respect of our market risk post implementation of these changes, which are mandated by the end of Q4 2010.</p>
          <p>This is more than a doubling of the CHF22 billion that you can see on the chart in respect to the second quarter this year, but the fact is that we had an unsustainably lower amount of value at risk in Q2 as we've set about building an FICC business for the future.</p>
          <p>Now of the total RWA balance of CHF248 billion, just over CHF160 billion relate to the Investment Bank. And of that sum, over CHF50 billion relate to positions that we hold in relation to legacy businesses that we've exited or are in the process of exiting.</p>
          <p>An example of positions of this will be our auction rate securities holdings, our loan to the RMBS Opportunities Master Fund managed by BlackRock, the RLN programs and our remaining monoline wrapped negative basis trades. And over time, there CHF50 billion of RWAs will reduce to zero.</p>
          <p>Operational risk, currently an equivalent 46 billion of risk-weighted assets, also has some scope to come down over time. So on a net basis taking just those three main drivers into account; there is still further scopes to reduce RWAs by at least 10% over time.</p>
          <p>Here's our usual chart that traces the movement in regulatory capital ratios from quarter-end to quarter-end. Tier 1 capital increased to 32.6 billion at the end of June. Most of the IFRS loss for the quarter was reversed to exclude the effective goodwill impairment and the charge for own credit. The increase in the quarter is therefore largely attributable to the equity placing that we completed at the end of June.</p>
          <p>Given the significant reduction in RWAs, the Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 13.2% on a reported basis and pro-forma for the announced Pactual sale, the Tier 1 ratio is 13.7%.</p>
          <p>This slide in addition just shows the Group's consolidated core Tier 1 ratio for the past three quarters and pro-forma for the sale of Pactual, where the pro-forma ratio is 10.7%.</p>
          <p>This slide shows you the translation of our balance sheet as presented in the accounts under IFRS to the adjusted basis that's used by FINMA to calculate its leverage ratio. And you can see that the average adjusted assets decreased by approximately CHF140 billion compared with Q1. And during Q2, we agreed with FINMA that we could further adjust the assets for the netting of cash collateral that we receive on positive replacement balances under derivatives contracts. And so we've restated the Q1 reported number, which was originally 2.56%. At 3.5% at quarter end and obviously even higher on a pro-forma basis, our leverage ratio comfortably exceeds the 3% group minimum level set for FINMA for achievement by 1st of January 2013.</p>
          <p>This slide shows you the breakdown of our funded balance sheet. Our loan to deposit ratio is just over 70%, with the excess of deposits over loans totaling some CHF130 billion. We have excess collateral, much of which we can use for funding purposes, totaling almost CHF200 billion. During the quarter, we continued the shift of our funding away from money market paper and interbank debt towards much more long-term debt and secured funding.</p>
          <p>Now turning to divisional performance, the profits in Wealth Management and Swiss Bank held up reasonably well in the context of challenging circumstances. They rose 16% quarter-on-quarter if we exclude the CHF321 million of restructuring charges incurred in Q2.</p>
          <p>Total operating income increased marginally to just over CHF2.9 billion, however recurring income did fall 5% of so to 2.2 billion. In the pure Wealth Management segment of international clients, the gross margin fell slightly by 2 basis points to 87 basis points, 64 of which were recurring in nature and 23 transaction-related.</p>
          <p>The margin erosion was partly the result of lower interest income on lower credit balances. However, the key factor was a general shift away from higher margin products and discretionary mandates. We're tackling this in a number of ways, including by reviewing our product set And we already see early signs that mandate volumes are stabilizing.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe that margins have stabilized, although we'd expect seasonally slightly lower transaction volumes in the third quarter. We continue to apply rigorous controls to G&amp;A expenses, setting aside 321 million restructuring charges. Underlying expenses were 8% lower than in the first quarter. Personnel expenses would have been 9% lower, reflecting a reduction in head count by over 1100 in the quarter. And as I already mentioned. the division's credit losses remained low, amounting to only CHF20 million net of recoveries.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management Americas reported a pre-tax loss of CHF221 million after restructuring charges of 152 million and a 17 million special assessment from the FDIC, the latter being in line with that levied against all other FDIC insured depository institutions. The loss in Q2 compares with a loss of 35 million in Q1, which included a CHF19 million goodwill impairment charge in relation to Pactual.</p>
          <p>Operating income declined 3% quarter-on-quarter in Swiss franc terms. Recurring income fell 4% to 787 million. Managed account fees were higher, but the effect was more than offset by lower net interest income due to lower spreads and the impact of the additional FDIC assessment. The proportion of total income represented by recurring income was steady at 58%.</p>
          <p>On an underlying basis, operating expenses increased 1% quarter-on-quarter in Swiss franc terms. Excluding the CHF71 million of the restructuring charge that relates to head count reductions, personnel expenses were flat quarter-on-quarter. However, in dollar terms personnel expenses were 6% higher, largely reflecting higher revenue base compensation for the financial advisors, higher incentive compensation accruals and increased expenses relating to hiring. And these were partially offset by the cost savings related to staff head count reductions that began to come through in the latter part of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Underlying non-personnel expenses grew by 3% due to higher IT costs and legal expenses. In Swiss franc terms, the gross margin on invested assets fell by 6 basis points to 80 basis points in the quarter. The decrease comprised four basis points fall in the recurring income margin to 46 and a two basis point decline in the non-recurring margin to 34, but in dollar terms the margins were unchanged quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Global Asset Management reported a profit for the quarter of 82 million francs. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge of CHF191 million in Q1 and restructuring charges in both quarters, the pre-tax profit in Q2 would have been CHF103 million, which is down 30 million of 22% on the adjusted first quarter result.</p>
          <p>Operating income rose 6% to CHF530 million, primarily due to the higher performance fees in the Institutional segment, mainly in alternative and quantitative investments. Wholesale revenues declined marginally. Personnel costs rose significantly quarter-on-quarter from 226 million in the first quarter to 309 million in Q2, mainly reflecting higher accruals for performance based compensation.</p>
          <p>Fixed personnel costs in Q2 are not representative of those to be expected in the second half of 2009. Only around half of the head count reductions communicated in Q2 have yet had effect on the financials.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expenses fell marginally by two million to 93 million francs and the cost / income ratio was just under 80% after elimination of restructuring charges. Lower fixed personnel expenses in the second half of the year should have the effect of reducing this ratio in an otherwise steady environment.</p>
          <p>The stronger investment performance that began in 2008 in the division's major equity capabilities compared with the previous years continued in the first half of the year. Changes made to the investment teams in equities and fixed income capabilities are now showing good results, and a large number of these strategies are outperforming their benchmarks. Equity strategies saw their first quarterly net inflow since the fourth quarter of 2005.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Investment Bank. The Investment Bank reported an overall improved result, a pre-tax loss of CHF1.8 billion compared with a loss of 3.2 billion in Q1, but obviously its overall performance is still far from satisfactory. Adjusting the reported figures for disclosed economic own credit produces a pre-tax loss of CHF0.6 billion versus an adjusted loss of 3.8 billion in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenues before disclosed own credit impacts at almost CHF1.75 billion represent the best performance by the division for two years. This reflects stronger revenues in equities and IBD as well as a significant reduction in the losses on legacy risk positions in FICC. FICC's core businesses had a relatively weak quarter, which saw significant voluntary and involuntary staff turnover and management changes.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses fell 5% quarter-on-quarter on a reported basis. However, on an underlying basis, they increased by 22%, largely as a result of the significant increase in personnel expenses. These increased by almost a quarter to just under CHF1.5 billion, mainly due to higher accruals for performance related compensation and, to a lesser extent, salary increases. G&amp;A expenses fell 6% to just over CHF600 billion.</p>
          <p>I promise you this is my last slide. In IBD, total revenues increased to CHF717 million from 304 in the prior quarter  Advisory revenues were down 2% to 211 million, as activity was affected by continued slowdown in the global economy.</p>
          <p>Capital Markets, on the other hand, were up 60% to CHF771 million, with a 67% increase in ECM revenues, driven by higher follow on issuance across all regions. And a 52% increase for Debt Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>Other fee income and risk management revenues were negative 265 million, mainly attributable to mark-to-market losses from the tightening of credit spreads during the second quarter, which affected hedges taken out on our investment grade loan book.</p>
          <p>Equities had a solid quarter. Revenues increased 6% to nearly CHF1.5 billion. Revenues in cash trading rose, mainly as a result of improved commissions and trading flows in Europe. Derivative revenues were down, as increases in the Americas were offset by something of a decline in Asia Pacific, where we saw lower structured product volumes.</p>
          <p>Equity linked revenues were down, but on a strong prior quarter, despite good performance in Asia-Pacific. Prime brokerage services were up, as financing revenues benefited from spread improvements, although we did miss out on greater opportunities because of some staff departures. Revenues from exchange traded derivatives also increased. And prop revenues were positive and increased in all regions.</p>
          <p>FICC revenues on a reported basis were disappointingly still slightly negative at minus CHF59 million. Revenues from the core businesses were down significantly quarter-on-quarter at around about CHF1 billion. The contribution from credit was only marginal, as we hired in new staff to build a flow trading business. Macro was down over 40%, as revenues in FX trading fell by half on lower volumes and tighter spreads. Rates solutions too saw a significant decline in revenues following a strong first quarter. And after an exceptionally strong first quarter, emerging markets saw its operating income decline to more normal levels.</p>
          <p>The four additional factors drove the overall result. First, credit spreads on the monoline insurance sector rallied in Q2. And this enabled us to reset our credit valuation adjustments to the amounts receivable and do credit default swaps with the monolines. And this yielded gains to FICC of around about CHF 0.5 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And so the next three items make up the majority of the losses that turned core revenues of about 1 billion plus a 0.5 billion gain on the monoline exposures into an overall slightly negative net operating income line. And these are as follows:</p>
          <p>First, around half of the difference is attributable to the effect of the tightening of our credit spreads on our uncollateralized negative replacement values. Here, tighter credit spreads lead to lower discount factors, which in turn drive an increase in the liability we book for payments that we're due to make under derivatives contracts.</p>
          <p>Next, there's the effect of having reclassified certain trading positions to the loans and receivables account. Those positions are hedged by derivatives. This is similar to the effect I described just now in respect the to investment grade loans. Although the hedges may be economically effective, the reclassification left us with a short position on an IFRS accounting basis where the reclassified asset increases in fair value. The accounting short created by the quarterly loss was almost CHF350 million net of the increased effective interest income.</p>
          <p>Balance reflects losses incurred elsewhere as we effectively spent the gains we made on the monolines on de-risking other exposures in our legacy books.</p>
          <p>And so quickly to sum up, considerable progress has been made in de-risking the balance sheet and returning to profitability. Our capital levels are now high; the market's perception of our firm's creditors significantly improved, as observed in the recent tightening of our credit spreads. We've stabilized our financial position and laid the foundations to continue the process to rebuild client trust and our reputation. And we acknowledge that this will take some time to complete.</p>
          <p>With that, I conclude my presentation on the second quarter results and now hand you over to Philip.</p>

          <p>Okay. So I just wanted to run through how we're going to do the Q&amp;A. We're going to have two Q&amp;A sessions. We're going to do the analysts and investors first and we'll do that with the investors and analysts in the room here and then the online. We've got a number of questions pending online. And then we're going to have a set for, after a short break, we'll have a set for a media session in English and German which we'll be holding next door in the next door auditorium.</p>
          <p>So if we could just start with analyst and investor questions here in the room. If there aren't any immediately, we'll go to the online, but if we could just see if anybody would have any questions. Please the microphone here. We'll just take some questions here in the room first.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. Teresa Nielsen from Bank Vontobel. I was wondering if you could explain, you had a mandatory convertible note from the Swiss government where you were mark-to-marketed in the first quarter? Do you have any impact from this in the second quarter? And my second question is on Pactual, will there be any impact on the third quarter? You were announcing a potential charge of about 500 million. Is that going to impact the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I take the first one only on the MTN? You're absolutely right that instinctively, given that our share price increased over the quarter, you should have seen a mark-to-market loss, ironically, on the call option that's embedded in the MTN, the so-called booster option.</p>
          <p>The share price is an important determinant, and that did have an impact of creating a mark-to-market loss on that derivative. However, a countervailing impact was from our volatility of the share price, which significantly reduced over the quarter. And as a consequence of the contraction in the volatility, there was an effect the other way. And the net effect was hardly anything at all. So it was driven mainly by the decrease in the volatility of our shares, offsetting the impact of the increase in our shares. So you're absolutely right to raise it. It's no longer an item that's material at all to our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any further questions in the room from analysts or investors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry; you had a question on Pactual. Yeah, the goodwill impairment charge that we took in Q2 is effectively a release of the foreign currency translation reserve that we held against Pactual from the time we bought it and it accrued over the holding period. It was driven only really by foreign exchange movements. There was no reassessment of the value of that business. The only impact that was not related to foreign exchange currency movements is the profit in the quarter from that business which accrues to the purchaser. So that's effectively taken out of the divisions that earned it. And you see that in the accounts. But otherwise it was effectively a release of that foreign currency translation account.</p>
          <p>And as I said, at the end of June, June/July, the balance &#x2013; the remaining balance on that account was around about CHF300 million. And on completion, that account gets washed out through the P&amp;L. So had we completed in Q2, the much bigger number would have been washed through the P&amp;L. The fact is we went through a quarter end, we had to remark-to-market because of the businesses available for sale. And that comes through as a goodwill impairment charge that reduced the amount on the foreign currency translation account in equity. The amount that we have to wash through on completion just depends on the real, the Swiss franc and the dollar exchange rates at the time of completion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kilian Meier, NZB. It's on outflows in Global Asset Management. Are these driven by regulatory or compliance concerns by institutional investors as well, or are they attributed to other factors? That would be the first question. And the second question would be on client advisors in Wealth Management and the Swiss bank, can you quantify which percentage of those are unwanted or regretted leavers, or is that secret?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the outflows, they are certainly in Asset Management, especially some institutions which have restored their funds mainly in the U.S., and because of the case which we have with the IRS. And so you will find institutions who on reputational reasons or on reputational grounds will either not invest, cannot invest because their charter says so or will move to other providers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a follow-up on that. Do you expect that to reverse or at least stop once the issue with the IRS is settled?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly think that will reverse as soon as we have improved our reputation, as soon as we have settled open issues. It takes some time. It takes a few months that these things are forgotten and/or put in the right light and how we behave &#x2013; how the bank is behaving. And so, yes, as far as the money, I think we we'll reverse at a later stage. On client advisors and leavers, John, do you have anything to add there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I made a point that we did have this redundancy program. The number of client advisors who actually left the bank was relatively small in Q2, depending on the jurisdiction in which the client advisor works. That means that they have not yet gone to another competitor, if that's what they choose to do after they leave our bank. And so the impact on net money flows is yet difficult to gauge. But I think it's a slight majority of the client advisors and Wealth Management in Swiss Bank who left in the first half of the year, left as a consequence of our redundancy programs. But there were obviously some regretted leavers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. If I may, a few questions. The first one is regarding fixed income. In your discussion on a top down level, what are the three issues that are key for you to turn around the fixed income business? The second question is about the 20 billion of cost base run rate, what kind of revenue assumption is that underlying? And the third one is regarding risk management and are we at the end of the de-leveraging process balance sheet risk-weighted asset value at risk at this point? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fixed income, I would say the three issues are people, people and people, what concerns our fixed income at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you go in a bit more detail in respect what areas are affected and how you mitigate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we do not have especially strong areas in the fixed income market where we can say we are market dominant and we have to rebuild fixed income, which we are doing at the moment with new management, and that will take some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does that mean new hires, that we see net new hires into the fixed income business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will see new hires. We have hired new management and will continue to hire in the management area. Overall, I think we probably still will reduce the head count slightly.</p>

          <p>The cost base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost base, Kian, it's not really predicated. We like to make as many revenues as we can. What we did say is that we couldn't control revenues necessarily, but we can control our cost base much more. And we thought that if we brought the cost base down below an annual rate of CHF20 billion, then the revenue potential of the company should then turn us into a profit making position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the de-leveraging question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, and de-leveraging, you mentioned a number of facets there. I think on value at risk, as I said, it was rather unsustainably low in Q2. And that's partly because, for example, in credit trading, we were effectively on the sidelines. Now I would expect that to go back up to the sorts of levels it was before. I think in Q1, the market risk, risk weighted assets were 28 billion. They came down to 22. Our value at risk, which we disclosed in the quarterly report, is half or even a lower proportion of that of our major competitors.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross balance sheet, the derivative replacement values will come down unless something strange happens to volatility and it goes up again. So I would expect replacement values on both the positive and negative side to continue to come down.</p>
          <p>The loan books will probably come down, because our clients are not asking for credit to the extent they used to. But we showed you on a slide, we have a tremendous amount of liquidity and we need either to put that to work or retire it, because at the moment it's still either not earning any spread or our big liquidity buffer's still earning a negative spread.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how &#x2013; what was the impact of the liquidity buffer in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we said we would bring it down by 20% or that we just had, and we had. We've not yet brought it down by the further 20% or so that we flagged. And that's because we're still discussing the right timing in which to do that. But there is still a negative to carry it. It's come down, the spread's come down, so the cost in Q2 was less than half what it was in Q1, but it still a position that we're running that we would rather not run for the long-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I may, one more. Fixed income. When do we think &#x2013; when do you think the rebuild of fixed income will be completed. Is this a six month process, one year, two year process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is more likely a six to 12 month process. These things do not happen overnight, as you know, and considering where we are coming from, that will take a little bit longer. So of the six and 12 months, we probably have two to three months already behind us. So it has a nine months, probably.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Huw van Steenis, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. First question, when you compare to, your experience to Credit Suisse, where you've already had a huge success of one firm revenues, if you look at UBS do you see material upside from cross-selling within the Group or is it slightly too early to say?</p>
          <p>I think secondly, for John, just to go back to the liquidity pool, given how much credit spreads have tightened in the quarter, would you have to actually take more, materially more, credit risk to actually get a positive carry, or are you, do you still think actually at this point we probably won't see any real mitigation in the liquidity pool drag.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, just to understand in terms of total balance sheet size, if risk-weighted assets can come down a further 10%, should I also assume that total assets could also potentially shrink another 10% from here and then we start to stabilize? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's an integration. I have to say, that in UBS we do have one brand which is a good thing to start with, but unfortunately no integration whatsoever. So we can look forward to substantial additional revenues integrating our divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Huw, on the liquidity buffer, I think the natural preference would be to retire the buffer; I take down the liabilities as well as the assets, because borrowing long-dated liabilities and investing them in high yielding assets is a place we've been before, but it isn't really banking business. And so much the preference is to get rid of both sides of the balance sheet when we feel that it's appropriate to do that.</p>
          <p>On RWA reduction, I did &#x2013; perhaps I wasn't careful enough to flag that the 10% reduction was really just from the three items I mentioned. Obviously, if we continue to reduce our credit books, which appears to be the way the market is moving us, because in a recessionary environment people are not drawing down credit to the extent they were, then that would obviously also have a positive impact to bring down the risk-weighted assets, but I didn't want to give you the impression that we're going to come down too far and excite you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if they came down by another 25 or so off the 250, roughly, that maybe where you might expect us to be in future periods. On the balance sheet overall, the elephant in the room still is the positive replacement values on the asset side, which is still 540 billion. And they are still largely driven by two things. One is the historical shift in &#x2013; the secular shift in interest rate's down, which causes replacement values as you change the discount rate. And the other is volatility, especially in foreign exchange markets and in interest markets, where just big replacement values arise because we've written a simple interest rates swap, which is otherwise not very risky, but you're paying out very high fixed rates or you're due to receive very high fixed rates, and that increases the debt or the credit you have to book on the balance sheet. So over time they do replace. Interest rates may not stay as low as they are right now and volatility should come down. So the trend there should be that that number comes down fairly significantly; maybe not by 211 billion per quarter, but at least by a fairly sizable chunk over the next couple of quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have a couple of questions on the Wealth Management side of the business. First, there were some headlines on the screens a couple of days ago that Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel said that you've explored a disposal of the Wealth Management Americas business, but have decided to hold it to the next three years. Given the sort of uncertainty that creates in a people business, it was a bit of a curious quote. Sometimes these are misquoted. So I was wondering if you could explain what you meant by that?</p>
          <p>And then I want to come to some of your comments on the departures. I just wanted to check, did you say in Wealth Management and Swiss Bank that slightly more than half the departures were involuntary? I think that's what you said. And maybe you can provide us some insight into Q3 developments given the time lag between when people resign and when they actually sort of depart the bank? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on Wealth Management U.S., I didn't make any quote whatsoever. So that was a pure invention and I can assure that I wouldn't make a quote like that either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Wealth Management client advisors, we gave you the net number. Now we said in the international segment the first half we lost 850 client advisors. That's obviously a net, as we still hire some people and we lose some voluntarily and then we had a redundancy program. But of the net number, the redundancy program accounted for more than half, but of the net number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we showed you a chart with the head count reductions. Some of those remaining in Wealth Management and Swiss Bank would be client advisors. The ones in jurisdictions were as a consequence have been made redundant, they have not yet left the bank and could be redeployed within the bank. But we would expect, yes, in the next few quarters, as I've said, more client advisors to be leaving. If they then find jobs at competitors, that could have a delayed effect on them taking away some client assets from the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just sort of broadly, when do you expect to actually see growth in client advisors? Is that a 2010 issue or who knows?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. I've got a question and a clarification, please. The clarification is I thought it's very interesting, Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel, you suggested that the UBS businesses were not very well integrated and there could be a lot of benefits going forward. Because I think the previous management had suggested that the close integration of the businesses had added about 15% of the value of the business in terms of revenue and cost and capital synergies. So how do we square those two views with the previous management's assessment of the integration, perhaps a little optimistic?</p>
          <p>And the second question I have is about the balance sheet and the FINMA leverage ratio of 3.7%. It's obviously well ahead of the current target of 3%, but with the SNB suggesting that it might want to move to a 5% target, I mean, do you see a risk of that happening? Might it happen soon? Could you get there in a hurry? Or do you think that they're happy with the status quo? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>On integration, I can only tell you what I found and what I'm looking at. And so I don't know what previous management said or on what kind of basis it said. There might have been something which they &#x2013; I'm guessing now, which they might think was integration in a way and mentioned that to you. I know at the times and that another bank was accused of copying UBS at integration, but looking as things are now, I don't know, I would say that comment was definitely wrong at the time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure we have much insight into the views of the SNB and where they want the FINMA leverage ratio to go. It's actually set by the FINMA, but they set a minimum of 3% for us at the Group level. And we've now comfortably achieved that. As I've mentioned, the balance sheet is still trending down a little bit, partly through some technical factors. And as we change our approach to trading, you'll the velocity of flow through the balance sheet is much higher than it used to be. We used to store a lot of things on the balance sheet and that's no longer our strategy. So generally speaking, the balance sheet will continue to trend down. And as we hopefully build profit and capital in future periods, we should grow that ratio. But the implementation date is 1st of January 2013, which is a long, long time from now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had a couple of questions. Firstly, I wondered if you could make any comments on the exposure draft on IAS-39 released in July and whether you see any prospects of any assets being reclassified back to the trading book?</p>
          <p>As a second question, I wondered if I could ask on balance sheet contraction, seems to mostly be happening in the derivatives book and not much shrinkage in your repo book. Is that the timing issue, where you're trying to pick your time that you mentioned earlier or are you still running quite a big match book, perhaps to support your institutional business which I know is very important to you?</p>
          <p>And then a final question, you mentioned that prime brokerage revenues were up, but I wondered if you could comment on how you see your prime brokerage business. It can be quite balance sheet intensive. There are some other banks out there that have probably made a better job of gaining market share in that area, right, for the last six months. Do you still see yourself as, a bank that's attempting to compete at the top level in prime brokerage and if so, how? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I take the IAS-39? When we transferred assets from the trading book to the loans and receivables account, we did so on the important proviso that the only assets we transferred out were ones that related to trading desks that we no longer had. So these were positions we no longer traded because we no longer had traders, and we couldn't actively &#x2013; proactively risk manage. And so the chances of us taking things from the accrual book and putting them back in the trading book are next to nil.</p>
          <p>We are, however, allowed under the relaxation of the rules to sell down some of the reclassified positions and the monolines were a case and point where we've not sold, necessarily, the positions, but we've commuted it into a different position which we are then free to sell. And you'll see the movement in one of the tables in the accounts on the reclassified assets, and they have come down, partly as a consequence of some sales.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On prime brokerage, we think we have to be in that business. It is complimentary to our equity trading and I think we cannot reduce it to a size where it isn't competitive in the market anymore. Our strategy there, actually we are also aware that it is balance sheet intensive. That's why we are becoming more selective on the clients we offer prime brokerage to and to keep balance sheet under control, to keep our risks under control, prime brokerage has risks and, but still have &#x2013; are competing in that market and so concentrating on bigger clients and on names we like to have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the repo book, there's not a simple answer to that. I think you may mean the reverse repo balances of over 200 billion. The main use to which we put reverse repos is a deployment of our excess liquidity. We buy extremely high quality government bonds and then we reverse repo them with central banks. And so that's one way we have of managing our liquidity and keeping it safe. On the match book, the repo position which is under 100 billion is actually also a way we fund our trading books through the repo markets. So the match book is now significantly lower than it was two years ago.</p>
          <p>It is still a business we're in and we do, you're right, we do need to be in it for our institutional clients. It keeps us alive and well in the funding markets, but it's not a core business. And with the liquidity position we have, we need to use reverse repos as a form of investment.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Fiona here. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, fixed income, the slide 19, I still don't think I totally understand the losses on DVAs on NRVs. I don't know if you could talk about whether this is just a one-off or if it could go on. And also on the one billion, you said it's weak revenues. I'm trying to understand what Mr. Gr&#xFC;bel has talked in terms of rebuilding the fixed income business. Does that mean the ambition is to have the run rate to be more than four billion annualized. If you could just talk about, also, what that one billion is in, what the constituent parts are?</p>
          <p>And then the other issue on the clients' advisors. I think you said there's still 2,000 people still to go in Wealth Management and Swiss Banking. How many of those are client advisors? And then the third question is in terms of the cost number, are you telling us that the bonus accrual is around 3.5 billion to four billion, and could that number go up further given competition? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I have a go at the DVA on NRVs? The NRVs, for those of you who are not familiar with the concept, this is a way of booking in our balance sheet under IFRS. The amounts we have to pay to counter-parties under swap contracts and other derivatives. And the way that this is held in our accounts is that it's effectively a discounted present value of future payments we have to make, under a swap contract is easiest to explain.</p>
          <p>There are some products which, where it is the market expected practice, to use the counter-party's credit spread as a means of valuing those contracts. So by no means are all of our 500 plus billion of NRVs measured on this way. It's market practice in many, many derivatives to close out contracts and to trading contracts on a LIBOR curve alone, but there are some types, particularly in the credit markets, where the derivative is valued by using a discount rate that includes a premium for the company's credit spread. Now because our credit spread has come in over the quarter, the discount rate we're using goes down. And as you'll remember from your school mathematics, when the discount rate is lower, the present value goes higher. And from your 101 accounting when you increase the liability and nothing else happens, you create a loss. And we said that about half of the 1.5 billion of negative impacts on FICC in the quarter were from that effect alone.</p>
          <p>And then the other two was this funny accounting short where we have reclassified assets, but it's still a derivative hedge, that marks-to-market. And their credit markets -- credit spreads tighten, so the derivative lost value, but we didn't change the value of the reclassified asset because it's a loan and you can't change it's value. And so we took a loss on the hedge, even though economically the hedge still affects it against the credit risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I just ask, because obviously no other banks mentioned this? Is this just something completely specific to accounting at UBS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's been in &#x2013; I think it's Note 11B for the some time. The American broker-dealers actually disclose the &#x2013; they break out the valuation of derivatives on the negative replacement side by reference to their credit spreads. They don't then show the negative replacement value, unfortunately. They show a netted value on the asset side only. So their balance sheet always looks much, much smaller than ours on the European IFRS basis. Where ours shows this enormous balance of 540 on one side and 520 on the other side, and the Americans would show not quite the difference because you can't net off all &#x2013; they're not necessarily all hedges of each other, but they would show a much lower number. In our case, that's the number we'd show in our FINMA adjusted assets. The Swiss GAAP number's very similar to the American GAAP number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But from a P&amp;L perspective, if credit spreads come in again, this will continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, although you can't assume it to &#x2013; in fact it's not a direct parallel to owned credit. Because remember, economic owned credit is too impacted, the impact of credit spread, but it's also the change in fair values attributable to other factors. And we only really show our financial liabilities validate fair values through the profit and loss account in relation to, it's predominantly our structured products. So for the structured note we've issued, for example, references the FTSE 100. When the FTSE 100 goes up, then our liability under that structured note goes up and therefore we make a loss on own credit, even it's nothing to do with our own credit. It's simply because the thing that the structured note references has gone up in value. Likewise if the FTSE 100 or the pound-sterling fell against our referenced currency, then we would take a profit.</p>
          <p>In Q2, we said the impact within the 12, 13 or whatever it was of own credit, the impact relating only to our credit spread was a good 950 million of that. It's shown in the IFRS disclosures in note 11. So a relatively small proportion, 250 or so, relates to the underlying instruments that are referenced and about 950 relates to our credit spread. In that derivative about the DVA, it's all to do with our credit spread, but actually relatively few of our derivatives are priced that way because it's not normally the market practice. In a simple interest rate SWAP, for example, between banks, you would just close the things normally at LIBOR and you would never reference either counter parties credit spread. Also on negative replacement values, I have to stress it's uncollateralized. And this bizarre phenomenon where if suddenly a derivative becomes collateralized, you having had it in the pool of derivatives that you counted the DVA on, it comes out of the pool and as a consequence the liability falls when you make a profit.</p>
          <p>So you have these very, very odd phenomena that relate to that. So people don't like disclosing it because it's even more difficult then own credit to understand. But it is an important factor in the carrying value of the NRVs and I just thought it was helpful to explain to you, not as an excuse because there is no excuse for not making a profit, but it was reason why the NRVs fell in value, I'm sorry, the NRVs went up in value and therefore we had a corresponding loss.</p>

          <p>On the rebuilding of fixed income, we did have management losses over the last month. We also made new hires. The revenue of one billion this quarter or last quarter was I would think a low point. As such, we certainly aim for higher revenues than that on unequal markets, especially in markets as we had in the last quarter. We had virtually nothing -- no revenues from credit rating, which was the biggest performer in the last quarter. And these are kind of areas we are rebuilding and have to rebuild and become competitive again. So, yes, we should see higher revenues going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple of questions. Firstly, coming back to the DVA loss, if you're taking a DVA loss this quarter, is it reasonable to think you've booked fairly sizable DVA gains in previous quarters and if so, could you disclose the, give us the cumulative DVA gain. And also could you clarify whether those DVA gains and losses are excluded from capital in the same way that the own debt gains and the losses are? Second question is just on the portfolio businesses. Maybe if you could comment whether you are happy with the portfolio businesses as it stands or whether you would look to make further adjustments going forward if opportunities arose?</p>
          <p>And then a third question , on the &#x2013; I think you've referred to in the process of legacy credit arbitrage portfolio and mentioned the billion of losses in the first quarter. Could you just highlight how that links into the 400 million of legacy risk positions in the second quarter out of the same portfolio? And maybe you could give little bit more details on just what exactly that portfolio consists of, how large it is, what kind of losses we could expect to going forward if the de-risking continues? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the technical point of this DVA, it would have influenced the carrying value of the liabilities in prior quarters. The number that we carry as sort of implicit life-to-date DVA is much, much lower than the own credit. The reversal in Q2 was quite exceptional, which is one of the reasons why we've mentioned it. And it doesn't, importantly &#x2013; it's important to note that it does not move in line with the own credit because it attaches to different types of products. But you're right, there would have been to an extent because we're using our own credit spread when we value these things. We value lots of things on the balance sheet. There would have been an impact from the widening of our credit spreads. The DVA is not separately disclosed and it's not therefore an item that is excluded from the capitalization ratios that we calculate for the FINMA, but that's standard I think with all of the European banks at least and I think the American banks too. So it was a deduction from capital in Q2.</p>

It was over 400 million in the quarter. And it wasn't in any particular book, it was some of its marking down positions, some of its actually selling, so a part of that big de-risking exercise did involve incurring some losses on the way.

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everybody. Three quick questions, first of all, a straight forward accounting one. John just to confirm that the goodwill impairments that go through Asset Management and the Investment Bank, just comes straight out through the from and to services charge into the Corporate Center. Is 100% of that the case or broadly 100%? Second question is on the international outflows in Wealth Management. Could you give us a little bit more flavor as to where that has occurred? And can you perhaps talk about given how strong your balance sheet is now, how much of that you attribute to the inevitable disruption from the restructuring you're going through with the Wealth Management unit as opposed to how much is reputational? And perhaps talk about what you think the outlook might be from that perspective in the next two quarters?</p>
          <p>And then finally on your two stronger suits within Investment Banking, clearly I think although a performance by Investment Banking itself, Equities looks a little bit moderate, should we say, particularly when you compare the performance to your biggest competitors in the second quarter? And just perhaps talk about what you can do there to get back to your leading position in that market, not just in terms of perhaps the volumes, but in terms of the revenues? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the technical goodwill point, the answer is, yes, it does go back out through the services to and from. The one slight proviso is that the other impact, as I mentioned, not just currency translation, is a technical impact relating to the profit that Pactual made in the quarter which we don't keep, so that goes back out through that line as well. And that goes proportional to the division that actually made the profit as opposed to the spread of goodwill that we had in the first quarter. But by and large you're right. It all goes back out through the services to and from line.</p>

And so our best hopes are that in the fourth quarter we look better on revenues in comparison with other banks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have a question on the tax rate adjusted for this tax benefit that would have been the tax payment. And you guided for actually no tax payments for the full year or no change. Do you still stick to this?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. I got the question. Well, one thing we dearly like to do is pay lots of tax on big profits, so it's not an aspiration of ours not to pay tax. There were two big items in the quarter. One was the uptick in our performance enabled us to reverse the provisions they release with taking deferred tax assets in the first quarter. So that was a re-credit of that number. And you're right, the difference between the net credit we showed of 208 or whatever it is is basically tax paid. And it's tax paid predominantly in Asia, where we're still very profitable in jurisdictions other than the U.S. and Switzerland where we have these losses go forward. So it's generally tax payable in jurisdictions other than U.S., somewhat U.K. and Switzerland.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would be your forecast? A similar thing assuming no tax payments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's an indirect way of asking for a profit forecast of sales; can you answer that question? But we would expect to pay tax or reserve tax for profits and our Group rate does remain at around about 22%, but obviously we have extremely sizeable tax losses brought forward. So the payment of tax may be deferred, but the tax rate on profit should be around about 20-22%.</p>

          <p>So that concludes the presentation. As I mentioned, we're going to have a media Q&amp;A session in the next door auditorium in a few minutes. Thank you for participating. And if you've got follow-up questions, please come through to the IR team. Thank you.</p>
