          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Viacom Earnings Release Teleconference for the Third Quarter Ended June 30, 2010. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter ended June 30. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO; and Jimmy Barge, our Head of Tax and Treasury.</p>
          <p>Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trends schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. Let me refer you to page number 2 on the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our Web site.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As all of you can well imagine, we are more than pleased to be with you today to share our perspectives on the strong results we have seen in the quarter ended June, 2010. With six months under our belt in this calendar year, day after day our confidence continues to grow as the emerging economy recovery builds.</p>
          <p>Now of course we're not all the way back, but the light is brighter than it has been for some time. Consumers are returning to the marketplace. Marketers are beginning to spend again to grow revenue to capture share and Viacom is the leading entertainment brand, strong audience connections, is now and will continue to benefit from the upswing in confidence and the upswing in spending.</p>
          <p>Under the very capable and insightful leadership of CEO, Philippe Dauman, and COO Tom Dooley, Viacom has made investing in programming its top priority. And that has kept our creative engines running strong despite the difficult environment. As a result, our film and television pipeline is deep with potential new hits and popular returning television series and film franchises, and this in turn is driving ratings; it's driving box office growth. And thanks to our continuous laser focus on enhancing the efficiency of our business, our creative success continues to translate directly to our bottom line performance.</p>
          <p>Viacom is generating strong cash flow and returning the value to shareholders as we have demonstrated by our recently initiated dividend program. Today's announcement underscores Viacom's clear advantages. What we have is this: we have a smart strategy; we have an extremely capable and gifted management team; and we have great world-class brands and assets. The success reflected in these results is, believe me, only a prelude to the bright future we see not just for this year, not just for next year, but for, indeed, many years to come.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to turn this call over to my very, very close friend, Philippe Dauman, Sr. Dauman. The ball is in your court, Philippe.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This in turn is driving strong bottom line results. Both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment businesses are delivering strong results creatively, operationally and financially.</p>
          <p>As the media industry continues to evolve and adapt to a digital environment, our singular focus on creating the compelling content our audiences desire across every screen has positioned Viacom very well. While the economic recovery appears to be progressing in fits and starts, a condition that leaves us cautious, we are encouraged by the growing momentum we see in the domestic advertising market.</p>
          <p>As I will discuss in a few moments, we completed a much stronger upfront than we experienced a year ago. This establishes a stronger base for our next fiscal year. This morning I will briefly review our financial performance and then turn to our operational results in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. Tom will provide additional detail on our progress and then we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>As we review our results this morning, Tom and I will refer to the adjusted numbers. Viacom's consolidated revenues were $3.3 billion in the June quarter, flat with the prior year's results. Media Networks generated a 6% increase in revenues on higher advertising sales and affiliate fees. This growth offset a decline in our Filmed Entertainment segment where home entertainment revenues were down substantially year-over-year, primarily due to the number and mix of titles.</p>
          <p>Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 40% to $418 million in the June quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.68, a 39% improvement over the prior year. The increase was fueled by higher operating income in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment.</p>
          <p>Our business continues to generate strong free cash flow. We had $355 million in operating free cash flow during the quarter, up from $159 million a year ago. The tremendous progress we've made in strengthening Viacom's overall financial position was further validated by the recent upgrades by two ratings agencies. And last month, we were very pleased to deliver a regular quarterly cash dividend to our stockholders. We also look forward to resuming our stock buyback program, which we expect to commence early in the first quarter of our new fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to our Media Networks. Keeping our finger on the pulse of the ever-changing entertainment taste of our audiences is what makes our cable network so successful. Our ability to tap into and reflect the interests of varied and highly valued demographics attracts marketers from a multitude of industries. Investing in and developing new content, that is how we continue to build strong global brands. That is how we broaden the reach of those brands and that is how we position each Viacom network as an invaluable nexus between our marketing partners and the consumers they want to connect with.</p>
          <p>The overall advertising market continues to strengthen. That trend, along with a boost from stronger ratings at several of our networks, pushed our domestic ad sales up 4% versus a year ago and up sequentially over the 1% growth we achieved in our March quarter. Worldwide ad revenues increased 4% in the June quarter as well. The domestic growth came from a stronger scatter market, and while it is still early in the current quarter, we are expecting to see further sequential improvement in our domestic ad sales growth.</p>
          <p>With regard to the advertising up front, we went into it this year in a much stronger position than a year ago. Our ratings were up at key networks and we had new and improved programming slates to share with potential marketing partners. As a result, up front pricing across our networks increased mid to high single digits and we sold just over 50% of our volume, a low double-digit increase over last year.</p>
          <p>Our Nickelodeon Kids and Family group had a strong Kids up front with games across several major categories. This year, we were able to secure a substantial increase in non-endemic or adult categories such as insurance and automotive. This shift reflects the fact that Nickelodeon is now firmly established as a co-viewing destination with more parents watching shows on Nickelodeon along-side their kids.</p>
          <p>Our slate revenues continue to grow, primarily driven by rate increases in the past quarter. The multi-year nature of our Slate relationships will provide us with steady revenue growth for many years to come. In addition, we're continuing to roll out our high definition channels and extend distribution of our standard definition channels to smaller affiliates.</p>
          <p>Now let me take a few minutes to review what's happening creatively at our networks. Our investment in programming continues to pay off, helping us to sustain the stellar performance of perennial stars like Nickelodeon and to fuel the momentum that's underway at networks such as MTV, Comedy Central, BET and TV Land. Nickelodeon broke records again this quarter, delivering its biggest second quarter audience ever among total viewers. In fact, the Nickelodeon family of channels now captures more than half of kids viewing on television during its programming hours, giving it a 20 percentage points share lead over its nearest competitor.</p>
          <p>Uber franchise Sponge Bob was again the number one rated program with 2 to 11 year olds and newcomer Team Umizoomi was the number one ranked preschool program. Nick had six of the top 10 programs on all of television with both demos.</p>
          <p>In addition to iCarly's strong regular episode performance, iCarly tent poles consistently draw record-setting audiences. For example, the iCarly: iWon't Cancel the Show premier was the highest rated and most watched telecast on all TV in May among kid and tween demos. That was trumped by the June premier of the iCarly: iPsycho, which was the number one rated telecast of the entire quarter across all television with kids. And as the series appears in more countries around the world, iCarly continues to grow into a true global franchise.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, our newer live action shows, True Jackson, Big Time Rush and Victorious, are building their own impressive followings. A combination of new and proven programming on Nick Junior, Teen Nick and Nicktoons fueled double-digit growth in audience size for each of these networks. Ratings at Nicktoons were boosted by the additional Avatar programming that aired in June, which was part of the cross-network promotional campaign leading up to Paramount's theatrical release of The Last Air Bender. Building on this success, Nickelodeon recently green-lit a new series tentatively titled The Legend of Korra, which will continue the evolution of this animated franchise and is slated to premier next year.</p>
          <p>MTV enjoyed its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year ratings growth with four of the top 10 original ad-supported cable series among its target audience of 12 to 34 year olds as the network continues to successfully diversify its programming. MTV's new scripted comedy, Hard Times of RJ Berger, has delivered solid ratings that steadily increased and has just been picked up for a second season. This show has drawn a strong male audience, which is consistent with one of MTV's objectives as it develops new programming, and the good MTV news keeps coming.</p>
          <p>In the past couple of weeks, two of MTV's most successful new shows return for a second season: Teen Mom, MTV's number one new series in 2009, was the number one telecast in its time slot across all television among its core demo of 12 to 34 year olds for the first two weeks of the series. And fans just can't get enough of Jersey Shore. The season two premier broke all of the series' previous records, delivering a 5.1 rating and attracting 5.3 million viewers. It was the number one cable telecast of the year for its demo and it was MTV's best season premier rating in more than seven years. We're already moving ahead on season three for this phenomenon, whose impact has extended literally around the globe. The first season of Jersey Shore has already been seen in more than 30 countries.</p>
          <p>Coming up later this quarter, MTV will bring back The Buried Life for another season and debut docu series World of Jenks. In October, the network will air another season of 16 and Pregnant and My Life with Liz.</p>
          <p>The MTV network's music group is also making innovative moves in the digital space. Late in the quarter, we announced a multi-year partnership with Warner Music Group through which we will have the exclusive rights to sell advertising inventory related to WMG's premium music video content across our U.S. digital properties and mobile services as well as on WMG's growing network of proprietary artist sites and third-party affiliate sites.</p>
          <p>The addition of WMG's video views for a collective total will expand MTV network's music group's online reach to more than 50 million monthly unique visitors, solidifying the group's position as a leader in the digital music space.</p>
          <p>At Comedy Central, we have been revamping our programming line-up and the audience is responding enthusiastically. Ratings began to turn around in the month of June with year-over-year improvement of 5%. During the first five weeks of this quarter, Comedy's total day audience has grown 20% year-over-year, anchored by the continued success of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which had ratings growth over the prior year. South Park, Ugly Americans, new original episodes of Futurama, as well as Tosh.0, all have delivered outstanding results. Ratings for Tosh.0, now in its second season, have been building steadily and impressively as the show has found its audience. Just last week, Tosh hit a new series high, delivering 2.7 million viewers and further cementing its status as the number one show among young men on Wednesday evenings this summer.</p>
          <p>The success of our linear programming line-up is also driving digital success. The suite of sites that constitute Comedy Central digital, including comedycentral.com, thedailyshow.com, colbertnation.com and southparkstudios.com, enjoyed its best quarter ever. Comedy Central digital averaged 9 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter, up 23% versus last year, and ranked number one in the entertainment and humor category.</p>
          <p>Across our networks, we have had numerous other original programming standouts. For example, TV Land's hit sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, its series premiere was the most watched sitcom telecast in cable history with nearly 6 million viewers. We've already green-lit a second cycle of the show, which will air in early 2011. This series, along with the upcoming third season of She's Got the Look, is one of several initiatives we have underway at several of our networks to broaden our target demographics, namely attracting more of the 18 to 49 and 25 to 54-year-old adult market, which will open up new and lucrative marketing opportunities for us.</p>
          <p>BET's The Family Crews and the second season of Tiny &amp; Toya both rank among the top original series ever on BET and The Mo'Nique Show continues to grow its late night audience. And our signature award shows, including the MTV movie awards, the BET awards and VH1's Hip-Hop Honors, all delivered outstanding ratings as well as strong digital traffic. We are looking forward to the MTV Video Music Awards, which will air live on September 12 from Los Angeles.</p>
          <p>I also want to mention the re-branding of MTV Tr3s. Now known as Tr3s, MTV, Musica y Mas, we are expanding this brand's content to appeal to a broader spectrum of the 12 to 34 Latino demographic, a growing force culturally and economically. Working more closely with MTV Networks international's Latin-American operations, Tr3s will feature more original programming and key acquisitions with particular emphasis on driving more co-viewing among teens and their parents, again a new expanding demographic category for us. In our International business, we are seeing solid progress in most of our major territories in Europe and in Latin America as well as in India and expect improvement in margins as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Now I'll move on to Filmed Entertainment. Our theatrical slate at Paramount Pictures continues to perform very well this year. Our major releases in the past quarter were Marvel studio's Iron Man 2 and DreamWorks Animation Shrek Forever After. Both franchises delivered solid box office performance and we expect that to extend to strong DVD sales later this year. We are also pleased with our Nickelodeon tent pole, The Last Air Bender. This film has defied critics' expectations and is still in the early stages of expanding overseas where it is performing well thus far.</p>
          <p>The home entertainment market continues to be soft. In addition to lower revenues from third party distribution arrangements this past quarter, we had three fewer DVD releases than in the prior year. In June, Paramount Home Entertainment announced the extension of its revenue sharing license agreement with Redbox to continue to make its DVD and Blu-ray titles available for rent through the Redbox kiosks on the same day they are released for sale. The data from our 10-month test with Redbox suggest that this arrangement had minimal impact on DVD sales and offered our consumers more choice in how they wish to enjoy our movies. Back in the theaters, Dinner for Schmucks just opened this past weekend and Middle Man opens tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we have a number of promising films slated for release. Next month, we will be distributed academy award winner Davis Guggenheim's latest documentary, Waiting for Superman, which focuses on the crisis in the current state of America's public schools. In the fall, you won't want to miss Jackass 3D and the highly anticipated sequel, Paranormal Activity 2. These will be followed by DreamWorks Animation's MegaMind and Ethan and Joel Coen's remake of True Grit.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we are very pleased with the strong results we have delivered over the first half of the calendar year. We will continue to focus on driving and nurturing the enormous creativity that exists within our company and on improving our operational efficiencies. Our investment in original programming is clearly yielding positive results.</p>
          <p>We will continue to generate more and more new content for our audiences and find more ways to monetize that content as digital, mobile and international forms of distribution become more significant. And we will also build on our financial strength to ensure that we are well positioned to return money to our shareholders and capitalize on future opportunities.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn it over to my partner, Tom.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail and update you on the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude from the June quarter of last year 33 million of severance charges; 16 million at the Media Networks and 17 million at Filmed Entertainment.</p>
          <p>You may have noticed that adjusted operating income from our segments now excludes equity compensation in addition to any one-time items that affect comparability. This change in presentation should help you better analyze segment operating results.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year-end. The trending schedules on our website should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues were flat to last year at $3.3 billion. Media Networks' revenues increased 125 million or 6%, primarily driven by a higher affiliate feed and advertising revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 10% or 135 million. Home entertainment revenues were lower in the quarter reflecting fewer new releases and lower catalog sales. Total company expenses declined 173 million or 6% for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by 212 million or 15%; and Media Network expenses increased 28 million or 2%.</p>
          <p>The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases in the quarter. Consolidated operating income in the quarter increased 28% to $794 million.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 6% to 2.1 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues increased 6% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.</p>
          <p>Page 8 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 4% in the June quarter, which was an improvement from the March quarter's 1% growth. International advertising increased 6% in the quarter with foreign exchange reducing the growth rate by two percentage points. This growth was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to our affiliate revenues, our domestic revenues increased 12% while international revenues increased 6%. Approximately 75% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of rate and subscriber increases.</p>
          <p>Moving to ancillary revenues, domestic revenues declined 3% while international revenues increased 7%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues, partially offset by increased online content licensing fees. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales.</p>
          <p>Media Networks adjusted operating income of 789 million in the quarter was 14% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 250 basis points to 38% in the June quarter, primarily due to lower Rock Band losses. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 39%, which was an improvement of 20 basis points from last year. The improvement in the core margins was driven by higher affiliate, advertising and ancillary revenues, partially offset by higher programming expense.</p>
          <p>Programming expense in the quarter grew 10%. During the quarter, we aired licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond and Rosanne, new scripted series like the Hard Times of RJ Burger and Hot in Cleveland, as well as returning series and specials including America's Best Dance Crew and Hip Hop Honors.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Filmed Entertainment; revenues in the quarter declined 10% to $1.2 billion. Page 10 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of the Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate continues as we released fewer titles both theatrically and in home entertainment compared with the June quarter of last year. Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter increased 60 million, or 10% to 644 million. Foreign currency had a three percentage point favorable impact on worldwide theatrical revenue growth. The performance in the quarter was driven by the distribution of Iron Man 2, Shrek Forever After, and How to Train Your Dragon.</p>
          <p>This compares to last year's June 26 release of Transformers 2 as well as the release of Star Trek and Monsters vs. Aliens. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 43% to $248 million. The decline reflects lower revenues on distribution titles as well as fewer home entertainment releases. We released three titles in the quarter as compared to six titles in the June quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of 69 million as compared to an operating loss of 8 million last year. The $77 million improvement in operating income principally reflects lower print advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, certain Paramount releases from 2009 were made available to our Epix pay TV joint venture. Accordingly, we recognized 40 million of revenue and 24 million of income at the Filmed Entertainment related to those releases. We also recorded 27 million of equity losses so there was no net impact to Viacom.</p>
          <p>Moving below the segment results, total company equity losses from investments were $24 million in the quarter. The losses principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The tax rate in the quarter was 36%.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and debt profile. We generated 355 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter as compared to 159 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income and lower working capital uses, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense and by higher pre-tax earnings.</p>
          <p>Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with 6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and 677 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. This facility expires in December and we are in the process of renegotiating a new $1.5 billion facility to replace it. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9 times, which is consistent with our target of approximately two times.</p>
          <p>The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least three times. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was eight times. We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage, managing our cost structure and improving our free cash flow conversion. Our enhanced credit profile has resulted in recent upgrades from both Fitch and S&amp;P to a BBB+ rating and Moody's has put us &#x2013; our ratings on review for possible upgrade.</p>
          <p>Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, last week we announced another quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share; that will bring our total dividends paid to shareholders to 182 million since we initiated our dividend program in June. And starting in the December quarter, we will begin buying back our stock under our $4 billion stock repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the rest of our fiscal year. At Media Networks, we will continue to find cost efficiencies in operating areas that will enable us to enhance our core margins while investing in programming. Our targeted annual growth rate for programming expenses remains mid single digits. In the September quarter, however, the growth rate will be comparable to the June quarter due to the timing of shows coming on air.</p>
          <p>In September of 2009, Rock Band launched The Beatles game worldwide on Xbox, Wii and Playstation 3 platforms. This year, they will launch Rock Band 3 worldwide on October 26, which falls in our next fiscal year. Rock Band will sell the software and song downloads related to Rock Band 3 while Mad Catz will be responsible for the hardware sales.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, operating free cash flow of $737 million is 442 million higher than the same period in 2009. While we expect to generate substantial free cash flow this year, the increase will be somewhat mitigated in the September quarter as last year we benefited from the theatrical performance of Transformers 2. This year, we will be incurring production spend related to some of our fiscal year 2011 tent pole films as well as increased participation payments.</p>
          <p>In summary, while the quarter was characterized by concerns about the macro environment, advertising showed continued strength and we remain focused on executing our strategy. At Media Networks, the launch of new original programming and the return of several successful series are resonating with both viewers and advertisers. Our recently completed up front demonstrates this momentum.</p>
          <p>At Filmed Entertainment, we continue to build our portfolio of franchise films, strengthening the pipeline for the studio. We are managing our cost structure and driving greater efficiencies throughout the organization with a focus on growing margin and increasing cash flow. Our commitment to reallocate capital in order to invest in key strategic initiatives positions us for long-term growth.</p>
          <p>With that, I want to thank you for listening, and now I will turn the call over to your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for taking my questions; a couple of questions. First, I was wondering &#x2013; you had a very strong up front, how that position you &#x2013; how that translate into next year advertising growth in your mind so if you can give us some color. I know you're not ready to give guidance at this point. And secondly, you know, you have been consistently improving your core margins. As we look forward, more of a high level, how should we think about where you think core margins can go? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Imran. Well, as you suggest the up front season really set us up well for the next fiscal year. The up front sales will begin to be reflected in the December quarter, which will be our first fiscal quarter. Across the board, as I mentioned in my remarks, we had pricing in the mid to high single digits increases. We had increase in volume. And the scatter market that we're experiencing now, despite the turbulence in the overall economy or some of the headlines you see out there, the scatter market continues to be strong. You know, our pricing over the up front in the last quarter, in the second quarter, was up mid teens. And as we begin the third quarter, it is at that level or a little better than that level. So we continue to see strength that gives us optimism for advertising growth in the next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>As far as our core margins, we work hard to not just maintain it but continue to improve it through efficiencies, as Tom mentioned, while continuing to invest in programming. Obviously, as our revenues grow as the advertising market continues to be strong, we know that our affiliate fee growth rate will continue to be strong. We may have an opportunity for further improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Imran, specifically on the core margin front, you know as Rock Band losses go from being losses and turn around into a profitability, which we foresee in the near future, we think that is a driver of core margins. We also see opportunities to expand the core margins in the international segment as we roll into next year. So we see continued momentum there as well as we continue to find, you know, more operating efficiencies in all of the business segments. So we've been investing in programming while at the same time driving those core margins, and we see the opportunity for that to continue.</p>
          <p>On the Filmed Entertainment side, we've done a lot to drive the cost equation there and improve that. Yet at the end of the day, that will be &#x2013; the core margins there will be driven by the overall success of the film lineup.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. Look, I was just curious, some peers have had some pretty terrific international advertising growth rates, 25% plus. I'm not sure if you can summarize international easily, but can you square the difference to your 6% for us and are you more mature or making changes in your business? Is there any rating shares issues, or is it potentially we're going to see some improvements to international as well as domestic? And then secondly for Tom, have you given any consideration to moving up your share repurchase program given the strength of your results and what appears to be a pretty attractive valuation? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the international side, we do see the opportunity for that to improve faster in the future. Once again, some of the markets, our market line-up doesn't exactly parallel their market line-up, and our demographic mix doesn't parallel their demographic mix. Certainly there's been more strength in the older demographics relative to the younger demographics, and that's equal on the international and on the domestic side. We see strengthening in the younger demographic mix coming through. I guess traditionally &#x2013; I don't know if there's any stats on this, but it probably comes back later in a recovery period. So we do see international's advertising growth strengthening down the road.</p>
          <p>As far as the share repurchase program, we've been pretty disciplined about how we're going about doing that and being very mindful of the overall leverage of the company and the cash flow dynamics of the company as you guys all know. You know, the quarter ending December 31 is usually very strong from a cash flow point of view, and we will, as we stated, wait until that quarter even though the stock is very attractively priced at this point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Two questions; one for Philippe and one for Tom. Philippe, I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit more about your strategy to grow non-endemic advertising for some of your channels, where you are in that process and when you expect to see that reaccelerated ad revenue growth.</p>
          <p>And second, just for Tom, to clarify your programming cost growth comments mid single digits, it looks like for fiscal 2010, the programming cost growth will be about 8% year-over-year. So is that what you mean by roughly mid single digits, or should it be closer to 5 to 6? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Spencer. On the first question, we're making a big push to grow non-endemic advertising in the Nickelodeon family of networks in particular. We're making great progress. We saw it in the up front sales where, as you know, the automotive category in general is back in advertising. We have a very low market share in that category.</p>
          <p>Many of the new car models coming out are geared to younger purchasers, young families. And we saw great progress in our up front sales in that category. We see also a lot of progress in electronic products and a lot of the new products out there, insurance, and as well as advertising like Procter &amp; Gamble and the like. So we are &#x2013; we expect to see a lot more progress going forward, but we're already seeing good signs of that in the up front season that we just completed as well as in the scatter. Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the mid single digits, we referring to like 5 or 6, but depending on which shows are working and which shows aren't working in the third quarter, we may mix it up, but it won't get any higher than the 7 or 8 range in any case.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. First question for Tom and then I have a follow-up for Philippe. Tom, on the equity line, maybe you could just refresh us on when you expect Epix to be cash flow break even and profitable? That 26 million in below the line from Epix and Rhapsody, how should the losses there progress in terms of the recoup? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The equity losses on Epix will continue from a P&amp;L point of view. They will be cash flow break even, we expect we'd be pretty close to that in the December ending quarter, the first quarter of our new fiscal year. So we're in pretty good shape from a cash flow point of view, we believe, on Epix, and very excited about that.</p>
          <p>As far as the other categories, the number that we reported this quarter will pretty much round out to be the number we report. There's pluses and minuses. We have profits coming in from our India venture that are offsetting some of the losses coming from some of our other ventures around the world. But that rate or aggregate number seems to be a number that you can roll forward with for a period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thanks. And then Philippe, when you look at the nature of some of your MTV brands whether it's not just Jersey Shore but Teen Mom or 16 and Pregnant, I mean, these things are controversial. Some of these topics are controversial. I know that works to your advantage in terms of your TV ratings. I'm just wondering in terms of the financials, how does that work in terms of your advertisers? What are your advertisers saying about some of these topics? And I know at times it's a tough balancing act. It must be. How do you approach that balance? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, there were some issues when Jersey Shore's first season launched. A lot of talk out there about &#x2013; before the show really hit. And now we have advertisers just scrambling to get on it. We have some advertisers who want to get wall to wall on particular episodes. We're turning them away. So it's resonating culturally &#x2013; it &#x2013; and with our audiences, and of course marketers want to reach those hard to reach passionate audiences. Same with Teen Mom, which is actually a very sweet show if you've watched it. It has a lot of life lessons in it and very uplifting. So those shows are actually doing very, very well from a marketing standpoint.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Philippe started out asking about &#x2013; or mentioning that the film business' home video line was continuing to weaken or be weak year-over-year. Just wondering, given everyone seems to be shrinking their film slates and shrinking the number of releases, have you thought about or would you have interest in doing more of what you used to do in terms of joint ventures overseas both on the theatrical side as well as on the home video side and just how you think about getting the cost structure of the film business to a better place? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Rich, we are continuously looking at ways to reduce the cost structure and overhead of our business, and we've been making continuous improvement in that respect, including in the home entertainment line. As far as international distribution, we continue to have joint ventures in several territories. We look at that on, again, as the marketplace evolves, the international marketplace is growing. In some markets it makes sense for us to have our own distribution, in others we will look at opportunities for joint ventures either with local players or some of our colleagues such as Universal, with whom we already have ventures in certain territories. So we continue to look at that equation and are looking to improve our cost structure at the studio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, just to follow up on that, the point about the movie business continuing to contract the number of films they release, we see that actually changing. We see that beginning to change at the end of the second quarter. Certainly as we go into the third quarter, I'd say the first and second quarter of this year would be sort of be the bottoming-out point of the downward contraction in major releases, which draw a lot of advertising, put a lot of advertising in the marketplace. And we think that bodes well for us as we move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, one of the factors in that is not just the major studios, but you have studios such as DreamWorks and other mini majors who are coming out with new slates, having not put them out before or increased slates as we look forward beginning next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So movies that will put advertising into the marketplace. The volume there will actually start to see a bit of an uptick, which is the first time that's happened in a while.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen; just two questions. First, I guess for Tom, looking at the Media Networks and the non-programming expenses, how should we be thinking about growth there? You know, what are the puts and takes in terms of holding that down? How much further in efficiencies can you get, because you have obviously taken a fair amount of cost out of the business already.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just on your deal with Redbox, I was wondering if you can comment a little bit on the data that you've obviously seen in terms of the impact of your window on DVD sales and data which some of your peers have talked about indicating that they do see some benefit to a longer window on their DVD sales. Is there anything to reconcile there, or is there any comment you could offer on that or the data that you have? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, I'll take the &#x2013; this is Philippe, I'll take the Redbox question and turn over the expense question to Tom. As far as Redbox, we &#x2013; unlike some of our competitors, who were in litigation with Redbox, we had an agreement that gave us actual data over a ten-month period so we had objective information. That data showed us that there was extremely little degradation in DVD sales, and the financial terms offered by Redbox for an earlier window far out weighed that degradation. Our competitors who have the 28-day window are getting much lower pricing in their Redbox deal. So thanks to our actually having real world data, unlike our competitors, we were able to make what we think is the best decision for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, on the cost side of the Media Networks business, we see &#x2013; we will be increasing the compensation line, which we held pretty tight last year. That will be a factor that will drive increases in costs. We're also looking at ways to expand some of our promotional dollars, what we use to promote shows. That will be tied to the overall efficiency that we get from promoting those shows, so that will basically translate into higher revenue growth. So I think we will continue &#x2013; we've got some pretty good models in place to really be able to release dollars and spend as it relates to the overall revenue equation on the other side of it and we've been very successful at driving more investment in higher margin dollars, which is improving our bottom line. And that's the focus that we've had across the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much for taking the questions. So with regard to Rock Band, it seems like the strategic shift that you implemented recently is actually starting to stem the losses there. If you can provide a little bit more color on when you think Rock Band might actually attain profitability and any further changes along those lines that you're making?</p>
          <p>And separately, still within the gaming theme, I notice that you have started to make even more concerted push into social gaming, Social Express, et cetera, and I think some time, a couple years ago, you had Flux as well. So obviously casual gaming is one of your strong suits. So I wanted to get a sense in terms of gaming as a category, when do you &#x2013; any idea as to how much that business could grow? What's your longer term strategy to kind of synthesize all of these platforms, perhaps, into one coordinated and centralized platform? So any color on your gaming strategy would be helpful and any quantification as well; just to get a sense of how much of your overall growth that might contribute over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk a little bit about the metrics behind Rock Band, and Philippe will talk more about the overall gaming strategy. Rock Band, we have put in place the deal with Mad Catz, the distributor that will distribute the hardware peripherals associated with the game unit. That substantially reduces or effectively eliminates the economic risk associated with that, which had been a drag on our previous earnings potential associated with the entity.</p>
          <p>The second piece of the equation deals with the deal we recently did with Microsoft around a dance game for the new Connect product that they have out there. We have great hopes and expectations for that, but the way we structured that deal, we believe we have little downside risk and all upside risk associated with that. As we roll forward here, Rock Band 3 will be distributed in the marketplace. We think it's got great potential. We'll be very cautious on inventory levels that we put into stores. So we have the ability to realize profits, finally, on this segment and we're very excited about that and very optimistic about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And really the &#x2013; on the Rock Band strategy, it's really been reducing the risk so going forward we don't have the risk that we experienced in the past and hoping for better rewards.</p>
          <p>As far as our overall gaming strategy, we are very excited at pushing our strong position in the casual gaming arena. We have great reach. We are now beginning a number of initiatives that will lead to subscription revenues for us that will enhance virtual goods sales. We think there's a lot of opportunity in the mobile platforms as we go forward around the world. And incidentally, we're experiencing some good success in many of our international markets in this domain.</p>
          <p>And the Social Express acquisition, which you pointed out, very, very low cost; it's in keeping with our strategy as it relates to acquisitions driving our business. Very low cost, really helping organic growth, accelerating the development of social gaming; not the larger purchases that you have been reading about in this arena. So we think we can drive revenues and have a good growth curve in that business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've got two questions. First, when we look forward to the September quarter advertising, if we look at this, how much is that going to be impacted by the weak up front from last year? It sounds like the June &#x2013; if I remember correctly, the up front last year you sold, what, low 40s percent of your inventory, down about 8%, and that's probably what drove the June quarter to have lower ad growth than the rest of the industry. Is the September quarter going to face that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, Philippe, I was wondering if you could update us on the status of the YouTube litigation. Is that now over with, or is that going to be a continuing item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the September quarter is the last quarter that we'll have the last year's weak up front that we have to overcome, so that certainly is a factor in the September quarter. However, as I mentioned in my remarks, because of the continued strength in the scatter market and good ratings in our core networks, we expect to see sequential improvement in the rate of growth from the 4% that we delivered in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as the YouTube litigation, we intend to pursue an appeal at the Second Circuit. The decision of the lower court allowed us to deal with the legal issues on an expedited basis without having to go through a protracted trial and the expense of a trial. So we look forward to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to deal with this issue and the ruling, which was, by the way, inconsistent with rulings that have been made by other courts around the country.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Can you talk about how you think internally on a long-term basis about the ratio of home entertainment revenues to rentals? I mean not just DVDs and even Redbox; I mean broadband over time, and really coupling international as well as domestic? I mean, obviously that ratio has gotten blown out of the water the last couple of years. Do you see that stabilizing, or do you think that that hits a slight inflection point and we get some growth in a few years as technology evolves and consumption patterns evolve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, I'm not sure I got the entire part of your question, but as far as sales versus rentals, certainly you are seeing rentals shifting from the box environment to the Redbox and other platforms. Rentals are increasing. Blu-ray distribution is starting to pick up again as consumer markets improve in certain markets. And that's an opportunity to drive greater margin product as we go forward.</p>
          <p>There has been some stabilization in DVD sales as far as new releases, but continued weakness in catalog DVD sales and we see that continuing. The international arena continues to be a good opportunity. As we see the revenues increasing in theatrical it's also driving sales of DVDs, so international is an opportunity for the studios.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Can you just remind us as we look out to the rest of this year; I think Nickelodeon has a sizable amount of licensing revenue that comes in seasonally with calendar Q4, although you may book that on a sell-in basis. I was wondering if you can just talk about what you're hearing from retailers and what the year-on-year compare looks like. I think the last couple of years obviously the consumer has been in a tough spot, so are the comps sort of favorable this year, and how should we be thinking about that piece of the business as we move into the back half?</p>

          <p>Yeah, we see great interest from the retailers this year in terms of both the volume and breadth of product that they would like to carry in the stores as it relates to the CP that we have available, and we hope that will be a big piece of our new fiscal first quarter and look forward to it. We are seeing some good order volumes there, as I said, around some of the great traditional product that we have available for them. And that's product both in existing franchises and some new franchises that we've introduced. We don't get that granular on the specific dollars and cents associated with that, but we do see that as a category that will drive growth in Nickelodeon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks; if I could squeeze a follow-up in. I don't know if you have considered selling Epix or Epix content through Netflix, sort of similar to what Starz is doing? I know that Epix is looking at different sort of distribution models than the traditional pay network, but I wanted to just bounce that idea off you, Philippe, and get your thoughts.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Epix does well. It's doing well now that we're in the marketplace with several distributors we reached agreements with earlier. We are looking at all forms of distribution going forward, and Epix will be announcing new distribution agreements pretty shortly.</p>

          <p>Moving on, we'll take our next question from David Bank, RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, this will be our last question, please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Squeezing in under the wire; thank you. I guess first question is giving us a sense, I guess, that the buyback is going to take place kind of proportionately with your seasonal cash flow generation. But can you give us a sense like over what time period we should expect the authorization to be used over?</p>
          <p>And then &#x2013; two quick ones; the second is, Philippe, could you give us a sense of the magnitude of the acceleration or kind of how you're currently pacing or some more color? And then last, I just want to make sure I got what Tom said. On the equity line, are the Epix equity losses going to be consistent with the last couple quarters, or were you talking about the other businesses in there like the India investment and stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Epix equity losses will go down as Epix moves closer to break even throughout the end of this year and into next year, 2011. So there will be other items in there where as we make different investments in some of the smaller entities or 50% joint ventures or less joint ventures that we have ownership interest in that will keep that line pacing around that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the buyback goes, we expect to initiate it again in the next quarter. We expect to execute it on a steady basis, looking at what our cash needs are and being consistent with our leverage ratio objectives, the approximate two times leverage ratio. But we think based on our cash generation, our capital needs, that this will be a significant pace as we go forward. And what was your question on acceleration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Order of magnitude, so a little bit more color around the improvement you're seeing sequentially.</p>

          <p>Yes, domestically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically we're still &#x2013; as I indicated in response to an earlier question, we're still dealing with last year's up front, and that's being made up and then some by a good scatter market and once we get into October into the December quarter, we will benefit from this up front where we have some greater volume than last year at higher pricing. And we expect &#x2013; we see no reason why the scatter market shouldn't continue to be strong, and we'll be able to ride the solid ratings we have at our key networks. And our objective, of course, is to try to keep that sequential growth going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's important to note that our older-skewing networks like the TV Land and Nick at Nite and to some extent CMT are very high demand networks and are pacing at great growth rates. As we talked about, the majority of our demos that we have to sell are in the younger-skewing demographics, and those have recovered at a slower rate than the older-skewing demos. We are seeing an acceleration in the advertisers who are advertising to the younger demos, and we think that, combined with the new up front that we just completed, will help us launch our advertising revenues and accelerate the growth there.</p>
