          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Rome. Before starting this presentation and handing over to the top management, Mr. Fulvio Conti, the Chief Executive; and Mr. Luigi Ferraris, the Chief Financial Officer, let me underline that as you may see today, we are not having dedicated slot of presentations for Endesa and Enel Green Power. Those business cases would be discussed in dedicated Investor Days which you see indicated in this chart, as for your agenda. Naturally, the top management of these two companies as well as all the managers and the divisional directors of the group are here to address the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>So, thank you again for coming up. And let me hand over to Fulvio Conti for the start of our presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, again. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our traditional presentation, the strategic plan and the annual results plan for 2012-2016, which you'll see interesting.</p>
          <p>In 2011, our Group has continued to deliver a set of solid results. Once again in line with targets, notwithstanding the many crisis that we have seen in the recent years and in particular the worsening of the economies during the fourth quarter of 2011. This crisis is expected to continue as for mature markets as Italy and Iberia, especially during the first half of this year, 2012, while I &#x2013; we do expect emerging markets economies to confirm their solid growth.</p>
          <p>That said we're convinced that starting 2013 onward also Italy and Iberia will see a recovery in their economies. And emerging markets, we'll continue to expand. The management undertakings in terms of CapEx optimization, improved efficiencies and balance sheet strengthening will confirm the capability of the Group to deliver fundamental results coupled with financial discipline.</p>
          <p>So first let me handle 2011. I will talk through the macro environment and Luigi will follow with &#x2013; will follow on with the results. In 2011 &#x2013; if I may have the slides? Is someone moving on the slides or it's me? It's me. In 2011, we faced markets growing at two different speeds. Since the last couple of years, mature markets have been experiencing low growth rates with stagnating and decreasing GDP as well as lower industrial output. This trend accelerated in 2011 fourth quarter and is expected to continue in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Most of the economies are indicating that there are ways and means that the economies might bounce back in the second half of this year. In contrast, emerging markets are experiencing higher growth sustained by a very important demographic expansion, resource availability and stable governments and regulations. All of this had an impact on the energy industry.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this slide &#x2013; slide coming, there it goes. As you can see in this slide, growth markets showed a different pace of electricity demand evolution compared with mature ones. In mature markets, we experienced no growth on electricity demand due to the impact of the crisis. And this has been offset by an ongoing demand expansion in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>The persisting state of crisis of the last years led the industry to cut capacity for a total amount of about 56 gigawatts. Within this framework, Enel is taking advantage of its geographic diversification and its well-balanced mix of regulated and unregulated activities. As you will see in a moment, this balanced mix has delivered a good set of results despite the ongoing deterioration of the macro environment in the year.</p>
          <p>Now, let me hand it over to our CFO, Luigi, who will be explaining to all of us the 2011 financial results in detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>S, thank you, Fulvio, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First, I'm going to give you some financial highlights. Then, I will take you through the 2011 divisional financial results, ending with our Group's net debt evolution. Group EBITDA increased by 1.4% mainly driven by Infrastructure and Networks, Enel Green Power, the International division and the Market division. Net of non-recurring items of about &#x20AC;300 million 2011 EBITDA was in line with 2010.</p>
          <p>Group net income has decreased by 5.5%, totaling about &#x20AC;4.1 billion. Bear in mind that these results has been affected by the amendment to the so-called Robin Hood Tax. Furthermore, Group net ordinary income takes into account as a negative adjustment the above mentioned non-recurring items and the deferred tax impact of the Robin Hood Tax. And this has been compensated for by some positive adjustments mainly related to some write-downs, Endesa Ireland, Edesur in Argentina and Enel Green Power in Greece.</p>
          <p>The Board of Directors has decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting a total dividend of &#x20AC;0.26 per share of which &#x20AC;0.10 already paid in November and $0.16 to be paid in June 2012. This is based on a 60% dividend payout policy applied to Enel's net ordinary income reported in 2011. Net debt decreased during the period of about &#x20AC;300 million. I will provide more detail on this, of course, later on in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Our net financial charges stands at &#x20AC;3 billion registering a decrease of &#x20AC;174 million, mainly as a result of the following: lower interest charges of &#x20AC;74 million as the positive impact of the lower net financial debt position has more than offset higher interest charge paid on the variable short-term debt. The decrease of other items by &#x20AC;100 million was mainly due to a negative one-off item recorded in 2010, relating to Spanish tariff deficit, which we already mentioned on the occasion of the nine months 2011 result presentation.</p>
          <p>Also let me remind you that our normalized annual average cost of gross debt stands at 4.9% versus about 4.6% of last year. Finally, the Group's tax rate increased from about 30% in 2010 to about 37% in 2011. These higher taxes are mainly the result of the inclusion of the Robin Hood Tax in our accounts.</p>
          <p>Let's now continue with an update on forward sales activity. Well, in Italy, we have hedged 85% of our 2012 production at an average base load price of about &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour, and 40%, 45% of 2013, including the roll-over at an average base load price of about &#x20AC;78 per megawatt hour. In particular, for the forward sales related to 2012, spark spreads declined by about &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour versus 2011. And this, of course, will be reflected in 2012 results, as you will see during the course of our presentation.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we are fully hedged for 2012 at 5%-10% for 2013 at an average price of about &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour and &#x20AC;57 per megawatt hour when it comes to 2013. In Latin America, we are 70%-75% hedged for 2012 and 60%-65% when it comes to 2013. In Slovakia, as usual, we are 100% hedged for the entire 2012 and about 40% for 2013. Prices &#x20AC;56 per megawatt hour refers to 2012 and about &#x20AC;52 when it comes to 2013.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to explain our EBITDA evolution in the following chart, which gives you an overview of how the different divisions have contributed to our EBITDA 2011. Starting with analogies of Generation and Energy Management, well, as you can see in the chart, overall divisional EBITDA declined by &#x20AC;210 million. This is mainly the result of a decrease in the generation margin of &#x20AC;480 million caused by lower margins and prices achieved versus 2010, coupled with the ongoing lower hydroelectricity during 2011; a reduction on &#x20AC;84 million in the gas at trading margin mainly due to the gas price drop for final clients; an increase of &#x20AC;300 million in other items mainly thanks to the revaluation of Trento's Hydro Dolomiti Enel assets as we have already stated again during the course of the nine months presentation.</p>
          <p>Moving to domestic Infrastructure and Network division, well, we reported a strong set of results here. EBITDA increased to &#x20AC;4,285 million or 12% up versus last year. This is mainly the results of the following: higher connection fees of &#x20AC;220 million related to energy producer. Let me remind you that during the course of 2011, we have connected about the equivalent of 10,000 gigawatts versus <mark type="ph" /> 2% (12:28) gigawatts in 2010 and &#x20AC;286 million, mainly thanks to personnel related provision release and quality premiums received for the improvement in the quality of the service rendered to the final customers.</p>
          <p>Moving to the International division, EBITDA increased by about &#x20AC;122 million versus last year. In the Centrel region, Slovensk&#xE9; Elektr&#xE1;rne recorded an increase of &#x20AC;99 million, mainly attributed to the net positive effect of CO2 sales and to a discounts on the transmission tariff linked to some onerous contracts.</p>
          <p>Southeastern Europe recorded a decrease of &#x20AC;29 million as a consequence of the assets sold in Bulgaria during the course of 2011. Russia increased by about &#x20AC;57 million, with generation activities contributing &#x20AC;14 million as a result of the growth of energy margin, mainly thanks to higher spreads on free power sales, partially offset by the negative year-on-year difference in the release of a water tax provision recorded in 2010. And also, let me mention supply activities which have contributed for an additional &#x20AC;40 million versus last year, thanks to higher margin reported on the final customers.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to Endesa results on slide &#x2013; on the following slides. Well, as usual, first of all, let me remind you that the numbers we report on this slide and the following one are the results of the application of Enel Group's accounting principle, which may differ from Endesa's principle due to local standards. The Iberia division has recorded a decrease in EBITDA of about &#x20AC;493 million, or 11%. But net of the perimeter effect and the capital gains related to assets sold in 2010, 2011 EBITDA decreased by &#x20AC;100 million, or just of 2.4%.</p>
          <p>This was mainly the results of a decline of &#x20AC;240 million in the liberalized business, which can be largely explained by the higher fuel costs and energy purchasing costs recorded as a consequence of the increased thermal output, lower hydro and nuclear contribution, coupled with higher prices; an increase of &#x20AC;70 million in the regulated business, mainly thanks to higher distribution revenues after the implementation of the Royal Decree issued during the course of 2008; and other items for &#x20AC;61 million that reflects the lower fixed costs related to the efficiency programs implemented by the company.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to Latin America. Well, Latin America division has recorded an EBITDA decrease of &#x20AC;152 million or minus 4.5%. This is mainly the results of the following: &#x20AC;89 million of negative foreign exchange effect translation; a negative one-off impact of &#x20AC;109 million due to the full recognition of the net worth tax in Colombia, which will be paid every six months in eight installments between January 2011 and December 2014; an increase of &#x20AC;24 million in the generation business, mainly thanks to better hydro condition in Colombia due to the El Ni&#xF1;o effects and higher prices in Peru, partially compensated for by lower margins in Chile compared to 2010 due to the drought which is affecting the country; an increase of &#x20AC;22 million in the distribution business, mainly thanks to higher volumes distributed in all the countries in which we operate that more than compensates the negative EBITDA of Argentina explained by higher costs as a consequence of inflation coupled with no tariff increase.</p>
          <p>And now let's have a view of Enel Green Power in the following charts. Well, Enel Green Power totaled &#x20AC;1,585 million, representing an increase of &#x20AC;275 million or 21% up versus last year. This is mainly the results of the following: an increase of &#x20AC;53 million in Iberia and Latin America, which is mainly the results of the consolidation of ECyR for &#x20AC;41 million and overall higher prices in Iberia for &#x20AC;32 million; an increase of &#x20AC;23 million in North America, thanks to higher volumes in winds and hydro production and also thanks to a one-off positive impact of &#x20AC;16 million indemnity on a renewable plant expropriation; and finally, an increase of &#x20AC;184 million, mainly related to the fair value revaluation of some assets sold as well as the capital gain on the assets sold to Gas Natural.</p>
          <p>Let's move to our net debt evolution. Well, overall, net debt decreased by about &#x20AC;300 million versus 2010, standing at about &#x20AC;44.6 billion. During this period, the cash flow from operations has enabled us to cover CapEx, debt services, taxes, and dividend payments, meanwhile releasing extra cash for net debt reduction. In particular, during the fourth quarter of 2011, the group has benefited from a very positive evolution of the operating cash flow, more than doubling vis-&#xE0;-vis the third quarter, mainly thanks to our operations, the recovery of the seasonal working capital, and some regulatory cash-in items released in the last part of the year.</p>
          <p>We are also improving our liquidity position. In fact, looking at this chart, it is clear that liquidity is not anymore an issue for the group. As you can see, we can count on about &#x20AC;30 billion of liquidity available which already covers existing debts &#x2013; existing debt maturities through 2014 even taking into account 2012 short-term portion of debt maturities close to about &#x20AC;5 billion related to commercial paper and other credit lines which will be rolled over during the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now, let me hand over to Fulvio Conti to take you through our 2012 short-term outlook and our 2012-2016 strategic plan.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Luigi. I'm now going to start illustrating in this section the short-term macro environment in 2012. Let me start with a slide that shows basically the current economic scenario that we're facing, particular in Italy and in particular to the GEM division.</p>
          <p>Despite the slight increase recorded in 2011 versus 2012 and the expected partial recovery in 2012 versus 2011, electricity demand evolution in Italy will remain weak. Increasing overcapacity and gas oversupply will continue to test market balance during 2012. In fact, we're expecting that 2008 demand level will not be recovered up to 2014. During 2011, the system overcapacity has worsened, mainly driven by the last and final CCGT additions and by a huge increase in solar photovoltaic capacity. Even assuming a lower path of solar increase going forward, 2012 will end up with a total solar capacity installed of at least 15 gigawatt.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, the 2012 reserve margin in Italy, when put pressure on spark spreads that would drop by about &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour versus 2011, of course. This has already been indicated by Luigi, and I confirm it to you. The persisting low level of gas demand in 2012, sorry, and versus 2008 has put additional pressure on operators facing take-or-pay obligations. As a consequence, the wholesale prices, which represents a relevant benchmark for power price, has declined.</p>
          <p>However, notwithstanding this gas oversupply, as you all know, combined cycles are running on long-term oil-linked gas contracts. And this will continue to play an important role in the Italian wholesale market. As a consequence of all of this, we do expect GEM EBITDA for 2012 to be in the region of &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to Spain, 2012 outlook will be characterized by a slight decline in demand versus 2011. And looking at the most recent data of GDP growth, which will show a decline of 1.5% in 2012, we are assuming that electricity demand will not recover at the 2008 level, not earlier than 2014, as we've seen in Italy. The main drivers which explain the decline of 2012 EBITDA are the normalization, the last resort tariff, the Tarifa de Ultimo Recurso; as well as the higher impact from the social bonus, the bonus itself; expected lower margins in the Irelands, affected by the gas, electricity interconnection; and the non-recurring profits in gas contracts we negotiated which we have recorded back in 2011.</p>
          <p>In Latam, Enel's operating performance will benefit from the good macroeconomic environment in this region. We are expecting electricity demand to grow by about 4% and generation output to grow by 5%. EBITDA is expected to grow by 10% in 2012, mainly driven by increased output in generation on new capacity and the hydro conditions and by the positive effect of the net worth tax in Colombia already paid in 2011 which will now be represented again.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to Russia and Slovakia. In Russia, we're forecasting in the short-term EBITDA to remain stable at &#x20AC;500 million, while dark and spark spreads will continue to rise. We now expect a delay in the gas netback parity versus the prior years, up to 2023, but yet again, with sparks and darks spreads growing, slower than the past, but still growing. In Slovakia, we are forecasting a stable EBITDA equal to &#x20AC;800 million. All in all, Russia and Slovak Republic continues to maintain their profitability levels at a stable scenario.</p>
          <p>Let's move to renewables. We're currently investing in new capacity for almost two gigawatt, which one gigawatt would be delivered during 2012, thus reaching at the end of the year a total of net installed capacity of 1.1 gigawatt, stable load factor at 40%. Under this scenario, EBITDA is expected to increase to about &#x20AC;1.7 billion in 2012.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, on 2012-2016, let me give you an update on the plan assumptions. Starting with 2013-2014, mature markets are expected to gradually recover and emerging markets will continue to show growth performance which is reflected in higher electricity demand.</p>
          <p>Our balanced mix of markets leaves us with place &#x2013; well-placed to benefit from growth in emerging markets while consolidating our positive &#x2013; our position in mature markets &#x2013; mature areas. One important feature is the CO2 scenario. And the good news is that we are balanced. As you all know, CO2 price scenario is strongly affected by decisions of the European Union, which are currently under discussion. You may have heard about setting quantity aside.</p>
          <p>Let me also remind you that total cumulative emissions at the group level during the 2012-2016 amounts to a total of 350 million tons. Nevertheless, a large part of emissions are already covered by our internal portfolio. In fact, total CO2 credit portfolio, including international offset and EUY in the period of 2012-2016 amounts to 207 million tons. Furthermore, the mix of generation imply a natural balance allowing the nat short position in Italy to offset the natural long position in other countries. In particular, the natural short position of GEM is almost completely hedged up to 2015.</p>
          <p>Now let's move into our strategic focus of the plan period. Consistent with previous years, our priorities for the plan period remain on maintaining our leadership in mature energy markets; delivering future organic growth from developing markets in Latam, Russia and Eastern Europe as well as on renewables; accelerating our efficiency plans and ongoing operations of excellence; keeping tight control on CapEx spending; providing leadership in cutting edge technologies; and finally, pursuing a strategy of net debt reduction to ensure our long-term financial stability.</p>
          <p>More specifically, let me direct your attention to mature markets, starting with the Italian operations. Given the economic scenario that we have commented earlier, our major tasks in the Italian market is to maintain a focus on the operational excellence and CapEx optimization. This will be achieved through a number of actions like maximizing synergies and continuing with the implementation of our Zenith project, working capital optimization, as well as focusing on upgrading and improving efficiency of the existing fleet, protecting margins through hedging, and portfolio optimization.</p>
          <p>We'll also strengthen our leadership in the free market pursuing selective growth opportunities in mass market and small/home office segments. This will go together with a tight attention on maintaining cost leadership and quality of service to final customers. Finally, we will not miss the ongoing use of innovative technologies developing smart grids and electric mobility tools.</p>
          <p>Turning to the overall financial targets in this division, the result of this plan will be approximately &#x20AC;7.1 billion of CapEx in Italy between 2012-2016, mainly focused on investments in regulated activities, characterized by stable, high-returning established by the authority, and maintain investment in generation. We've also maintained a steady floor of &#x20AC;5.3 billion of EBITDA in Italian operations.</p>
          <p>Finally, Iberia, we'll manage our relationship with regulators. We'll continue to focus on maximize synergies and executing Zenith plan. Our CapEx program will be characterized by selected just-in-time investments. Our reorganization in distribution segments is progressing well and will complete during this plan period, helping to increase overall efficiency of the operations. Lastly, with all of these initiatives, we'll strive to maintain high standards of service and continue to modernize our grid.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the overall financial targets for the division. During the plan period, Iberian CapEx will mainly focus on investments in distribution activities providing higher profitability, installation on new digital meters and favorable insular scenario in terms of electricity demand and new capacity, in particular in the Canary Islands. Also medium term growth in Iberian operations EBITDA will be driven by regulated business demand and price recovery.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the attention to the growth markets, Latam. In Latam, we'll consolidate our leadership position through a number of initiatives. In generation, we will add about one gigawatt of capacity and prepare ground for more investment in the outer years. In distribution, we will add 1.8 million new clients in the period. We will achieve new regulatory model in Argentina possibly, pursue control chain simplification and companies consolidation. We will also continue to focus on maximizing synergies in the Zenith plan as well as operational excellence. And finally, in line with our overall goals, we will optimize cash flow through selective investment policy.</p>
          <p>The result of this will be CapEx program focused on building new capacity, Bocamina II, El Quimbo, Talara, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:27); enhancing our presence in the area leveraging about 1.8 million customers to be connected, as I've said. And these investments will be supported by a favorable regulatory environment, encouraging investments in distribution to follow increasing connecting demand. Latam EBITDA will benefit from demand and price increases, new capacity additions and a generally favorable regulatory scenario.</p>
          <p>Next, International operation, which we'll seek to strengthen the existing marketing positioning. In Slovakia, we will focus on organic growth and margins protection, leveraging on our know-how and technological expertise and increasing our market position in the Centrel area. In Russia, our focus will be organic growth through investment opportunities in CCGTs as well as in the improvement on our existing fleet reliability, efficiency, and fulfillment of environmental commitments. All of these will help us strengthening our position on the international operations.</p>
          <p>More specifically, within these two markets, we will be selectively deploying capital to completing the one gigawatt of new nuclear capacity in Slovakia during 2013 and 2014 and some refurbishment investments in Russia on coal and gas generation. Taking into account international operations performance, EBITDA will be driven by higher volumes of electricity produced, thanks to the new capacity entering into operations in 2013 and 2014, favorable improvement in the generation spreads, and in the specific case of Russia, the opportunities of gas supplies to OGK-5 power plant from our 20% in seven Energia fields which will provide additional price benefits and hedge gas supply risks.</p>
          <p>In this regard, let me also add in the next few weeks, these seven Energia fields will start producing, which will be extremely good news for all of us in the second half of the decade, will account for about one quarter of all of the non-gas from gas produced in Russia. Just to give you an idea how strong our position will be at that point.</p>
          <p>Finally, on renewables operations, the maximization of value through the leverage on continuing shift investments from mature markets to emerging ones and managing the pipelines selectively, establishing operation and maintenance, world-class know-how and leveraging global business development and EPC teams set up in the last few years, monitoring the evolution on new technologies like concentrated solar thermodynamic and small biomass and developing new predictive tools in hybrid plants.</p>
          <p>Our investments in renewables during the plan period will focus on increasing our footprint in those areas where the combination of resources availability and need for additional energy create a sustainable platform for renewables regardless of regulatory support. This will ensure an increasing diversification of existing footprint towards markets outside Europe. The CapEx plan is confirmed at &#x20AC;6 billion and will lead to about 11.6 gigawatt of total capacity installed by 2016 versus the 7.1 gigawatt at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Against this macroeconomic backdrop in investment plan, what are we doing to secure value creation? Over the next few slides, I will outline a clear program of actions aimed at increasing our presence in growth markets, offsetting the challenge of our mature markets. Within our mature markets, we will invest in new pumping storage opportunities in Spain, backup capacity and efficiency projects in Italy. We will also leverage high value-added and innovative project based on smart meters and electric mobility among others. And finally, we will utilize our customer base as a platform to enhance revenues.</p>
          <p>Moving to our growth markets. Our investment strategy in these markets will serve as a tool to deliver overall profitability growth at a group level. This will be accomplished through adding 4.5 gigawatt of capacity in renewables, 1.1 gigawatt in Latam, one gigawatt in Slovakia, and some refurbishment investments in Russia, as we already commented; leveraging technological and geographical diversification across the group; pursuing supportive regulation to enhance profitability in Latam; improving efficiency in regulatory businesses.</p>
          <p>We will also take the opportunity to reassess the mix of our capital allocation to current economic environment, with a more focused and effective CapEx program, through investment allocation and efficiency that will bring lower CapEx in mature markets and the new efficiency project called Optima CapEx, adding another &#x20AC;1 billion of cash savings.</p>
          <p>Let me focus your attention, if you wish, on efficiencies, starting with Enel-Endesa synergies program. We have reached &#x20AC;1.3 billion target as for 2011. And this level would be maintained throughout this plan and beyond. In addition, we'll continue to deliver our Zenith programs which will contribute about &#x20AC;6 billion of cumulative cash in the period of 2009-2015.</p>
          <p>On top of these programs, we have launched another initiative which we call One Company Project, which aims at establishing a lean holding together with centralized global service units. This initiative will bring yearly cost savings at the tune of &#x20AC;400 million starting from 2016.</p>
          <p>Now, what does all this mean for our group in terms of financial targets? First, dividends. As long as the current situation of financial constraints and lack of liquidity in the financial markets persists, the dividend payout will tend to a gradual reduction on dividends payment for all subsidiaries. Under these new policies, Enel Group will distribute about &#x20AC;11 billion to shareholders between 2012 and 2016, of which about &#x20AC;3.5 billion will go to our minorities. We believe this approach will allow us to ensure growth coupled with long-term financial stability, despite the difficult macro environment and to enhance cash flows available for the net debt reduction.</p>
          <p>In fact, through the action we have outlined today during the plan period, we will increase our capacity for net debt reduction to &#x20AC;14.5 billion versus the &#x20AC;9 billion in the previous plan. To summarize what this means for our overall financial targets taking into account the macroeconomic factors we discussed at the start of this presentation, we have revised our short and long-term targets.</p>
          <p>Our 2012 EBITDA target stands at &#x20AC;16.5 billion rising to &#x20AC;19 billion by 2016. Ordinary net income is projected at about &#x20AC;3.4 billion for 2012 rising to &#x20AC;5 billion in 2016. This increase will be supported by growth in developing markets as well as the initiatives we have taken to sustain margins, drive efficiency and cost savings, all across the group. Financial discipline is a key feature of this plan. Our prudent approach to CapEx and dividends will enable us to deliver nearly &#x20AC;15 billion net debt reduction by 2016.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by saying that most of the uncertainties, if not all, on financial distress and fiscal policies are now over. And we remain confident that through the managerial action that we have put in place, Enel will be well-placed to pursue long-term growth.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. And now, let me move to question-and-answers.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So let's start with questions, reminding that we have people here in the room but also questions from people connected on the website. I remind you that this event is being broadcasted live on the Web. So first question here, maybe Susanna Invernizzi, Lehman. Can stand up please, Susanna? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Susanna Invernizzi, Barclays unfortunately, not Lehman. It is now. Well, I have several questions. First of all, if you can elaborate a little bit more on the reduction of the GEM target for EBITDA in 2012? So how much is associated to spreads, demand, and other &#x2013; eventually other issues?</p>
          <p>Second, on the CapEx plan, again, if I may have more information on the CapEx reduction, so which were the main area of reduction versus your previous plan? And also looking at your available lines, maybe if you can give us little more details on the term loan that you have raised in February, the duration and any details on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we answer right away? The GEM targets obviously are influenced by the impact of this double effect of the overcapacity coming from the photovoltaic growth. Dramatic expansion of photovoltaic had the impact on us because it is working at the peak hours, shaving to some extent the extra pricing that you might get during peak hours. And the other impact is coming from the effect of this gas situation of Italy. This combined creates this five gigawatt of &#x2013; sorry, five gigahertz of spread, which is missing in 2012 versus 2011.</p>
          <p>Demand is not growing that much. It's stable and therefore the combination of all of this is definitely a lower EBITDA. Is this a transition versus more bad news? No, I would not consider that to be a moment of passage. It will be in my view in terms of possibly the bottom because what we might be seeing the next year a slight increase of demand. What will I see &#x2013; we'd like to see? A bit more of gas markets being driven by the LatAm countries. There is no infrastructure to make leeways for more spot pricing gas into the market. And the slowdown in the growth of the photovoltaic is also another positive element. So all in rate, I think, when we say that the margins will be a floor of &#x20AC;5.3 billion EBITDA in the plan, we are pretty confident this might be the outcome.</p>
          <p>Let me speak about CapEx reductions. We applying here the just-in-time principle. We had and we still have wonderful projects to be deployed in terms of expanding our presence in the Italian market or the Spanish market, but demand is not thee to justify for the time being. So you can easily postpone those investments, complete the existing ones, and therefore having a well-balanced position and the commitment you have today versus what you might take in the future.</p>
          <p>And on this, again, our driving towards supporting more the regulated business, not only in Italy and Spain but also in the fast economies &#x2013; fast growing economies on South America, is giving you the idea that we are allocating a bit more capital into distribution. We maintain our renewable &#x20AC;6 billion of CapEx because we believe there is a wonderful resource available in those economies that we are in the space of, the Americas, for instance, and the remaining portion will be those investments &#x2013; those selective investments in generation and distribution capacity in the mature markets, which will bridge the gap between now and the moment when the overall demand will continue to see growth, even in Italy and Spain.</p>
          <p>That's the combination of all decisions that we have been taking on the &#x20AC;27 billion of capital. It's lower than the past because there is less of a need of incremental capacity since demand is not growing. So it's no-brainer. It's an easy decision to take. When it comes to the term loan, Luigi, can you talk about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the opportunity to update you about what we have done during the course of the first two months of this year. In total, we have raised about &#x20AC;7.3 billion of funds with an average maturity of six years and with a cost only of about 4.8%. This is including, of course, the bond retail issuance, some private placements and the term loan facility you were talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question. Roberto Letizia, would you please stand up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Roberto Letizia from Equita SIM. Lot of changes so need to better understand what are the underlying assumptions of the plan. And the first need I have is understand what the rating from a credit perspective you have used for the plan? So if it's still A or BBB+? And in case you changed the assumption over there, if you can better let me understand what's the impact from both financial and operational side, meaning how much of the debt have step up clause, for example, on the rating and the cost of debt? And if there is any operational impact, for example, on the hedging activities on the forward sales on the rating impact, anyway which rating has been used?</p>
          <p>And then especially for with regards Spain, which kind of assumption has been used in terms of possible regulatory revision to be taking in the few month, if there is any? On the CapEx, a follow-up from Susanna, just better understanding. If you can give us the split annually for 2012 and 2013 on the CapEx and if specifically your CapEx assumption exclude any investment for Porto Tolle and Porto Empedocle in case it includes how much of it? And that's it for the moment. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me tackle the first question you have. You have to consider the situation the world is at this very moment and in particular Europe. The newspapers are full of news about what's going to happen to Greece, what has been the major concerns in sovereign funds, sovereign debt, global comp out being approved, being referendum, being I don't know what. I don't need to remind you the overall conditions of the economies we're living in. We are reflecting a dramatic change. We've been lucky and able, more than lucky, to be resilient in the past few years. When the crisis have been biting the cheeks of many different players in the market, we have been resisting because we had the good combination of assets, because we had a diversification of markets, because we had cost savings programs going on.</p>
          <p>But with the continuing trend, negative trends of the economies, if we will not be changing and adapting ourselves to the changing world, you would have looked at us as fools. We're not fools. We're sensible managers working for the long-term value creation for our shareholders and bondholders. And that's what we're trying to give you as a message today. This plan is predicated not on single ratings, predicating on the ability to carry on with growth, maintaining financial stability, namely being able to prove that no matter what's going on in the world, whatever financial crisis will occur, the company will be up and running and possibly increasing profitability as we do plan to increase profitability.</p>
          <p>And this has got nothing to do with the rating. I do believe that what we have here is a plan that will justify &#x2013; amply justify single A rating. But if the Italian Republic is going down to BBB, as other countries are suffering for the same downgrading by Standard &amp; Poor's, should we expect to be an exception? You'll have learned over the years that it's difficult to stay above one single country level.</p>
          <p>That's the key assumption that we're making. We are making the assumption that no matter what the overall world will look like, a year from now, two years from now, three years from now, we stand up with our programs, plans, CapEx, cash flows to benefit from the many opportunities that the market will continue to deliver because we're selling and generating electricity. We have less volatility in other markets because we are an energy company with a composite yet performing asset managers that can deliver. So stay tuned with this and we'll get to you good news.</p>
          <p>Spain, I didn't get to the answer but we have here...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have other regulatory in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have the top officers of Spain in the name of the Chairman and CEO and they can deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the question was on what kind of assumptions on regulatory issues were made for the plan and the &#x2013; actually the only way we could do it and the way we did it is assuming that the present regulatory set up would continue throughout the five years. So in other words that distribution will continue to be reattributed according to the Decree 222 issued last year that in so far as generation is concerned that the domestic coal so to say protection Decree is going to go up to the end of 2014 as foreseen that the Garona Power Plant will be shut down in 2013 as it is foreseen that the access &#x2013; new access fee will be paid by generators as it has been established. And that finally the new European regulation concerning emissions from large power plants will be implemented as well in Spain in the near future in that the efficiency programs and the social tariff will be financed by the large electrical utilities up to the end of 2013.So the assumption is that this will continue consistently throughout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me answer to your third question about differences in CapEx comparing the new plant versus the old plant. Well, first of all, the major efficiency is &#x20AC;1 billion efficiency which is the Optima CapEx project. Then we had placed different capital allocation, in particular, in the mature market namely Italy. I am referring to the delay of Porto Tolle also due to some authorizational issue. Different projects are delayed in some project in Spain to take into account also the current demand, current consumption. So all together, we are showing &#x20AC;4 billion difference, which is mainly located starting from 2014 onwards because in the meantime, we are finalizing most of the already committed projects for supporting our growth. Optima CapEx is not going to affect our growth projects but it will be fully dedicated to optimize the management of our mandatory and maintenance activities across the world.</p>
          <p>If I may just integrate to what Mr. Conti said about possible or what does it mean in terms of additional cost to us, if &#x2013; or should we be downgraded to BBB+? Well, the impact will be manageable. We are talking about 15, 20 basis point maximum on our total cost of debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may on this subject to avoid any further confusion. If that would happen because the Italian Republic is BBB+ and we might be downgraded, I don't know, we might be seeing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:07) as announced by the newspapers, I don't know in the near future. I do expect this to remove one thing that is creating anxieties on some of you, the negative outlook. If it's going down to BBB+, it has to be with stable outlook. That removes the uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Now we have declared to you all of the negatives. The flow of negative news are out. Now it's up to us to improve the situation. Now it's up to us to carry forward with our programs, with our investments. We're always taking care with decent returns as offered by the new dividend policies to shareholders and at the same time, coupling, as we say, the growth with the strengthening of our balance sheet. That's what we need to do. But we are here to tell you as usual in a transparent way what the overall assessment of our position is. And if this downgrading will occur, it will have resolved one of the anxiety of the markets because this will be transformed into a stable outlook for all of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question. I think we have Banca Akros. Will you please stand up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dario Michi, Banca Akros. The first question is on the domestic generation activity. So in the presentation that you expect a deterioration of the environment till 2014 and then a recovery till 2016, I'm wondering which are the drivers on the basis of the recovery given that there is the CO2 impact and then recovery in demand starting from 2014?</p>
          <p>Then the second question is on Russia. Russia is very positively contributing to the current results and in your presentation, I saw that you have increased the CapEx related to each part in comparison to the previous one, while the EBITDA contribution is expected to decline versus the previous one, I'm wondering which are the reason why this change?</p>
          <p>The third question is on the gas market. I would like to ask you if you can give us an overview on the gas market and which are the season about the Gas Project and Porto Empedocle regasification of terminal, I'm not understanding if we are short or long for gas in Italy? And the last question is about CO2. How do you see the CO2 dynamic in 2013? Do you expect any change like you it is in UK, for example, with the minimum price or which are your expectation on this? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will ask the colleagues to intervene from the floor to give you the answers. But in general, I would say in the reversal the CO2, you might be reading the papers that European Parliament passing through amendments which will instigate potential offsetting aside on the ETS market. And I think I still believe and also as President of Eurelectric, I will be supporting that to be the right decision. I mean the overall ETS functioning is predicated, has been predicated in the past in free allocation. Now with the option system, you need to have some sort of the balancing factor, and this will be the <mark type="ph" /> set sign (01:01:51) more than the UK decision to go for the minimum carbon.</p>
          <p>There are good expectations of that European decision might really be transformed into a directive. When it comes to gas in Porto Empedocle, we running it on the investment on Porto Empedocle. It will take time but we are running. We are working right now to in the early works of the project, so we continue to commit ourselves for that specific project. As we indicated, we have postponed the Port Tolle decision for two reasons. One is that there is no permit up until now. We're still fighting with the administration for that but it will not be necessary to abide right away because there is no demand. So there is no brainer decision to postpone the decision waiting for the authorization, by the way.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Russia, we have indicated to you that we are "conservatively" assuming that the push incremental price of gas for the inland market will be slowed down where the net back parity reached in 2020, 2023 as opposed to 2015 and 2016 as was originally planned.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we are projecting a curve of our pricing to be higher as, less higher than we used to assume in the past. Is this impacting our strategy in Russia? No, because it's still profitable. We make a vertical integration case of excellence there with sourcing our own gas with combined cycle working at the new efficiency level of 56% to 60% yield versus the average 30% yield of the competitors' assets. So we have a technical advantage of higher margins for ourselves, thanks to the investment we made. There are other opportunities as well.</p>
          <p>We also have a 50% of our generation mix which is coal, therefore giving us additional advantage with the balanced position of gas combine cycle, higher efficiency and coal. We have sales activities in the Russian market. Today, you can sell into the free market at about RUB1,000 or RUB1,100 or RUB1,300 depending on the peak hours of the day. And this will make a decent profits today and as the instigation of price increases of gas will continue even after the election of Mr. Putin, I think this will also be confirmed. That will give us additional margins altogether. And all the customers we are selling to, paying the bills. So, we have a perfect cash flow situation. Now, here is Mr. Mancini, who is the GEM Director that can stand up and speak to you about the gas situation and tell you what we do expect, and why is it so that we see the margins 2015, 2016 the way we see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, yes, thank you. Let me give you some information with respect, first of all to our outlook when it goes to spark spreads, evolution and margin's evolution on generation. As we have heard, we are taking prudent view, we are taking a view which is the reality today facing the fact that these spark spreads reduced quite significantly though we still need to recall the fact that still the Italian market stays at very strong premium vis-&#xE0;-vis all the Northern European markets, Continental European markets. Nevertheless, we've seen spark spreads eroding from two digits into possibly one digit in this year. And this is a consequence basically of what we've been seeing before and of the fact that the drop in demand, the slow recovery of demand has a strong impact on prices. There is a very high level of sensitivity, if you want, from demand into prices on the spot market.</p>
          <p>What we're seeing for 2013 and possibly by the end of 2013 onwards, we are seeing a decent recovery on demand following the GDP growth. That is the most significant aspect we need to face, to address. In order to see the improvement in margins we definitely trust it will take place, starting possibly in the second half of 2013 and then onwards.</p>
          <p>This is true for power. We have seen also the view &#x2013; we've taken also the view of gas market in Italy and in Europe, but namely and specifically in Italy, which is to some extent long to answer your question. We see market today in gas in Italy has been a long market with pressure that has been transferred to some extent on prices, wholesale prices and also prices for thermoelectric production.</p>
          <p>The level of reduction is not huge. The possibility for the market to reaccommodate the long position are there but will take probably again sometime before we see the effect of that. We imagine that kind of effect might come over the second part of the present decade. So, we see oil index prices as they are today to stay stable over the next two, three, four years. But basically the increase in demand in power 1% roughly on a yearly basis and in gas 1% roughly on a yearly basis will drive the improvement of our margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have a lot of question coming from the web, before going back to room, relating to the expected evolution changes in the Spanish regulatory framework; in particular, a lot of guys are asking about the fact that we could, if we expect changes in the structural or in the level of the tariff systems, going forward. And this &#x2013; if this could have an influence over the payment or delay, cancellation, over the accrual tariff deficit going forward? So, maybe we can make some clarification on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say the answer will be definitely, no. There's not going to be a change in the tariff deficit repayment which is 60% done already. But let me ask <mark type="indiscernible" /> (69:25) if they want to add on &#x2013; if you want to say something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, definitely nobody today can say what exactly will happen. What we know is that the solution, structural solution to the huge problem of the tariff deficit ranks very high in the priorities of government. And we know that the next couple of months will be probably critical for that.</p>
          <p>Having said that, for sure, we project that there will be a component in that solution for tariff increases. All of us, all of those who have made even simple calculations know that more or less over the two years concerning the tariff, the excess tariff which is more or less half of the last resort tariff, there's &#x2013; there would be a need overall 35% to 40% over the couple of years increase which would result into more or less 50% of that that is between 15% and 20% on the overall tariff.</p>
          <p>So whether that is going to be politically acceptable or not, it's not to us to say, technically, it will be absolutely acceptable. But if that is not going to be fully done, then there are a number of other measures which could be taken and which will be able to solve the tariff deficit. I'll simply recall what we have been proposing that we have been summarizing during the recent result presentation of Endesa. Of course we not consider any haircuts, if that was the kind of the question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's get here. Alberto, would you stand up please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. I have four questions please. The first one, could you give us your perspective on the gas market in Italy. You're talking about oversupply, but prices are still 20% to 30% above European LNG levels. So, is your plan accounting for the recent revision Eni had with Gazprom; and are you envisaging any change, any reform from the government given the liberalization push that is ongoing, and what do you see there in terms of risks because I guess, any reform would &#x2013; attempts to bring prices down?</p>
          <p>Secondly, sorry to go again about the tariff deficit in Spain, but it's supposed to be something like &#x20AC;5 billion this year for the system as a whole and politicians have openly talked about sharing the burden of the deficit between companies, consumers and government. So sharing suggests perhaps some sort of risk at your end. So can you elaborate a bit on the sensitivity, what you think might be this type of risk for Enel?</p>
          <p>Third question is maybe it's not the right moment to ask, but do you have any sensitivity on demand just in case this 1%, 1.5% doesn't come about, maybe demand stays flat until 2016, energy efficiency, macro situation, you name it, and that will be helpful?</p>
          <p>And the last one is more strategic, I'm trying to pick your brain, let's say that, again, it's a scenario analysis, but let's say that the macro situation is worse, let's say that demand isn't growing that much, let's say you've regulatory intervention in Spain. In your mind what would be your response to a further deterioration in the macro situation, I'm thinking of disposals, I'm thinking of perhaps considering script dividend, given it's also fiscal situation in Italy? And just to see how you would rank any reaction to any further exogenous deterioration? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, said some interesting questions, as usual, Alberto. Gas market, I think we addressed with the intervention of Gianfilippo Mancini. But let me repeat, I mean, the gas market in Italy lack of other infrastructures, such as new gas lines, new regasifiers will be dramatically impacted by the long-time contracts which are driven by <mark type="ph" /> SeverEnergia (74:14), Gazprom, Eni and ourselves coming from past indexed to oil and this might be difficult to convince, an Algerian to say, you know, you have to change your contract because there is a different price in the United States of America, thanks to shale gas They don't reason that way, they's say you have a contract, you have an obligation, you have commitment, therefore, you are continuing to toke or pay because of the lower demand, there's been a incremental pressure on the take-or-pay side of the contracts. And this has created a bit of a price war to some extent that has reflected, as we commented already.</p>
          <p>Can we see this ongoing for the future? Yes. There is a chance. There's also a chance that people will be able and &#x2013; attentive on the way they manage their position and we also are attentive. We can possibly use with intelligence to some extent our availability of LNGs. We can take advantage of the different pricing in the world from the $5 in the United States to the $10 over here, to $15 in Japan; and therefore &#x2013; there's a lot of these things going on out there at the moment.</p>
          <p>So, for the short-term, I don't see a major change in the situation in the Italian markets for gas. And even the government invention, which is translating into unbundled Snam Rete Gas from Eni. I don't think this will have an impact on the pricing at all to be honest with you. I mean the price is determined by the ones who actually drill the holes in Russia or in desert of Algeria and deliver it.</p>
          <p>The other point about the tariff deficit in Spain, I think, you are following close what we are saying, loud and clear. Tariff deficit can only be cured by raising tariffs and showing the cost to the consumers. That's our position. That's our stance. That's what we are dealing on a daily basis with the local governments. And for us there is only one way, which is, you have to honor your commitment, which they are as a matter of fact, and they're paying back all of the existing deficits and they're recognizing the remaining portion of the deficit to fill up the &#x20AC;24 billion. Of course, Spain is passing, as Italy, as other economies in the recession mode. And therefore they need to cure state deficit. They have a harsh time in reducing that deficit and they have to find solutions for that in economy that is not growing that's extremely difficult.</p>
          <p>So we sympathize with the government, actually they're doing very well, as Italian government is doing very well. So no complaints about the way the governments are acting. But we are saying electricity sector has already paid the burden for that. We've been financing this for the time. Therefore now, for them to be as they are credible and reliable vis-&#xE0;-vis the financial markets which will have to subscribe their bonus, bonds or BTPs or whatever. They have to honor their obligation. And therefore we counting this wise approach by wise politicians and governors. So for the time being, we're not taking any specific view on the sacrifice they might be asking. Sacrifice will have to come from the tariff increase because this is a cost that is not being reflected and has to be reflected.</p>
          <p>The point about sensitivities in demand, again, we have sensitivities on the downside and the upside. We tend to prove our conservatism by using more those on the downside than the one on the upside. But if you will go around these days in Spain as in Italy, you would see economists are saying, well, maybe we are really passing through the most difficult times over the last decades with a bouncing back of the economy in the second half of the year based on export driven economies, China, United States, Latin America, the economy is growing. Export being one of the key feature of our economies, Germany and Italy are good examples of that. Demand will pick up. We all hope that will be the case. But we're not planning on this. We're planning on stay flat. Can this go below this? If it does, what's going to happen? Well, first of all, you've seen that we protecting ourselves with all the liquidity of this world. We're safe and sound, no problem, no panic.</p>
          <p>If demand goes down, what will be the consequence for us? I mean, in Italy, we have the best generation fleet. No one else has the mix that we have. We have the coal, we have the hydro, we have the gas, when and needed. Therefore, we will be the last one to suffer from that. So, even if demand drops, I do expect this gentleman in the energy management here to be able to use at our profit the flexibility of our fleet. And therefore, I would not see that to be a dramatic case of study for us. This &#x2013; if the demand is growing, well, on the contrary, results in a much higher margins for all of us.</p>
          <p>Do we need to sell other stuff? Well, you see in the &#x2013; maybe you noticed that, we still have assets to sell, smaller assets. You might remember few weeks ago, we have disposed the final 5% of <mark type="ph" /> Terna (80:55), I think we did well on that. We have other smaller assets that we can dispose. We have &#x20AC;1.8 billion of disposals in our programs. We also have &#x20AC;1.3 billion of reshuffling of our participation to buy back things, so that we have a better cash flows coming to us at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>Do we need to do more? To be honest with you, no. But there are many things that we had eventually, if this situation gets worst and the countries go belly up and the Maya calendar is true, and therefore, we have the end of the world. Before that, we can sell some assets which are liquid in the market. But I don't believe in the Maya calendar, therefore, I'm not contemplating anything specific. Am I answering your question Alberto?</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Pablo Cuadrado from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Three quick questions, the first one is on the Infrastructure segment in Italy, looking the guidance that you have provided today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope, right now, it's going to be better. The first question was on the distribution in Italy on the Infrastructure. In the guidance, you have presented some kind of &#x20AC;400 million drop on EBITDA for the next year. Wondering if you can give further details in terms of lower return or other issues that you have considered to see that drop?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the cost of debt. Assuming that you maintain the single A rating, could you let us know which is this better cost of debt for 2012 and during the plan? And the third question will be on the Generation again. I'm trying to understand what is being said today on the 2012. I've been listening weaker demand, also in solar installations, et cetera, &#x20AC;5 drop in spark spreads. But looking the production of CCGT's last year in Italy, which were 17 terawatts, &#x20AC;5 spread is only like &#x20AC;100 million. So, trying to understand a little bit better the gap of that &#x20AC;600 million on the Generation? And basically, I don't know if you can provide us, which is the Generation margins, on net margins that you have for hydro, coal and CCGT in order to weight to that number. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, many questions on the &#x2013; I will ask Luigi and others to answer into the detail. But the key fundamental assumption we are taking as again out of conservatism is that in distribution in Italy there will be, as you know, regular intervals of regulations activities. We just, of one, which will give us four years of visibility on the tariff and there has been basically no change in our tariff structure, no hair cuts has been generated.</p>
          <p>Now, being conservative, we're also assuming that down the road, there is going to be another round of regulatory revision and that then we might suffer in hair cut, in reduction on the tariff. It's an assumption. Maybe it's conservative, because we think as we were expecting to negotiate "to offer" the visibility on the numbers that we are carrying that our Regulatory Asset Base deserves a level of tariff, which is adequate to reflect the investments profile. This will be the case also for the next round of negotiations &#x2013; sorry, revisions with the regulators in 2014 and 2015. And at that point in time, if we are able to demonstrate what we can demonstrate, there will be no such things as a reduction. But, again, being conservative, we're assuming this might happen. And therefore, we try to give you the best scenario, the worst scenarios, not the best scenario, okay?</p>
          <p>Now, on the remaining question, who want to answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Very briefly, when it comes to our cost of debt, we have assumed in our business plan an average cost of 5.3%, 5.4%. Now, if we look at what happened in the first two months of this year, when we raised, as I said before, &#x20AC;7.3 billion at an average cost of 4.8%, I think we are in a good shape now. Should we assume for a while that we are downgraded to BBB+, as I said before, the impact on our cost would be marginal. We are talking about 15 to 20 basis points maximum. So I think we are in the range that we can support during the course of the plan.</p>
          <p>Just to integrate what Mr. Conti said, the explanation in terms of your numbers of Infrastructure and Network results in 2011 versus 2012. Well, we have two, let's say, non-recurring component here, if we can call it non-recurrent. In 2011, we have recorded about &#x20AC;200 million of profits coming from the connection activities due to the boom that we have seen in the installation of the solar photovoltaic's small power plants. And this is expected not to be repeated during the course of this year. So this has to be &#x2013; this is part of the explanation.</p>
          <p>Second one, regards the fact that during the course of 2011, we have released some provision regarding the personnel. And we had a very stronger and very positive results in managing the quality of the service render that it is not expected to be repeated in 2012. If you take this out, basically, the &#x20AC;3.9 billion that we are reporting in 2012 is substantially in line with 2011 results, because we had no cut due to the change in the regulation. And when it comes to Generation and Energy Management 2012, I think Gianfilippo Mancini would answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm pleased to do it. Spark spreads, yes, you're right. We have been producing and we expect we will producing roughly 17 terawatt hours of energy in our combined cycle. But, as you know, the Italian market is a system marginal price, where 50% of the generation is out of CCGTs. And therefore, all the remaining technologies are price taker out of that. So you need not to consider 17 terawatt hours as a reference, but the whole generation, which going back to 2011, was 65 terawatt hours. Out of which, we have 33 of coal, 17 of CCGTs and 15 roughly of hydro generation. So the reduction, the drop of &#x20AC;5 megawatt hour in CCGT price was price spark spreads go directly throughout all the technologies. This is the fact. And seemly a reduction in the gas price, assuming a stable reference for oil indexation, again, reflects into a reduction in margin throughout all the technologies. Having said that, I strongly confirm the fact that our generation fleet is today in a very beneficial position because we can take profits of our Torrevaldaliga Nord, our coal generation fleet. And looking at the prices of commodities of coal prices, specifically in these days, you have an interesting activity in keeping your coal power stations active. But mainly these two reasons the spark spreads and the gas drop fully explain the difference that we see for 2012 vis-&#xE0;-vis 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Anna Maria Scaglia from Morgan Stanley. Sorry to go back to the Generation thing. But I would like to understand what is your long-term power price assumptions that you are taking into consideration in the plan? And trying to understand what is the impact on the dark spreads, so is it is that &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour that you were talking is applied to the dark spread as well, or you are assuming a bigger impact due to the CO2 as well in the long-term? Also, when we talk about gas, Eni's been talking about contract renegotiations, some of the mid-stream operators have been talking about contract renegotiations. Is Enel acting in terms of trying to renegotiate this &#x2013; your contract? And also, can you just provide us a little bit of visibility in terms of your coal assumptions in terms of what is going to happen to your coal contracts?</p>
          <p>And the second question is about the growth in the other businesses that you have in the International divisions is just organic growth or there is something more? And maybe can you give us some granularity on the disposal of the &#x20AC;1.8 billion? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anna Maria, the disposals growth to the revert order &#x2013; reverse order, the disposals are including items that you have already heard in the past. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (91:49) we also have <mark type="ph" /> Ireland (91:53) that we're working on right now. We also have the CN, the transmission line from Brazil to Argentina. These are the kind of items that we're working at the moment. These are the tail-end of the major program of disposals that we have launched four years ago if you might remember, okay? Nothing special.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the coal &#x2013; sorry, to the International expansions, we are not planning any acquisition, if this is what you meant by that question. We are not planning any acquisitions, just organic growth. We are happy and content on the perimeter we have. There are plenty of things that we can deliver using the existing perimeter and we will be working on that. That is no acquisition, nothing like this. When it comes to the sparks and dark spread, you are hitting into the sanctuary into the mask we wear a secret of all our activities. So I'm hesitant to give you a very clear number. You have to kind of like help us in guessing what will be, if I may use this expression.</p>
          <p>But basically, the coal assumption is there. You have a chart, if you're facing, you see the chart that we have. We have a wonderful partnership with a company called Bayan that gives us coal among others, in very interesting conditions, high quality coal as you know. And coal will continue to see the assumption that you've seen casted out. Coal will continue to be a very important feature in our mix. If you assume that the spread on gas will be in the region of &#x20AC;8, &#x20AC;9, &#x20AC;10 megawatt hour, coal will be a multiple of that, of course. Now to give you the exact number, I won't give signs to our competitors that we don't like to give. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (94:28) to add something.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't buy gas from Gazprom. We buy gas from other sources. We buy gas from Algeria. We buy gas from Nigeria. We live happier with the Nigerian. We'll be happy with Algerian, but we're also negotiating with the Algerian to review the price. Up until now, we're still negotiating. And when there will be a revision, we will let you know. But for the time being, we're assuming that this is the price we have today. And therefore, we're working on that. You want to add something? Gianfilippo is always the one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just I might take the question that was raised before regarding price reviews also with respect to Eni, Gazprom, whether we reflect that renegotiation in our outlook. Just to say that, yes, the outlook we are looking at is the outlook of the market or prevailing market, so we take into consideration the effects of the ongoing negotiations. And also, I might add the fact that the &#x2013; what we hear, what we read on the press with respect to these renegotiations reflects the fact that there is a reaction in the market in terms of reducing &#x2013; increasing, improving the flexibility of these supplies in order to take account for a market which is becoming slightly long. And this, again, contributes to our vision of market stabilization in terms of prices and confirmation of all indexation contracts.</p>

          <p>Hello. Good morning. Francesca Pezzoli from Credit Agricole Cheuvreux. A couple of questions left. The first one regarding Enel Green Power, I see that you're broadly confirming the target for the company compared to the past plan. Don't you see electricity prices pressure affecting the profitability of Enel Green Power as well even that big part of the production is in Italy? And regarding Latin American target, what are your assumptions in terms of allowed returns there considering that you are facing some review in part of the regulated business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have Francesco Starace, who can answer that question. But basically, it is true that if we don't depend on incentive and subsidies, we depend on market pricing. Therefore, you've seen there has been a slight decline in the margins in Italy, because the price went down. But that's why we are investing in other parts of the world where resource is available. And the quality &#x2013; superior quality of the resource, 4,000 hours of wind makes hell of a difference versus 2,000 hours in geothermal in places which are not used to have geothermal like United States, so it's helpful for these kind of initiatives. But let's speak with Francesco on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We will perhaps go deeper in this on the 23rd. But they can anticipate to you that short term, Italy and Spain are hedged. So, we don't see an impact. Medium term, there could be some, but it's more than compensated by the growth we're having elsewhere. So, that's the reason why Enel Green Power has basically very little impact on this.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The point was on revisions on distribution in Latin America. Yes. Every year, we have at least one. We had already practically concluded the one on our operations in Coelce, the northern-eastern part of Brazil. That concluded with a decrease of the watt due to the lower country risk, but all the other elements were maintained at or even increased at more-than-reasonable levels, so that we have to take into account and that will be a hit of approximately &#x20AC;40 million to &#x20AC;50 million in the first year, that's 2012.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, this will be more than offset by growth in by savings. This year, 2012, we will have also a revision of Chilectra in Chile. We &#x2013; based on past experience and on the calculations that are pre-calculation that have been published, we expect a minor change there. It's too early to quantify, but we expect a minor change there. During the course of the plan, we'll have in a couple of years also the review of the tariffs reviews of Codensa in Colombia.</p>
          <p>And we expect there a mild reduction of the order of magnitude, if we can say, today, for a couple of years, at least that what we put in the plan of the order of &#x20AC;20 million. Then we will have also around 2015 of Edelnor in Peru, where we expect again a mild reduction. In Argentina, last but not least, we do expect and we need a quite substantial increase in tariffs for Edesur, starting with an important revision based at least on inflation and later on an integral review of the tariffs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Virginia Sanz de Madrid from Deutsche Bank. I would have a question on your dividend policy, which to me has been today one of the probably most disappointing news you have come up with, apart from the drop in guidance. This new dividend policy of the 40% payout, would you call it a conservative one, taking into account that potentially the outcome in Spain may not be the 20% tariff rise you are expecting and you are making a room for it? And if, perhaps, the situation in Spain doesn't deteriorate, do you think that this payout has room for upside? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The dividend policy that we have, for what I told you this morning is dividend policy is that maintains the principle of taking care of the shareholders, if you want. 40% floor means that if things are better, of course, we can revise it upward. We're not revising downward. But 40% layout means that if you remember the numbers for 2012, 2014 and 2016, that this might still offer a decent 4% to 5% yield on yesterday price, on today's price maybe even higher. We've been offering to you, as a shareholder, a range of wonderful bombastic yields. I remember 12% yield. And I would have expected you to come forward and say, give me your shares, please, because I like 12% return. This didn't occur. Why? Because there has been other factors influencing the share price, maybe; the overall economy, regulatory uncertainties and the likes.</p>
          <p>Now, we're saying &#x2013; in this plan, we are addressing that point. We're saying most of the uncertainties have been removed. I mean, beyond the Maya calendar, we don't expect any major disaster to occur. We're reaching the bottom. Maybe we can bounce back into more positive. But if we have hit the bottom, we don't need to dig, we need to scale up. And one way of scaling up is to reassess the correct positioning of our dividend flows. In a company that has many objectives, one to maintain shareholders as happy as we can, to create value for them, that continues to be a top priority.</p>
          <p>Secondly, to offer to all the bondholders the safe harbor concept that we have been praised in the past and we are, because we are continuing to deliver financial discipline; and at the same time, the expectation of growth. In markets that are not growing, we're trying to be more efficient with selective investment. In markets which are showing growth, we invest in it. The combination of all of these, in a compassionate and sensible way and with a solid common sense approach, justifies a dividend policy which ad-hoc meant to provide 4% to 5% return, even higher if the shares is lower, of course, and being seen as a floor. I think, long term, this will be appreciated by shareholders. I'm pretty sure, because the fundamentals are continuing to deploy and to demonstrate the ability of this company to be solid and a safe harbor for everybody.</p>

And then, I would like to have the contribution of RusEnergoSbyt on 2011 results, if it's possible. If on 2011 there is any release of provision, and then &#x2013; sorry, but I feel I was not being answered to my first question. So, the question on the rating, I'm not worried about the rating. I'm sure you're managing the company not respecting the rating. But I'm a poor analyst and I work with numbers, so the point you increased cost of debt is &#x20AC;170 million over three years and then you'll have the additional cost of the new debt for the maturity ending next year. So, these additional costs of an eventual downgrade have to be subtracted by your guidance or not? Thank you.</p>

          <p>First of all, I think the methamatics doesn't have the way you're calculating. But basically, what we are demonstrating with this plan that the free funds from operation into debt will justify a single-A rating. That's my personal belief. Standard &amp; Poor's may have different views, I don't know. We will see when they will publish whatever they will publish. But if I assume the way of thinking that those rating agencies may have is that even though they might say, you have a solid position to justify a single-A rating, then the business risk you're running in countries which are not showing growth, which are under scrutiny by the rating agency for their sovereign debt and what have you may lead them to downgrade us down to BBB, that's BBB-plus. If that happens &#x2013; again, I'm saying, if that would happen, it has to happen on the basis that they remove the negative outlook and we remain stable. So, we will be indifferent from whatever is going to happen at that point in time to the Republic or to the Kingdom of Spain. That's the basic concept.</p>
          <p>Now, we do have contracts. We have the Treasurer here that can prove it to you that we have &#x2013; do have contracts, which says that if you fall down by one notch versus this, you are going to pay only 10, 15, 20 basis points depending on the individual contracts. And this is applicable to the credit lines. It doesn't really change the structure of the cost of the bonds issued. So, the mathematic is there. You're right to say that if &#x2013; these 10 to 20 basis points are not reflected in these numbers. They are not. You have to do that. But these are, in my judgment, believe it or not, about &#x20AC;50 million. No more than that. Am I now answered your question or &#x2013; okay. Thank you very much.</p>
