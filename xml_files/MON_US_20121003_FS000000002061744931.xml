          <p>Greetings, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 Monsanto Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Mr. Hurley. You may now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the line. Thanks for joining our year-end earnings conference call. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; and also Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Commercial Officer. Also joining me are Manny Cruz, Bryan Corkal and Ashley Wissmann, my colleagues in Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address. We're providing you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis, where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and press release, both of which are posted to our website.</p>
          <p>This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is also included in the safe harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.</p>
          <p>With this call, we address the guidance and growth drivers for our 2013 fiscal year. With the fourth quarter results in hand, we generated 25% ongoing earnings per share growth for the full year. Likewise, our results for the year and the quarter track near the expectations we laid out in our third quarter update, so we've seen the growth from the areas of the business we expected in fiscal 2012.</p>
          <p>Given the focus on 2013, Hugh will start today with an overview of our strategy and how we're thinking about growth this year and for the long-term. From there, we'll have Brett Begemann walk through the operational drivers that gives us confidence in our growth expectations. And then Pierre will lay out the translation of that growth into our guidance and financial outlook.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand it to Hugh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line. We've been talking and planning for fiscal year 2013 for a while now. By any measure, fiscal 2012 was a compelling year. Today, however, we turn our focus to 2013 and what our continuing growth looks like. We'll also emphasize how that growth happens. I'll let Brett walk you through the details and the milestones of our operational plans for 2013 and my focus will be on how those growth drivers come together over time.</p>
          <p>There's three areas that I'd like to emphasize. First, the foundation for this growth is the success that we've had over the past two years and I'm particularly proud of what Monsanto achieved in 2012. We delivered 25% ongoing EPS growth and a record $2 billion in free cash flow. And that speaks to everything that matters to our business that reinforces the strong fundamental environment in agriculture, equally important, it's the proof point in our business. With the right growth strategy in place, we're executing well, we're focused on discipline and we're capturing the momentum in our business.</p>
          <p>That sets up my second point. Because that strategy is in full swing, 2013 becomes a logical extension of 2012. Driving growth is a continuation of what we accomplished this year and that reinforces our confidence in 2013. We've had back-to-back years of strong performance. That compounding effect means we'll build off a significantly higher base.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 5 where our ongoing earnings per share guidance range of $4.18 to $4.32 reflects mid-teens ongoing earnings growth from our 2012 endpoint. And 2013 is setting up nicely. We're carrying good momentum in the U.S., we're on the front edge of some significant acceleration in Latin America and the latest harvest data that we will share with you today reinforces our confidence in our products.</p>
          <p>A month-and-a-half ago as many of you were standing with me in a field in Illinois for our Whistle Stop Event, I said at that time we thought that even as overall yields would be down, the relative showing of our products would be good. Now with the data and that's exactly what we see. Our yield advantage is shining through even in one of the most difficult seasons on record for our growers.</p>
          <p>And finally, as good as I feel about this year, I feel equally good about our opportunity over the horizon of the next five plus years. As our growth is more global, we're adding a couple of new layers coming online each year. The intersection of our current business and our R&amp;D pipeline gets even more exciting over the long-term as we roll out significant new platforms that reinforce our opportunity as a yield company.</p>
          <p>In this past year, we tested Intacta and DroughtGard and our new Ground Breakers program, we added our Integrated Farming Systems and our BioDirect platforms and that's a compelling opportunity that's balanced in the near-term and offers significant upside in the longer-term, giving us a strong view on how our growth shapes up well beyond 2013.</p>
          <p>I also recognize that the opportunity for Monsanto in 2013 plays out on a much larger stage. With this year's terrible drought that underscores how stretched the world's grain resources are and that reinforces that the drivers of agricultural productivity are real and they're ongoing. The world needs sustainable productivity growth and that creates a tremendous runway for agriculture.</p>
          <p>We've emphasized the point that we're a yield company and whether it's the business performance that drove our growth to this point, or specific opportunity in 2013, or the long-term promise of our pipeline, what drives us is our ability to deliver yield in more ways than anyone else in this industry. That opportunity clearly begins in 2013 and on a call like this, the details really matter. So I'm very pleased to have Brett with us here today. In his role as President and Chief Commercial Officer, Brett is leading our near-term growth initiatives so he's in the best position to walk you through these growth drivers in more detail.</p>
          <p>So, Brett?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to have the chance to join you this morning. As Hugh said, my focus is putting the operational plans behind our growth so I'll highlight where I'm focused and how I'll measure success. I'll also echo Hugh's overall sentiment. Given the strong performance in our business and the momentum we carry into 2013, we're in a very strong operational position to deliver growth. Let me start with slide 6.</p>
          <p>We expect the drivers of our growth in 2013 to be reassuringly familiar and we expect the growth will be divided fairly evenly between our core U.S. business and our accelerating international opportunity. The first part of that 2013 growth revolves around the U.S., which continues to be the anchor for our business. That starts on slide 7, as we'll continue to drive trait upgrades and mix improvement as we build out our platforms in corn and soybeans. In 2011, we tipped from emerging opportunities to established platforms for both Roundup Ready 2 Yield in soybeans and the <mark type="ph" /> Refuge Reduction Family (8:42) in corn.</p>
          <p>We expect to step-up Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans again in 2013 reaching a range of 39 million to 41 million acres as we drive penetration in our brands and reach a critical mass among licensees. Likewise, we expect approximately 36 million to 38 million acres for the Reduced Refuge Family in 2013 as we expand the offering of Refuge-in-the-Bag across all three of our products in that family.</p>
          <p>As we drive the annual upgrade of our seed portfolio to the latest high-value germplasm, we're also well positioned to continue the gains we saw this year. With returns now finalized, we can definitely say our U.S. branded seed volume grew by the largest increment in the last three years. With share gains of more than 1 point in both, branded corn and soybeans, our volume growth exceeded this year's market size expansion. That sets up for continued volume growth in 2013. That also plays out in price where the mix benefit of our portfolio upgrade drives our opportunity.</p>
          <p>With our pricing cards out and plans in place, we see a total portfolio price lift in corn in the range of 5% to 10% from this upgrade and the biggest driver is the mix effect as this is less about price pass-through on apples-to-apples products and more about the opportunity created when we leverage our R&amp;D engine to bring new, high yielding products online. With the seed production capabilities and infrastructure we have, we're also confident in supplying seed for the coming year. It's obvious that our business planning is happening against a backdrop of this year's devastating drought.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, as farmers turn toward next year, seed is a priority. As I think about seed availability, 2013 is set up to be remarkably similar to 2012. Last year, storms and heat stretched our seed production. This year, it was drought. We've built our overall U.S. plan based on the reality that 2013 corn acres are likely to be in the same 96 million acre range and soybean acres could potentially be higher than this year's 76 million acres. You'll see some natural cost pressure in a production year like this but that balances against our hedging strategies, some cost pass-through and the continuation of higher acre ranges.</p>
          <p>The final piece of this U.S. look is perhaps the most important and that's performance on slides 8 through 11. With the dry conditions, corn harvest moved more rapidly so there's more corn data available earlier this year. Soybean data is still coming in but the anecdotal feedback has been good again this year. I won't do a deep dive but let me give you a snapshot of the early results.</p>
          <p>First, on slide 9. In a year when overall U.S. corn yields are down significantly, DEKALB's relative yield advantage is as strong as ever. In fact, the lower yields magnify our performance and this year is trending to be our second highest percent advantage in the last decade. It's a relevant data point because when DEKALB shows up this well in a tough year, I believe it cements our reputation for performance. Farmers see DEKALB shine in high-yield years and outperform even in the lowest yielding years, so they're seeing a degree of consistency in bottom line performance that influences purchases for many years.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide 10, this is a new layer of data this year. As the industry matures and each seed company uses different trait combinations, I believe farmers will focus even more on the bottom line yield performance regardless of the trait package. And you see in areas like the South and the Central Corn Belt where data is in, our DEKALB products consistently out-yield the commercial products sold by our competitors reinforcing our position as offering the premium, highest-yielding total package.</p>
          <p>If I move to slide 11, one of the highlights of the regional look is our DroughtGard Ground Breakers results particularly in a year like this. We compare our DroughtGard Hybrids specifically against the competitors' drought-marketed products. In this head-to-head data, the DroughtGard Hybrids will commercialize from Ground Breakers showed a yield advantage of approximately 5 bushels an acre. That reinforces the value of having a combined system of traits and germplasm and puts us into the commercial track for 2013 as DroughtGard becomes our next offering for the Western Corn Belt.</p>
          <p>And before I leave the yield data, I'd make one final point. At this time of year, we get a lot of data from the U.S. because of harvest, but the trends and yield advantages we see in the U.S. are transferable to our international regions. Very simply, the differentiated performance in the U.S. comes from the strength of our germplasm and our ability to apply capabilities like markers and chippers. Logically, we're doing those same things in markets from Latin America to Europe. That strong performance translates directly to leading positions in the key countries and continued opportunity to grow our volume globally.</p>
          <p>And that's the perfect segue to the second half of our growth: the international opportunity. This is an opportunity that's been in the shadow of the U.S. business for some time, but in the last couple of years we've really seen some critical drivers emerge that shine the spotlight on our growing global growth. That begins in Latin America, an area where we see acceleration in 2013. In particular, we expect the continued ramp-up of the corn opportunity in Brazil and Argentina will become one of the single largest sources of growth in the next few years.</p>
          <p>It begins in Brazil on slide 12. The rapid trait growth to-date has been driven on just initial trait penetration. But as we look to 2013, we'll get a double-shot of opportunity as we expect to both expand absolute penetration and continue the upgrade cycle. One of the keys for the growth is the upgrade to the first true double stack called VT PRO 2. We expect that to step-up from a small amount of our mix in 2012 to the second highest volume trait in our portfolio in 2013. That's important because the trait gross profit lift, as we upgrade to double stack, is between 70% and 80% per acre over our first-generation product.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, we have one of our largest seed footprints. And on slide 13 you can see the key for the 2013 is upgrading that base from the double stack to the triple stack. We expect VT Triple PRO will be more than one-third of our branded mix in 2013.</p>
          <p>Like Brazil, the upgrade is important, as there's a 20% to 30% trait gross profit lift over the existing double stack. Both Brazil and Argentina also follow a similar pattern to the U.S., where the portfolio turnover drives a germplasm upgrade as well. And with the rapid upgrades going on, the collective Latin American mix upgrade is actually moving faster today than in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The summer corn seasons are still shaping up in Latin America. Practically, with the commodity ratios favoring soybeans today, we expect corn acres in the summer season to come down some from last year's peaks. That's balanced by the second <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:37) season, where acres are expected to ramp-up. Despite some of those acre shifts, early indicators for our business are showing up extremely well. In particular, the orders we have track squarely with our expectations for both total trait penetration and the expected trait upgrades for 2013. That means we're tracking well against our overall plans and with the deliveries rolling out now, we'll see that positive trend in the first quarter results Pierre will cover.</p>
          <p>Corn drives the 2013 opportunity in Latin America, but soybeans will come online over the next few years as a new layer, so it's an opportunity we're building plans for today. That soybean growth really revolves around Intacta and it reflects how far we've come in building a system since the early days when Roundup Ready soybeans were grown illegally in Brazil.</p>
          <p>As many of you have followed, there have been legal challenges over the past eight years in getting a royalty collection system in place for Roundup Ready 1. Our position has been upheld by multiple Brazilian courts, but the challenges continue. Just to emphasize, these suits are centered on Roundup Ready 1, not Intacta. We recognize that the various cases will continue through the legal system, and that takes time, but practically everything is operating as usual with Roundup Ready 1 and we continue to feel confident in that legal process.</p>
          <p>If I shift to the growth opportunity, we're on the front edge of the opportunity for Intacta, shown on slide 14. While this year is financially immaterial for earnings, it's a major strategic jumping-off point for Intacta. We see Intacta as a step-change for farmers, and farmers' own data for our Ground Breakers program showed yield benefits of greater than four bushels an acre and helped create more than $80 in new value on every acre. We're using 2013 to position ourselves for a rapid ramp-up when we expect to hit the broad commercialization in fiscal 2014. Most importantly, with in-country approvals, we can build on the initial Ground Breakers testing from fiscal year 2012 while we finalize everything ahead of commercial rollout.</p>
          <p>This year, we have expanded availability of varieties and overall acres with more commercial growers. We reach more customers and a larger geographic region, which builds the base of customer experience. At the same time, we're building the seed and varieties we need to be in a position for next year. Taken together, that extra customer experience and focused commercial preparation puts us in a good place to make sure we showcase Intacta's breakthrough benefits when it hits the commercial stage.</p>
          <p>The last highlight I'd offer revolves around another key piece of our global business, and that's our germplasm growth on slide 15. In 2013, growth in the corn business isn't limited to top-of-mind geographies like North and South America. We also expect the corn business to grow in conventional seed markets, ranging from Mexico to Western Europe. The best near-term example of that 2013 opportunity is Eastern Europe, on slide 16. The corn footprint in Eastern Europe is as big as Brazil and it's expanding. In the past few years, we've effectively doubled our share, outpacing a growing market. Just like the U.S., there was a significant drought in Eastern Europe and the rebound expected next year, as corn acres continue to remain strong, provides a strong backdrop for one of our fastest-growing businesses.</p>
          <p>I've focused on the drivers at the heart of our core business for 2013. From an operational standpoint, we're focused, we have a consistent strategy, and we're entering the year with momentum. The last two years have been important in confirming our strategy and reigniting growth, and that's one of the strongest sources of confidence for me, because we have the tools we need to drive growth, we just have to focus on execution. And that means our growth is backed by strong operational plans. We've turned an important corner as a business and we're focused on turning the momentum we've started into real growth in a growing global business.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand the time over to Pierre, who will give you the specifics of how this translates to our guidance outlook for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everybody on the line. Today I'll focus on translating the fiscal year 2012 endpoints and the priorities Brett described into the core elements of our earnings and cash guidance for 2013. But before I do so, let me start on slide 17 and summarize my views on where we stand from a financial point of view.</p>
          <p>First, as Hugh and Brett said, we are seeing our growth continue and we expect mid-teens ongoing EPS growth in fiscal 2013. This is growth off a higher compounded base and it speaks to the strong engine we have in place. But in my role, I also like to note that we've built our plans in ways that accommodate the normal variability in agriculture and when I step back, I feel good that our guidance is based on growth that's balanced and achievable. Second, we continue to be able to translate our earnings growth into free cash. The efficient translation of earnings to cash is always a focal point for us, so the reality that we have generated approximately $2 billion in earnings and $2 billion in cash in 2012 is a compelling proof point for me. And third, as we translate the operational plans Brett described, we're certainly becoming more global, more diversified and that is creating better balance and flexibility for us. Our business profile is now more global and this gives us the opportunity to manage variability and meet our underlying earnings commitments.</p>
          <p>I think the best way to see the translation of the 2013 operation plan Brett laid out into guidance is to walk you through the key lines of the financial statements on slide 18. If we start with the bottom line earnings, our ongoing EPS guidance range tracks the mid-teens growth after FY 2012 endpoints of $3.70 per share which translates to $4.18 to $4.32 per share for fiscal year 2013. Above the line, we expect our Seeds and Genomics gross profit will continue to grow. In 2012, our Seeds and Genomics gross profits crossed the $6 billion mark for the first time coming in at nearly $6.1 billion. For 2013, we'll build on that new level as we expect to reach segment gross profit in the range of $6.55 billion.</p>
          <p>The strongest driver of our segment growth in 2012 was our corn gross profit and that will be true this year as well. With the continued build-out of the U.S. and the acceleration in Latin America, we expect double-digit gross profit growth from our corn business. That is complemented by contributions in growth from soybeans, vegetable and our other seeds and traits crops. After a challenging year in 2012 for vegetables, we expect the beginning of the return to growth with a modest positive GP growth contribution beginning in 2013. So we expect this growth to be offset somewhat by cotton. As commodities favor corn and soybean acres in 2013, we expect significantly lower planted cotton acres in the U.S. and that will reflect on our cotton business performance.</p>
          <p>The other above the line contributor is expected to be Ag Productivity. For fiscal year 2012, Ag Productivity generated $986 million in gross profit with year-over-year growth that reflects strong performance across the board. We achieved strong volume and mix in Roundup, we've had another good year in our lawn-and-garden business and we are seeing some growth in our selective chemistry offerings. Our 2012 results confirm how we think about ag productivity. We've reset the strategy and now it's really approaching a steady state. We've seen a positive lift in the gross profit as we've been able to implement the strategy we laid out two years ago and we have delivered on execution. For 2013, we don't see significant shift in the strategy or financial profile for this &#x2013; from this year and we expect total gross profit for the segment in the range of $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving below the line, let me now highlight another key area on the financial walkthrough. For our expenses, we are focused on maintaining our discipline so our spending grows at a lower rate than our top-line and that creates leverage for bottom-line earnings. As we look at the operating expense lines of SG&amp;A and R&amp;D combined, for 2013, we expect those to grow at a rate lower than our sales growth. We ended 2012 with SG&amp;A at about $2.4 billion, which was consistent with our revised guidance during the year. The year-over-year uptick reflects the acceleration of our business during the year as we use some additional SG&amp;A in the form of commissions and some investments in our people, structure and organization. Going into 2013, we expect SG&amp;A to be in the range of $2.55 billion.</p>
          <p>On the R&amp;D line, we ended fiscal year 2012 with an R&amp;D spend of $1.5 billion, which also reflected our expectations of higher spend with our revised guidance during the year. We were able to make some incremental investments in R&amp;D in 2012 to speed the development of key projects like our Latin American launches and new platforms like our Integrated Farming Systems and BioDirect work. Since we made those investments in 2012, we expect only modest incremental growth in 2013 with total R&amp;D spend in the range of $1.53 billion.</p>
          <p>The final factor in our earnings guidance is the tax rate. With the year end rate right at 30% for fiscal year 2012, we expect our annual tax rate will maintain a similar range in 2013 at 30% to 31%. If I bring all those P&amp;L elements together, let me tell you how I see the trends that drive earnings for 2013 on slide 19.</p>
          <p>First, I expect that our Seeds and Genomics gross profit growth will be split almost evenly between the U.S. and our international regions. We may see the balance of that growth tilt towards one side or the other based on the actual business performance throughout the year, but as I look at the big picture of growth, there is good overall balance as the strong growth rates in international regions like Latin America provide a nice complements to the expansion of our larger core business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Second, as I look at the components of the 2013 growth, they are the same sources we saw driving our 2012 performance. The largest contributors are mix and volume. On the mix side, the technology adoption portfolio upgrades Brett described drive this opportunity. And we will complement that with additional volume growth as the expansion of our base business in key geographies continues to drive nice overall volume growth for the company.</p>
          <p>That sets up my expectations for the flow of earnings throughout the year on slide 20. The first proof point of the operational drivers comes in the first quarter. Last year, we saw significant increase in earnings coming through Q1, as Latin America became a larger contributor. This year, we see similar significant growth as we project Q1 to be another pronounced increase versus last year. And that reflects two big factors. The most prominent is the acceleration of the corn opportunity in Latin America, as the trait upgrade cycle continues the trends we saw beginning last year.</p>
          <p>Adding to that, in 2013 is some positive timing and shifts in the flow of the U.S. business which means we expect to see more of the U.S. growth showing up in Q1 this year. With the trends to early order, we expect the possibility of some earlier shipment this year and we are also seeing some overall structural shifts as more seeds is moving in the first quarter as our volume grows and we manage the logistics around getting seed placed in the distribution system.</p>
          <p>The majority of our earnings still comes in the second and third quarter as they reflect the large markets in the northern hemisphere including the U.S., but with the shift in the U.S. seed positioning benefit in Q1, the growth in those quarters would proportionally be lower although we still expect an increase for the combined Q2 and Q3 period over last year.</p>
          <p>The last piece I will cover is the outlook for free cash flow on slide 21. We generated a record amount of free cash flow in 2012 generating more than $2 billion in total free cash. That is important not just because it's a record, but it's actually one of the strongest indicators to me that our execution is translating the business opportunity into bottom-line financials. If you look at that $2 billion, what you see is that a good portion of our net income growth directly flowed through to free cash and that's a reflection of two key factors.</p>
          <p>Number one, our collections remained strong as the record free cash flow also reflects a record level of collections for the full year. Number two, in 2012, we maintained balance sheet discipline. We have a strong focus of working capital elements and we are able to see the benefit of the restructuring work we undertook over the past few years. That helped to offset the natural working capital increase you'd expect as a part of the growing business.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, we expect our business performance and discipline will continue to be reflected in our cash generation capability in 2013 and project free cash flow in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. With that outlook, we expect to continue the translation of earnings into cash while accommodating for the funding of growth within our free cash.</p>
          <p>I'd highlight a couple of key considerations. First, the driver for cash generation will continue to be our net income. Second, with the growth opportunities in our business, we have the confidence to make some incremental CapEx investments. As we grow our footprints in regions like Latin America and Eastern Europe, we will put some capital in place that will support our next rounds of growth.</p>
          <p>So while our CapEx has been tracking close to depreciation and amortization for the past couple of years, those incremental investments this year will mean CapEx is expected more in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. Third, with growth there's also some natural investments in working capital, practically, I expect these to show up as steps &#x2013; step-ups in inventory and receivables across our business. Logically, these will support our growth engine in seeds and traits globally and will help adjust through the steady state environment of our ag productivity business.</p>
          <p>Our 2012 performance positions us well to both continue our cash generation in 2013 and support our continuing opportunity, and this naturally leads me to how I think about using that cash. Because we are committed to converting earnings into operating cash, I view that cash as an important tool in continuing to invest prudently for growth in the business and return value to our shareowners. So we will focus our cash developments around investments and acquisition opportunities that build our business footprint and technology capability, but we will also maintain our focus on returning value to our shareowners through share buybacks and consistently paying out a portion of our earnings as dividends.</p>
          <p>While an earning calls &#x2013; while an earnings call like this turns the attention to the fiscal year in front of us, there are two pieces of context I don't want to lose as we lay out guidance. First, our priority in 2012 was to deliver on our guidance and we did that. With ongoing earnings growth per share of 25%, we have a strong business engine in place that sets up 2013. Second, as CFO, I want to see our business strategy translate to our financial statements. With the operational plans Brett laid out, we have a very good line of sight on the detail that drives our opportunity and that reinforces my confidence in our ability to deliver the next layer of growth in 2014.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Bryan for the Q&amp;A period.</p>

          <p>Just wondering &#x2013; I guess, I'll actually ask a non-fundamental question. Your &#x2013; you generated or you now $1.2 billion in net cash and your cash balance grew by $711 million and your dividend is $642 million, I'm just curious, I know you bought some businesses as well this year, I'm just curious, why not raise the dividend more than you have or what should we be thinking about along those lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks for the question, Vincent. Well, the way we have been thinking about our deployment of cash has been very consistent over the last couple of years. I mean we are committed to growing our business and as you mentioned, we've been making some investments and acquiring a couple of companies and this is still an area we are actively looking into. And in terms of the return of the cash to the shareowners, our board allowed us another $1 billion buyback plan and as you mentioned, we've also raised our dividends by 25% in the previous quarter. So we are very, very conscious of returning the cash to our shareowner in a disciplined way as well and one of the key things is the sustainability of the commitments we make. So when we raise our dividend 25%, we are very committed to continuing this growth and being very focused on that, but we also have to manage the opportunities we have on the acquisition side. So it's always a balance we have to maintain. We've been very active last year, I mean, actually over the last couple of years, we returned twice about $1.1 billion to our shareowners in between dividends and buyback and that's really something we are focused on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe Brett commented that the full season corn numbers in South America might be a little bit lower as farmers plant more soy acreage. So wondering if you could just talk about the profit implications there? And then secondly, what you might expect in the summer corn season and maybe the relative intensity of hybrid corn in both those seasons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob, thanks for your question. I think you really hit the heart of one of the issues that Brett talked about this morning. So I'll ask him to say a few words, but the way I think about this is we feel really great about the season. And as Pierre mentioned, we see the first quarter shaping up to be very, very significant. So if you don't lose sleep in the quarter and you look at the total season in Latin America, it shaped up real nice. Brett, maybe a few words between first season and second season corn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hugh. And Bob, I think that's something that's really relevant in South America is the fact that farmers have that option to look both at first and second season. So with the commodity prices pointing them towards soybeans in the first season, it &#x2013; many of them are going that way, which will put pressure on corn acres, but they have the opportunity to come back in the second season, where we expect that acres will rebound in corn, particularly in Brazil, to where you won't see such a substantial reduction for the whole year. But to Hugh's point, the season is setting up very well as we track our business, looking at how our orders match up with our expectations for our first quarter, we're very much on track.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have a two-part question. In your goals for the Genuity family in corn for 2013, you're up to 36 million acres to 38 million acres. Will you be roughly fully penetrated at that point, because that 36 million acres to 38 million acres, I think, is about equal to your branded corn acres in the United States? And secondly, I think your target this year was to grow your offshore gross profit at the same rate as your &#x2013; or to have your incremental gross profit be half U.S. and half offshore. How did you actually do, that is, you grew about $1 billion in gross profits, how much came from the U.S. and how much came from offshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll maybe ask Brett say a few words on potential and Pierre on gross profit. The headline, Jeff, on corn is, if you look at this year and you look at next year, corn is the driver for Monsanto. So corn growth is really our wheelhouse and we saw, Pierre, 25% GP growth year-on-year in corn. So it's doing very well and a big piece of that's the platform. So, Brett, maybe a quick word on platforms and then, Pierre, a dissection on domestic versus international?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. If you look at the U.S. this year, that's &#x2013; it's another significant step up in our Refuge Reducing Family looking at 36 million acres to 38 million acres, but that's not necessarily the end, Jeff. You should think about it in the context of the whole market and recognize that VT Double PRO RIB Complete is a part of that now, which starts to expand that bigger than where we used to be with the old triples, which is the measuring stick that often gets used. So, there's still growth beyond what we see that we'll go into this next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as for the breakdown of gross profit in 2012 and in 2013, the way we've been thinking about that is, I mean, we've got two growth engine; one in the U.S. and the other one ex-U.S., with the ex-U.S. growing faster from a smaller base and both in 2012 and 2013, we are expecting to see equivalent growth. The breakdown, as we mentioned is, will be depending on how the business evolves during the year, but we are really looking at those two engines to provide about the same level of gross profit growth.</p>

          <p>Just couple of things on Latin America, when do you expect the China approval for Intacta? And could the Intacta ramp be faster than any of your previous products because you would have had two years of Ground Breaking &#x2013; Ground Breakers trials. And related to that, if I may ask one more, about &#x2013; you mentioned that Argentina has been a challenge to get paid in Argentina, I was just curious about your gross margins in corn in Brazil versus Argentina? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, thanks for the two questions. So, the way I would think about Intacta, over 10 years we've learned that you never speculate on regulatory approvals or when they're going to come, but our position hasn't changed. So, 2013 is all market activity, so it's getting the product in more farmers' hands, getting on more acres, and continue and expose the technology of growers, and then 2014 is our commercialization phase.</p>
          <p>So, we've said from the get-go that 2013 would always be de minimis and that 2014 would be the year, and I feel &#x2013; I continue to feel confident, from a Chinese point of view, that we will meet that 2013, 2014 timeline in terms of expanding Ground Breakers.</p>
          <p>In terms of acceleration, it's hard &#x2013; we're talking about something happening in 2014, it's hard to say, but everything I hear from growers down there, there's tremendous enthusiasm; there's a lot of pent-up demand; they're now re-learning the system. It's an intuitive shift. So, I think it's going to be big and I think it's going to be big fast. And then in corn, quick words on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, regarding the specific question around the margin, P.J., regarding corn in between Brazil and Argentina, you're looking at very similar types of margin in both countries, because remember, the corn being a hybrid, you don't have the issue you had in Argentina with soybean. So, the value capture mechanism are about the same and the level of margins you're looking into are very similar in both countries.</p>

          <p>You've given your forecast for a flattish corn acres in the U.S. for next year. Do you think you can grow corn volume and gain corn share in the U.S.? And do you have the seed supply to do both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and yes. So, it's kind of interesting, because we're sitting here on the run-up to Thanksgiving and we're talking about flattish acres numbering 96 million acres.</p>
          <p>I think the country's got the absolute capacity to plant that much and there's a pent-up demand for that kind of volume, it's going to get down of what sort of spring the country has to get 96 million acres in the ground. But based on the momentum that we've established this year and looking at the performance differentials in our germplasm, we feel pretty good about our supply and we feel pretty good about our performance leverage. So, the early feedback from growers has been very encouraging, and I think the team has done a really nice job in our pricing. So, never done is done, David, but the set-up looks pretty good.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just very quickly, any comments on the impact of the Farm Bill kerfuffle on order patterns in the U.S. in Q1 versus Q2? And, as you look at the 5% to 6% advantage for DEKALB, as you look at the changes in your breeding platform, can that &#x2013; can you break out of that and get better than a 6% advantage versus your peers in two to three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the Farm Bill, no, I'd say no impact. Obviously, growers are watching it, but the headline this year was a really tough drought and a very early harvest and they're looking at knocking it out of the ballpark next year. So, there's an anticipation of support, but not &#x2013; I don't think it had any impact on order patterns. And then, Brett, if you &#x2013; I don't know if you have any comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, to the other part of your question, on the yields and the differential, we're obviously extremely pleased with the differential that we're seeing this year in a really tough year, which is really consistent with what we've seen in the outstanding years before.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind the point I made, though. As you go to fully traded products and you start looking at things like DroughtGard coming into our portfolio, Corn Rootworm III coming into our portfolio, we start to balance out that whole portfolio and we're looking at the absolute performance of the overall system. So yeah, I think there's a real world opportunity for us to continue to drive our advantage in the marketplace as we build out that portfolio of products.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You talked about slower opportunity next year in cotton in the U.S., which obviously isn't too surprising. Can you tell us what happened in this fourth quarter which looked a little light? And how much of that was India and what your outlook for India is next year, for cotton?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as you mentioned, the final results in cotton in the fourth quarter were lower than what we've seen in the previous year. So the first place to start with is something we have been talking about since the first quarter, this is the reduction coming from the pull-forward in the first quarter of some Australian revenues, which was accounting for about $0.05 of EPS.</p>
          <p>So this one aside, we had larger returns, actually, than we thought we were going to get in the U.S., so this has been driving part of the downside. And we've also mentioned the fact that in India, we were not looking at a great year there, and it's also been part of the equation. But the largest part definitely has been Australia, which we were anticipating, and then the pullback of acres in the U.S. and also, to a certain extent, in India. When we look at next year, we're looking at acres pullback of anywhere in between 10% and 20% across the globe, so that's why we are conservative and willing to signal that we are not expecting our cotton next year to be outperforming.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hugh, you obviously performed very nicely this year, certainly year-over-year and certainly relative to your guidance. So, speaking of that, what couple of factors would you attribute doing materially better than your original guidance?</p>
          <p>And likewise, as we look out at &#x2013; assume we have this call on October 2013 and you do better than your original guidance, what might be the areas of upside there? And conversely, should you not perform as well as your expectations, what might be the areas that might be the factors behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Frank. So, I am very pleased with the performance this year, and the point we made in the call is, 2013 is a continuation of 2012. So, I think from your question &#x2013; the logic flow from your question is, what we set up in 2012 in terms of performance momentum carries into 2013. Then if you dial that down a notch, a big piece of it is corn performance and obviously, a piece of that is driven by acres, albeit in a tough year, and we are anticipating that those acres will come back next year.</p>
          <p>So, it's the strength of technology, the performance of corn, the conservatism in our pricing and that sets up a momentum that we are getting. It's never done until it's planted in the ground, but the early feedback from our grower customers has been very positive as we look into 2013.</p>
          <p>So, that's how it's set up, and I'm delighted with the performance this year. I'm really pleased in cash generation. And the dilemma of how we repatriate that cash is a really great problem to have. But that's how I look at 2012 and 2013, is that the heart of this is corn, but the second one I would call out is really compelling performance in our soybean platform and we've been aggressively switching those technologies and that yield data's still coming in, Frank. We'll update you later in the season, but the early reads on our soybean platform has been very, very encouraging.</p>

And 10 years ago, hard to believe, we've been talking about Eastern Europe, but we see &#x2013; we're going to have to invest and we're going to have to spend CapEx to unlock those markets, but we see continued opportunity in technification in Brazil and Argentina and in the mid-term, we see real opportunity in Eastern Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hugh, wanted to follow-up on U.S. corn pricing and your outlook there. You've talked about overall realizations being up 5% to 10%. My understanding was, you were closer to 10% in 2012. Are you just being conservative this early in the season? Because I would think, between your genetics renewal, the mix upgrade and certainly even less discounting than last year, that there's a potential for further upside in corn pricing in &#x2013; or greater growth, rather, in 2013 than in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, thanks for the question. I'll maybe ask Brett to jump in here, but the way I would think about it is &#x2013; the pricing is done. It's largely done. So, it's communicated and then the &#x2013; and we were early communicating pricing this year, because it was important as growers were getting in the fields and looking at depleted yields, that they knew where they stood.</p>
          <p>So, we've priced our portfolio; the industry, I think, has pretty much priced now, Brett, so the upside is going to be on, I guess, how aggressive the discounting is and how swiftly the season goes. But we've pretty much baked that cake and it's &#x2013; the stall's set out in that 5% to 10% range one more time. So, it's going to get down to performance and volume, and also the mix effect with technification. We're seeing really, really nice lift as growers look for those high-tech, better-performing products. But, Brett, I don't know if you've got anything that you'd add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a short add on the end of what Hugh was describing on the mix effect is that, when you think about the 5% to 10%, that's what happened this past year to move us towards the higher end. It's the opportunity for next year as we drive to the higher traded packages in the marketplace that give us the biggest lift, and that's where we'll see that occurring. So, but all the rest of the details are out there, so I don't see it being significant at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Brett, just a clarification. You said corn market share up more than one. How much more than one? And was all that growth due to VT Double PRO?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all the growth was not due to VT Double PRO. It was a significant contributor to our growth, but it wasn't all that. Our entire portfolio grew very nicely across the whole U.S. this year and we're clearly up more than a point, when I look at all the numbers. But you know as well as I do, there's so many moving parts on that with what were the absolute acres and harvested acres, et cetera, et cetera. So, I feel really good about, it's more than a point, but to quantify it much tighter than that's difficult to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you'd say in corn and beans, probably the best year in the last three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. A question on your capital budget for fiscal 2013. If I look at the range of $800 million to $1 billion and take the midpoint there, it looks like it's up perhaps 35% to 40% versus the $646 million that you spent this year. So, just wondering if you could elaborate on some of the drivers behind that in terms of key projects and whether or not there might have been any deferral of expenditures out of 2012 into 2013? Just to help us understand the increase a little bit better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually, Kevin, and that's a great question and we tried to touch on it in the discussion previously. What we are recognizing today is that based on the strength we've seen outside of the U.S., both in Eastern Europe, in Argentina and in Brazil, I mean, we now feel very comfortable that over the next couple of years we're going to be needing more capacity to provide the market, because we've enjoyed real success in those three areas and this is where definitely we're going to be putting some steel on the ground to increase our manufacturing capacity in those area.</p>
          <p>And really, the comparison from one year to the other is linked to those incremental production capacity that we're going to be putting on the ground. So, that's really &#x2013; we are now at a point where we feel very comfortable that we can invest in those countries because we've got the market to support those capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just as a follow-up, Pierre, is it seed production that you're investing in? What sort of specific investments would you envision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this is definitely seeds production. I mean, it's <mark type="ph" /> dryers (56:35), it's &#x2013; I mean, really seeds manufacturing capacity that we are investing in; Eastern Europe, Brazil and Argentina.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. Just touching on the vegetable business, if you could kind of walk us through what type of growth rate you might expect for fiscal 2013? And when you think about kind of between Europe and the U.S. kind of where that growth is coming from? And then similarly, just on cotton, I know we had touched a little bit on India, but if you could touch a little bit on Australia as well, because that sometimes is a driver of this first quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael. Thank you. Pierre, maybe you can say a few words. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:24) veggies, this isn't going to be a breakout year, but it will be a return to normalization. And then cotton, there is a lot of moving parts between India, Australia and then shrinking acres here at home.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when we are &#x2013; looking at our veggie business, the way we've been planning, I mean, obviously within a range of different outcomes, but we're looking at single-digit growth this year for our veggie business. We've been redeploying our resources and you mentioned the U.S. and Europe. Actually, as we mentioned in previous calls, the veggie business is redeploying towards the Middle East, towards North Africa, towards Eastern Europe and we are reflecting those changes in our planning. I mean, we are expecting now that the Europe business will be stabilized. We are still seeing growth in the American business and most of the growth is going to happen in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe. So that's the way we've been planning. I mean, obviously, if there's any opportunity we'll be there, but that's the way we've been planning. So single-digit growth as far as our veggie business is concerned.</p>
          <p>Regarding Cotton, I mean you mentioned Australia as one key factor. So, we're not expecting the performance in Australia to be as good as it was last year, but we are still looking at high acres &#x2013; planted acres in Australia. There is water in Australia. It may not be as good as what we enjoyed this year. So, specifically about Australia, this is not the area where we're going to see the massive pullback. We'll see the pullback in the U.S., India mostly. So, that's the way we've been planning.</p>

          <p>And, Rob, this is Bryan. I think we are running just a tad bit long, so that's probably the last question we have time for. Maybe if we could shift to just a quick summary by Hugh before we close, so that we try to respect everybody's time here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Bryan. So, thanks again for joining us on the call this morning. I think as you hear our remarks and also the questions, we turn our focus to 2013 today and the opportunity that we see in the new fiscal year. And there is real opportunity in this new fiscal year. We are optimistic in how we see that playing out. So, let me try and summarize in three points how we see this setting up.</p>
          <p>First of all, we here at Monsanto feel very good about 2012. We've focused on our customers and we've recaptured the momentum in our business and we put together back-to-back years that underscore our growth mode. I feel equally good about 2013. As a continuation of 2012, we'll continue our strategy and that gives us a clearer line of sight on our growth than we've had in some previous years and that in turn reinforces our confidence. And finally, as we highlight our growth in 2013, it's growth that's really underpinned by strong operational plans and Brett covered some of them today.</p>
          <p>It's also coming from more sources on a more global scale and that obviously speaks to increased CapEx and expansion and that underscores what we see as our continuing opportunity against the backdrop of a world that needs more agricultural productivity over a long runway. So, thank you very much for joining us today and we look forward to sharing these plans as they unfold in 2013 with you.</p>
