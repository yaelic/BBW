          <p>Good afternoon everybody, and thank you for joining us for our call on the First Quarter 2012 Financial Results as well as the outcome of the April Renewals. Today's speakers are J&#xF6;rg Schneider, CFO; and Torsten Jeworrek, CEO of the Reinsurance Group.</p>
          <p>Same procedure as every quarter, we will start with a short presentation, which will then be followed by a comprehensive Q&amp;A session. And I won't spare you my usual housekeeping remarks. Please limit the number of your questions to a maximum of two per person in order to give everybody a fair chance. We would like to end the call at about 4 PM.</p>
          <p>J&#xF6;rg, now the floor is now yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We are back to normal after a strong first quarter with good operating performance across all segments, driven by a sound underwriting result and high investment result; we are well on track to meet our financial targets. Let's dive into the presentation with an overview of Q1 on slide three.</p>
          <p>The net profit of &#x20AC;782 million translates into a return on equity of 13.1%, return on risk-adjusted capital slightly below, at 12.8%. We have strong capitalization according to all metrics; for example, an increase of 4.8% in shareholders' equity, including higher unrealized gains and losses. We have an investment result of &#x20AC;2.2 billion on annualized return on investment to 4.3%. This is based on high net disposal gains. We indeed made good progress in most parts of our core business. Reinsurance property-casualty was 94.6%, with only 6.3% for major losses. Adjusted for major losses, the basic loss ratio looks rather high, but this is based on very careful reserving.</p>
          <p>Reinsurance life performed well with strong technical result of &#x20AC;150 million. Primary insurance segment came in with significant earnings contribution. We had an improving international PC business, which resulted overall in a combined ratio for the entire property-casualty portfolio of 95.3%. Munich Re is on track with stable operating result and slightly improved combined ratio. For the net result, this good development has been masked by negative currency effect.</p>
          <p>Please note that there has been a change in group segment reporting. As of 2012, disclosure in our segment reporting is without a consolidation column. In other words, it is more consistent and transparent because the intra-segmental items are not considered in the segment's balances anymore and therefore add up to the group result. The new form of disclosure eliminates that accounting and should make the real contribution of each segment to each line item and to the bottom line figures much clearer. You can see more details on slide four and on page 35 of the quarterly report.</p>
          <p>On slide five, you can see that Q1 2012 shows the highest profit over the last eight quarters and drastic upswing compared to Q1 2011. The decline of Other in the bottom right corner of this slide is due to a currency result of minus &#x20AC;103 million after &#x20AC;67 &#x2013; plus &#x20AC;67 million in 2011 and taxes of &#x20AC;159 million after a tax gain of over &#x20AC;600 million in Q1 2011. That means taxes were &#x20AC;771 million higher than in Q1 2011. So tax and currency result make up for &#x20AC;940 million swing in the Other result.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remains strong according to all metrics. Let's move on to the development of shareholders' equity on slide six. Overall increase of IFRS shareholders' equity of &#x20AC;1.1 billion and this is a consequence of the following: First, negative foreign exchange development mainly due to the weaker U.S. dollar; second, the high consolidated results; and third, higher unrealized gains and losses. This was mainly due to the spreads narrowing and positive developments on the stock markets.</p>
          <p>Also, our debt leverage remains low in spite of the temporary spike of the respective ratio which you see at the bottom of this slide. New subordinated bonds of &#x20AC;1.44 billion had already been issued at the end of March and are therefore included in that calculation. If we include buyback of &#x20AC;700 million of the old subordinated loan from 2003, which happened in April, the adjusted debt leverage would have been just below 9% &#x2013; 19%. We also intend to call the outstanding &#x20AC;1 billion of 2003 subordinated loan in 2013 and this will bring the leverage ratio back down to roughly 18.5%. And we then have the comfort of having no maturities until 2017. And all things being equal, we will also have no refinancing need for a period of at least five years, so four years from 2013.</p>
          <p>Our economic capital position has also further improved. We have higher available financial resources mainly due to the Q1 profit and we have lower risk capital requirement because of the rise in interest rates outside of the Eurozone. Our rating capital is strong. We have regained substantial low single digit billion buffer above AA requirements. Group Solvency I capital is in any case almost 2.5 times the required level. So all these varying metrics are currently pointing in the same direction. We are well equipped to seize business opportunities.</p>
          <p>Slide seven gives you the standard overview of our well-diversified investment portfolio. We have no new story to tell here. Total investments &#x20AC;212 billion, after &#x20AC;207 billion at the end of last year. We still have an emphasis on highly rated securities and we see only marginal changes in the asset allocation.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to diversify our portfolio to deal with all kinds of scenarios as the capital markets remain very volatile, we saw that in April and it's very obvious that this volatility will persist. We made net investments in the U.S. treasuries and in emerging market and supranational bonds. We slightly reduced our exposure to German government bonds and Pfandbriefes and bought Scandinavian, British and other covered bonds. We saw an increase in the valuation of Pfandbriefes, corporates, with the corporates compensated for by foreign exchange movements because we had a quite substantial U.S. portfolio here and an increase in the valuation of our equities.</p>
          <p>Let us move on to slide nine for the composition of our investment results. This totaled more than &#x20AC;2.2 billion, equal to an annualized return on investment of 4.3%. Regular income was stable in absolute terms, &#x20AC;1.9 billion. The return on investment on this regular income increased to 3.6% up to 3.9%. This is due to reinvestments at lower interest rates and due to the increased market value, also a consequence from low interest rates and narrowing spreads.</p>
          <p>We had relatively low write-ups/write-downs of &#x20AC;179 million, a strong contribution from net capital gains, but no excessive harvesting. Overall, the on and off balance sheet reserves even grew by &#x20AC;2.3 billion to &#x20AC;13.6 billion, that is 6.4% of our portfolio's market value. But overall, we achieved a total return on the portfolio of 8.7% on an annualized basis. Balance losses on derivatives due to equity derivatives must be seen in the context of rising stock markets. Then, we had a positive net balance of other income and expenses of &#x20AC;162 million and this includes &#x20AC;292 million from unit-linked business, which is irrelevant for our bottom line.</p>
          <p>As far as the segments are concerned, I will start with primary insurance at Munich Health, before I will hand over to Torsten Jeworrek for Reinsurance. Overall, we had stable income in primary insurance, slide 11, with primary property-casualty up by 2.6%, this is domestic growth. Primary life was down 4.8%, not surprising, and health insurance remained unchanged.</p>
          <p>On slide12, Primary life had a good technical net result. This was driven by an investment result with a return on investment of 5.5%. 1.4 percentage points of this is due to the already mentioned increase in value of funds for unit-linked policies. This is not relevant for our bottom line because it is fully compensated by an increase of the provision for future policyholder benefits.</p>
          <p>Also, we realized some gains as a buffer to give us more room for an active management where we regard this as being appropriate from a market perspective going forward. Therefore, the good investment result as well as the very good net result cannot be taken for granted on a recurring quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, primary health, slightly below Q1 2011. Technical result was down due to an extraordinary DAC amortization in previous years and higher medical expenses. Last year's investment result benefited from relatively high disposal gains producing a lower result in Q1 2012.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, property-causality primary insurance, improved technical result. This was achieved on the back of a better combined ratio which fell by 1.6% to 95.3% in total. Slide 15, combined ratio for Germany was worse than in Q1 2011, but better than for 2011 as a whole and we are confident that this can get a very strong year here again.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, the combined ratio of the international business nicely improved by almost 8 percentage points to 101.3%, still not totally satisfying, but clearly heading in the right direction. This was true especially for Poland, which is back to strong performance. Turkey improved, but it's still on its way. We sold as you saw our Korean subsidiary, which we bought in 2008. We were constantly struggling with the bad performance in a very difficult market. Some improvements were achieved, but we did not see a real chance to make it a sustainable success. The sale is expected to lead to a double-digit million burden on the P&amp;L, most probably in the second or in the third quarter dependent on the timing of closing which is not sure yet. Now, so this will put an end to an overall very bad experience.</p>
          <p>Munich Health, slide 18, basically self-explanatory. Strong top line plus 13%, reinsurance plus 11%, large quota-share transactions providing solvency relief to our clients. These continue to be the main growth engine for the reinsurance part. In primary insurance, we also show a plus 16%, mainly from our business in the U.S., Spain and the UK.</p>
          <p>Slide 19, bottom line is relatively small. Primary Insurance had been negatively impacted by the U.S. healthcare reforms. As you know, our private fee-for-services business has been particularly difficult after the reforms and we moved our business model more to an HMO type and we are very confident that we are on the right track here.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange and investment income movements had a relatively strong impact, here relative to the rather small numbers involved here, in Q1 especially with a negative foreign exchange result.</p>
          <p>So far with Munich Health. Now let me hand over to Torsten for reinsurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on slide 21 and we'll walk you through the Q1 results of reinsurance and later through the renewal results. And I'll start with the premium volume. In Q1, reinsurance achieved moderate growth of 1.7% resulting in a total premium of &#x20AC;6.8 billion. Big difference between life re and non-life. In life re, there is an unchanged strong development of our premium volume here in Q1 by 9.9%. What are the two drivers? About half, a bit less than half of this growth stems from our large solvency related life reinsurance transactions. This is basically still caused by the transactions written during the last year, since 2008. And some of the transactions written last year have been booked for the first time in 2012 in Q1. The remaining increase in life re comes from organic growth in one of our core markets in Asia.</p>
          <p>Non-life picture looks a bit different. Here, we show a slightly reduced premium volume by minus 2.7%. This result, and I think J&#xF6;rg indicated it already, is slightly distorted. Why? We have changed the premium allocation between the quarters in 2012 in one of our subsidiaries, New Re, and this leads in Q1 to a negative premium effect of about &#x20AC;300 million. In other words, without this distortion we would have shown a moderate premium increase in non-life too.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 results in life reinsurance, unspectacular on a very high level. Net result is reduced by &#x20AC;74 million. This is however completely caused by investment result and to position other result. Our technical result on the left part of the slide shows a very good and very stable development, &#x20AC;153 million. Please remember, our target for the technical result, our annual target is unchanged, &#x20AC;400 million. In other words, one cannot automatically project from this &#x20AC;153 million quarterly contribution to the annual result; there are always slight fluctuations, ups and downs. We think, however, our performance is great.</p>
          <p>Investment result, in the middle, is slightly reduced because of an over-proportional contribution of disposal gains in Q1 2011, so we come from a pretty high level in the year before. The position, Other results shows a slight increase due to lower tax burden.</p>
          <p>On the next slide 23, reinsurance property and casualty, of course, the result improvements, the net result improvements and technical result improvements you see here is a result of the normalized cat loss activity in 2012. The change of occurred cat losses between the quarters Q1 2011, Q1 2012 is in the order of &#x20AC;2.8 million. That explains at the end of the day. The investment result shows here deterioration, slight deterioration, but only because of an artificial improvement last year, which was caused by the additional investment result recovery from the cat bond Muteki by &#x20AC;211 million, remember we got this recovery on the cat bond transaction as a result of the earthquake from the capital market and of course it had at that time to be booked as positive investment result. The position otherwise results is reduced because of taxes mainly.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 24, I would like to discuss the development of combined ratio and the split of the combined ratio, back to normal, on a 94.6% level, the ratio from large losses, cat and man-made together was 6.3 percentage points, particularly the contribution from catastrophe losses was very low. We had only 1 percentage point contribution from that side, largest cat event in the first quarter was larger tornadoes weekend in February 2012 contributing &#x20AC;54 million.</p>
          <p>On the man-made loss side, we had this contribution slightly above average. This was mainly caused by negative run-off effects from former underwriting years. Sandy Creek was one of the losses I can highlight, if you would, I can highlight this a bit later. In other words, we could even have produced a slightly better combined ratio by about 2 percentage point if we could have avoided this negative run-off effect from man-made.</p>
          <p>I would like to underline the reserves from all our large cat losses occurred in 2011 and former years remain unchanged, there was no need to increase neither from the earthquake events nor from the Thailand flood.</p>
          <p>Maybe a few words about basic loss ratio, you see that here on the upper part, 57.4%. I don't know whether you are surprised or not, but this ratio is for us on an expected level, even if we show here the sort of deterioration when you compare this Q1 figure with the full year 2011, why?</p>
          <p>Remember, we explained our reserve policies here in the first quarter and I can also make this projection also in the second quarter that we do not show yet any &#x2013; of the expected reserve releases from former underwriting years. In other words, while we conservatively reserve related to the new underwriting years intentionally to build up the sort of reserve cushion for this uncertain years, we only make the decision about reserve releases when we have the full set of new data available and this will happen in Q3 and in Q4. So therefore, please don't compare this one quarter basic loss ratio performance with the full year. That is &#x2013; in that respect distorted. For the projection of our combined ratio target, remember we set about 96% as our target for 2012, this performance is in line.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I would now switch slide 25 to the April 1 renewal. Among the three bigger renewal dates, January, April and July, the April renewal is the smallest renewal, only 1.2% &#x2013; &#x20AC;1.2 billion volume was up for renewal. However, in terms of importance of our cat business, it's a pretty important renewal for our portfolio. And you'll see here that about 36% of that renewal premium was cat driven premium. Where does the premium volume come from? About 40% of this business stems from Japan and Korea, another 24% from Northern America, and the rest from various parts of the world and our casualty lines.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 26, the waterfall chart is a rough overview. You see here and I think the most important remarks refer to the price change and to the premium volume. The chart shows significant price increase, 5 percentage points and slight reduction of our top line. What are the drivers for these changes? First, we made deliberate decision to reduce underpriced business slightly because of the cycle particularly in casualty and aviation. I'll come to that later, and we also made deliberate decision at the end of the day to give up some of our proportional earthquake treaties in Japan and these were cases where the reduction of our envisaged loss of current limit was not achievable. I will highlight that a bit later on the next slide.</p>
          <p>As in &#x2013; on the result of these changes we gave, about &#x20AC;30 million premium volume resulting in &#x20AC;1.12 billion, and mentioned price increase of 5 percentage points. When we show this price increase that is our estimation of the net price change that means excluding all exposure changes and excluding a change in the portfolio structure and that's important to note, that means we give a price change for an unchanged mix of the portfolio between proportionate and non-proportionate business. You will see on the next slide that we have changed our business mix, gave up quite some significant portion of our proportionate business, increased our non-proportionate business. When you would additionally include this change in the portfolio mix, then the resulting economic effect leads to an improvement of about 8 percentage points instead of 5.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 27, I would like to cover the lines of business and segments. When you look into the chart, you see on the left side &#x20AC;1.2 billion premium volume, which was up for renewal below that figure, the 5% price increase and when you move from that figure in the line to the right then you will see here on the property a very significant price change of 14.2%. This is caused and driven by our earthquake catastrophe treaties in Japan, average price increase here was in the order of 35% including all treaties loss-free and loss-affected and then there were other price increases achievable under the separate storm treaties in Japan, about 10%, and similar amount under the U.S. catastrophe treaties also in the order of 10%, so very satisfactory picture, in line with our expectation.</p>
          <p>Second point and that is the figure below on the left &#x2013; that is a proportionate business in property. And here you see a 19.7% reduction, which reflects what I already mentioned, we despite price increases decided to give up about &#x20AC;80 million of our property business in Japan basically for the reason that we could not agree with the clients in these four cases in appropriate reduction of the loss occurrence limits under these treaties.</p>
          <p>Why did we consider this reduction of loss occurrence limit on the proportion treaties is a very important objective for the renewal? It has to do with the question to what extent we want to expose our shareholder to model uncertainty and it has to do with our changed view of higher earthquake probability further south in Japan in the region of Tokyo, which was a result of the 2011 earthquake.</p>
          <p>Our geologists tell us that 2011 earthquake resulted in new stresses in the ground, further south, and this stress will be released in one or the other way in the next three to five years. That can happen via the larger frequency of smaller earthquake, it can happen via bigger earthquake or few bigger earthquakes and considering that we thought the right mixture between price increase and improvement in conditions in that case our current estimate is of high importance for our renewal. So finally we gave up for treaties, in one case we could switch from proportionate to non-proportionate reinsurance and of course proportionate business means reduction in volume at the end of the day was finally deliberate decision.</p>
          <p>What else happened? In casualty, we gave a business yield particularly in the United States. The rate development of this business was pretty flat. Nevertheless, we run more and more into the problem that we, because of the flat cycle, cannot compensate the reduction of interest rates level in the mature markets by opposite increase, necessary increase of the prices and therefore despite achieving an unchanged combined ratio for that business, when you consider this casualty business economically, it reduces the profitability and we reached a point here where we had to give up some of the business in the United States.</p>
          <p>Aviation is more unspectacular and here the biggest renewal date will be the fourth quarter of 2012. Here we had to cancel one larger treaty because of the price. So considering that, we think that it's a very good outcome for the renewal and you should also keep in mind when we show price changes in the renewal, these price changes which we show are the changes after application of updated models. We updated our models both in the United States and in Japan, in the United States because we took over some of the proposed changes from RMS version 11 where the inland exposure is modeled in a more refined way leading to higher expected loss cost which is of course into the price increases you can get in the market.</p>
          <p>And similarly in Japan, I mentioned it's the higher expectation or probability of earthquake led to a model change for our portfolio for our underwriting approach and of course this higher expected loss cost in the future, they eat into the margins which we get, therefore our shown price increases might look a little bit smaller here.</p>
          <p>On the last page, slide 28, the outlook for the July renewal, July is the second big renewal in the year; $1.8 billion premium volume is up for renewal. The regions North America, Australia, New Zealand and Latin America are cat exposed regions and loss-affected regions. That means there is something to do in the coming renewal and we have a very positive expectation that the trend we achieved and the price increases we achieved one year ago will continue.</p>
          <p>That's from my side and I switch back or hand back to J&#xF6;rg Schneider.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Torsten. I will close with the confirmation of our outlook for the financial year 2012, this is on slide 30. Compared to the guidance given at our Analyst Conference in March, the figures are basically unchanged. We just show a slight increase in gross premiums written for reinsurance, which were &#x20AC;25 billion to &#x20AC;27 billion and are now &#x20AC;26 billion to &#x20AC;27 billion, so we narrowed the range in the upper half and this in spite of the new consolidation methodology where the intra-group business is eliminated.</p>
          <p>Apart from it, we increased slightly our ambitious results target for reinsurance, net result &#x20AC;1.9 billion to &#x20AC;2.1 billion now. And a bit more careful with regards to Munich Health. We stick to our net results target of &#x20AC;2.5 billion, such a good first quarter is not a reason for us to increase it because there is too much time ahead of us until the year end. And therefore, perhaps it has become more probable than before, but no reason to change for the time being.</p>
          <p>After Q1, the economic environment and the capital markets are still worrying and volatile. And we stick to our well-balanced investment portfolio, which has been dominated by asset liability management considerations. And in our view, this is no time for taking higher bets and becoming very courageous.</p>
          <p>The investment portfolio together with the liabilities should be well protected against extreme losses on a net economic basis and this is for us by far the most important. With our insurance business, we are well on track and we are committed to actively taking up opportunities in our business to keep it that way.</p>
          <p>With that, back to Christian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just wanted to understand broadly the group's risk or remaining risk appetite for property cat exposure over the remaining renewal season. I think just to remind myself here, to date you've reduced property cat exposure in Europe because you didn't think pricing was adequate, it looks like overall there has been a slight reduction at April renewal as well, does not free up more potential risk capitals, property cat to deploy in mid-year or maybe just give us a sense of what your remaining risk appetite is?</p>
          <p>Second question, on the covered bond portfolio, you talked about increased geographical diversification, I noticed some of that went into the French and Spanish covered bonds, and there has been slight rating migration downwards, very slight on the covered bond portfolio. Was the asset backing of the covered bonds you are buying and does your rating reflect the underlying financial institution or can you give us some sort of reassurance on what that rating reflects? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Torsten Jeworrek here, I start with your first question, appetite for cat capacity in the rest of the year. First of all, observation is right. We reduced Europe windstorm because of prices in January. As far as Japan is concerned, our risk appetite or the capacity we finally deployed remains almost unchanged. Why because, we gave up volume intensive proportion of business, but deployed some of that into catastrophe business.</p>
          <p>As far as the United States is concerned, July 1 renewal, here our risk appetite is basically flat. Though in other words, anticipating further price increases in the order of 10% or maybe slightly above, we plan to deploy the same capacity at least as far as U.S. hurricane is concerned.</p>
          <p>Why not more? If prices should further rise, because this as mentioned already, it's the peak scenario in the Munich Re group and our risk appetite is pretty limited here because any further increase of that peak risk leads to an over-proportionate allocation of risk capital and consumption of risk capital. And in other words we make then our pricing incompetitive in the future. Therefore, I cannot imagine that we deploy more capacity for U.S. hurricane.</p>
          <p>In the other parts of the world like Latin America, Australia and New Zealand, we basically have a risk appetite which is the function of the available price increases with maybe one exception. That is the Christchurch region; here we feel there is too much uncertainty in respect of further earthquake in the coming years. Therefore, we have here a bit more careful approach. That's it I think from my side.</p>

          <p>With the covered bonds, yes, you can see on slide 43 that we indeed have Spanish covered bonds. So there is a rating migration for these bonds from AAA to AA and partially from AA to A, so still a relatively high quality we see. And this is not only due on the underlying assets, but also on the liability of the issuer which is basically the big banks there, which are not only domestic banks, you know that. So therefore, we have an eye on it and we would not aggressively increase it at all. But we think that this is where the adjustable in our portfolio, Andrew.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The German-covered bond will, as you see also on slide 43, still be not the majority, but here it's 39% and we also increased it over, sorry, we decreased it somewhat, but we keep it on a very high level. So this is still our core asset in that class, but when you look at for example Scandinavian-covered bonds, we are not worried about their quality at all and this is what we mean by diversification.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much. I have two questions, please. The first goes back a little bit, but maybe you can help me, it's on the MCEV embedded value. Just to understand how you do your anchoring and what's the ultimate rate to use and what it would look like if you did it like Allianz. I think they use an ultimate rate of 0.2%.</p>
          <p>And then the other question is on Korea. So there is a loss coming, but clearly it's been making a loss. What's the net effect of the loss to come, whenever it does come, and exiting the business, in other words not having the recurring loss. Can you give an idea of when, how much stop loss we get and maybe a timing? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, on the MCEV, Joa Oechslin is also here. He would say a few words on Korea. I can't quantify the effect of the net loss at the moment. The contract has just been signed and the final purchase price is still dependent on a couple of items at closing. Therefore, I beg for your understanding to bear with me and have a little bit of patience, but it will be a double-digit million loss. So it's really up at that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the &#x2013; the reason I ask is what is the impact of not having the recurring loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on how optimistic we would have been. I would say the company would have been good for another double-digit million loss for a couple of years already, so if I'm not too optimistic here. So therefore I'm very, very relieved as the CFO of this group to have that deal fixed now. And now to Joa on the anchoring of the yield curve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael, on the anchoring, my comments relate to the year-end 2011 MCEV since we've not disclosed new figures. At the year-end 2011, we did use the swap curve and up to year 50 we have been taking market rates, swap rates without any adjustments and as of year 50 we started to anchor these rates up to very long maturities. That was the approach at the year-end 2011 that included the whole inversion of the yield curve which has been depressing the MCEV so much at the year-end.</p>
          <p>Now, we have more clarity on the Solvency II outcome and there is a lot that points towards a earlier anchoring at least for Solvency II purposes. We are now reevaluating how we should anchor the yield curve and for the first time this will be public obviously when we disclose new MCEV numbers, which would be year-end 2012. So we have some time. Internally, we are evaluating currently how we would handle this extrapolation. So at the year-end 2011, there was anchoring as of year 50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's the ultimate rate used, is it 6% or 4%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The ultimate rate used is almost immaterial. It doesn't really play a role. Since you anchor as of year 50, the ultimate rate was actually something around 6%, but it is almost invariant the MCEV numbers, because that rate is reached at year 100 something like that, so it doesn't matter.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions. One, just looking back to Japan, I'm just trying to understand what appears to be a materially different approach from you than how some of the peers have already reported. If my understanding is right, you've made clear that you feel comfortable with your capitalization. So with your different position on Japan, do you think it's starting from a different position to some of those peers or you have the greater exposure already, so expanding it doesn't perhaps makes so much sense or is it simply a different view on the risks and you mentioned of course greater likelihood of at least small challenge but a potentially larger earthquake in the southern part of Japan. So I just wanted to understand what do you think is driving that?</p>
          <p>My second question is a little bit broader, but it seems &#x2013; but it's around you risk appetite again. It seems that Japan, you haven't added anymore risk. U.S. &#x2013; Japan you're not adding any more risk despite rate improvement. U.S., you're not willing to take additional risk, even though you are forecasting rate improvement. Europe hasn't seen much rate improvement, but you're not taking any more risk there anywhere. I just would be interested to know what you think it would take &#x2013; if markets are unprofitable at the moment in your eyes for the risks, what it would take to increase your risk appetite in anyone single market at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andy, it's Torsten here, I'll start with the first question, Japan, I think it's the latter, how you describe, what you described and it's a different view of the risk. Our objectives to improve prices and conditions both was early announced and communicated to the market and to all our clients last December already. And why, again, why do we think are the occurrence limits, the heart occurrence limits so important for the reinsurer when you deploy and that is a Japanese specialty significant amount of capacity on the proportionate business under high intensity scenarios like earthquake, then the protection by a maximum loss limit is decisive in our opinion, because otherwise always the non-proportionate treaties are the better choice be there by nature a limit in place.</p>
          <p>We provide significant proportionate capacity like many of our peers and therefore we thought it's now the time although to get these heart loss occurrence limit under the proportionate treaty is right. And they have two benefits: they protect against model uncertainty and error of models particularly in worst case events that is one thing. And the second thing is particularly considering the higher frequency of possible earthquakes in the near future, we think it's the time now to achieve this improvement.</p>
          <p>So it's a completely different view of the risk, this has nothing to do with capital considerations. So we would have liked to deploy more capital if, although, in addition to prices, this improvement of loss occurrence would have been available for us. That is maybe the quick answer for that; it's not more, not less. May be there was one consideration. We achieved this improvement in almost all cases and it would have looked strange if we would have given it up in cases, three, four cases which I mentioned. So what was the other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just the way your appetite maybe growing because you seemed just as though not interested in &#x2013; or not interested in the areas that do seem to be getting price improvement, you explained Japan, but now you mentioned U.S. and U.S. particularly I guess is predominantly your significantly tax free zone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look in the United &#x2013; I think you referred to the United States, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, more broadly, I am just struggling to see where you as an organization is getting excited about your business because it seems you're not wanting to get too carried away with any single market, which might be fine, but I others are getting a bit more excited, so I am just trying to understand the difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine. The only scenario where our risk appetite, so the appetite to give out more capacity is limited is really U.S. hurricane and that has nothing to do with the availability of capital or so. When we let's say would deploy more capital and more capacity in European windstorm, which we would do in case if that appraises, then it would also cost more capital. So capital is not a restriction.</p>
          <p>The question is what would happen in our peak scenario, United States hurricane, when we deploy more capacity in this peak scenario, what happens then? We have reached our risk appetite which is a function of available financial resources and it's limited in a way that our business remains diversified. When &#x2013; more violate this diversification in our overall portfolio, the more so to speak will cause distortions in our pricing. In other words, we have reached already now a level where profitable pricing is so high that we are at the edge compared with market pricing. And therefore, we would not further deteriorate this diversification of portfolio, that is the only reason. In all other scenarios in the world, be it cat scenarios or be it bread and butter business, and it's fully assumption of surprise at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>Second question and here I would like to refer to a completely different scenario. And in all lines of business and all segments which are related to financial crisis and asset risk, we have hardly any risk appetite in the traditional reinsurance business. So we keep to &#x2013; we try to keep our portfolio clean of market risk. And that is even the case in the life reinsurance portfolio where we build up this new business where we take overall market risk from clients, but only on the basis where we can pass it on by our hedging instruments into the capital market. So that is the only so to speak hard restriction for us. We don't take over market risk under reinsurance business because of the uncertainty in capital market we could do not consider that has core.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maciej from Morgan Stanley. I had two questions. The first question is, I think you mentioned in your &#x2013; J&#xF6;rg, you mentioned that there was a &#x20AC;1 billion capital position, excess capital position under S&amp;P as of I think 1Q or as of now, I'm not sure, but I wanted to know is that &#x20AC;1 billion, is that inclusive of credit given by S&amp;P for your own internal capital model, because I know they're going &#x2013; undergoing a process where they're going to credit some of the difference between your internal capital model and their own model to your capital. So I just want to know whether it's including that or if it's excluding that, so we could expect a little bit more in the future.</p>
          <p>And the second question is I know I think you guys &#x2013; and also some of your competitors has talked up the ability of large reinsurers such as yourself to access private layers, which require enormous amounts of capital, but therefore are accessible to other smaller players. I just wanted to know, in your renewals, was there a &#x2013; like how much the private placements play a role in the price improvement that you're able to get and how unique was that to you? Okay, those are my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maciej; J&#xF6;rg here. On S&amp;P capital and I said low single-digit billion amount. So it's above &#x20AC;1 billion. I hesitate and I will not quantify it because it's on one hand a little bit fluctuating. It is dependent on analyst adjustments, but it already includes the credits, a very small credit for the difference between internal model and the standard model. But it does not include all other items one could imagine that should be included over time. So I can only repeat that I'm extremely relaxed about our rating capital situation. Then to Torsten on the renewals and how much private placement business is involved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You know for the whole portfolio, the share is pretty much unchanged. It's around 35% which we mentioned. It's however worthwhile to mention that in Japan now, in this expired renewal, there was a very high share of private conditions achievable and for Japan now in the order of 70% to 75%, 80% or so. So very high proportion of Japanese business was concluded on a private basis at least for us. Again for the rest of the portfolio, it's still in the order of 35%, significantly below that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Brian Shea from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I just wanted to revisit a topic we discussed at the Analyst Meeting in March in London, the conservative booking of your combined ratio. I thought the message from London was that you're booking it conservatively last year and will be booking at conservatively this year; it seems that your conservatism has increased markedly, I just wanted to ask is that true and if so why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer it and if Torsten wants to add something. No, this is not true; it's just a sequence of the quarters in the year, yes. So we constantly reserve in a careful way. We do not have enough new client information currently to do a major reserve review, but it's realistic to expect some release then. Torsten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's true, even I would support what you say that it's a question of time here. It's a natural gap in our internal process between the reserve buffer we have to build now for the youngest underwriting year and the time when we have better information available to make decision on new releases from former years. And this will only be &#x2013; the latter will only be the case in the third and fourth quarter. Therefore, this picture what you see now that you'll see, let's say, the intentional buildup of the reserve buffer in this first, second and third quarter without showing reserve releases against that will be probably a picture for the future. So it has to do with our information or processes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I can add one aspect, we always compare the actual reported losses to the expected reported losses and we see still more or less the same pattern as we did over the last couple of quarters, so very positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe I misunderstood then, I thought that your combined ration target for the full year of 96% was inclusive of any reserve release that may come in the latter part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is true, Brian, this is true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess &#x2013; okay, sorry, I don't mean a monopoly. I think in that case I don't understand, I mean last year you had a underlying combined ratio in the business and normal losses of 96%, you had 4 points of reserve release on top of that, so that's 92%. And now you're saying for this year it's going to be 96%, I don't understand this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't follow that now. So last year that was anyways totally distorted by the huge losses, but I think the 96% bottom line after all, that is something which I would regard as being realistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, maybe a rough calculation, for the full year, not Q1, for the full year, I think you can expect approximately an underlying basic loss ratio in the order of 54% or so. And then roughly 30% expenses, that is 84%. And then as we mentioned during the analyst conference, roughly a 12% normalized combined ratio contribution from large losses including cat. When you compare this with Q1, Q1 of course shows a slightly deteriorated or worst basic loss ratio is 57%, which is above this annual average. But why, because only the buildup of the buffer is included for the reserve, not the current effect of potential future releases. Therefore, this is absolutely in line, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's just that I guess when I look at the full year 2011 performance and we normalize for large losses, I work out that that equates to 96%. So I think that's the number that had been mentioned back at the March analyst meeting. It's just that it's like the price increases happening now, in fact we're not seeing them, that's really the basis of my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot share with you because I don't know exactly what you mean. What happened certainly considering all the distortions in 2011 is that maybe the basic loss ratio was by accident a bit lower than average, but this is in a fluctuation, this is nothing structural.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Just I don't want to go back on the renewals, there has been lot of discussion. But on the July renewals it seemed to me that Torsten you were indicating that the picture could look a lot like last year's July renewals when you did actually increase shares and also prices. And is it a correct understanding that you kind of headed back a bit also thinking that you would be increasing more rapidly in July? So that's the first question. And I do appreciate that there were reasons given for the cutback here, but is this part of the reason that you wanted to as they say keep the powder dry for use at risk?</p>
          <p>And second thing is very, one thing on the sensitivities, because you do mention a lot about how they're low in class, et cetera, et cetera, and the sensitivity, the P&amp;L impacts have quite changed in the three months between December reporting and now. And that's on slide 48 and I did manage to speak with Investor Relations on the equity side where impairments were the reason. But on the fixed income side, the FX, is that the main diver because I see a significant difference in the same slide 48 in 2011 with the FX.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>So for example, if I look at the 100 basis points move, let's say just for example, looking down &#x20AC;0.5 billion here, just looking at the same slide last in December was &#x20AC;200 million. I'm wondering what has changed? On the equity side, I know the reason from speaking with Investor Relations, but on the risk-free interest rates, I was just maybe selecting things.

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for this. So I apologize straightforward, I am not looking really to upset you on the usual renewals question on Japan, but I'm really trying to square the situation and understand it better. So last year when we had these huge losses, you shared the message with us that the Japanese companies need patience. You need to pay, but for the time being there are no rate increases because they need first to see that you're friendly to them and then afterwards they renew with you the contract. And now when the contracts are up to renewal, if I understood it properly, there was a breach of trust somewhere and they went to Swiss Re with their contract. Or if it is not the case, is it that you effectively wrote substantial amount of more non-proportional business. And in this case, did your risk budget augment on the Japanese risk, by I don't know 30%, 40% or your entire risk budget on a group level augment for this sort of earthquake in the Asian room. maybe you had 20% or things like that or how should I understand it? I'm really not able yet to square it. I'm sorry for annoying you, but I'm simply trying to understand.</p>
          <p>And the second one, if I may, is about your combined ratio at your primary insurance international. Now that you have down sold, by how much should we expect the combined ratio international to come down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought, Torsten here, I thought, sure with your first question, you reiterated what happened last year. I think it's not from us what you described. We didn't tell the market or anyone that we have to be friendly to the client and rely on a let's say better renewal one year later. That is not true. It's at least not from us. What happened last year, when you remember, the earthquake occurred in March and about 50% of the Japanese reinsurance programs were at that time already renewed and could not be reopened after the earthquake.</p>
          <p>Then there were a few other programs, where we mutually agreed to wait for about six weeks to extend the old risk period to get a better picture first about loss development and to price then the treaties on a more sort of qualified basis and all that happened. And when you look at the pictures last year, we showed already last year despite of the fact that only 50% was open for price changes, the other 50% was renewed, which was already last year significant price improvement in the Japanese market.</p>
          <p>What happened this year is all programs in the market of course including those who could not be reopened last year were reconsidered in terms of prices and conditions. And what happened then at the end was we had the different view of the risk, I tried to describe it, and the treaties which we gave up have never been played solely with Munich Re. I mean, we gave up a share in these treaties and I mentioned these were four treaties and these four treaties were not, let's say did not move from Munich Re to someone else. Only our share was replaced. The other reinsurers, which we mentioned, they participated in those treaties already before, but they had a different view of the risk and they decided to continue with their share in respect of the loss occurrence limits on the basis of unchanged conditions. And this is something we did not want to support, so this is a very simple and only explanation for our renewal approach. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for the question about the Korean subsidiary, it made up for roughly 8% of the premiums of ERGO International, with a combined ratio of 115%. So if we adjust for it, then it would be an improvement in the order of 1 to 2 percentage points. So it's not enormous, but nevertheless helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Michael Haid from MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. Michael Haid, MainFirst Bank. Two questions. First in life primary insurance, the technical interest income increased significantly versus last year from &#x20AC;544 million to &#x20AC;1.1 billion. I assume this has something to do with the unit-linked business, can you confirm that? And can you please explain the mechanics here, how it works in the P&amp;L?</p>
          <p>And the second question, I must come back on the July renewals, last year the price effect on the July renewals was already very strong plus 5.7%, you said you expect further price increases or expect the price increases to continue i.e., plus 10%, plus price increase expected for U.S. nat cat. To what extent &#x2013; the question I have, to what extent are the price increases that we've seen in the January and April renewals has already &#x2013; in this year, to what extent have they already been reflected in the July 2011 renewals or asked differently what makes you feel confident that we see further price increases in the July renewals this year versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I'll start with your first question with regards to the technical income in life, which indeed went up almost double &#x2013; or just doubled. And this is indeed due to the unit-linked business, where the results went up by &#x20AC;365 million and also due to the high participation of policyholders in the increased investment income. So both is very straightforward and due to the way how we calculate this technical interest because it should compensate the allocation to the policyholders here. Torsten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, July renewal and why or to what extent do we expect further price increases or are they already included in the last renewals, let me go through the markets why we think we see a similar picture in terms of prices on top what we've seen last year. In Australia, New Zealand, the change &#x2013; in other words the increase loss pattern, the further development of the occurred earthquake event will of course be reflected in pricing. And Munich Re and the other players, they report &#x2013; they reported in the second half of 2011, further loss increases which of course could not have been covered and reflected in last year's renewal in July. So loss activity, loss development will play the major role for Australia and New Zealand.</p>
          <p>In the United States, it's a bit different. Here, we're optimistic for two reasons. One is still RMS Version 11 for the reinsurance side and that still plays a role and for the first time we see and I am a bit careful here, but we see slight indications that most likely because of the changed model assumptions that there is also a rising demand for cat capacity for hurricane business in the market. In other words, the demand side could help the pricing.</p>
          <p>In addition to that what we see for the first time now it's a gradual improvement of underlying primary rate in property in the United States. Whether this was driven by performance or by model change, we don't know, but primary rates in property in difference to casualty, by the way, they show positive or have shown positive development in the order of 10% or so for the last four months already. And because of this renewal date, which also includes some property business altogether, we are positive for the United States. So different drivers, but resulting in similar expectations like last year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Maybe one additional question just quickly, did you change the finishing of the combined ratios for P&amp;C and P&amp;C re? Because I noticed that they are different first quarter last year versus those that you reported last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is just due to the new consolidation method, because the business between the reinsurance segment and ERGO has been taken out now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the only restatement here.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions on my side. The first one is year-to-date including January and April 1 renewal, can you give us an idea of the cumulative economic price increase you've achieved on the renewed book and what should be the effect on the basic loss ratios over the next 18 months to come?</p>
          <p>And the second question will be on the U.S. casualty business. You indicated also your willingness to give up some business because of I would say not the total level in terms of technical rates to write this business on profitable basis. Could you tell us, I mean, how much or how far are we from a technical price which will make you more inclined to write this business? What's the gap currently versus the way you're seeing the business and how the market is looking at it currently? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, I mean, I think you mean the two renewals we already observed, January and April now, that is in the order of 2.2%, 2.5%, if we add them together. And this is also the effect you should &#x2013; that is an underwriting year view of course, and underwriting year means over the next years, you will see that in an improvement of combined ratio.</p>
          <p>U.S. casualty, a difficult question because you have of course a mixture of proportionate business, non-proportionate business, where particularly the interest rate change has a very different effect on the pricing of the business. But we think we need at least, and this is maybe a rule of thumb, low double-digit percentages of premium increase before we can compensate the reduced interest rates which occurred over the last three to four years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then, J&#xF6;rg speaking here again, I can meanwhile better answer Vinit's question. Vinit asked why the P&amp;L impact in the sensitivities chart on 48 is substantially higher than on the similar chart as at the end of last year. So to give you an example for decline of risk free rates, by 100 basis points, the P&amp;L impact was &#x20AC;200 million, as Vinit said, and it is now &#x20AC;500 million. As I said before, I could confirm it meanwhile with our asset managers, it's due to the higher usage of bond futures and inflation swaps. These are the futures we have used to increase the duration of our portfolio and this has a higher sensitivity from an economic point of view. The impact is similar to that of the trading of the underlying, but from the P&amp;L point of view, the impact is much higher. So thank you for taking notice and for asking it. We then can continue with the next question.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much. I just got one question and I don't know if this follows on from what you just said, J&#xF6;rg. But there was a very small negative impact on the primary life results from the swaptions in the first quarter and that kind of surprised me because I thought German bonds yields fell in the first quarter. So, normally it would sort of help out a bit. So can you just try and help me directionally why that was different? Is there some accounting issue or is it something to do with your policy on how you've been hedging or what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, William. The reason is indeed the German bond yields went down slightly, but on the other hand the volatility decreased. And therefore in the course of the valuation of these instruments, they lost a little bit in value and the net impact on the P&amp;L was only &#x20AC;3 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions if I may. First on the life reinsurance technical result, could you provide us maybe a underlying figure for the first quarter or maybe name the positive deviations you saw, maybe mortality or other influencing factors? Secondly, a question on ERGO, if I saw it correctly, this efficiency program to be planned on the sales force, do you expect here additional costs and when do you think you might incur them? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, talking here first life re, there are no spectacular or unusual developments in the technical result. As mentioned, run rate is expected to be &#x20AC;100 million and they are very normal and let's say fluctuations above or sometimes below which are not explainable. Our mortality in general worldwide was, however, very good. There are no exceptional countertrends or negative trends which I could report. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the ERGO efficiency programs, there is a new board member in charge for sales since last November, and currently there are a couple of projects underway to further improve ERGO's distribution, but I cannot anticipate the results now.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Could I just ask two quick ones on property and casualty primary, please, the first one is on Turkey, because of the three problematic international operations you have. Poland has kind of resolved itself through lower nat cats and I guess a bit of pricing improvement. And in Korea, you resolved by selling it. In Turkey, you're sort of committed to holding onto this and trying to turnaround or is the potential we see a disposal of that dismissed too? And then the second thing was, J&#xF6;rg, when you were talking about the combined ratio in Germany, you made kind of positive sounding statement I think about the outlook in Germany for this year. Could you just maybe expand a bit on what gives you optimism in Germany? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Spencer. On Turkey, we do not intend to sell the business; it's on a good path for its recovery. On Germany, there is some seasonality in the loss ratio of the German business, because especially the strong rains and storms we had during 2011 are typically below the reinsurance thresholds, that means that the net account of the company is substantially affected by it and there is some seasonality, but is not so extreme and the underlying quality of the business is in good shape and therefore I'm very confident that ERGO can continue on this path of success for its German property casualty business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was kind of asking about the underlying I think because I wasn't clear. It does exhibit some seasonality, but are you suggesting the underlying is also getting better or more stable picture there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stable, if we have a longer term view. So I would regard 2011 as being somewhat substandard in the way ERGO produced its &#x2013; what's excellent result and a very good business mix.</p>
