        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Presentation of 2008-2012 Strategic Plan. I am very pleased to be announcing today the very strong set of 2007 results. These numbers demonstrate the value we are creating from our strategy. Last year has been a transformational year for Enel with the acquisition of Endesa and the Russian assets. We will therefore be presenting to you today in detail the strategy and targets we have for the new Group over the next five year.</p>
          <p>The next five years for Enel will center around three priorities. Consolidating and integrating the new Group, delivering growth from this new platform, while maintaining a stable and secure financial position, but before we review the 2007 results and go into more detail for each division, let me outline the headline numbers which demonstrate all this.</p>
          <p>Next chart: well, during the next five years we expect to generate an operating cash flow of &#x20AC;63 billion. This comes from a cumulative EBITDA of &#x20AC;74.5 billion, generated by international growth, particularly from Endesa and the Russian investments, the ongoing efficiency programs and our organic growth in Italy and international.</p>
          <p>During this period we'll also seek to maximize the value of our existing assets through a carefully targeted program on non-strategic asset disposals, as well as prioritization of renewables with limited potential add-on investments in our existing geographies.</p>
          <p>We estimate that the net cash effect of these sales and investments will be in the range of &#x20AC;11/15 billion cash in. This cash flow and funds from portfolio optimization will allow us to deliver growth through organic investments of &#x20AC;37 billion, to pay debt service of 14 billion and maintain a dividend of &#x20AC;0.49 per share throughout the period with the two years installment payments.</p>
          <p>This will total a &#x20AC;15 billion of dividends outflow, which will move our payout ratio from 76% in 2007 down to 59% in 2012. And overall this will leave us 8 to &#x20AC;12 billion which will be applied to debt reduction to ensure that Enel's balance sheet is both efficient and secure and to support a stable A rating on our debts.</p>
          <p>As you can see the outlook for Enel is very positive. Following the transformational acquisition of 2007, we are now entering a period of strong organic growth. We are launching a careful targeted CapEx program to drive this growth, particularly through renewable innovative technologies. We will continue to extract ongoing value out of the core markets, particularly in Italy and Spain. We are committed to deliver an EPS CAGR of 10% for the period 2007-2012 and to achieve a debt level in the range of 45 to 49 billion by 2012.</p>
          <p>I will now hand it over to Luigi for giving you the details on the 2007 results. Luigi?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fulvio. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I am very pleased to show you a very strong set of financial results. As you will hear from Fulvio's presentation, we completed our transformation process into an integrated international energy player and the numbers are reflecting this.</p>
          <p>First, on chart number five, I am going to give you a snapshot of some relevant financial highlights. Then I will take you through our 2007 financial results. The numbers you see show an overall growing performance driven by all of our divisions as you will see later in the presentation. In particular, from the underlying depositing contribution of Endesa which passed delivery value into our group.</p>
          <p>Now, on chart number six, our overall financial results. Starting from EBIT, down to net income. As you can see, the EBIT increased by 20%, thanks to the EBITDA improvement.</p>
          <p>Our net financial charges amount to &#x20AC;900 million. This is the net effect of the following. First, higher interest charges for almost &#x20AC;1.4 billion mainly due to the increase in net debt position following the acquisition of Endesa, and the first 37% stake in OGK-5. Second, higher financial income for &#x20AC;300 million mainly dividend coming from Endesa. Third, higher income resulting from the fair value valuation of Acciona put option for &#x20AC;136 million. And fourth, other positive items for &#x20AC;51 million mainly due to risk management activities.</p>
          <p>Coming to taxes. Our tax rate decreases from 40% to 30% mainly thanks to the impacts of the deferred tax asset and liabilities and the new fiscal law in Italy. Moreover, group net income grew by 31% and our cost of debt as of 2007, is equal to an average of 5.1%.</p>
          <p>Now on chart number 7, our overall financial results starting from the EBITDA evolution. EBITDA increases by 25% compared to the same period of the last year with a strong growth of all the operational divisions and in particular on the international division with the consolidation of Endesa, which accounts for &#x20AC;1.2 billion as you will find detailed in the following charts.</p>
          <p>Next of the above mentioned contribution of Endesa, full year 2007 EBITDA would be up almost 10% versus last year. I would like to remind you that according to the international accounting standard 2007 EBITDA figure does not include the contribution of Endesa Europe recorded as discontinued operation, which amounts to almost &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the individual business areas starting with chart number eight on the Domestic Market Division. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;325 million versus &#x20AC;167 million last year. This is the net effect of the following. First, the increase of &#x20AC;108 million in the electricity regulated market. Second the increase of &#x20AC;132 million in the contribution of the free markets. Thanks to the following.</p>
          <p>Higher gas margins for &#x20AC;80 million, basically due to higher volume sold and to the positive FX for &#x20AC;26 million of the remodulation of the gas tariffs to end users set by the regulator. Higher electivity margins for &#x20AC;52 million, basically due to higher volume sold and third other and other non-recurring items of minus &#x20AC;82 million, which includes cost of customer acquisition and the electricity authority fine.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number nine or Domestic Generation and Energy Management, EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;3541 million representing an increase of &#x20AC;384 million versus 2006. On the positive side we record, first the improvement of &#x20AC;328 million in the generation margin thanks to the following.</p>
          <p>&#x20AC;307 million due to the contribution of unit margins driven by the positive effects of the improvements of the fuel mix and by higher revenues from ancillary services, which more than offset lower volumes, minus &#x20AC;75 million of energy trading activities due to lower volumes coupled with lower prices and &#x20AC;96 million lower provision for early retirement incentives versus last year.</p>
          <p>Second the positive impact of &#x20AC;103 million for the fair value of bilateral contracts with a single buyer. The above mentioned improvement has been partially offset by the reduction of &#x20AC;47 million in non-recurring items totally recorded in the first quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>Lets' now have a quick look at the fuel cost evolution on chart number ten. As you can see in this chart, our average fuel cost per megawatt hour has decreased by about 5% versus 2006, while our average unit revenues stand at &#x20AC;74.4 per megawatt hour versus 70.6 of last year. This is clearly boosting our total unit margin by more than 16% versus last year. These numbers of course are not including contribution of ancillary services which would go on top of them.</p>
          <p>Moving on to chart number 11, or Domestic Infrastructure and Networks Division, EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;3,726 million representing an increase of &#x20AC;300 million versus 2006. This takes us up substantially the effect of the following. First, the improvements of &#x20AC;333 million in the electricity business mainly thanks to higher energy margin for more than &#x20AC;100 million strong cost saving actions for &#x20AC;80 million, lower provision for early retirement incentives for &#x20AC;142 million.</p>
          <p>And second, the increase in the gas business of &#x20AC;61 million, mainly due to higher gas margin and cost savings. The above mentioned improvement has been partially offset by the negative impacts of non-recurring items related to the capital gain for last year disposal of the Modena network.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 12, or International operation, well EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;2,380 million, representing an increased of almost &#x20AC;1.5 billion versus last year. This is mainly due to the effect of the consolidation of Endesa in the fourth quarter. The main contribution refers to the following, Endesa positive impact of &#x20AC;1.2 billion for the 70% consolidation of the company. This amount is split into the Iberia area for &#x20AC;691 million and into the Americas area for &#x20AC;531 million, in Centrel, a strong contribution of Slovenske Elektrarne for &#x20AC;198 million.</p>
          <p>Let me just say a few words about, in particular Slovenske Elektrarne. Full year 2007 EBITDA of this company is equal to &#x20AC;580 million boosted by higher domestic energy prices, higher volumes and cost reduction. In South Eastern Europe, an increase of &#x20AC;6 million and in the Americas net of the contribution of Endesa, we recorded &#x20AC;42 million increase mainly due to the positive performance of the Group's operation in South America for the consolidation of the Panama assets. This more than offsets lower contribution in North America due to a positive one-off item recorded in 2006.</p>
          <p>Moving on to chart number 13, a quick look at EBITDA of the Services and Holding area, which stands at &#x20AC;51 million or minus &#x20AC;300 million versus last year. This is the net effect of the following, first lower margin on imports for &#x20AC;240 million largely in line with our projections, mainly due to lower volumes imported and lower prices. Second non-recurring items, which decreased by &#x20AC;23 million and other items for &#x20AC;45 million.</p>
          <p>Also moving to Chart number 14, let me just give you a snapshot about our renewable areas. Well, let me tell you that the numbers reported in this chart includes our Italian wind, geothermal, mini-hydro and solar operation and all our international renewable activities with the exception of larger hydro and Slovenske Elektrarne.</p>
          <p>Of course these numbers are part of the results I have already shown you in the previous charts. As you can see the installed capacity at 2007 is 3.1 gigawatts versus 2.6 of last year or plus 18.5%. And the production is equal to 11.8 gigawatt-hour versus 10.7 of last year. EBITDA totals &#x20AC;868 million versus &#x20AC;782 million with an increase of almost 11%.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, we expect new capacity now in the pipeline to boost the profitability of our worldwide renewable operation as you will see later in the presentation of our <mark type="inaudible" /> accounts.</p>
          <p>As far as our net debt evolution is concerned, on chart number 15, you'll see that the overall net debt stands at &#x20AC;57.5 billion including the net debt related to Endesa Europa <mark type="inaudible" /> for &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The debt recorded an increase of &#x20AC;45.8 billion on 2006, mainly due to the acquisition of 67% of Endesa and 37% of OGK-5. Operational cash flow remains strong at &#x20AC;9.1 billion. We covered CapEx for &#x20AC;5.2 billion and paid interest of &#x20AC;1.4 billion. Regarding the debt structure as of 2007, we have refinanced &#x20AC;10 billion of our syndicated loan thanks to the issuance of bonds in euro, pound sterling and US dollar.</p>
          <p>We have included in the annexes some slides with more details on our debt profile, but two points, are worth highlighting here. First, following our recent successful bond issue, the average maturity of our debt portfolio is over five years. The next falling due maturity will be three years from now as you can see chart number 119 in the annexes. Second, almost 50% of this debt is either fixed or hedged; we are therefore very satisfied with the stable and conservative structure of our debt profile.</p>
          <p>And now dividend, as you know yesterday the Board of Directors resolved upon proposing to the AGM a &#x20AC;0.29 dividend per share that will be paid in June 26 this year as planned. This adds up to &#x20AC;0.20 interim dividend per share already paid in November 2007 for a total 2007 dividend of &#x20AC;0.49 per share. This makes Enel stock one of the European best-in-class, in terms of yield delivered to shareholders.</p>
          <p>The solid financial performance, coupled with the resulting dividend, confirm that the ongoing strategy has delivered the expected results.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And now I'll handover to Fulvio Conti for an overall view of the strategy.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me go back to 2006 and '07 just for a while. As you might remember, in my first strategy presentation back in March, 2006, I laid out a clear path for Enel with three key priorities: maintaining leadership in the Italian market; international growth, both organic and through acquisitions; and improved performance through investments and greater efficiencies.</p>
          <p>This strategy has been followed through 2007 &#x2013; add the environmental innovation program to complete our range of investor developments. The strength of these subtle numbers that Luigi has just reported to you, I think demonstrates that we are maintaining our leadership in the Italian market which continues to have attractive fundamentals.</p>
          <p>We are delivering value from efficiency improvements across the Group. And during 2007, through the acquisition of Endesa and OGK-5 in Russia, we have achieved international growth which brings us an entirely new platform for future growth. Moreover, we are profiting on our renewables and innovation as you will see later during the presentation.</p>
          <p>The phase of this transformational growth through large acquisition is over. Enel's strategy over the next five years will focus on delivering growth and value from our expanded portfolio. First we will ensure that the assets of Endesa and OGK-5 are successfully consolidated.</p>
          <p>Second, we will capitalize on our leadership position in our core markets, such as Spain, Italy and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Third, we will further increase our integration from upstream to downstream and complete the value chain in distribution and generation where we're missing one of those.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we will continue to drive operational improvement programs throughout the Group, delivering significant further cost reductions.</p>
          <p>Fifth, we're strongly focused on building growth in emerging areas, such as renewables and nuclear, both of which I will address in more detail.</p>
          <p>As far as Endesa is concerned, I'm pleased to report that cooperation is proceeding well and we already established a close working relationship with Acciona. The synergies we will be delivering from this transaction are substantial.</p>
          <p>They total about 730 million which is 50 million more than what we had announced in December, as we have found more in Latin America to be extracted. Endesa enjoys a strong established position to grow from in Iberia and Lat. Am.</p>
          <p>Latin America, in particular, is one of the fastest growing energy markets in the entire world due to its tight supply and demand balance. Both geographies offer further growth potential through investments in incremental capacity, or by investments which upgrade existing facilities.</p>
          <p>In Iberia further investments in CCGT plants will result in a more competitive and cleaner generation mix and wholesale retail gas markets offer significant growth potential.</p>
          <p>In Latin America Endesa will invest both in generation capacity and distribution to capitalize on the growth of those markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to Russia, I would like to update you on the progress we have made in this country. It is another region which offers very high potential for growth. We've been in Russia since 2004 as you know. And this experience has given us a clear view of the country's opportunity both in terms of demand growth and the progress of market liberalization.</p>
          <p>The acquisition we have completed both in the upstream gas sector and in the power generation sector enables us to be a vertically integrated presence from upstream to downstream. Indeed the first ever integrated gas and power operator in that huge market.</p>
          <p>Our joint venture with Eni in Russia will satisfy over 50% of OGK-5 gas needs starting with first gas in 2010. So far we have invested &#x20AC;4 billion in Russia including the total equity investments. We intent to invest further 2.2 billion over the next five years in developing our business both in power generation and upstream gas. Investments in OGK-5 will be both expansion of new CCGT and replacement of older capacity. Let's turn now into our business mix.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; Enel has a well balanced mix of fuel and the unregulated and regulated activities breakdown is solid. The regulated activities are in countries which have a clear and stable regulatory scenario. The group continues to have a well diversified fuel mix with 37.5% of generation coming from the combination of nuclear, hydro and other renewables. And this will provide us a sound platform for higher margins over the long-term. Not only, this will hedge our competitive position also against any negative carbon market scenario.</p>
          <p>Beyond 2012 our production, our production mix will benefit from our additional nuclear capacity namely in France with EPR projects in association with EDF. We are going to get sizable position and in Slovakia with the completion of the two nuclear units of Slovenske Elektrarne which is ongoing.</p>
          <p>Our earnings in generation are also enhanced by our strong forward contracting strategy. As a matter of fact we have substantially fully hedged Italy for 2008, Slovakia for almost 50%, as well as Iberia. For 2009 we have covered more than 50% of our sales and almost 40% in Iberia, and we are also selling into 2010 as the matter of fact already we have a sizable position in Iberia. We're 20% locked in. Let's move on.</p>
          <p>Our growing international presence is giving us a platform for further strengthening into a vertical integration. In terms of gas inputs into Italy the supply agreement we secured with Algeria will give us an additional 1 billion cubic meters starting from 2009 thus reaching a total of 7 billion cubic meters. Together with the existing arrangements we have with LNG supplies from Nigeria and Qatar, we will reach total portfolio, 12 billion cubic meters per year.</p>
          <p>Our participation into the Algerian, Italian and the GALSI project which will secure an additional 2 billion cubic meters per year on a long-term basis with first gas coming by 2012 will reinforce this position. As well as our development of LNG we are promoting obviously re-gasification units into Italy. We are very close to get a final permit on the re-gasify unit in <mark type="inaudible" /> with re-gasification capacity of 8 billion cubic meters eventually.</p>
          <p>Let me speak about renewable. Let me focus your attention on this. Renewables will play a very important part of our future of Enel. Across all of our markets there are strong conditions for growth through incentive schemes to support this development of green energy. Therefore, we're starting up the development of our renewables in two main ways. First we are investing for growth. During the period of plan up to 2012 we will be investing a total of about &#x20AC;7 billion in this area to increase outlook from wind, mini-hydro and geothermal across all of our geographies.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in new technology such as the concentrated solar power with projects such as the Archimedes project in Sicily. The second way is that we will bundle all of these businesses into one single division across all geographies and technologies. There will be additional value to be extracted by managing all of our renewables business as one single unit sharing innovation and best practices, procurement synergies and overall management efficiencies. Also we will not stop by 2012. There will be lot of pipeline projects moving beyond 2012, which will be instigated by this new division.</p>
          <p>Obviously one of our key aims is the one of developing long-term growth through a well balanced and diversified generation portfolio. And nuclear in this context will play a major role and it will be an important feature of our generation mix. Nuclear provides important balance with its all &#x2013; low cost and low emission characteristics.</p>
          <p>Today we have running about 4000 megawatts of capacity and we plan to grow further this with these projects in France and Russia and Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. From 2008, Enel will participate in the International Research and Development work for at least one of the plans of fourth generation technology. We are already partnering with EDF in France in the development of the next generation European pressurized reactor technology with the plant Flamanville.</p>
          <p>And to the extent we have signed an agreement with Rosatom the Russian energy &#x2013; the atomic energy group we will be pursuing co-development opportunities in the Eastern parts of Europe. As well as we are looking at the Cernavoda Romanian plant. Possibly we've might have lost the Bulgarian bid without regrets.</p>
          <p>Our investment program demonstrates, we are committed to invest in further growth. We are investing 37 billion, but the important feature of this is more than 21 billion is specially focused on organic growth. This investment flow will reach the peak over the next three years and then will be reduced significantly in 2012 when bulk of our organic growth will be completed. And at that point in time the group will turn into a highly cash generative company.</p>
          <p>Alongside with this program for growth, we are developing a strategy of portfolio optimization. We have identified opportunities to realize value from some of our assets. First, as you know we are about to complete the assets which have been agreed with the antitrust authorities to be sold to E.ON as part of the Endesa transaction. We will continue to look into the disposals of high voltage network, the residual portion of high voltage network in Italy, which is on well on track for being completed by the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>We also intend to realize the value that we're generating from the incorporation into one single unit of the renewable businesses. This could take some different forms. It will depend on the market that will also be our option to select the appropriate route while maintaining the majority stake in what we've been building so far.</p>
          <p>We are also providing &#x2013; we're also gathering for some limited resources, if there is a scenario for any opportunistic minor development, which if conditions and terms are compelling could be realized. But the overall mix that will be available to fund debt reduction is sizeable. Now you will see the details of the presentation, our colleagues here they will give you the basis for which I presented to you such evolutionary and positive plan. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Who is next, Francesco?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. Let me start with a quick overview. Can you hear me? Okay, Right. Let me give you a little bit of an overview of our strategic priorities for the next five years. We have and we remain to be &#x2013; we remain the leader of &#x2013; in the regulated market. We have become and we will continue to grow our leadership in the free electricity and gas market. This is the way to enhance control throughout the whole value chain and protect the group margin. We aim to reach operational excellence in particular; we want to improve within our customer base the perception of the quality of our services.</p>
          <p>Let's now go on and see how we look at the electricity market in Italy over the next five years. What you see here is a representation of the evolution of the market between 2006 and 2012. We expect growth in demand throughout this period with a compound annual growth rate of around 2% in the period. From the 1st of July 2007 the existing market in Italy is fully opened. Which means that all customer segments including the residential one can choose the supplier both for electricity and gas.</p>
          <p>Our sales strategy for the retail market is based on a very simple fixed price Dual Energy offer with a strong attention to renewable energy. Free market growth has been 12.3% from 2006 to 2007 and our estimate is a 17% growth from 2007 to 2008. Enel has been the driving force behind this growth of the free market and let's see this in a little bit more detail in the next slide.</p>
          <p>This is quite a busy chart, let me guide you thought it. At the end of 2007 the number of customers in the free market has reached a total of 2.7 million this is a 300% growth in terms of customers and an additional 19 terawatt hour consumption in the free market due to our strong efforts which started in spring 2006. Out of this 2.7 million our share is 1.7, the rest of the competition has 1 million all together. This makes us by far the leading player in the Italian retail market.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look this more in detail. Let's begin with the business segment. At the end of 2006, in the business segment we had only 700,000 customers. They consume 154.4 terawatt hours. At the end of the year 2007, only Enel has reached 1.1 million customers with a portfolio of 56 terawatt hours. On the residential segment, since the 1st of July, 2007 at the end with a beginning of the liberalization of all the residential customers, the mass has reached the 33 million of eligible clients. We have been the first Italian operator, who launched a Dual Energy offer for the residential customer. We switched in the last semester of 2007 more than 600,000 customers. We believe the combined effort of our competitors will add another 100,000 at the year end.</p>
          <p>We are currently offering our residential clients renewable product &#x2013; renewable fixed price energy and a two years fixed price for gas too. Considering the situation in the commodities market these products have been very successful. We had quite an insight in putting them on the market early enough during the first part of 2008 so when we are talking we are progressing at the rate of 10,000 contracts a day considering all segments so it's quite a strong push.</p>
          <p>Now on the gas market we had a pulse in gas demand in 2006 due to climate effect. We continue to forecast a moderate but steady growth between 2007 and 2012 approximately at 1.6% per annum. It is because Italy already has a very high penetration of gas distribution throughout the country. Growth will therefore come only from organic growth of society from existing customers and is expected to be split equally between domestic and business segment.</p>
          <p>What we can say we observed a renewed interest in retail gas switching as a result of the full liberalization of the electricity market. So I think that gas has been pushed back into fashion after the liberalization of the electricity market and our dual energy strategy proves this. In the first six months more than 200,000 residential customers joined our dual energy offer. Let's focus now on our position in these markets.</p>
          <p>What is our aim? Our aim is to push growth on a selected customer basis. Growth in terms of volume sold to the electricity market to a well selected portfolio of free customers with the aim to match our optimal production mix. This will lead us to place about 100 almost 97 terawatt hours on the electricity free market by 2012.</p>
          <p>Growth in terms of volumes sold to the gas market. We constantly tap our gas and electricity dual energy offering. This is based growing our volumes in this market up to 9.2 billion cubic meters by 2012. Where are we at the end of 2007? We have about 4.5 million customers in both markets, 1.6 million only electricity, 2.6 million only gas, 209,000 dual energy. To be more specific on the portfolio of customers what you can see in this chart is a representation of this ideal optimum portfolio of customers that we are well underway to assemble. The combination of clients from all segments brings the total to 14 million on the free markets, of which over 3.6 million will be dual energy. With an overall combined consumption profile so these 14 million customers will absorb our energy in a way that matches well our optimal production profile in the expected evolution of the Italian energy market.</p>
          <p>We will also have 1.8 million gas only customers at the end of the period. Now a little bit of a snapshot on forward sales which are an evergreen of these presentations. We have sold 100% as you heard from Fulvio of 2008 production. Of this 69.3 terawatt hours have delivered already to the free market and the balance with a single buyer and other traders. At the end of 2007 we have already sold 53.2 terawatt hours and another 31.8 are sold throughout 2010. We are progressing with a monthly pace of 1.8 terawatt hours a month with a two years rolling forward time horizon more than 85% of the actual volumes have sold at fixed price.</p>
          <p>And now let's have a quick look at the development of the solar photovoltaic energy sector, as you know Italy today is one of the hottest markets in this sector. We have a favorable incentive scheme and the market is literally booming. In the last years we have begun to develop our presence in the energy efficiency and renewable sectors on the retail end. We are offering with these brands <mark type="inaudible" /> product for all segments of clients in particular in the field of renewable distributed generation. So photovoltaic, solar energy, thermal solar energy, many ways.</p>
          <p>How we do this? We have a grid of qualified franchising solars, it's a network of more than 310 dealers which we are growing constantly. They are located throughout Italy they cater for the retail and small business market and we have a central engineering unit for large installations.</p>
          <p>Currently we hold 34% of the photovoltaic market in the country in terms of capacity sold and installed to third parties in the next five years we want to grow our percentage more than the market growth. So we have an objective of having 210 megawatts of solar photovoltaic power installed and a market share of 42% by 2012.</p>
          <p>We think in Italy we will be one of the first countries where we will achieve grid parity between cost generated for peak hours and cost generated by photovoltaic fuel cells. It's a combination of a lot of interesting factors in this country, and we are pursuing a strategy for a long term alliance with the world leaders in this technology upstream in the silicon value chain to sustain our presence after 2012.</p>
          <p>Now I focus on cost to serve. As the number of customers on the electricity and dual energy market grows as you see and as we keep introducing new steam-lined processes and new IT applications our interest in dual energy free market cost to serve will decrease, it's actually already going down. We plan to reach a target of &#x20AC;23 per customer cost levering in 2012. We are targeting a free customer base of 14 million by 2012.</p>
          <p>This is free customers, at the same time we will also be handling around 15 million customers that one way or another will have decided or not decided but will remain on the regulated market. Therefore we will be at this point handling around 30 million customers. We'll be managing one of the largest client's bases in the world. We leverage this cost competitiveness on this very large base and we we'll export this know how elsewhere in our European base.</p>
          <p>Now, as small snapshot on the acquisition cost, of course, increasing the number of customers in this free electricity and gas market has a cost. We are driving down the acquisition costs and our objective is to push this single customer acquisition cost down from &#x20AC;50 per customer in 2007, to &#x20AC;29 per customer by 2012. This is through some drivers. The optimization of the channel mix by using less costly channels, for example, wholesale. Development an increase of virtual channels, which already start to give us a lot of satisfaction like a website and basically enhance our capabilities to extract synergies via progressive implementation of advanced geo-marketing tools and competitive market simulations.</p>
          <p>I thank you very much. I hand now over Gianfilippo Mancini, to take you through our strategy and target for the Generation and Energy Management Division. Gianfilippo?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Francesco. And good morning ladies and gentlemen. Our strong domestic leadership is founded on a competitive and flexible generation fleet, on our operational excellence and our well focused fuel and power commercial capabilities. We believe we can further leverage on these resources in order to achieve our ambitious target of operational excellence and profitability.</p>
          <p>Before I move to describe in more detail these actions, let's have a look at the market scenario now. As you can see here, in 2007, CCGT production reached almost 50% of the Italian energy mix. This specific situation of dependency of generation cost upon gas prices will continue in the future, as additional CCGTs will enter the market. This will reinforce the dependence of the Italian wholesale prices on the cost structure of the CCGTs.</p>
          <p>Let now focus on our investment plan. This is core in our long-term strategy and will allow us to strengthen our leadership in the Italian market to expose new opportunities and to face environmental challenges. Our Italian program is on track. As for CCGTs in 2007, we completed our five gigawatt conversion program with the commissioning of the last unit at <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>In order to further improve our CCGTs' flexibility, we've launched a new investment program that will enable these plant to work at profitably at lower load levels, while also increasing their maximum output.</p>
          <p>This will provide us to with approximately 200 megawatts of additional capacity. Also additional, oil and gas power plant still play an important role in our portfolio strategy too. But thanks to their flexibility, which allows us to capture significant opportunities in the ancillary services market and in exports.</p>
          <p>In coal, our new plant will contribute to dramatically lowering our production cost with raising our base load volumes of production. With respect to Torre Nord, we confirm that the first unit will be in full operation during 2008, while the other two units will follow in 2009. This new, clean coal, state of the art power plant will represent a world benchmark in terms both of efficiency and of environmental impact.</p>
          <p>Referring to Porto Tolle we are awaiting national environmental impact assessment before starting construction phase for which we expect we will leverage on the experience gathered from the similar Torre Nord projects. With current oil prices we also perceive an increased interest in clean coal which makes us confident that we will achieve authorization before year end.</p>
          <p>We're also implementing specific investment programs dedicated to our existing programs, which will give us both a significant environmental improvement on pulverized coal capture and coal logistic and an additional 100 megawatts of output free of fuel costs.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to renewables. Here we are pursuing new opportunities and increasing our 2008-2012 investment program as you can see here. With this new program we'll be investing more than &#x20AC;3 billion in development and maintenance project with an increased target in additional installed capacity by 2012 of 1.4 gigawatt, most of which in wind. This target is based on a large and strong portfolio of initiatives and it will give us a return over 14% in IRR thanks to a positive Italian regulatory regime on green certificates.</p>
          <p>On the wind sector we are developing projects in excess of 4 gigawatt, mainly in the windy areas of Southern Italy and we are pushing forward this initiative through specific agreements with local authorities leveraging on our presence in these territories. As an example of this, we recently have signed an agreement with Sardinia region to build 160 megawatt, new wind plant that will be online before the next year end.</p>
          <p>Regarding geothermal production as you know we are the world leaders in this sector and we have recently signed an agreement with Tuscany region to develop new plants for a total of 200 megawatts. And finally moving to hydro our consolidated technical expertise and the extent of our portfolio of assets allows us to carryout several green-certificate projects at high return. We are revamping our existing plants and we are developing new, small hydro projects thus increasing by one terawatt hour our profitable green certificate production by 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving now to research and innovation activities, we are focused in particular on improving fossil fuel power efficiency and on CCS projects. Our aim here is to acquire experience in all technologies connected to the capture and the storage of CO2 after positive results of our first research activities, pilot plants for pulse combustion and oxy-combustion technologies in our existing plant at Brindisi are currently in the authorization phase.</p>
          <p>The first pulse combustion demo plants will be located in one of our high efficiency coal plants in Torre Nord or Porto Tolle. And regarding our hydrogen pilot plant the 12 megawatt plant at Fusina is currently under construction. And we're also developing investments for innovation in renewables in particular in thermodynamic solar with the Archimedes project in concentrated photovoltaic technology and in geothermal energy.</p>
          <p>Our investment plan is driven by the awareness that the power business today, CO2 constraints and emission limits will be even tighter in the future. In this regard our new clean coal units will be more competitive than combined cycle turbines even assuming very high CO2 prices.</p>
          <p>The variable costs described in this chart imply that only with CO2 prices above &#x20AC;70 per ton given the commodities forward pricing we see today, will CCGTs be as competitive as our clean coal units.</p>
          <p>With this respect, the new 2008-2012 Italian National Allocation Plan is contributing to define a more predictable scenario. We now expect a unit shortage of around 8 to 9 million tons between 2008 and 2012. And we confirm that our position here is already fully hedged at very competitive cost as I will describe through the next chart.</p>
          <p>We also welcomed the increase in the limits for the use of flexible mechanism, which has been introduced by the Italian National Allocation Plan and allows us to use certified emission reduction units up to 19.3% of our total allocation.</p>
          <p>On this market acting as an early mover in the global carbon market, we have built a very competitive and robust portfolio, which makes Enel one of the top three carbon market players in terms of registered certified emission reductions in the world.</p>
          <p>Our sourcing costs are around &#x20AC;8 per ton and our portfolio mark-to-market value is well above &#x20AC;500 million today. Our portfolio consists of more than 60 projects, most of which are renewable energy generation plants and projects implemented in the chemical industry.</p>
          <p>These projects are expected to generate as a whole 75 million tons of emission permit between 2008 and 2012, 56 million tons of this will be generated by projects that have already successfully completed all the approval cycle introduced by the United Nations and as a matter of fact are already in operation. The expected volume will be more than enough to satisfy our compliance needs and it is allowing already to us, to take very interesting opportunities in the secondary markets.</p>
          <p>On the long-term plan horizon towards 2012, the regulatory framework is still very uncertain despite the publication of the post-2012 proposed trading scheme directive. Anyway we firmly believe that in a CO2 constrained world without free allowances the CO2 cost will be reflected into power prices, and our well-balanced generation mix will then make us naturally hedged against the CO2 risk and will protect us against CO2 price volatility.</p>
          <p>And finally, still regarding our post-2012 compliance strategy we believe we can leverage on our robust portfolio of CDMs and on its integration with Endesa's portfolios to seize new project opportunities throughout the world.</p>
          <p>Now coming to our coal and shipping strategy, our current portfolio of procurement contracts secures a major portion of our midterm sourcing requirements. We have consolidated strong commercial relationships with geographically diversified coal sources and contracts that range in all the areas producing coal of good quality. On coal shipping we have today a portfolio of 10 long-term time-chartered ships that put us in a very competitive purchasing position and also provide us with profitable arbitrage opportunities in the market.</p>
          <p>For 2012, our portfolio accounts for approximately 10 million tons of coal and shipping services and we have contracted these quantities at a discount of about $50 per ton against present market prices which leaves us with a total discount of about $500 million for the year. And we have similar advantages for the following years.</p>
          <p>As for gas, as anticipated by Fulvio, the development of our presence in the midstream and upstream sectors is a pillar of our strategy. We are pursuing specific initiative ranging from storage to pipelines like GALSI re-gasification terminal, new energy supplies and gas field developments. The results of these actions coupled with our existing gas and energy input contracts will provide us with a high degree of flexibility and independence</p>
          <p>Now let's move to our commercial strategy. We give priority here to a high coverage of our power production through forward selling mainly through our Domestic Market Division. We've sold our 2008 and 2009 production at average prices of 78 and &#x20AC;77 per megawatt hour respectively, an increase versus 2007 and we expect our total production for 2008 in the range of 90 terawatt hours and we expect this production to increase over the years as a consequence of our investment program.</p>
          <p>Our activities in the forward markets, both on power exchanges and over the counter are creating a more liquid power market in Italy and increasing our business opportunities from trading, both in Italy and throughout Europe. These are asset backed activities which allows us to optimize our portfolio which is made up of both generating units and power contracts and capturing market opportunities and securing margins.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of all the activities I just outlined, our investment plan for the next five years totaled about &#x20AC;6 billion of which about 80% is devoted to the development of our generation fleet. The commercial operation of Torre Nord will significantly reduced thermal variable cost of generation and will increase our base load production while the new build program will drive a significant increase in green-certificate productions. As a consequence of this, by 2012 we will achieve an extremely efficient and flexible and well-balanced energy mix compared to the other players in the market and this will of course strengthen our leadership in the domestic generation market.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I'll hand it over to Livio Gallo to take you through our strategy and targets for the Infrastructure and Network division. Livio?</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gianfilippo. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Let's start by given you an overview of a strategy of the Infrastructure and Networks Division. As the electricity distribution leader in Italy with 81% of energy distributed our growth possibilities are limited. We are therefore strongly focusing on cost leadership and operational excellence. In the gas distribution sector, we are the second largest Italian operator with 2 million end users, and we aim to grow increasing both our margins, profitability and of course our market share.</p>
          <p>Innovation. Innovation is our challenge for the future. We have just completed the most important electronic meters deployment in the world, with 31 million meters installed and controlled, and we want to use this well proven technology as a springboard to develop the first large scale electricity and gas integrated automatic meter management system. This is our pathway to the future. To the future of the electricity networks is largely which is the key innovation project which we want undertake.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to our business fundamentals. In the electricity business we foresee a stable growth of 2% average growth period-over-the period. Our market share will remain steady at 81% of the Italian total distributed energy. In the gas sector over the same period, we expect to increase our volumes by 7.4% average growth, increasing our market share from 11 up to 16% of the total gas distributed in Italy net of power generation plant consumption.</p>
          <p>Let me now draw your attention to our route towards excellence in the electricity distribution. Since 2001 we have implemented several actions in order to improve our quality of service and to reduce our operational costs.</p>
          <p>The result over the period of 2001 to 2007 is a dramatic reduction of our operational expenditures per customer, down 230% in 2007 versus 2001. While improving year-by-year our power quality index. The customer minutes lost reached the record low &#x2013; the record level of 49 minutes of interruption in 2007, down 270% versus 2001.</p>
          <p>We have a rollup of savings from 2007 onwards it's &#x20AC;930 million per year when compared to 2001 and we will keep improving our efficiency in the future.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at our network commercial operations, our excellence is not only reducing our cost and the duration of interruption, but also it's supporting market liberalization, satisfying our customers with simple, fast and clear procedures. Between the opening of the market 1st July of 2007 and at the end of the year 2007 approximately 700,000 customers moved to free market. The increases for switching procedures by almost 58%.</p>
          <p>Now, the automatic meter management system helped and is helping us to manage the volume of this activity, performing remote readings and simplifying communication with traders. In 2007, we improved our network commercial quality index measured according to the standards set by the regulator by the authority for electricity and gas with a level of 90.3%.</p>
          <p>Let me now draw your attention to the regulated electricity revenues. Following the updated tariff related to third regulatory period running from 2008 up to 2011. According to our estimate the starting regulatory asset base for the new regulatory period is approximately &#x20AC;22 billion with an actual increase of 10% mainly due to the application of the deflator of investments and the recognition of past metering investments. The weighted average of cost of capital remains stable at an average of 7%. On a comparable basis, the x-factor has been reduced in a real 1.4% versus the 3.5% value of the second regulatory period.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and regulatory asset basis, we no longer be subjected to the x-factor. Now the combined effect of the profit sharing mechanism, the increase of our distributed volumes and the increase of depreciation is a net decrease in our regulated electricity distribution revenues totaling &#x20AC;150 million. This reduction is fully balanced by an increase of the remuneration of the regulated commercial activities. Coming up we foresee stable revenues from tariffs estimated &#x20AC;4.86 billion per year over the same period.</p>
          <p>Now, our approach to the operational excellence. It is based on three main projects. First Lean organization, in 2007 we launched a Lean Six Sigma project with the aim of fostering continuous improvement, reducing waste and variability in our processes and focuses of course on value added activities. This will give us additional &#x20AC;150 million of savings per year by 2009.</p>
          <p>Second, power and gas Integration. In 2007, we completed integration of the staff activities and IT activities system in power and gas, so as to optimize synergies which will account for about &#x20AC;20 million per year by 2009.</p>
          <p>Third, workforce management. In 2008, we will complete the equipping of 5,300 vehicles with the modern system which is always on and able to communicate with our control systems in real time in order to optimize the localization of our crews in case of fall, indeed we have reduced of course our cost for monitoring and inspections. The resulting savings will be &#x20AC;30 million per year by 2009. So finally, the overall savings in OpEx will be &#x20AC;200 million per year. From 2009, when compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn our attention to the quality of service targets and the expected premiums. We are committed to invest in innovative technologies such as network automation, distributed intelligence, smart meters, promoting focused investments, aimed at reducing the minutes of interaction to our customers.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we expect to reach the record low of 31 minutes cumulated interaction for each single customer which will consolidate our benchmark position in Europe. This will allow us to have an additional &#x20AC;430 million in quality premiums over the period.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to our gas distribution and to our growth. We want to grow as previously stated and strengthen our position becoming more and more competitive and profitable. We aim to reach about 3 million end users by 2012 by expanding our network and by bidding for new concessions taking advantage of a 2009 expiration of a large number of concession in Italy, more than 4,000 in Italy. Over of this period, we aim to increase our EBITDA by 10% average growth per year relying also on our power and gas synergies.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn our attention to the third strategic driver, Innovation. As previously stated, the automatic meter management system is managing and controlling 31 million electronic meters. It has been adopted by almost every other distributor in Italy, first becoming a de facto standard.</p>
          <p>Relying on our success, we are also undertaking the opportunity to even add remote control of gas meters. The result will be a power and gas infrastructure for automatic management of meters. This will consolidate our leadership in the automatic meter management system and allow us of course for further savings in operations.</p>
          <p>Smart grids are the major challenge for the future. They increase every year however distributed generation is changing the way of operating and maintaining the grid. The research and development for new control and local dispatching systems is the main goal of address in a European funded project coordinated by Enel involving 25 European leading partners in industry, utility, IT and research centers.</p>
          <p>Finally, let's turn our attention to our targets for the period 2008-2012. As shown before our OpEx has been reduced sharply. When compared to European and UK averages based on 2006 figures our OpEx per customer is below the European average, but still about that of the UK.</p>
          <p>In 2007 alone, we reduced our OpEx by &#x20AC;5 per customer. Down to a value of &#x20AC;50 comparable to UK average. Over the next five years, we aim to further reduce our operational expenditures with a target level of &#x20AC;48 in the year 2012.</p>
          <p>Over the same period, we will invest &#x20AC;6.8 billion in our assets. Most of our spending accounted for 51% of the total will be allocated to network connections driven by our customer requests out of which 90% will be financed through regulated fees, 24% will be for mandatory investment in the electricity business, 9% in mandatory for gas. And finally, 16% will be for quality of service improvement enabling us for additional quality premiums.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the 2008-2012 period will continue to see the delivery of strong results in EBITDA together with a decrease in OpEx, high efficiency in new investing activities and high performance in our operation.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. I will hand over to Carlo Tamburi for the &#x2013; taking you through the strategy of International Division.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Livio. Good morning, everybody. Fulvio has outlined the targets of the International Division. I will now analyze in more detail our key priorities. We want basically to consolidate and strengthen our position through a proper integration process, which would take into account the peculiarities of each context.</p>
          <p>Sharing know how, best practices and expertise will create an efficient working platform with the objective to maximize operating excellence productivity and synergies. When we look at new opportunities we will focus on exploiting and developing the most attractive initiatives using a great deal of selective approach. We will invest in innovation and new technologies to keep us ahead of competition and our international division has a strong presence in high potential markets.</p>
          <p>Iberia and Latin America will be presented later on by Andrea Brentan. Fast growing markets, available inter connections and attractive opportunities were the drivers of our expansion so far. And the focus on the optimum technology including nuclear brings an effective mix of generation portfolio across all of these renewables have a central role.</p>
          <p>Let me now go over all the elements of this picture. Looking at the global scenario, we must consider Russia as one of the most attractive markets. Fundamentals are very good with a demand of more than 1000 terawatt hours and a growth rate of up to 4% per annum in certain regions in the next five years.</p>
          <p>Liberalization of the Russian market reaches 25% next July 2008 and will be completed by 2011. Industry capacity is becoming tighter due to the shutdown of plants at the end of their technical life. <mark type="inaudible" /> estimates that more than &#x20AC;70 billion has to be invested in the next few years to cope with market needs and demand growth.</p>
          <p>Domestic energy prices are driven by gas prices that will converge to the European net backs. We have been in Russia since 2004, building an integrated position from upstream to downstream. The gas fields of SeverEnergya have gas assets of about 700 billion cubic meters plus condensate, making this <mark type="inaudible" /> one of the largest fields in the pan-European scenario. Enel's production share <mark type="inaudible" /> half to 50% of gas requirements from OGK-5 company. First gas is expected in 2010 ready to replace carbon sourcing commitments of OGK-5.</p>
          <p>49.5% stake in RusEnergoSbyt gives Enel a unique position <mark type="inaudible" /> electricity with more than 35 terawatt hours sold in 2007 and about 250,000 customers with a widespread commercial presence.</p>
          <p>RusEnergoSbyt is an ideal vehicle for OGK-5 production. OGK-5 let me focus on it for a minute, operates 4 power plants of 8.7 gigawatt capacity and balanced fuel mix of 50% coal and 50% gas, taking advantage of the gas &#x2013; of the spread between coal and gas prices. Plants are in the most attractive regions of Russia with <mark type="inaudible" /> hours consumption per annum. As a result of the recent mandatory public offer, Enel owns now about 60% of the company for an overall investment of &#x20AC;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>We are now finalizing the sale of about 7% of the shares of the company to EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and IFC [International Finance Corporation] to reduce the financial exposure and to enhance the solidity of the shareholder structure. The integration process has already started to improve efficiency, operating performances and results thus confirming the OGK-5 relationship in the area.</p>
          <p>Capacity and improvement investments for more than &#x20AC;1.5 billion are planned in the plan 2008-2012. These really demonstrate the strong potential we see in this company. Enel's track record and commitment to Russia entitle us to be considered a credible long-term investor and a reliable partner.</p>
          <p>I will now move to Centrel. We consider Centrel a strategic market due its geographic position in the middle of Europe and high interconnection capacity. Fundamentals and growth in this area are strong. Slovenske Elektrarne has an optimal generation portfolio of about 6 gigawatt of capacity with a very efficient portfolio mix. Two-thirds of the electricity produced in 2007 came from nuclear. Since 2007, we've sold about 25 terawatt-hours most on the fully liberalized domestic markets with prices converging to the levels of leading German pools.</p>
          <p>We are planning to invest Slovakia approximately new &#x20AC;1.9 billion until 2012. A big part of this plan consists of the completion of the nuclear power complex in Mochovce. Slovenske Elektrarne is a success case for the integration of purchase by Enel bringing efficient and financial performances far above those expected by the acquisition plans two years ago.</p>
          <p>Now we move to Southeastern Europe. Prices for European electricity market are converging to a single one market thanks to the high interconnection capacity. Enel's two distribution companies in Romania, Banat and Dobrogea and one supply company, Enel Energie, make us the second largest player in this market. Muntenia Sud will come soon and their position will raise in 2008 our base of 2.5 million customers and market shares to 21% in supply and 27% in distribution.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we have also acquired a wind developer, Blue Line, contributing wind projects pipeline of about 175 megawatt in 2010. With the new investments in nuclear and cogeneration, Enel is going to be the first player to realize the value chain integration in this country.</p>
          <p>In Bulgaria, we have 73% stake in Maritza 3 and the powering on this plant will be fully completed by mid 2009.</p>
          <p>In Greece, we are in the <mark type="inaudible" /> market with <mark type="inaudible" /> operation, an additional 47 megawatt under construction with a large pipeline also of new projects. Just a few days ago, the Greek government authority has awarded Enel the contract for a new CCGT of about 450 megawatt at Viotia. Moreover in that area we're looking at additional opportunities focusing on Albania and former Yugoslavia countries also due to the potential interconnection to the Italian domestic markets.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to the Northwestern Europe. France and Belgium are Europe's third large market after Russia and Germany with decreasing reserve margins in the next years. Enel, at the end of last year, has signed the agreement with EPR to increase its presence in this market. The agreements provide Enel with anticipated capacity to be sold on the French open market and particularly with new know how in this new technology.</p>
          <p>Today more than 60 Enel engineers co-operating EDF plant development and projects. We have also access to new thermal capacity under evaluation. Last year, we have sold 1.3 terawatt-hours rapidly increasing to 10 terawatt-hours in 2012 climbing from new anticipated capacity we will grow and with pipeline. In Belgium our partnership with Duferco was signed for a new 410 megawatt CCGT.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to the other side of the ocean to look for renewables in North America. We're all ready over there. The US and Canadian wind markets are among the largest in the world. The US one grew at a double digital annual rate over the past five years and is expected to continue to do so in a favorable regulatory framework. We <mark type="inaudible" /> position renewables in the large pipeline bringing capacity from the today's 472 megawatts of input capacity to 1,600 megawatt in wind, hydro and geothermal by the end of the plan. And in North America shows Enel's ability to enter markets with significant growth opportunities and integrate acquired companies profitability.</p>
          <p>Having finished the picture let's now see what all this means in financial terms. With this overview I summarize the strategic guideline focus so far and shade the International Division's picture for the next years. Investment totaled for &#x20AC;8.1 billion in the plan 2008-2012.</p>
          <p>It consists of diverse technologies through environment and through innovation provide for a diversified and balanced global portfolio, producing strong financial performance. We are boosting the business to bring in 2012 more than triple of 2007 EBITDA, meaning a compounded average growth rate of about 27% per annum. Consolidate, develop and innovate are the key words to make our model successful in today's international scenario.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and now its Andrea's turn with Latin America and Iberia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carlo. Good morning everybody also from my side. What you see here is another overview of the strategic priority of the Iberia and Latin America Division. I'll take you now through the details and I'll start with Endesa and particularly with its Iberian business.</p>
          <p>Two preliminary remarks, information concerning the Endesa plan are based on the strategic plan guidelines elaborated by Endesa Strategic Committee. The plan has not yet been submitted for approval to Endesa Board, pending the conclusion of such important ongoing fourth quarter initiatives such as the sales of assets to E.ON and the transfer of the renewable assets to the Acciona Endesa NewCo. The Endesa figures do not include the assets to be sold or transferred.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the fundamental of the Spanish electricity market. The Spanish electricity market is expected to continue to grow steadily as the average consumption levels in Spain remain below the European average. Growth in peak demand which forecasts in line with growth in energy demand so that Endesa is forecasting a stable reserve margin over the period of around 10 to 12% and this coupled with its forecast for fuel and CO2 prices leads Endesa to project pool prices around &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour which can be seen as somehow conservative.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the evolving regulation, where a number of issues are to be highlighted. First of all, deregulation. The good news here is that the key &#x2013; the key here is that the disappearance of the tariff energy will make the retail business all the more effective. And moreover it is envisioned that the tariff of last resort will be based on real energy, which will make that the &#x2013; there will be an avoidance of further energy system deficits.</p>
          <p>Concerning CO2 decree, the sector, as you know, is presenting a very united front against the decree. We must wait though for the new legislation to be debated in the Spanish Parliament, as it was agreed by most &#x2013; the major parties there to see whether the conceptual errors contained in the decree will be rectified, as we do hope and work for.</p>
          <p>In distribution there have been already very significant and favorable changes. In 2007, remuneration was increased, while the formulas were changed for 2008, as you know the efficiency factor for Endesa was more than double. That's very good news and the individual distributor's growth differentials have been recognized. And if we look ahead, the RAB system will remunerate capacity investments and reward higher quality and lower losses.</p>
          <p>Finally, concerning the capacity payment scheme Endesa is convinced that the present scheme will be modified again in the future as it is not sufficient to encourage investments, which are, as you know, key in Spain given the large contribution of renewables to the system.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a look at the strategy in Spain. Endesa's goal is to remain the leader in the Spanish market. Both in sales and in output the plan is keep in the radically changed retail market of 2012 the same total sales market share of 2007. That is around 41% and to achieve this Endesa will leverage its present strong position and the excellence of its sales network with the best track record in the sector and the ability to launch new customer services. To reach a balanced and hedged position Endesa will build new capacity.</p>
          <p>This is the new capacity which is planned. The plan is to achieve a generation mix more balanced between coal and CCGT, so as to hedge also against potential risks associated with the two technologies. The Endesa plan considers 3200 megawatts of new CCGT capacity on the mainland, including 800 megawatts to be built together with International Power in Portugal, which is a very interesting market. And in addition, Endesa plans the expansion of its operating <mark type="inaudible" /> pumping station by 400 megawatts which will allow to obtain further capacity at peak with limited investment cost. And with the shift in the generation mix Endesa targets also to significantly reduce its specific emissions over the period.</p>
          <p>As far as the island system is concerned where the new regulation is fully established, Endesa plan considers over 1200 megawatts of new capacity to meet growth in demand in these areas where Endesa has developed a degree of specialization that no other player has.</p>
          <p>And few words now on the position on CO2, which is strong one for Endesa under the current National Allocation Plan, Endesa was assigned somewhere 127 million ton, which should cover around 60% of the emissions throughout the period. To cover emission deficit Endesa has in place an excellent portfolio of CDM projects which will enable it to make full use of the maximum <mark type="inaudible" /> provided for in the NAP which is equivalent to 42% as you know of the allocations is made free of charge. The rest of the deficit would be met through market purchases.</p>
          <p>The average cost of Endesa's CDMs stands at around &#x20AC;8 per tone, significantly below Endesa estimates for market CO2 prices, which is between 22 and &#x20AC;25 per ton. Endesa's CDM portfolio currently stands at over 91 million tons and factoring in present use assumptions still leaves enough capacity to cover the maximum ERC limit. In fact there may be very well excess rights which might generate very interesting margins.</p>
          <p>Let's look now at our distribution. As you know, between 2004 and 2007 Endesa invested significantly in its distribution system to improve service quality. Having achieved its quality target Endesa does not have now to invest in its networks significantly above the need to service growing demand.</p>
          <p>In distribution Endesa will also benefit from remarkable synergies with Enel, in particular concerning the digital meters Endesa, and we are very strongly cooperating with Endesa, is prepared to implement the project some three years before the deadline established by the regulators which as you know is 2018. And finally, the new regulation in place will allow Endesa to benefit from the good growth expected in its distribution market, which is 3.9% on an average per annum.</p>
          <p>Gas market, in the gas business, Endesa has been able in a few years to become number two player in Spain despite Gas Natural's virtual monopoly. This business generates very good margins driven by two key factors, the strength of Endesa's sales network, and Endesa's proven ability to source gas in very competitive terms.</p>
          <p>Growth in this market is expected to outpace that of the electricity market at an average annual rate of 4.8%. In gas, Endesa's goal is to lift its market share to some 20% of market share in the year 2012, and meanwhile Endesa will continue to invest in its regulated business developing the gas pipeline network which also is a regulated business, since Spain enjoys a favorable regulatory situation and attractive margins.</p>
          <p>And now let's look at the figures associated with this strategy. All in all, Endesa plans to invest over the period &#x20AC;10.3 billion in Spain and Portugal. In generation, CapEx account for 65% earmarked for growth. This will drive EBITDA to more than 5 billion by 2012 at combine annual growth rate of 6.8% per annum.</p>
          <p>A little remark concerning the present CO2 decree, the present CO2 legislation, although Endesa plans to dispute it entirely, Endesa has taken the conservative stance of factoring in a negative impact on EBITDA in the event that it is eventually applied to energy not sold through bilateral contracts.</p>
          <p>And let's now move to Latin America, where Endesa is the largest private market player and let me start with the Andean countries. Endesa is the leading utility in Chile, Peru and Colombia. We have no close second competitor in sight. Those three countries have shown impressive records in demand growth and Endesa expects that growth to stay about 5 &#x2013; above 5% a year for the coming years.</p>
          <p>This growth has resulted in narrowing reserve margins that together with gas shortfall especially in Chile have contributed to growing prices. All three countries have been applying consistently orthodox macro-economic policies and their outlook remains positive.</p>
          <p>All these three countries have advanced and stable regulatory frameworks in generation. Long-term options provide price signals for investments in the capacity. In distribution, all these three countries have very advanced and stable RAB models which allow capture of growth and capture benefit from efficiency brand.</p>
          <p>Now, the strategy in these countries where Endesa intends to reinforce its leadership position in Chile, Peru, and Colombia through strong organic growth both in generation and distribution. In generation, Endesa plans to grow its installed generation capacity by almost 2,000 megawatt over the period and have an additional pipeline of some 3,000 megawatts that can come into operation soon thereafter.</p>
          <p>The new capacity will consist of approximately 800 megawatts hydro and 1,200 megawatts thermal. The 20% stake in the gas uptake rights that Endesa has in the Quintero LNG plant in Chile which will start operation in 2009 will guarantee operation of Endesa Quintero and San Isidro I and II combined cycles.</p>
          <p>In distribution, Endesa expects that demand growth, higher RAB and efficiency programs will more than offset the impact of any potential downward revision of WACC in these regulations. Finally, in these countries, Endesa will carefully consider potential acquisition opportunities in distribution.</p>
          <p>Take a look at Brazil which is the next country in line in the continent to gain and investment grade status. Has been also consistently applying orthodox economic policies, shows strong macro indicators and has a rather stable regulation. Brazil is set to show higher energy prices as reserves margins narrow with growing demand, more hydro capacity takes several years to complete and gas supply remains an issue.</p>
          <p>In generation Endesa plans to organically add some 200 megawatts of hydro to its profitable business, while in distribution we have a strong upside potential at Endesa through growth and higher operational efficiency especially in the reduction of losses at Ampla. In Brazil Endesa will consider M&amp;A opportunities in generation towards a more integrated position.</p>
          <p>And last but not least Argentina that continues to show strong economic and demand growth not followed however by sufficient new capacity investments in generation and in upstream gas. Endesa is set to maintain its current market position as the leader in generation and distribution. In particular Endesa's distribution business in Argentina initiated last year a clear regulatory path, improvement path towards higher values that will allow us to regain reasonable profitability and quality of service levels. In this context Endesa will invest to capture growth and will increase efficiency.</p>
          <p>The country's generation systems though are highly strained. With remuneration levels are still not adequate to encourage investment in new capacity.</p>
          <p>And now let's look at the figures. For this time all in all Endesa will invest more than &#x20AC;6.5 billion in Latin America over the next five years.</p>
          <p>In Chile, Colombia and Peru Endesa aims at strengthening its current leadership position and will invest &#x20AC;4.3 billion of total investment in these markets of which more than &#x20AC;2 billion will go to organic growth of generation capacity.</p>
          <p>In Brazil Endesa will invest more than &#x20AC;1.6 billion of which 0.4 billion will go to new capacity in generation. And in Argentina Endesa will start a new investment plan in distribution where it will also increase the efficiency and the quality of service. And these investments together with a number of efficiency plans will fuel Endesa's EBITDA growth in Latin America which will reach almost &#x20AC;3.5 billion in 2012 growing at a compound average growth rate of 6.5% a year.</p>
          <p>And now let's look at the update on synergies where there is quite a crowded chart. Last December we have announced a total of &#x20AC;680 million synergies in the year 2012. Since then we have been working on further potential upside and so far we have been able to identify a further &#x20AC;54 million of additional savings mainly coming from distribution and procurement in Latin America. As a result the total now stands at &#x20AC;734 million. We are currently working still on over 30 individual projects and we expect further savings from that.</p>
          <p>In the meantime the implementation of the defined strategies has been &#x2013; let's say, launched in a very structured way where the operational plans have been defined, project managers appointed and accurate economic monitoring to deploy and progress is systematically monitored by the synergy committee at the level of the board.</p>
          <p>Let's look now at overall investments. During the plan after Acciona and Enel's takeover, Endesa has redefined its strategic priorities. Endesa will now begin a new investment cycle leveraging its strong presence and financial position to be further enhanced by asset disposal. The plan is to invest a total of &#x20AC;24.4 billion between 2008 and 2012. 18.4 billion are earmarked for organic growth opportunities already identified, while further 6 billion are earmarked for complementary organic and M&amp;A growth opportunities. The 18.4 billion include besides the organic investment in Iberia and in Latin America that we talked about before, an estimate of 1 billion to the Acciona Endesa renewable NewCo, and 0.6 billion of miscellaneous investments.</p>
          <p>The 6 billion includes 2.5 billion for complementary organic growth in number of countries such as Greece and Morocco and 3.5 billion for M&amp;A opportunities. It needs to be noted however that the plan has sufficient flexibility to value the allocation of the 6 billion as a function of opportunities arising and specifically and mainly of their potential returns and strategic fit.</p>
          <p>This plan will drive an earnings growth of over 10% per annum on an average throughout the period. EBITDA is projected to grow at nearly 9% per year.</p>
          <p>And let's now move to our joint venture in renewables with Union Fenosa. In Spain as you know the regulatory framework for renewables remains very favorable. EUFR [Enel Union Fenosa Renovables] will accelerate its growth and projects to add a total of over 1000 megawatts throughout the plan and to achieve this EUFR will leverage its strength and development organization and its very solid pipeline. The growth will focus mainly on Wind with turbine supply for 2008 and 2009 has been substantially secured. Therefore we'll invest a total of almost &#x20AC;1.9 billion over the period and its EBITDA will grow at an annual compound rate of over 29% achieving the value of over 320 million in 2012.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk about Enel Latin America, our unit for renewables there. In Latin America we continue to grow and plan to add a total of some 470 megawatts over the period with a very well balanced portfolio of technology. In geothermal, ELA [Enel Latin America] will develop in Chile where the regulatory conditions for renewables are set to evolve favorably through our successful joint venture with ENAP, the major oil and gas company there.</p>
          <p>And also in Central America, within geothermal, where we are conducting promising explorations in Guatemala and Nicaragua and where we are growing in Lageo our joint venture in Salvador.</p>
          <p>In hydro, ELA targets organic growth in a number of countries, Guatemala, where we have an excellent track record. In Costa Rica, where we have won the right to build and operate 2-50 megawatts hydro projects, and in Brazil, which has you know has huge hydro potential.</p>
          <p>In wind ELA will pursue organic growth, in Brazil mainly and in Mexico where good results availability is now coupled with increasingly favorable regulatory conditions. The prime considers to invest over &#x20AC;1 billion with an EBITDA growth of 17% achieving over &#x20AC;260 million in 2012.</p>
          <p>And to conclude this is a summary chart showing the consolidated figures of the Iberia and Latin America Division. Total investments through the period are nearly &#x20AC;18.4 billion on a consolidated basis and EBITDA will grow from 4.3 billion in 2007 to nearly 6.8 billion in 2012.</p>
          <p>And with this I have finished and I guess this is now...</p>

          <p>Thank you all for your participation and I really appreciate your all being tied to all of these slides which have been presented to you. If it was worth doing this in as much as we have tried to give you a strong sentiment a strong plan that has been built by our team based on the fundamentals are good and which imparts creditability on our success story.</p>
          <p>So now with the help of Luca we can take the questions you might have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you and very briefly let me remind you that we have about 137 people connected now via website. They love being &#x2013; they attended the presentation; they will have the opportunity as well to ask questions. So let's start here with the first question. We have Chris Moore here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please, Chris could you stand up and state your name and institution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My name is Chris Moore. I work at ABN. I have three questions please. My first question is I think the guidance you gave us to 2012 in terms of EBITDA growth and EPS growth are quite different. It seems to me there is much more growth at EBITDA level than there is at EPS. Could you just maybe spread out where that difference lies? Is it amortization of goodwill on Endesa? Is it more debt? Is it more minorities in Lat. Am.? Could you just give us a steer on that, that's my first question?</p>
          <p>My second question is I think Endesa said today that it intends to distribute 100% of its capital gains on assets sales. Does that mean that they will simply pay down debt with their sales to E.ON or do you they will pay a special dividend? What's your feeling on that as a shareholder?</p>
          <p>And my third and final question is the CapEx, the CapEx is 37 billion I think last time round it was 20.3 so it's a very big jump. Could you just tell us what percentage of Endesa CapEx you are taking in that number, what percentage of OGK-5 CapEx is in that number? And also is OGK-5 going to be 53% consolidated now because I had a slightly higher number than that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the EBITDA, EPS, I think what we have shown to you is that EBITDA provides 11% compounded growth and EPS gives you a 10% compounded growth so I generally don't see that much different that will be on your numbers, and it just would be a combination of small things like small minorities that might be built it up.</p>
          <p>When it come to dividend of Endesa, our common view on Endesa is that we might distribute as dividend the net capital gains on the disposals of the assets and this would be in conjunction with an ordinary dividend policy of 50%.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the investment, when it comes to the investment, we are obviously showing a different situation from the past. We are taking into account 67% of all of the Endesa bits and that obviously explains a vast majority of the incremental CapEx during the year and then, we are obviously pushing on the renewable side as I mentioned to you we now have instigated a full speed machine to capture the many different pipelines project that we have been developing over the last few years and now coming to fruition. Therefore there is drive which is as I said the fuel for growth I mean the investments in renewables for all of these considerations that we've been giving to you are highly attractive when it comes to high returns that they offer and therefore we are pleased to develop that money after.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Javier Garrido from JP Morgan. Three questions if I may. The first one is on your dividend target. Should we see the dividend target of &#x20AC;0.49 per share in 2012 as an absolute target or it's a 60% payout on your EPS target of &#x20AC;0.83, will you see upside to that dividend target if you are to exceed the &#x20AC;0.83 per share in EPS?</p>
          <p>The second question is also on the CapEx. I know it's a difficult question, but how much do you reckon of that &#x20AC;37 billion of CapEx would not be producing cash flow in 2012 because it's a significant amount of investment in nuclear, there's a significant amount of investment also in renewables, you could give us a guidance of how much of that CapEx is not yet contributing by the end of the period?</p>
          <p>And the third is on the financial situation, you have stressed on of your targets is to keep a strong financial situation and strong balance sheet. Do you &#x2013; how comfortable you are with the credit rating agencies maintaining your current rating and which would be the cost for Enel in case of a downgrade to BBB status? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Let me start with the final then I'll &#x2013; we go back to the first. Obviously we're confident that the plan that we are showing to you might be seen favorably by the credit rating agencies when it comes to the valuation of A. We've demonstrated that the ratio that we given to you net debts on EBITDA below three times, it's one of the many ratios that we're looking at constantly to provide comfort to all credit rating agencies about our resilience, and our financial stability it means that we want to keep this maintaining A rating as a priority. That's why we are presenting the plan the way we are presenting it.</p>
          <p>But with a sensible cash flow generation that we are earmarking for ourselves and comforted by the fact we have a good track record of delivering things as we usually do as you see from 2007 numbers as well as on past. We think we can obviously offer to our company growth while meeting that same expectation of maintaining financial stability.</p>
          <p>And this is also true for the dividends what you've seen is in the past is a company that had no strategic plan of growth and therefore we were paying you 100% of our income including extraordinary income on the past. We're now evolving to maintain our attractiveness to all the shareholders as a good high dividend yield company. But on the other hand, my ambition is to maintain an attractive dividend yield, but not an abnormal dividend yield. That's why I am saying that I hope that share prices will go possibly higher; we all hope that, depends on you, but definitely we will maintain the &#x20AC;0.49 and maintain about 60 or 50% payout ratio as all utilities will do on a normal basis because we will have future growth to fuel and that's why we keep that dividend constant over the years.</p>
          <p>Then on the CapEx, would you like to take on this question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as we said during presentation, we have almost &#x20AC;21 billion worth of development, CapEx development. It is not clear and easy calculation as you can imagine because you need to go project-by-project, but just to give you an idea I think we could say that one-third of the development is not producing or it's not reflecting EBITDA in the plan window. If you looked to our EBITDA after 2012, you will see clearly further growth because most of this as 8 to &#x20AC;9 billion will deliver this new EBITDA after this year. So I think you can assume more than 30% is not reflecting EBITDA however.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Stefano Gamberini, Euromobiliare. Just three quick questions. First of all, with regard to the EBITDA of Italian activities in 2009 you're projecting less than &#x20AC;7 billion compared to &#x20AC;7.7 billion in 2007 so why this difference and the same in 2012? If you can help us to understand the break down between distribution market and power generation, if you can?</p>
          <p>The second which are the assumptions you have in your business plans regarding power generation prices, I think that oil price and coal are already reported but if you can just summarize all main assumptions you have 2009 and 2012?</p>
          <p>And the third question regarded dividend if in 2010, Acciona will decide to exercise its put option, do you think that the stress on your financial position could be so high that you risk to change your dividend policy or otherwise even considering that the market is not easing this moment nor will be in the future? You are able to also manage the situation maintaining the 49 dividends of payments? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the EBITDA, please check that. Our generation price and EBITDA management -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's start from the EBITDA. Yes, you are right we are showing a decrease in our domestic EBITDA. We are basically assuming that there will be a decrease in the generation in particular due to two facts. The first regards the evolution of the ancillary service markets that prudentially, we are assuming which is going to decrease by 200, &#x20AC;250 million, by the way, in line with what we said many times in the past, gradually from 2007 down to 2009 and then will be flat, and clearly the difference between this plan and the other one is the fact that, we have in our CapEx plan in Italy the Porto Tolle investment, but prudentially we do not have the EBITDA associated with that.</p>
          <p>And finally the slight delay in <mark type="inaudible" /> as you heard from Gianfilippo Mancini will be fully operational in 2009, is affect a little bit in particular 2009 results.</p>
          <p>Well, what is the breakdown between Generation &amp; Energy Management and Infrastructure &amp; Network? Well, I think you can imagine that Infrastructure &amp; Network more-or-less will have the 50% of this mark, the remaining will be Generation &amp; Energy Management and Market Division for &#x20AC;150 million on average during the plan.</p>
          <p>What about the generation price in Italy? I think I can give you some &#x2013; Gianfilippo if you want to tell something about 2009, 2010?  Let me just stress that clearly, our price scenario is based on the commodity scenario that you can find by the way in the Annexes which is on chart number 97.</p>
          <p>Gianfilippo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Having said that I mean the reference scenario is the one you will find there. Of course as we've seen, the prices in Italy are very much linked to the evolution of gas and therefore Brent. So if you look at that scenario what we expect is to have a price that will be reflecting the full cost of Brent but by that scenario that cost would be well above &#x20AC;70 per megawatt hour in terms of baseload equivalent. With the cost for gas, a variable cost for gas that will be in the range of 57, &#x20AC;56 per megawatt hour. Having said I mean if we look at the forward markets, today you will find 2009 prices stated in &#x2013; over the counter in the range of &#x20AC;80 per megawatt hour on a baseload equivalent again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question relates to the dividends and the possibility that Acciona might exercise its option to put on to us. Dividends will not change in all our assumptions. And the reason why they are not changing is meant by the following. One, we demonstrated to you that this company is growing and is producing good results, is increasing their results over time, and long-term we do expect that these will obviously increase the overall value altogether.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if we have to serve the price for the 25% that has been put to us, we will, at the double benefits of gaining the incremental consolidation of the remaining portion of EBITDA. And the overall indebtedness without doing anything, but just collecting the number of shares which will be put to us, will maintain our debt to EBITDA ratio in the region of 3.3, which I believe will still make it a sizeable A rating.</p>
          <p>It goes without saying that having, at that point in time, in this assumption, that we are not contemplating in a moment, because we have a long-term marriage with our shareholder, with our partner. But assume that this is the scenario, of course, I do expect the value &#x2013; overall value that Endesa which show will be possibly be offered to the market. Endesa is a listed company. Therefore, there will be room for even lowering our percentage if needs be.</p>
          <p>But assuming that we will not be doing this, the level of exposure will still be in the region of a comfortable A rating and dividend policy will not be changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Before going on with Antonella, we have three interesting questions come in from the web so let me put them in the name of the guys who posted them.</p>
          <p>So, first question as far as renewables are concerned, are you fully hedged as far as the finalized purchases of the wind turbines, just necessary to &#x2013; let me say to cover and to face the huge increase in investments that you disclosed? First question.</p>
          <p>Second question, as far as the EBITDA target, if we compare on a like-for-like basis, EBITDA 2007 versus the target we gave for 2012, the &#x20AC;16.6 billion. I repeat, on a like-for-like basis, the compounded average growth rate will be in the region of 5%. Isn't that a reduction versus our previous target, the one we gave last year, the 6%, and if so can you give an explanation on this?</p>
          <p>Last question on the expected net debt for 2008. With the bulk of your asset disposal scheduled to take place in 2008, what level of net debt do you expect at the end of 2008? Do you expect the credit rating agency to downgrade Enel below the current ratings guys, which I think we've already answered as far as this one is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the hedge in turbines or turbines, whatever way you want to say it, for windmills we are not fully hedged. I don't think anybody will be fully hedged for the long-term, as a matter of fact.</p>
          <p>The windmills industry, manufacturing industry is developing as we speak, as we all in the industries are pursuing initiatives in that field. I see them, not only the major names in the industry, but also others developing their own manufacturing capabilities including in Italy we have plenty of and I am not at all concerned. I mean I've seen the rush to gas pipe turbines in the past. I've seen the situation where people were complaining about the lack of turbines and we only panned out 20 of manufacturing capacity was delivered at that point in time. The same is happening with the windmills.</p>
          <p>Even though we are obviously buying forward windmills and for instance all the investments we are making in the United States are fully covered, the major part of our investments in Romania are fully covered. But if you ask me whether I have already pre-bought windmills that I will be installing by 2012, I think the answer will be, no, I haven't yet.</p>
          <p>EBITDA targets for the prior to development of through transformation or through increased foreign investments in our company. First of all the number will be 6%, it will not be 5%. Secondly I would like to raise this point and I would like to raise a question to this gentleman. Why are we speaking about an incremental perimeter of assets for Enel were it not for being able to deliver further growth? That's what we are doing I mean the question is whether pre-Endesa, pre-Russia we would have been delivering 6% is no longer applicable. We are a different animal today. So the real question is can we deliver 11% growth and we can and we will.</p>
          <p>The net debt by 2008 will be obviously influenced by the time and the speed of our cash generation that will be in line with what we have right now and some of the disposals of the network that we are listing to you and I will still consider that to be in line with single-A rating and the number will be in the region of 50 billion as a matter of fact. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonella, you have a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonella Bianchessi from Morgan Stanley. Just a few questions. Your business plan; when you exclude the disposal it's absorbing cash. So I wonder if you can give a detail in the short-term 2008, 2009, how this is happening?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the CapEx line: I see two different approach in Enel and Endesa. In Endesa there is much more investment. I wonder, you are investing also in Spain in new generation capacity. I wonder why you are building capacity in Spain when you assume lower prices than in Italy and if we can think of an increase in CapEx in Italy as well?</p>
          <p>And the other thing is on the renewable business; if you can just clarify the disposal of the renewable business, is it going to be an IPO? What's happening for the Enel renewable business? What's happening for the Endesa renewable business and if there are any kind of connections between the two? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one. The renewables, we intend to first of all put a value tag on it. I believe that today showing renewables within the generation and international division per se doesn't give justice to them. I think there is in the sum of the parts lower value that you attach to the investments we have done so far than by pulling them out and make it a visible one. In particular, with the idea that we purporting and the strategic plan that qualifies for higher investments in the renewable bits, we think it's worth taking them in isolation and show it to the possible market outlets.</p>
          <p>The method on which we can take advantage of the value creation exercise is yet to be decided. It could be in IPO, but we are not yet there. It could be a private equity investment; it could be other format. It is premature to speak about it. What is important to know that we think we are doing really good things by pulling these things together, creating a division on its own, possibly creating a special vehicle company Enel Green Power and then start thinking about the way we can put value to it.</p>
          <p>We have taken the view that we can do it in two years time, we are not in a hurry doing this. We don't need to rush. We need to build things up and we will be doing accordingly and we will be keeping you posted on the way, but we are going to put a value on it.</p>
          <p>Invest in Spain versus Italy, I will make a general comment, then I'll ask Andrea to make comments about it. I think we are strongly supporting investments in Endesa. As you all know, Endesa has been kept under 2 years of siege by many different offers during the PTOs war or to the OPAs war. Now it's time for the company to spring off all the potentials that they have and there is potential also in Spain and when it comes to the end of it for us here sitting on the holding of Enel is the relative advantage of return on capital that matters to allocate capital. And we think we are doing the right decision to support this investment plan in Spain as opposed to other locations.</p>
          <p>We think we are not forgoing the important market of Italy at all. As you have seen and Gianfilippo can confirm it to you, we are investing heavily in the Italian market as well. So, the total investments plan we are forecasting is really the driver for the growth. And there is room for doing it. There is cash flow for supporting it, that's why we are implementing it. Now you want to say something about the investments in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The major structural differences. The first one is the difference in reserve margin. The other one is the cost of gas for the two and if you look at balanced, we're going towards more balanced portfolios as we &#x2013; Endesa does build strategic region in Spain, in Italy we're going for some coal, so that, that is the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think really behind the investment that we're projecting, the driver is the return on investment. There are of course, significant differences between Italian and Spanish market here. As Andrea just said, the reserve margin is different and the energy mix, so what we are doing I think is balancing the energy mix in Spain with CCGTs while balancing the energy mix in Italy towards an increased baseload and competitive production in coal and renewables.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to your first question and we are &#x2013; as you saw in my chart, in my presentation we closed 2007 books at a net level &#x2013; a net debt level of &#x20AC;57.5 billion including the discontinued operation. We are targeting to reach by the end of 2009 a net debt of &#x20AC;48 billion, which at that point will be the results of our operational cash flow or the CapEx plan that you can see deployed in our plan and the net &#x2013; the net cash in of the disposal, clearly I cannot provide you additional detail at this stage.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Eric. Can you hear me? Yeah. Eric <mark type="inaudible" /> from Cazenove. Couple of questions, on the domestic generation, you still have a significant portion of generation traditional oil and gas plants. What is your assumption in terms of those plans if there are some shutdowns included in your target 2012?</p>
          <p>And if you also plan increasing some CCGT capacity? I saw the Tuscany original plan that includes some conversion in the <mark type="inaudible" /> plants.</p>
          <p>Another question is related, can you elaborate a bit on the situation on the concession for the other plants and for <mark type="inaudible" /> after the 10 year increase in the length there was cancelled recently.</p>
          <p>And my third question, if you can answer that: out of the &#x20AC;11/15 billion disposal which is the portion relating to the E.ON assets that you are including in the figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one then and I'll hand it over to Gianfilippo. We are still under negotiations with our buyer, E.ON. You don't want me to say publicly the way we negotiated up to the final day, would you? So, I am afraid I cannot really answer to that question, but it was a nice try.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the generation side, would you, Gianfilippo, take on the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the first point was regarding our conversion of our oil and gas fleets and with this respect first of all, as I mentioned in my presentation, I mean we have out of this fleet, decreasing production, but still attractive margins because of two factors basically. The first one is the fact that these plants play a dominant role in the ancillary services market in Italy due to the fact that they have a very high flexibility. We have been keeping them into very good operations and they are therefore ready to increase or decrease their production on an instant basis. This makes these power stations gain good prices and good margins on this market and that is why we feel we will keep them in good shape.</p>
          <p>The second point similar to this, is the fact that the tightness of the market in Italy is still very interesting in peak times either in summer or in winter and there are good export opportunities sometimes that we are ready to capture specifically through the spilt.</p>
          <p>On conversions, potential conversions, conversions to CCGTs. We don't see today in the short term an interesting market space for investing in new capacity in CCGTs, except for the fact that we are doing that on our existing fleet. As I mentioned, we are changing some features in our power stations in order to add 200 megawatts in terms of additional capacity in CCGT and to also increase in terms of 300 megawatts the flexibility of our CCGT fleet, which is more and more core to produce electricity on a volatile market scenario. Therefore, the fact that these plants are able to reduce the <mark type="inaudible" /> very interesting in terms of affordability.</p>
          <p>Of course, we believe our plants, particularly, the ones that are by the sea are &#x2013; do represent very interesting opportunities for us in terms of investments and conversions in the medium to long-term and we are carefully looking into these opportunities. Also bearing in mind that the new green <mark type="inaudible" /> regulations gives very attractive remuneration for renewable technologies. I think that should answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're here with a scenario that takes the length, the validity of the concessions to 2029 rather than 2039. So, there is a potential impact in the very long-term, and we'll see whether this can be challenged or not. But we're, in the meantime, very satisfied with the fact that through our hydro power stations we're getting very interesting opportunities for further developing our production there throughout 2029 both implementing new green certificate initiatives and adding up additional capacity on an incremental value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question would be on profitability, on your Italian business you mentioned 7 billion of EBITDA for 2012 and if I heard correctly also mentioned 160 million of EBITDA coming from the markets. Now that is something to me like a 1% margin &#x2013; here in the UK retail companies talk about 5-7% margin. Now is it just you being conservative or now is Italy going to be a different market in your view?</p>
          <p>Secondly on nuclear, if you can &#x2013; I mean there is quite interesting slide, but could you just elaborate on how many megawatts of capacity you actually have under construction in 2012, look at France, Slovakia, Romania so on, just a number please.</p>
          <p>Third question on CapEx, actually for Endesa, I see Endesa is trying to spend 6 billion of CapEx in generation between now and 2012 for building less than 5000 megawatts of capacity in Spain. Why is the ratio of CapEx to megawatts so high? It just looks a little bit too high.</p>
          <p>And the last question just on strategy while you said no more big acquisitions, can I ask you what about asset swaps? Like you mentioned E.ON, I see Endesa has 3.5 billion available for acquisitions, I mean could that be an option as well for you that you could be considering an asset swap between Endesa and E.ON? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one again and I confirm that we have &#x2013; we are over with the large acquisitions, no doubt. I think we have developed a very important geography and European and Latin America footprint both in terms of diversification of the countries and the markets and the technologies that we are available. So, we think we finish with that. That doesn't mean that we stop. As you've seen we have plenty of things to do in a business plan that requests an additional three years of heavy work to be delivered.</p>
          <p>Yes, we might be still available for swaps. Swaps are not cash, are not cash flow, cash outflows. We might consider some but we are not considering for the time being any real opportunities. We have to see what the market will offer. I'm not so sure whether this would be a valuable alternative from what I see in the market these days.</p>
          <p>For the rest of question I am pleased to ask Francesco or Carlo on the nukes and Andrea on Endesa to answer. Francesco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me? I have to wait for the switch. Okay. Can you hear me now?</p>
          <p>The question on the margins, I have some difficulties in understanding, if you go to the annex documentation, you can see on page 121, a breakdown of the Market Division margins and a detail that relates them to revenues. If I understand well your question you are concern is that the margin calculated shows a 1% figure, did I get it correct? Okay.</p>
          <p>Now, you have to see that the budgets we are showing in 2007 here reflect 6.5 billion revenues and almost 100 million EBITDA, which is close to 2% or 1.5, something like that. The way we calculate these margins are basically the difference between the frontal price for forward curve that we internally generate and it is not reflected in the market. As you know, Italy does not have as the UK and most of the European countries, a liquid forward market. So when you calculate margins in this situation you have to look at generation and market as an unregulated business standalone unit and it's difficult to have an analysis of the margins on a case by case basis without an external forward curve as a reference.</p>
          <p>I think we do this calculation in the next year probably we will have a forward curve the figures will change drastically, but this is the present situation and that's the way we have calculated this margin reflected internal transfer price, which we have. We are not buying energy outside of our own sources. The plan here is to sell our own energy only.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. On page 120 of the presentation, you have Endesa debt at 12 billion. Forgive my ignorance there, but is that 100% of Endesa debt or 67%? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, when you talk about reducing debt by 8 to 12 billion by 2012, will that all be at the Enel level or would there be some debt reduction at the Endesa level as well?</p>
          <p>And then I've got a further question, you are looking at quite a significant investments in Latin America. What's your defense against the currency devaluation, if you're borrowing in hard currency dollars and investing in local currency, how do you protect against the local currency fall there? Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There are number of mitigating factors there. The first one is that in the regulatory regime there, there was a portion of the revenues which is indexed in dollars. The other one is that there is a large amount of the debt which is in the currency of the revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answers on the other slide is that this is 67% of debt and the answer to the other question is that we always keep 67% of the debt of Endesa within our debt, so whenever we decline the debt we are considering the combined effect of both Endesa's and Enel's into a single consolidation process.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Natixis Securities in Paris. Two question, the first one is looking your fuel price scenarios, the average in terms of oil is $75 and for the coal is 82, do we have at your group as dramatically change its parameter, do we have the sensitivity of any change of $0.10 for the both kind of fuel plus gas if you can on the EBITDA level, consolidated level.</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding your renewables I mean, you are going more or less to double from a little bit more than 3000 to little bit more than 7000 megawatts. Do we have a kind of breakdown in order to have a clear idea about in the gap of more or less 3000 megawatts, how many megawatts are currently under construction, how many permits you are able to obtain and what is the pipe you have in order to fill the difference? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're asking a very detailed questions and I am not sure that I have all the answers handy at the very moment. But there are people here in this room that can provide you with all the details on how much is capacity by technology, if you want.</p>
          <p>On the sensitivity, it goes without saying that the current assumption that we're using it's a very conservative assumption, when it comes to the P&amp;L impact. It is optimistic in a sense that you see the crude oil price assumption that we are taking compared to today's market at $110 a barrel is optimistic, meaning that it is 78 or $80 a barrel, not 110. But on our P&amp;L transformation of that effect is conservative because the higher the crude oil price and the gas price equivalent, the higher the margins will be, and therefore it is the logical consequence of having a prudent approach in projecting all of our numbers to be able to deliver as we have been so far.</p>
          <p>Now for every $0.10 of incremental pricing, can you, Gianfilippo, elaborate what will be the impact on the for instance on the Italian market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as a rule of thumb you should consider that an impact, an increase of the Brent price in terms of $1 per barrel roughly has an impact in terms of euro per megawatt hour in the Italian market of half of that. So $10 per barrel would translate into &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour in terms of price, and to derive out of that the impact on our margin, you need to consider that we have roughly 30 terawatt hours of renewable production that is fully impacted by that. And we have the remaining portion of our production being CCGT, which is neutral with this respect and coal, which &#x2013; for which the impact depends, of course, on the relative variation of Brent compared to the coal index, the FA2 for instance. And also with this respect with respect, therefore, to the correlation &#x2013; present correlation, the forward market &#x2013; market between Brent and coal despite the huge spikes also on coal, the difference between the two is positive for coal technology.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly you need to take into consideration many variables, but just to give you an idea. Let's keep for a while the exchange rate frozen, and let assume that Brent is going up $10, and that coal is going up $10 per ton as well. In 2012 at the group level the potential improvement of our EBITDA keeping the same mix of production mix it would be in the region of 280, &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Alberto Gandolfi from UBS. I have three questions, please. The first one is about cost inflation in your CapEx, we've seen the recent, not that recent, but a spike at least for 20% increase in the cost of combined cycles and also ever growing increasing the wind cost. Can you give us an idea on how worried are you about that? And what's your criteria in terms of ROIC versus WACC included in this plan?</p>
          <p>Now, other question is your '09 EPS seems to be slightly below consensus and one key reason is that it seems you're slightly delaying the full startup in <mark type="inaudible" />. But also, can you help me understand, if you are excluding a portion of the renewable business that you are planning to sell in '09, if you are excluding transmission assets that you're planning to sell? And can you give us an idea on like-for-like basis, because these still seem the new to beat versus what we knew in advance, or normalized for <mark type="inaudible" /> if you can?</p>
          <p>Lastly, very pedantic but, you're using &#x20AC;70 per megawatt hour in Italy, and 60 in Spain. Is it really justifiable for two, three years of oversupply in Spain a &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour gap, especially when your variable cost is already 60? I mean, is it really sustainable to sell in at a loss or not ever core in fix cost and again what would be your plan? What would be your 2012 EPS? If you really move to &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour in both markets, could you tell us that perhaps increase in coal cost as well of course, but similar to what you just answered? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost inflation in CapEx can you speak about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In CapEx you are right. Of course we've seen in the markets a tremendous increase in terms of capital expenditure &#x2013; of unit cost for all technology and so for coal, for CCGT and also for renewables as well, which is the impact. The impact of course is an increase in CapEx, but also it's an increase in the benchmark in the market, because of course this translates into increased expected price of electricity as well which is not a bad news for who owns already generating asset that can benefit from the increased price of newcomers for one aspect.</p>
          <p>On CCGTs as I mention in Italy particularly we've been completing our plan and we are investing with very low unitary cost in order to increase our capacity on existing power stations.</p>
          <p>Our renewables &#x2013; we can benefit definitely by the fact that we have a very wide portfolio of sourcing needs particularly wind turbines throughout the world. And therefore this allows us to capture discounts on the market and also thanks to market, which is another fundamental point here who &#x2013; wide agreement, framework agreements with the major suppliers throughout the world.</p>
          <p>There was a question on WACC here? I think it was &#x2013; ROIC, yeah, internal rate of return, of course any kind of investment throughout any technology in generation is assessed on the basis of positive return against WACC of that technology. So when it goes for instance to renewables, in Italy as you know we have a regulation on green certificates that allows us to capture to have granted &#x20AC;180 per megawatt hour over 12 years period of the time, that allows us to have very interesting WACC, very interesting IRR on our investments in this technology throughout the country, and particularly in Southern Italy as well as the coal, as I have been describing the clean coal technology as very positive spread on the IRR against related WACC.</p>
          <p>Another point I will try to answer also to the other question which is related to the differences between Italian and Spanish market in the wholesale &#x2013; in the wholesale market. Here you need to consider that you cannot just compare 70 to 60 in the two markets and get the conclusion that the returns are different, because there are fundamental difference between the markets; one is one that Andre mentioned before, which is different gas prices for the two markets, the other one which is fundamental. I think again is the fact that due to the regulation on green certificate, there is an additional cost, a variable cost in Italy which is linked to the payment by thermal production generation of green certificates.</p>
          <p>And of course you have also to consider the different volatilities that the different markets may have. We're talking about baseload, now, prices but the real effect in terms of IRR has to be considered in terms of volatility and size, and the different hours of the pooled power exchanges in the two markets. So that is why the IRR might be similar or opposite even despite the fact that you see a lower price in terms of baseload in Spain as compared to Italy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add something. You also have to consider &#x2013; if you look at load factors of CCGT in Spain for 2007, which was public data. Endesa has a load factor of some 60% <mark type="inaudible" /> had a load factor of not even 30%, so that means that as Endesa has given several times, guidance that the sourcing of gas is a competitive advantage of Endesa. I heard before standing at a loss in '08, this is a sale at a loss and in fact our projections of Endesa show very robust sensitivity versus the price and versus the changes in the market for the CCGT.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2009 EPS is benefit of course of the effects of the disposal let's say. Now it is not easy to explain what there is behind, but just to give you a straightforward answer, we're talking about of occasional effect on our EPS reflected by a way in this number between &#x20AC;0.05 to &#x20AC;0.06 per share.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Credit Suisse/HSBC. I have a question concerning the proceeds from the sale of Endesa assets. Will they be used to pay back debt?</p>
          <p>And secondly, will there be any bond buyback at Endesa level? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This will be decided by the Board of Endesa at the proper time. The guidelines of what is being considered here is the possibility of a dividend on the capital gains on the sales of assets of up to 100%.</p>
